2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,798
ryan hall his second time in the podcast

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,839
he's one of the most innovative scholars

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,800
of martial arts

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,839

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,839
as a side note let me say that i've

12
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,719
gotten a chance to train with ryan

13
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,359
recently

14
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,358
and to both discuss and try out on the

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,399
mat his ideas about grappling and

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,039
fighting

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,160
what struck me is his unapologetic drive

18
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,558
to solve

19
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,479
martial arts it reminds me of the

20
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:41,359
ambitious vision and effort of google's

21
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,640
deep mind

22
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,878
to solve intelligence in ryan's case

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,920
this isn't some out there martial arts

24
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:49,759
guru talk

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,440
this is a style of thinking about the

26
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,759
game of human chess

27
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,960
of seeking to define the rules and to

28
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,439
engineer ways

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,439
from first principles of escaping the

30
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,679
constraints of those rules

31
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,799
this style of thinking is rare but is

32
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,280
ultimately the one

33
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,759
that leads to the discovery of new

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,599
revolutionary ideas

38
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:18,719
conversation

39
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:21,199
with ryan hall you're known as

40
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,759
a systems thinker in martial arts but

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,359
you

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,280
also i think are willing to think

43
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,040
outside the rules of the game outside of

44
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,159
the system

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,360
when you're thinking about strategies of

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,799
how to you know solve the problem

47
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,438
particular problem of an opponent

48
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,320
whether that's

49
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:41,758
jiu jitsu or in mixed martial arts

50
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,000
what's your process for doing that

51
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,599
for figuring out that puzzle i would say

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,840
i don't know if i have a specific

53
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,438
like a to b to c process for that sort

54
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,960
of thing i try to do my best to uh

55
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:54,559
appreciate that i think a lot of the

56
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,478
thinking um or

57
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,079
maybe not all the things but a lot of

58
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:01,200
great thinking on

59
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,039
conflict on battle on war on martial

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,359
arts has been done already

61
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,040
um not that we don't have to do any sort

62
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,360
of uh background investigation or

63
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,640
reassessing of these ideas or axioms

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
that have come down through things like

65
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,279
the book of five rings or the art of war

66
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,878
or you know like von klosterwicz even

67
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,919
anything like that really

68
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,000
but is uh trying to understand

69
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,639
the the lessons of the past that i think

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,719
often times we we don't take with us

71
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,679
um problem solving we pay lip service

72
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,000
and like a

73
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
uh you know a victorious fighter uh the

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,519
great fighter uh you know

75
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,518
he knows victory is there then he then

76
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,000
he seeks battle everyone else is looking

77
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,280
for victory

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
in battle yeah moving on and that's why

79
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
i'm going to double jab and throw my

80
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,920
left hand

81
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,640
and i think a lot of times our actions

82
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,280
don't reflect

83
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,039
our stated belief structure and i think

84
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,719
that oftentimes you can tell

85
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,479
what i believe really or what my

86
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,400
fundamental operating system is

87
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,759
based on my actions whether i'm aware i

88
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,439
have an operating system internally

89
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,039
whether i'm aware of it or not or

90
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,598
certainly whether i'm fully aware of it

91
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,919
so i guess uh when it comes to

92
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,119
strategy i try to think about how things

93
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,439
interact you mentioned

94
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,519
systems thinking and i try to do my best

95
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,158
to understand how systems exist but i

96
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,680
think that

97
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,199
systems have a fundamental strength and

98
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,920
a fundamental weakness

99
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,639
they work how they work and that's great

100
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,199
but they're

101
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,199
readable so if you are aware if i am

102
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,799
operating on a system

103
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,839
of which you're you're not really read

104
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,519
into then i think oftentimes i can seem

105
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,519
like

106
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,680
shockingly effective particularly if my

107
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,080
system preys on certain weaknesses

108
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,040
uh that that maybe you are uh you're

109
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,799
given to

110
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,400
but what happens when you've read the

111
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,239
same books that i have

112
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
i think that a lot of times that makes

113
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,120
me deeply predictable i think about

114
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,559
systems in jiu jitsu

115
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,560
you know and uh a lot of times people

116
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,239
think that they're doing jiu jitsu when

117
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,598
in reality they are doing an expression

118
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,439
of it let's say i'll use there's the

119
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,000
marcelo garcia system

120
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,598
there is the uh henzo gracie current

121
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,680
henzo race system there's the old gracie

122
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,598
baja one there's a

123
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,680
you know the gracie academy classic

124
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,919
crazy jiu jitsu there's the

125
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
art of jiu jitsu um you know kind of

126
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,679
otto's approach and you know there's

127
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,399
some crossover between a lot of these

128
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,080
but uh oftentimes i think um you know

129
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,319
when it comes to

130
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,079
understanding how i'm making decisions

131
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,000
and how my opponent is making decisions

132
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,519
i have to appreciate whether or not

133
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,600
i'm an end user of something and i'll

134
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,360
use my my phone as an example

135
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,199
i was thinking of this the other day and

136
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,879
as an end user of my phone i can't

137
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,319
i have no idea what it does you know

138
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,680
like edward snowden comes up and goes

139
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,040
hey guys you realize your phones are

140
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,079
listening to you from like

141
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,759
really what yeah all right i believe you

142
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,519
and then of course that that comes out

143
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,319
but uh to what extent

144
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,240
i have no idea um what is my phone

145
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,839
capable of i have no idea i can mess

146
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,280
with the font though i really like blue

147
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,119
screens not purple screens

148
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,319
so like as an end user i can change some

149
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,918
of the bells and whistles that have

150
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,279
nothing to do with the underlying source

151
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,240
code of it all or how it functions the

152
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,918
same way my car

153
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,360
i'm an end-user of my car if i do this

154
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,000
with the steering wheel it goes if i

155
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,639
push on the gas

156
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,759
it goes um if i yeah i know how to fix

157
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,960
it when it's out of gas i know how to

158
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,960
fix it when it's out of oil

159
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,879
and i know how to fix it you know when

160
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,719
uh when a flat tire comes but

161
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,120
short of that or actually beyond that i

162
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
have nothing so i think that oftentimes

163
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,240
um you know i've been around in jiu

164
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,478
jitsu long enough to encounter like a

165
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,079
new wave of like good grapplers

166
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,839
and it's very very interesting sometimes

167
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,959
how they're running systems they don't

168
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,560
realize they're running

169
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,799
like i'm like oh yeah i trained at

170
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
marcelo garcia's academy for a long time

171
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,478
you know and a big fan of marcellus was

172
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,400
a student there uh

173
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,478
encountered a lot of the the otto style

174
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,120
jiu jitsu a number of years ago

175
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,038
uh been you know a very very you know

176
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,000
deep into foot locking and leg attacks

177
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,360
and whatnot for a long long time i

178
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,240
understand your system better than you

179
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
do or i may

180
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,280
and let's say you understand my system

181
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,239
better than i do that would be a huge

182
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,839
issue that was something that i

183
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,759
encountered a long time ago

184
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,038
trying to come up in jiu jitsu where i

185
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,240
was trying to utilize

186
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,159
systems that were

187
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,759
created by let's say hoffman mendes or

188
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,439
someone else and i'm basically trying to

189
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,199
do what you're doing i'm just not doing

190
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,600
as good of a version of it so not only

191
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,199
am i

192
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,199
not doing it well but i'm entirely

193
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,240
predictable and i think that that can be

194
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,000
a big issue so

195
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,199
to come back i think of systems a lot of

196
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,720
times now in terms of you know

197
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,840
particularly like end user type of

198
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
systems like uh

199
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,959
an iphone is a really really fast way

200
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,080
for me to be able to do all sorts of

201
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,359
things

202
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,199
if you were to take it from me i

203
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,680
couldn't recreate any of that so you

204
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,800
want to be

205
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,319
more the nsa unless the end user exactly

206
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,280
exactly that way that way i'm listening

207
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,560
i'm going to be the idol

208
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,959
of combat that's right we're watching

209
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,399
you p but basically

210
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,638
you know it's uh i guess what i would

211
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,239
what i would come back and say is uh

212
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,319
if you understand how things interact on

213
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,120
a fundamental level and what type of

214
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,720
games exist

215
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
and what type of interactions is this

216
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,880
then you can transcend a lot of the uh

217
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,720
the systems it's almost like a cook

218
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,759
versus if i can make certain things in

219
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
the kitchen i can

220
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,759
but i am not a chef you could give me a

221
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,758
bunch of ingredients and i

222
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,280
could probably cook not well but a

223
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,160
couple of different things

224
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,000
but a master chef you know would be

225
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,120
aware of the implications of all of the

226
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,959
things that they're doing

227
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,959
you know extra time in the oven less

228
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,638
time in the oven putting this you know

229
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,159
flavoring or spice in

230
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,759
you know what you're doing with various

231
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,960
things and also they could make they

232
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,919
could turn all of these ingredients into

233
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,120
chinese food they could turn all these

234
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,000
ingredients into italian food and they

235
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,639
could turn all these italian food

236
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,399
ingredients

237
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,918
into chicken parmesan or it could turn

238
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,000
into lasagna but

239
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,519
they're not limited to a specific thing

240
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,279
because they have knowledge of how

241
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,279
food interacts how what it does to

242
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,038
create taste what it does create texture

243
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:25,758
so to come back let's take rock paper

244
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,639
scissors rock paper scissors is built on

245
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,160
the idea

246
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,680
of a couple different things actually

247
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,639
i'll tell you what can i you might have

248
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
may ask you a question

249
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,000
yeah what's your favorite dinosaur on

250
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,800
the same on three we'll go

251
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,399
one two three t-rex t-rex i'll meet soon

252
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,000
man this is we're gonna be best friends

253
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,878
so uh it's

254
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,079
okay uh if so what's the first question

255
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,280
when you say hey let's play rock paper

256
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,038
scissors it's like is it rock paper

257
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,478
scissors or rock paper scissors shoot

258
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,719
and like rock paper scissors shoot

259
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:55,918
you're like okay because if we go

260
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,360
rock paper scissors shoot i'm like oh

261
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,439
man i got lucky

262
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,639
and i won imagine i won 100 times in a

263
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,879
row yeah

264
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,079
i'd be luck give me luck if i was

265
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,000
honestly doing that

266
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,240
but now let's say for instance i go on

267
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,439
rock paper scissors and you go on shoot

268
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,240
rock paper scissors shoot

269
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,598
here comes the rock right if you lose

270
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,478
whose fault is it

271
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,399
it's yours this is built on a parody

272
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,038
thing where

273
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,000
i don't get to pick second if i get to

274
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:25,759
pick second

275
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,199
it's like being able to investigate your

276
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,160
background before going to meet you and

277
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,240
then i'm like oh hi

278
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,240
oh i too love the new jersey you know

279
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,759
the new jersey nets which is a statement

280
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,320
that no one in their right mind would

281
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,479
ever make

282
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,919
when i was growing up so anyway you'd

283
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,639
have to have personal knowledge of

284
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,199
somebody

285
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,319
so anyway to come back let's you're if

286
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,519
if you understand

287
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,200
how games are structured

288
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,679
you can start to realize that there's

289
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,399
huge gaps and huge holes in a lot of the

290
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:54,000
the thinking behind all of it and if you

291
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,278
can create the illusion of choice i'll

292
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
play one more if you don't mind it's one

293
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,439
of my favorite ones to do this in class

294
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,000
all the time

295
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,519
uh have you seen this before no okay um

296
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,639
may ask you some questions please sure

297
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,720
okay fantastic

298
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,000
i'm scared oh there's everybody wins

299
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,560
don't worry um all right

300
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,799
so could you could you please i would uh

301
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,199

309
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,439
uh i'll go with the middle finger okay

310
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,480

313
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:42,319
[Laughter]

314
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,439
uh your middle finger okay can you pick

315
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,600

damn it so

323
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,639
i thought that enhanced the illusion of

324
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,838
choice

325
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,639
it's the illusion of choice if i'm

326
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,200
asking the questions

327
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,039
provided i ask the right questions there

328
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,440
can be no correct answer

329
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,958
it doesn't mean that ultimately if if

330
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,480
that's what you wanted let's say

331
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,838
like i thought i was guiding you to

332
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,879
something i wanted it turns out that was

333
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,160
the outcome you want to

334
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,360
well let's now let's here's now i'm

335
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,480
going to ask the wrong questions i might

336
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,639
not get what i want so

337
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,320
by the way sorry to interrupt uh for

338
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,360
people that might be just listening to

339
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,079
this

340
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,440
that uh no matter what trajectory we

341
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,359
took through that decision tree that

342
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
ryan was presenting it was always ending

343
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,320
up with the middle finger ironically

344
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,599
enough

345
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,320
i was surprised so and all of us were

346
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,639
surprised

347
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,600
and we're both winners yeah we all

348
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,360
everyone i

349
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,040
felt like a winner all right so now it

350
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,720
now i'm gonna then i'll ask some

351
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,319
different questions if you don't mind

352
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,560
uh can you please pick two fingers to

353
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,920

all right oh that's so awkward that's

356
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,600
like the worst finger positions

357
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,879
okay can you please wait a minute that's

358
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,120

375
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,560
ah man

376
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,919
is it what if you pick my my ring finger

377
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,119
and my index finger

378
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,958
yeah yeah i win yeah so even though i'm

379
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,039
asking the questions it's not impossible

380
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,958
that i arrive at a good outcome for me

381
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,559
but it's it's no longer guaranteed i

382
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,599
went from a situation where i literally

383
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,759
can't lose

384
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,040
yeah it's pretty low probability right

385
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,480
super low probability

386
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,159
and the second you realize what i'm

387
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
doing you would never let me win

388
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,159
because the ball is truly in your court

389
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,958
so i guess that that's kind of what i'm

390
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,759
fundamentally trying to put into play

391
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:05,838
almost all the time

392
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,519
can i ask the right set of questions can

393
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,560
i develop the ability

394
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,839
um skills wise understanding wise and

395
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,518
then discipline wise

396
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,600
and then have the courage and the

397
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,879
constitution and the and the discipline

398
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,399
necessary the patience necessary to

399
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,919
ask the proper questions and wait for

400
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,120
the proper answers

401
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:28,159
and if i can

402
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,560
all assuming like the perfect world

403
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,078
i win period oh yeah so does that make

404
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,159
sense yes it totally makes sense

405
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:35,838
so i don't know if you know sort of the

406
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,639
more mathematical discipline of game

407
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,839
theory

408
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,799
there's something called mechanism

409
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:44,160
design so game theory is this

410
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:46,078
field where you model some kind of

411
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,480
interaction between human beings

412
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,278
you can model grappling that way you can

413
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,120
uh

414
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,519
model nuclear conflict between nations

415
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,000
that way and

416
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,278
you set up a set of rules and incentives

417
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,120
and then use

418
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,399
math to predict uh what is the likely

419
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,320
outcome

420
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,159
depending over time based on the

421
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,519
interaction given those rules

422
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:15,199
mechanism design is the design of games

423
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,399
so like the design of systems that

424
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,120
are likely to lead to a certain outcome

425
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,399
and so what you're suggesting is you

426
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,000
want to

427
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,159
create you want to discover systems

428
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
whose decision tree all the possible

429
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:33,519
things that could happen

430
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,399
feel like there's choice being made but

431
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,720
ultimately one of the parties doesn't

432
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,958
have

433
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,079
any choice in what the actual final

434
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,559
outcome is

435
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,719
uh you're making them feel like they're

436
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,198
playing a game too so it's not like

437
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,040
you don't feel trapped it's kind of like

438
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,719
well the best traps

439
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,719
i don't you don't look very threatening

440
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,278
so i'm like oh i'll walk over there

441
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,199
i guess wouldn't that i guess that's

442
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,198
kind of an interesting thing if a lion

443
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,439
when is a lion roar it's an interesting

444
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,838
thing when you watch like lions hunting

445
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
don't roar when they hunt they want to

446
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,480
when they want to move you back

447
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,159
they do stuff like that when they

448
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,759
actually want to come and get you

449
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,159
they're pretty slinky it's like

450
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,519
water covered it's like furry water yeah

451
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,120
and and i guess like

452
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,440
when you keep that in mind um it's funny

453
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,959
how

454
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,880
like a frosted hobby actually a

455
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,399
brilliant guy like one of my mma coaches

456
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:23,838
and head coach at tristar

457
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,120
um he brought this up one time i thought

458
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,320
it was a really salient point he said

459
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,959
let's say we have a million

460
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,560
person bracket impossibly huge like

461
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,838
frank dukes went in the kumite level

462
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,000
huge bracket

463
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,519
he claimed to knock out like 250

464
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,480
consecutive people and you're like that

465
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,959
is

466
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,320
all of hong kong was in that thing and

467
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,159
everyone kept their mouth shut

468
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,240
but anyway that's pretty cool but uh

469
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,879
it's a comeback a little improbable

470
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,799
pretty cool

471
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,919
um so let's say for instance like

472
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,198
there's no cheating going on

473
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,039
no cheating going on and we're flipping

474
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,799
coins right

475
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,480
someone is going to have an unbroken

476
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,359
string of victory

477
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,120
through that bracket which is pretty

478
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,440
insane how many how many consecutive

479
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,320
like

480
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,079
toss-ups this person won and then at the

481
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,360
end of it all

482
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,879
imagine we like aliens show up and we go

483
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,800
hey they want to flip a coin for they're

484
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,600
not earth whether or not earth uh you

485
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,719
know gets to

486
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,920
gets to continue they're like oh i'll do

487
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,480
it

488
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,159
i'm good at this yeah that would be

489
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,680
tempting as a person to to do you're

490
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,919
like well i'm a lucky guy

491
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,198
oh yeah are you sure maybe i mean maybe

492
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,399
effectively you are we could argue they

493
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:27,039
effectively are incredibly lucky but

494
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,559
basically

495
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,838
is that an actual ability it's like a

496
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,039
perk in a video game or is that just

497
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,639
this thing that happened

498
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:36,480
so anyway uh how many times are someone

499
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,639
you could go through an entire career

500
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,399
you know particularly in a fights board

501
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,320
well let's say you get 15 knockouts in

502
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,519
15 toss-up scenarios because you see

503
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,879
that happening all the time in the fight

504
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,720
game a toss-up scenario it's not like

505
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,720
you're mounted on me and like and

506
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,399
that's not a toss-up scenario many many

507
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,040
many many many striking centers a lot of

508
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,879
grappling with

509
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,360
tons of striking scenarios are dead toss

510
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,799
toss-ups and uh

511
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,079
somebody wins by knockout they win five

512
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,519
times in a row then they lose a couple

513
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:00,239
times in a row and we go what happened

514
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,198
you're like what do you mean what

515
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,600
happened they were always flipping the

516
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,120
coin

517
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,959
and then they win five more they go ah

518
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,000
back on track can you imagine that

519
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,319
you're flipping a coin on like heads

520
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,399
heads heads heads tails what

521
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,680
tails those heads again oh man i'm back

522
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,759
on it i'm flipping good now

523
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,679
that's basically what's going on i think

524
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,680
the vast majority of the time and then

525
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,359
humanity's you know tendency to see a

526
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,599
sign in almost anything

527
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,519
you know it starts to present itself and

528
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,278
then we build a narrative in our mind to

529
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,879
imp to convince ourselves that we're in

530
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,838
some sort of control when in reality

531
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,519
i was in a marginal situation at best

532
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,720
the whole time yeah without having much

533
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,159
control without having a deep

534
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,240
understanding of the system the same

535
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,879
story is told the stock market with many

536
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,278
of the human

537
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,399
these distributed human systems we start

538
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,838
telling narratives

539
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,440
and start seeing patterns without

540
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,880
understanding actually

541
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,480
the system that's generating these

542
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,078
patterns so if we can see the system

543
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,000
that's incredibly valuable but then you

544
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:50,958
go well what system is above all of the

545
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,559
systems i guess

546
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,000
maybe physics maybe it's not like game

547
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,919
theory explains these things but like

548
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,679
i guess what are the what aspects of the

549
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,039
system can i can i put my hands on that

550
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,120
i can touch and understand

551
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,559
and what am i what am i missing what

552
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
what's going on in the world all around

553
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,558
me to continue to

554
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,838
lean on on dune that i don't have uh

555
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,119
that i don't you know you talk to a

556
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,359
blind person about

557
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,639
about the world about sight and talk to

558
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,000
someone that doesn't have everyone

559
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,319
who's got coronavirus now so no one can

560
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,439
taste or smell like this is delicious

561
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,798
like

562
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,720
is it so anyway uh you know again

563
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,918
what what senses am i missing or what

564
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,400
understanding am i missing

565
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,520
that's preventing me from seeing the

566
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,679
dots connect

567
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,119
in the world all around me and i think

568
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,640
sometimes if we uh

569
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,879
oftentimes at least personally i've

570
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,280
screwed this up a lot i'm so nose-deep

571
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
in the

572
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,079
in the trench of trying to understand

573
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
what i'm doing that i can't take a step

574
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,439
back and realize

575
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,720
you know that i'm in a forest not just

576
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,480
head-butting a tree

577
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,759
and i may be doing both maybe both two

578
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,919
things should be true at once

579
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,679
but uh so i would say when it comes to

580
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,320
strategy trying to understand that but

581
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,559
then also

582
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,159
you go well okay well how can that

583
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:54,798
sounds cool but how can you actually do

584
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,240
that

585
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:57,839
and then i'd say that's a really good

586
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,359
question because if i imagine i say man

587
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,879
i should fight like stephen thompson i

588
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,079
should fight like wonder boy he's like

589
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,080
good idea go do that i'm like

590
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,200
i'm not thinking about the guy i would

591
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,759
fight like could be even banging made of

592
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,319
if i could

593
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,160
you know it seems to work so anyway uh

594
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:13,038
you go well what if i could develop what

595
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,000
if i could take my time

596
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:18,079
developing skills so that when these

597
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,759
strategies become apparent that you are

598
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,399
they are executable to you

599
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,000
you actually have the ability to like

600
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,840
enter to again to be the person in the

601
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,279
arena to be the person required

602
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,038
whereas there's plenty of great ideas

603
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:29,759
like dunking a basketball is a fantastic

604
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:31,519
idea

605
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,599
alas for me unless there's a small

606
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,119
trampoline nearby i'm not the guy

607
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,719
but that doesn't make it any less good

608
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,839
of an idea i just don't i haven't

609
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,319
developed the ability

610
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,839
or i lack the ability so anyway i think

611
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,839
a lot of times at least when i watch

612
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,519
people in fighting i'll use an example

613
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,959
um we're so can we're so concerned with

614
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,960
trying to win early on

615
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,558
rather than develop skills that i'm

616
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,240
going like well what's the best way to

617
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,160
fight with my current set of skills

618
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,000
and usually the the path forward is like

619
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,320
the barbarian route like the

620
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,679
you put on the one ring take the damage

621
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,879
you need to take to hit that guy and

622
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,400
that was something i realized very early

623
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,000
on in my mma career was like i'm not

624
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,600
that good at striking at that time

625
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,119
i'm not a world-class striker now but

626
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,480
i'm way better at striking than i'm

627
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,839
giving any credit for because it helps

628
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,798
people sleep at night i think

629
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,319
but um i'm serious but uh um yeah yeah

630
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,200
you're always introduced as like this

631
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,678
message

632
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,038
like master grappler i'm like that's

633
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,240
nice of them to say that maybe i'm not

634
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:20,798
that good at grappling we haven't even

635
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,319
seen that

636
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,440
and but the funny thing is i'm like just

637
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,240
because if people almost go like well

638
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,360
lex like

639
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,798
see you're really good at this but you

640
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,079
gotta understand like we're equal man

641
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,440
like i'm good at this other thing

642
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,519
maybe you're really good at what you do

643
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,160
and i'm just mediocre that's also

644
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,359
possible

645
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,880
so there's plenty of people that define

646
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,319
themselves as a striker that do that

647
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,200
just because that's for lack of other

648
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,879
options not because they're a really

649
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,480
good striker like i'm a grappler i was a

650
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,240
grappler as a blue belt

651
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,839
not really so anyway i guess to come

652
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,679
back uh if

653
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,359
if i'm constantly going how can i win

654
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,880
with what i've got right now i think

655
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,000
often times i never take the time to

656
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,360
develop the skills that i want to

657
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,640
develop and i also never take the time

658
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,079
to develop the strategies that i want to

659
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,200
develop and that has actually been one

660
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,359
big blessing

661
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,880
of uh fighting someone frequently which

662
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,599
has been really frustrating as a result

663
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,520
of injury

664
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,279
and time away and you know some of those

665
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,759
people being hesitant to get in the game

666
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,440
but uh it gives you so much time to to

667
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,440
be out of the trenches and focus on

668
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,640
developing your abilities so that now

669
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,840
it's almost like developing money

670
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,679
like you mentioned the stock market that

671
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,279
you can now put in as you told me

672
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,360
bitcoin was a great idea

673
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,480
five years ago and i had eight bucks man

674
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,759
if someone told me bitcoin was a great

675
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,640
idea five years ago and i had

676
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:24,000
you know 50k oh my god i'd be sleeping

677
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,000
in my bed of money that i would then set

678
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,759
on fire later today just to do it

679
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,759
so all the due to all the injuries

680
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,359
you've been mining bitcoin all this time

681
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,798
and now you're a rich man well no

682
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,439
actually someone told me i was trying to

683
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,038
mine for bitcoin actually like in a cave

684
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,720
and then i found out recently that it's

685
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,400
actually mining is like a

686
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,759
figure of speech not like a literal

687
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,559
thing that you do but i mean in my

688
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,038
defensive english

689
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,359
language is difficult it is it really is

690
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:50,319
next time

691
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,439
russian is more uh is a ritual language

692
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,879
you should learn

693
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,640
you should learn russian i'll help you

694
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,320
out i believe you thank you so can you

695
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,520
do a whirlwind

696
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:03,359
overview of uh your career

697
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,000
in mma leading up to this point with the

698
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,558
injuries

699
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,599
and the undefeated record and then

700
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,839
what's next

701
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,519
since we're on the topic well i i did my

702
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:12,959
first fight in a

703
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,558
as a blue belt and i've been training

704
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,240
for about a year and a half i did nine

705
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,119
uh judicial tournaments in ten weekends

706
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,640
or eight maybe eight

707
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,479
tournaments in ten weekends prior to my

708
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,038
first fight in uh

709
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,240
april 2006 um i got punched in the face

710
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:25,279
a whole bunch i didn't realize it was a

711
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,640
professional fight

712
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,798
and found that out like the day

713
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,919
beforehand that was great

714
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,599
thanks coach uh it was in atlantic city

715
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,120

these are

732
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,119
i would a lot would have loved to have

733
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,519
it happen for different reasons yeah but

734
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:05,439

735
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,798

i won one round lost two rounds

739
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,839

740
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,120
you went for inverted sorry to interrupt

741
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,639
you went for inverted guard like can you

742
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,918
tell the story of that fight

743
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,600
yeah sure it was three three minute

744
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,640
rounds which is not a professional fight

745
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,759
length although i don't know if

746
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,960
professional fight length would have

747
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,679
been any better it's more time to get

748
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,240
punched

749
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,280
uh but uh i found out part way through

750
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,319
is like i remember walking back to my

751
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,240
corner in the first round i'm like this

752
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,158
guy can't hurt me and he's like yeah

753
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,599
my corner was my friend tom and then

754
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,799
someone else and he's like yeah

755
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,240
i would still encourage you to stop

756
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,359
blocking so many punches with your face

757
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,720
i'm like that's a good idea time i

758
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,918
appreciate that i'm gonna try that

759
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,360
um anyway uh i remember like i was not

760
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,320
you're not allowed to upkick so i'm like

761
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,479
great i was

762
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,839
i had no martial arts skills it really

763
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,279
at all but if i had anything at all it

764
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,000
was jujitsu it was very very little jiu

765
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,599
jitsu

766
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,279
uh but definitely no wrestling

767
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,119
definitely no striking like i was

768
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,359
basically a magnet for punches

769
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,399
so that was your time uh that was you

770
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,639
know roughnecking out

771
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,559
in atlantic city as we all do once in a

772
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,000
while can we fast forward to when you're

773
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:05,678
actually dominating

774
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,960
as a black belt well actually because i

775
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,400
took a little bit of money that they're

776
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,840
like hey we're paying him like

777
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,360
really okay stories with ryan hall

778
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,558
well then i went to i went to the casino

779
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,599
i went to whatever like the traffic

780
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:16,960
canada that was right there

781
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,480
the casino because that was a boardwalk

782
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,400
call and i'm like you know what man this

783
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,200
was this has been a not great not great

784
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,559
evening i'm gonna

785
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,240
this is i'm gonna win it back it's gonna

786
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,839
be great

787
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,440
15 minutes later they had all the money

788
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,879
that i had from the fight was gone

789
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,558
yeah i remember like walking out of the

790
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,840
casino super pissed

791
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,279
and like i don't know what i was

792
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,678
thinking like i'm not good at gambling

793
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,038
why

794
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,080
this was not going to make my night

795
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,119
better i just thought that there was

796
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,639
going to be some sort of cosmic

797
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,678
balancing and maybe it was the cosmic

798
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,200
balancing all at once for the things

799
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,320
i've done in the longer term though

800
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,159
yeah the the balancing we'll see

801
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,918
i hope so but to come so we're all dead

802
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,840
in the end though that is true time will

803
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,360
get us all

804
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,038
yeah well that was so that was the first

805
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,519
one and that was when i realized

806
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,200
i'm terrible at mma but i like it i

807
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,960
should just stop this until i one day

808
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,159
learn how to actually grapple much less

809
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,519
learn how to fight but i remember this

810
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,960
guy named dave kaplan who's the reason

811
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:04,639
my ears are all messed up

812
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,000
who was on the ultimate fighter and got

813
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,679
punched in the face and knocked out by

814
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,558
tom lawler who i'll always appreciate

815
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,600
for doing that

816
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:13,200
um but uh anyway uh david tom uh

817
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,639
i appreciate tom i appreciate dave too

818
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,840
david was great dave was just a huge

819
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,520
bully and used to like

820
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,278
really not completely unmercifully but

821
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,000
relatively unmercifully beat the crap

822
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:22,480
out of me and

823
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,240
uh anyway uh the ears look good so i

824
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,679
appreciate that i tell people it's a

825
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,200
tumor that i got and i'm gonna if they

826
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,919
want in on our class action lawsuit with

827
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,159
atmc they should you know

828
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,759
send me an email but uh anyway you're

829
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,360
very financially savvy

830
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,960
i'm very good no i just give the

831
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,158
impression like dave basically said hey

832
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,558
don't worry man you're never going to be

833
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,320
good at

834
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,759
mma and you're never going to be good at

835
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,038
grappling either but even if you are

836
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,599
good at grappling which

837
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:47,119
in my opinion you will never be you will

838
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,240
never be good at fighting and i said

839
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,439
dave if i do nothing else in my life i'm

840
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,558
going to keep training until i can make

841
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,919
you pay for that

842
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,440
and now that i can make him pay for that

843
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,799
really easily he doesn't train anymore

844
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,080
but i love dave dave's awesome he

845
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:59,119
actually won the singing b what an

846
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,519
interesting dude

847
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,199
super interesting guy but anyway uh none

848
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,119
of the virginia like speaks couple

849
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,759
languages super interesting guys like

850
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,199
shockingly good at jeopardy too um not

851
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,558
that i'm any good but still shockingly

852
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,720
good to jeopardy so anyway years later

853
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,158
met for as a hobby actually john danaher

854
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,839
i met john danaher and he put me in

855
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,039
touch with for as a hobby i started

856
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:18,798
training at tristar i you know

857
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:19,919
immediately loved uh working with frost

858
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:21,599
and learning under for us started

859
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,759
training at tristar and i did my first

860
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,839
real professional mma fight um

861
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,000
as someone that actually does had

862
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:32,240
practiced a little bit prior

863
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,079
in i think august 2012 um and uh

864
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,599
that was against a guy he was four and

865
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,839
five at the time so you know had some

866
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,519
experience um good kind of like first go

867
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,798
for me honestly and i won that fight by

868
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,400
tko

869
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:43,759
and then it was a little bit of uh time

870
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,840
off and then i did another fight against

871
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,119
a tough guy named uh magic hammer um he

872
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,319
was five and two at the time i think he

873
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,359
was three and i was an amateur she had a

874
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,079
good good little bit of fighting

875
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,000
experience

876
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:54,480
um won that one in the first round uh

877
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,558
via rear naked choke and then uh

878
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,319
started to experience difficulty getting

879
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,158
getting fights at that point

880
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,399
um you know what you continuously

881
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,400
introduced as like the

882
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,759
the master of grappling the submission

883
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,200
at least that would that was my thing

884
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,200
i don't know if i was that was the

885
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,600
source of the fear for people i think so

886
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,360
because

887
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,879
i mean that definitely wasn't much at

888
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,959
striking at that point you know i

889
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,320
definitely am a lot i'd like to think

890
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,440
i'm pretty hard to hurt although i try

891
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,278
not to lean on that and i

892
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,880
played baseball for like 16 years so i

893
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,119
can hit things pretty hard i just

894
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,640
wasn't able to uh i i recognized pretty

895
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,678
early on that i had no idea how to

896
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,480
actually hit things

897
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,240
hard without becoming hittable myself so

898
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,679
i think that's kind of the big thing is

899
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
a lot of times like we almost were

900
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,600
mentioning

901
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,599
before if you try to go and get people

902
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,639
too early you can hit them if they're

903
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,240
not that good

904
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,840
but you're going to get hit yourself so

905
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,759
you're making you're basically making a

906
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,439
wager you're making a trade of your own

907
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,640
life for the ability to hit them when

908
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,200
you watch guys like israel

909
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,640
sonia floyd mayweather stephen thompson

910
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,679
uh conor mcgregor when he's fighting

911
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,759
really well

912
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,360
it's not a trade they're not you're

913
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,679
hitting them and they're hitting you

914
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,199
it's they're hitting you but it takes

915
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,480
years and years and years and years to

916
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,759
be able to learn how to do that tom lee

917
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,038
is another great example of that and you

918
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,000
know my closest training partner one of

919
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,558
my best friends

920
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,679
and uh currently now uh one champion uh

921
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,440
with one championship

922
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,798
in uh in asia the champion of the uh

923
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,679
featherweight or i guess lightweight

924
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,798
featherweight

925
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,559
um 155 uh over there now and he recently

926
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:17,519
defeated uh martin nguyen in a really

927
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,359
great fight and

928
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,200
ton knocked him out long time champion

929
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,639
and tan doesn't let you hit him he

930
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,240
doesn't let you touch him i feel so

931
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,038
fortunate to have met guys like stephen

932
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,319
and ton

933
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,759
to go early on in career and go holy

934
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,119
moly i can't even

935
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:32,720
it's not even like oh you'll let me walk

936
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,239
over and find you it's like fighting a

937
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,679
ghost that periodically shows up with a

938
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,359
hammer and smokes you in the

939
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,880
melon and then disappears into the ether

940
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,639
again so the way to approach the

941
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,880
fighting game is thinking how can i

942
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,520
attack without being hit because every

943
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,559
every strategy every idea you have about

944
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,679
what you're going to do

945
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,798
has to do with uh like that uh

946
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,919
minimizing the the return abs absolutely

947
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,599
i mean that's what all good

948
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,320
fighting has done all poor fighting if

949
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:58,000
you know throughout the course of

950
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,879
history most generals whether they saw a

951
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,398
read or

952
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,159
you know they they did battles by

953
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,639
attrition yeah you know it's like yeah

954
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,640
man i've got 150 guys you've got 50 like

955
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,600
yeah 60 of my guys die killing your 50

956
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,120
like that's great for me

957
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,359
yeah but uh that's not so great for the

958
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,038
60 guys that died you know i hope it's

959
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,158
worth it so when you realize that not

960
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,240
only you're not just

961
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,840
kobe bryant and you're phil jackson too

962
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,159
you got to do everything

963
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,918
you know if you've got to run across the

964
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,559
beach in normandy so be it but that

965
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,000
better be

966
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:24,879
you should have we make sure we thought

967
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,919
this through and there's like hey

968
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,840
there's no way we can like

969
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,440
you know walk around the side huh

970
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,038
because oftentimes there

971
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,240
there is and i think a lot of times

972
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:33,599
there's a lot of incentives in

973
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,880
professional fighting to

974
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:36,480
for people who want to do that and we

975
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,240
come up with all sorts of well i'm

976
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,839
trying to be exciting

977
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,278
are you is that really what you came

978
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,199
here to do because i came here to win

979
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,558
and i think that anyone that that's

980
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,919
really successful came there to win and

981
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,440
if it ends up being exciting well that's

982
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,960
fantastic i hope that people enjoy

983
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,120
watching something and that's great but

984
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,360
that's a qualitative assessment anyway

985
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:55,359
you know you want to also be able to

986
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,558
you know live the rest of your life i

987
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,479
think it's easy you know i'll

988
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,398
use meldrick taylor i'm a big boxing fan

989
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,519
alger taylor was an excellent fighter

990
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:04,879
um came this close uh to a world title

991
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:06,240
and was stopped with like

992
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,240
he was in a fight that he was winning

993
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,519
with seconds remaining literally seconds

994
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,558
remaining and they probably could have

995
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,519
just let it go and he would have been

996
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:12,720
world champion and

997
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,038
it was brutal if you ever watch

998
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,079
legendary nights like hbo boxing show

999
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:18,000
it's it's great

1000
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,439
but um it's heartbreaking it's

1001
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,880
absolutely heartbreaking and also like

1002
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,080
the beating that he absorbed in that

1003
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,880
fight changed him for the rest of his

1004
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,720
life

1005
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,159
and also you know don't think he'd ever

1006
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
been hit before but it was one of those

1007
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,880
where you go

1008
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,038
it's it's all fun and games until you

1009
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,679
can't remember your name at age 44 years

1010
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,079
old

1011
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,600
and i didn't come here what are they

1012
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,119
what did patton saying nobody nobody

1013
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:39,199
wins the war by dying for his country

1014
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,558
make the other poor bastard die for his

1015
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,399
and uh i think that

1016
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:43,918
that's kind of what we're shooting for

1017
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,959
and you know the

1018
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,559
lionization of absorbing damage and

1019
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,159
that not being a big deal like you hear

1020
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,918
that all the time so and so can take

1021
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,360
shots that would put a lesser fighter

1022
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,038
down

1023
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,240
what does that even mean yeah you know

1024
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:57,200
like let's let me get this straight your

1025
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,359
ability to absorb

1026
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,480
damage is a part of you i mean i guess

1027
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,158
that don't get me wrong that is an

1028
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,880
attribute that's nice to have if you if

1029
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,080
you need it

1030
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,240
but there's plenty of people that

1031
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,480
actually have really porous defense

1032
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,000
that are just very very difficult to

1033
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,278
hurt for whatever reason

1034
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,079
that's a fascinating fighter's

1035
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:17,200
perspective on the thing i mean the

1036
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:21,038
the the story that is

1037
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,278
inspiring and i know it goes against

1038
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,278
the artistry of fighting is when you

1039
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,398
have taken the damage

1040
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,200
to still rise up and be able to defeat

1041
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,319
the opponent

1042
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,360
so it's uh but that

1043
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:38,079
that's a flip side of a basically you

1044
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,558
failing to defend yourself properly

1045
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,158
right

1046
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,678
i agree but let's say for i think it's

1047
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,278
it's trying that's a triumph of

1048
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,120
of humanity that's triumph that's

1049
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:46,240
amazing it's to witness such a thing is

1050
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,918
unbelievable

1051
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,880
but you still go this is there is a cost

1052
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,720
here it's like i i

1053
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,240
i've been fortunate enough to spend some

1054
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,240
time working with with the military

1055
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,839
and i've been like around and read medal

1056
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,200
of honor citations they're unbelievable

1057
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,278
like you read the story music

1058
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,558
it it's it'll floor you but it's all a

1059
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:03,200
cost and you don't want to be paying

1060
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:04,960
that cost

1061
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,640
or the long term and most of the time

1062
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,798
with the cost was everything and then

1063
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,720
sometimes you go hey yeah the value here

1064
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,558
it's worth everything it's like i

1065
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,079
defend your family you defend your

1066
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:15,200
country under certain circumstances and

1067
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,918
if that point is extension of your

1068
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,600
family

1069
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,759
you're like hey this is worth it to

1070
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,119
casually throw your life away or throw a

1071
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,839
hufflepuff it's foolish there's nothing

1072
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,359
there's nothing

1073
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,278
great about that and and like you said

1074
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,319
it's still an amazing thing to see

1075
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,839
yeah but but it's also amazing to see

1076
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,678
you not take damages the floyd

1077
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,240
mayweather it's the artistry of like not

1078
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,440
being hit

1079
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,038
and i wonder if maybe that's why people

1080
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,640
don't resonate with floyd as much as

1081
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,079
obviously muhammad ali was such a time

1082
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,519
and place a great man for so many

1083
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:40,398
different reasons although it was funny

1084
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,519
to remember like

1085
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,199
there were times when he wasn't very

1086
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,839
popular we love him now because of time

1087
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,600
of context

1088
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,278
you know time to move away from some of

1089
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,000
the nonsense he had to deal with

1090
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,159
but uh we got to see him struggle and

1091
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
also he had unbelievable sacrifice both

1092
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,159
in and out of the ring you know that

1093
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,919
that we all got to witness we've never

1094
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,360
really seen floyd struggle like that and

1095
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,640
granted obviously floyd isn't like a

1096
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,240
civil rights figure like

1097
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,440
muhammad ali was it's different time

1098
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,120
different place and he's a different man

1099
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,640
but basically uh

1100
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,398
you know i wonder if part of the thing

1101
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,000
that made us made everyone think of

1102
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:10,558
muhammad ali as the greatest in addition

1103
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,919
to of course

1104
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,960
the unbelievable things that he did out

1105
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,600
in the world and the stands that he made

1106
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,960
we saw him struggle in the ring it's

1107
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,038
it's almost it's humanizing

1108
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,880
you know it's it's weird when people the

1109
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:23,359
person yeah people respect b but again

1110
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,760
it's

1111
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,558
we saw gsp lose and gsp came back

1112
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,119
stronger

1113
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,599
khabib is amazing but i wonder i wonder

1114
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:31,199
how

1115
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,639
people feel about him long term not like

1116
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
they won't think of him as amazing and

1117
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,960
great

1118
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,919
and he's been a respectable person and

1119
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,240
champion but uh

1120
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,679
the time he hasn't he hasn't had to fall

1121
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,640
yeah if that makes sense and also

1122
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,200
coupled with uh

1123
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:49,840
ali had uh a way of being poetic

1124
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,120
about sort of the way he was in the ring

1125
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:52,000
sort of being able to explain the

1126
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,599
artistry that he

1127
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,679
i mean there's like joking as being

1128
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,480
playful but really he was

1129
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,840
able to describe the the flow like a

1130
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,038
butterfly's thing that could be like he

1131
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,359
was able to

1132
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,038
actually talk about his strategy without

1133
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:06,719
talking

1134
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,640
without crossing that line into the

1135
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,640
floyd mayweather when you're just

1136
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,759
talking about money and and just talking

1137
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,600
[ __ ] that's true

1138
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,759
actually conor mcgregor when he's not

1139
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,599
talking [ __ ] is pretty good at like

1140
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:21,119
talking about the art of the marshall

1141
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,240
and like first time and uh i wish khabib

1142
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:26,000
did the same

1143
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,000
actually uh from uh

1144
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,079
like the satya brothers there's a few

1145
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,119
there's a culture of like being poetic

1146
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:36,639
about like being scholars

1147
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:39,759
and also uh bards or whatever poets

1148
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,720
of the game and khabib is more

1149
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,599
like just simple and he lets his actions

1150
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,159
speak which

1151
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,959
is is great too in his own way yeah it's

1152
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,278
great but

1153
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,240
it's nice when you can tell stories and

1154
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,839
uh

1155
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,839
you know that that that's probably why

1156
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:57,359
ali was the great catch me

1157
00:33:53,839 --> 00:34:00,879
up to you went to three fights i think

1158
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,558
undefeated yep bj penn you we talked

1159
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,960
about last time you defeated bj penn

1160
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:05,759
that's a

1161
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,798
that's a i mean that's an incredible

1162
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:08,398
accomplishment

1163
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:10,719
but you fought a lot of really tough

1164
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,878
guys um

1165
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,239
when was your last fight and then catch

1166
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,398
me up with the injuries

1167
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,398
well a lot of people kept more and more

1168
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,878
and more were

1169
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,480
unwilling to fight you yeah that's been

1170
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,078
that's that was why i was out for two

1171
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,199
years following the grey maynard fight

1172
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,760
between uh

1173
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,799
the fighting gray um and bj and the

1174
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,079
great major fight was actually what i'm

1175
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,079
really proud of because

1176
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,000
um gray was very tough he's very big

1177
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,960
very strong very experienced i had

1178
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,320
only five fights at the time um and i

1179
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,760
didn't have a lot of skills i don't get

1180
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,200
to fight gray with what i

1181
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,599
have today i had to fight great with

1182
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,358
what i had in december 2016.

1183
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,720
and that i it really took a lot of

1184
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:48,319
discipline a lot of

1185
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,838
focus a lot of challenge you know to

1186
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,800
stay the course to do what i need to do

1187
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,039
in the fight and to win

1188
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,039
in in ultimately dominating fashion just

1189
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:56,559
not in the dominating obvious sense that

1190
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:57,519
you see when someone runs across and

1191
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,279
just

1192
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,639
does that to somebody but that wasn't on

1193
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,960
the list for me at that time

1194
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,719
you know so um that was a that was an

1195
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,320
interesting one but the time away again

1196
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:07,118
was very frustrating it was incredibly

1197
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,800
difficult

1198
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,640
before that fight uh after that fight

1199
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,640
that well because i uh

1200
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,920
i beat artem lobov in the final of the

1201
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,440
ultimate fighter in autumn

1202
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,039
is another guy that's tough a lot of

1203
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,838
experience and uh gets

1204
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:21,039
gets you know he he's a funny guy and he

1205
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:22,559
said some things on the internet so i

1206
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:23,920
think he gets a lot of heat for that

1207
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,078
but uh you know he just knocked out

1208
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,519
three of my teammates i'm like he

1209
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,880
put a couple people in a pretty rough

1210
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:30,800
shape at the end of that so he was doing

1211
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,160
well and that was a tough fight again

1212
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,160
if i got to go back and fight that fight

1213
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,519
now it would be not competitive at all i

1214
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:36,960
mean it wasn't competitive at that time

1215
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,719
but it very it was completely phased it

1216
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,559
wasn't close but it was competitive

1217
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,319
so you were improving and growing fast

1218
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,078
yeah and it was nice to have time away i

1219
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,838
wish i had more time in the ring but

1220
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,519
again i'd only been doing mma for three

1221
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,920
years at that time so the

1222
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,199
improvement from doing what the bitcoin

1223
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,960
mining

1224
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:56,319
was over uh overriding the ring rust

1225
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,920
i think so i don't really believe in

1226
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,800
ring rust if i'm honest you know i can

1227
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,960
understand why

1228
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,320
uh you know people could feel a certain

1229
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,679
way but if anything it's almost like you

1230
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,400
just kind of forget what competition's

1231
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,399
like

1232
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,599
and you realize like oh you feel

1233
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,800
butterflies or something like that you

1234
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,838
go oh my god this is different versus no

1235
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,519
that's your body getting ready to

1236
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,759
perform it's okay it's normal

1237
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,759
how do you not have ring rust i think i

1238
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,720
try to watch try to practice performing

1239
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,240
no matter what

1240
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:19,759
you know like whether it's sing karaoke

1241
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,598
i'm not very good but like anything you

1242
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,720
name it talking in front of people like

1243
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,079
you embrace the butterflies um yeah

1244
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,358
it's almost like i remember my last

1245
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,160
fight i'm just staring at the wall and

1246
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,719
i'm like

1247
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,679
huh i guess i guess i'm gonna fight in a

1248
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:33,838
couple minutes

1249
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,879
all right hey you give i mean of course

1250
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:36,320
we all heard the phrase like you can

1251
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,160
never walk in the same river twice

1252
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,920
because even if you're this even if the

1253
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:40,559
river's the same you're a different man

1254
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,599
that's uh

1255
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,880
i think it's a really important thing to

1256
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,039
understand because at various points in

1257
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,039
my martial arts career of

1258
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,400
thought oh man how should i feel i

1259
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,759
remember when i used to do well in

1260
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,200
competition i would feel

1261
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,040
i would think these thoughts listen to

1262
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:54,480
this song think think about this

1263
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,559
i would feel a certain way and then if

1264
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,039
you don't feel that way i would start to

1265
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,639
become stressed because uh i was

1266
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:01,519
self-inflicted versus going you'll feel

1267
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,279
how you feel

1268
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,440
your job is to show up with what you

1269
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,040
have on the day do your absolute best

1270
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,880
like i will never quit i can be sure of

1271
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:10,079
that i didn't say i can't be beat i

1272
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,599
can definitely be i could have lost

1273
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,079
every single fight that i've ever had

1274
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,000
but

1275
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,839
i control my effort and i control my

1276
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,519
attitude and that's i will

1277
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,039
i will do my very best to execute my

1278
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,400
game plan and the event's not working

1279
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,759
if i have to i'll put my hands up and

1280
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,559
walk dead forward if i need to at

1281
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
somebody

1282
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:25,759
you know we hope that that's not where

1283
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,599
it goes but you know like again that

1284
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,920
humanizing moment where you're shooting

1285
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,000
for like just the inner like the inner

1286
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,440
you sacrifice the outer and all you have

1287
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,199
left is will and

1288
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,639
you hope it doesn't happen but if it

1289
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,039
does you'll be there but i guess to come

1290
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,960
back like the extra periods of time

1291
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,320
um in between fights i think was uh

1292
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,920
valuable because

1293
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,599
it was it was deeply challenging it was

1294
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,119
incredibly it was it's

1295
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,720
heartbreaking sometimes i'm honest man

1296
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,280
it's like i didn't wanna it's just

1297
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,598
waiting

1298
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,480
oh my god dude is there politics

1299
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,680
involved does it

1300
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,159
some sometimes you know like i i i

1301
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,000
i you know it's every single time you

1302
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:03,199
step into the ring nothing's guaranteed

1303
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,559
um it's uh you could be hurt you could

1304
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,199
hurt somebody you could

1305
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,960
win you could lose you know throwing

1306
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,639
away just like i said throwing away your

1307
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,159
healthier life cheaply makes no sense

1308
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,319
for anyone um

1309
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,199
and you know having demonstrating some

1310
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,599
degree of

1311
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:18,799
of temperance is not cowardly either i

1312
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,880
mean but again you're

1313
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,720
if you wait too long you have nothing so

1314
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,440
i guess like uh

1315
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,799
i was trying and always being i'm always

1316
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,559
open to fighting the absolute best

1317
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,039
people possible i'm never turning down

1318
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:31,679
fights

1319
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,358
ever um you know some random jabroni

1320
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,960
decides that he wants to fight him to go

1321
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:36,159
away if i wanted to just fight randoms i

1322
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,480
would just start at stand to the you

1323
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:37,920
know

1324
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,280
on the table at denny's and start

1325
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,480
yelling and i'm sure would have you know

1326
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,119
some people who'd be willing to indulge

1327
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,159
me

1328
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,559
but uh you know you want to fight um you

1329
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:45,920
know

1330
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,599
meaningful opponents challenging

1331
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,000
opponents and i know who and where they

1332
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,079
are

1333
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,358
and so you did fight in atlantic city

1334
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,359
you know i did the denny

1335
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,279
but you put the denny's behind you i did

1336
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:56,799
and you know and i'll be honest if they

1337
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,839
were if i just stood up after that fight

1338
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,200
i don't know if i was in

1339
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,559
great shape to expect to win in the

1340
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,679
other fights that evening but i could i

1341
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:03,039
could have tried it i'm sure there was

1342
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,159
some takers in the crowd particularly

1343
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:05,119
after they watched me fight they're like

1344
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,598
yeah i'll fight that guy

1345
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,039
so okay so when was the last fight that

1346
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,960
was uh darren elkins that was

1347
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,000
six months or seven months after the bj

1348
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,838
fight which was great because that's you

1349
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,519
know i love maybe five really tough a

1350
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:18,159
very tough opponent very tough guy

1351
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,239
super tough dude and uh that was in uh

1352
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,358
july 2019 and then right when i was

1353
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:23,838
about to fight

1354
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,559
uh so you're ready to fight regularly

1355
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:25,838
after that yeah

1356
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,599
trying to fight and then you're trying

1357
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,199
to find a fight yeah incorrect we got

1358
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,440
ricardo llamas so no one else none of

1359
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,519
the

1360
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,039
i was ranked in the top 15 at that point

1361
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,639
and then uh

1362
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,920
people didn't want to fight we were

1363
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,759
struggling to find an opponent and

1364
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,960
ricardo llamas a great you know former

1365
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,640
title challenger you know

1366
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,000
mma you know really great history and

1367
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:44,960
mma recently retired but

1368
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,358
we were supposed to fight in uh i think

1369
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,920
may

1370
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:49,039
march march may of uh 2020 and then

1371
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,280
coronavirus happened

1372
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:52,320
and uh so that scrapped the whole show

1373
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,960
you know training we were just

1374
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,400
scrambling to try to keep the gym alive

1375
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,480
and take care you know i have five or

1376
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,599
six four five six i think five full-time

1377
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,199
employees that i

1378
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,119
you know they're my responsibility i

1379
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,838
have to their livelihood is in my hands

1380
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,559
and it's

1381
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,559
um to be irresponsible of me to to not

1382
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,000
take that seriously so anyway uh

1383
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:12,159
we were able to navigate through that

1384
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,760
time and then uh we were able to

1385
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,480
reschedule the llamas fight and that was

1386
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,680
in august

1387
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,318
of last year and i got a a

1388
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,000
medical like flag like oh hey like you

1389
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,519
you have a medical condition that we

1390
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,199
need to look into

1391
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,119
you when i got pulled from the fight and

1392
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,719
i immediately was concerned because of

1393
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,838
course any serious medical condition you

1394
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,039
want to go oh man

1395
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,039
well i guess i would like to look at

1396
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,000
that yeah it turns out it was a giant

1397
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,159
false positive

1398
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,400
and you know we find that out you know

1399
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,598
all of five weeks later and you go

1400
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,440
you gotta be kidding me that's

1401
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,640
frustrating and then we're still waiting

1402
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,159
for our fight waiting for a fight

1403
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,598
waiting for a fight waiting for a fight

1404
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,199
people won't sign up

1405
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,800
um asked for a number of different

1406
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,799
opponents basically said hey i'm willing

1407
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,119
to fight anybody that's that's tough and

1408
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,359

1436
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,160

1437
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,880

1440
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,599
universe goes hey man i hear you but

unfortunately it's healing up and then

1443
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,199
hopefully uh

1444
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,000

00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:33,679
i just wanted you to be the first person

1471
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,760
to know um

1472
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:38,000
i you know i just was pretty reasonably

1473
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,319
injured you just got an mri doctor says

1474
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,679
like

1475
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:41,279
hey man you're out and you need to take

1476
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:42,480
like three weeks off off don't do

1477
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,599
anything or you're gonna immediately

1478
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,880
you're gonna tear it the whole way and

1479
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,160
this is going to be surgery

1480
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,760
and then it's going to be an additional

1481
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:49,358
like eight weeks on top of that to start

1482
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,520
to rehab it through pt

1483
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:53,199
and anyway uh you know so i let him know

1484
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,000
hey if you can push this thing back i

1485
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,519
would love to

1486
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,880
keep on the car i would love to keep the

1487
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,800
fight you know it's like i respect you a

1488
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,480
lot as an opponent and also it's been

1489
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,318
brutal trying to get anybody to sign on

1490
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,000
so if you're into it i'm still there

1491
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:05,358
unfortunately he turned that down i

1492
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,880
understand he had other things going on

1493
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:07,679
he and his wife were expecting a child

1494
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,680
coming up

1495
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,118
so uh he needed to he needed to fight

1496
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:12,480
and anyway uh

1497
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,880
yeah i guess we'll see who's coming

1498
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,318
forward um is there somebody's like

1499
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,720
super tough in the featherweight

1500
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:21,039
division that you

1501
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,719
you seem to like enjoy the difficult

1502
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,239
puzzles is there somebody especially

1503
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,559
difficult that you

1504
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,399

00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,838
look forward to coming back and giving

1508
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,838
my best effort to do that

1509
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,078
i want to fight to beat uh megaman

1513
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,480
be a

1514
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,480
guy i would love to see that fight

1515
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,800

1516
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
fun

1517
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,920
um he would be very challenging all

1518
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,559
those guys are very challenging

1519
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,000
and uh so i look forward to just staying

1520
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:57,440
healthy to the extent that we can coming

1521
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,159
back and i'm gonna fight multiple times

1522
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,440
this year hell our hot water

1523
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:04,799
hell yes hey by the way uh i completely

1524
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
forgot because you were talking about

1525
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,000
systems

1526
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,800
and decision trees and the illusion of

1527
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,280
choice

1528
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,318
made me think of sam harris and i forgot

1529
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,480
to mention it

1530
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:15,440
so he talks about free will quite a bit

1531
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,838
huh

1532
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,720
and that there's an illusion of free

1533
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:22,400
will

1534
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:24,000
so it's like old claim cotton that the

1535
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,639
you know maybe the universe constructed

1536
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,159
that little game where

1537
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:30,000
it makes us feel like we have a bunch of

1538
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:31,358
choices but we really don't

1539
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,838
we're really always ending up with the

1540
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:35,759
middle finger that should be hilarious

1541
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,880
yeah that's it that's that's what you

1542
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,880
see before you die

1543
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,160
it's just a giant middle finger it's

1544
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,800
like oh [ __ ]

1545
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,399
i knew it uh i knew it what do you think

1546
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,318
do you think there's a free will like we

1547
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,800
feel like we're making choices so you're

1548
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:51,039
thinking again we're talking about okay

1549
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,119
here's a system of martial arts

1550
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:55,199
that's uh hands of gracie there's

1551
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,960
different schools and whatever

1552
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,559
and then you're thinking okay how can i

1553
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,039
think outside these systems but then

1554
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,920
there's

1555
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:04,800
also a system that's our human society

1556
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,920
and

1557
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,039
we feel like there's a actual

1558
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,800
choice being made by us individuals

1559
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,079
do you think that choice is real or is

1560
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,599
it just an illusion well

1561
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,200
okay that's a really good question i'm

1562
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,240
not necessarily equipped to answer this

1563
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,239
but i'll do my best

1564
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:22,318
um okay i guess i would say to start

1565
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,399
with sure would be interesting if it

1566
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,759
wasn't real if the choice wasn't real

1567
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,519
yeah um would be pretty

1568
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,440
interesting if it is real uh first off i

1569
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,318
would start with facilitated beliefs

1570
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,240
versus

1571
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:33,838
not facilitative beliefs it's almost

1572
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:35,439
like uh i think the world's out to get

1573
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:38,880
me

1574
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,800
true not true what next probably not a

1575
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,400
facility to believe even if you

1576
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,280
if imagine you believe there's no free

1577
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,000
will okay now what

1578
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,040
does that justify every single impulse

1579
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,358
that you're going to

1580
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:53,358
give into or does the belief in free

1581
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,920
will just the belief in my ability to

1582
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,119
work hard to focus to be disciplined to

1583
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,519
improve my position

1584
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,800
prove my situation whether it's true or

1585
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:02,400
not although i think that

1586
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,079
at least many of us would argue that at

1587
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,519
least whether whether there's some sort

1588
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,318
of internal driver that

1589
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:10,079
allows for that yeah like we live in a

1590
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:10,800
material world your actions do affect

1591
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,640
the world

1592
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,960
i can choose to pick that water up or

1593
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:17,279
not and anyway uh

1594
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,480
i would say i believe strongly in the

1595
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,519
idea of

1596
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,920
picking facilitative beliefs um you know

1597
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:24,480
and

1598
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,000
going hey i will adjust whether this

1599
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,679
belief system is right or wrong on a

1600
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,880
cosmic level i'm nowhere near smart

1601
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:32,480
enough to understand

1602
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,599
but i can say me deciding that

1603
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,960
let's say for instance i'm going to walk

1604
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,480
over to have a conversation with someone

1605
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,880
in the hotel lobby and they've

1606
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,480
never met them and i go over and i start

1607
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,079
with oh this is going to be interesting

1608
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,000
and i just walk over there

1609
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,359
versus in my head i'm like what's this

1610
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,559
[ __ ] want

1611
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,639
we're about to have two very different

1612
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,719
conversations i could be right that this

1613
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,879
person is not very polite or

1614
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,078
thinks negatively of me right from go

1615
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,760
but i think that

1616
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,280
that's probably not a facility to

1617
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,920
believe people talk about

1618
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,760
i'm how is that going to help me

1619
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,519
navigate the conversation to a positive

1620
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,480
conclusion and i think about that for

1621
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:07,358
uh um you know let's say fighting it's a

1622
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,800
good example like

1623
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,719
confidence plenty of people believe

1624
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,920
plenty of things that aren't real myself

1625
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,559
included i'm sure

1626
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,159
all the time and uh anyway believing

1627
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:17,599
that you can do something

1628
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:19,118
i'm like hey i think i can win doesn't

1629
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,838
guarantee you a positive outcome but i

1630
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,400
would say

1631
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,759
it most of us would probably most of us

1632
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,200
would argue that it helps

1633
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,800
and you think about depression what's

1634
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:30,078
depression if not a

1635
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,480
a negative unfacilitative belief that is

1636
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,800
not

1637
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,838
always that oftentimes is not reflected

1638
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,760
by reality

1639
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:37,279
but you project it on to reality and

1640
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,800
it's understandable if it makes you feel

1641
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,160
like oh man this isn't going to work out

1642
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,640
i don't think the prospects are going

1643
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,000
well

1644
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:43,679
and then if you feel like you can't get

1645
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,358
out of that loop that seems

1646
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,719
pretty rough and i see a lot of things

1647
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:48,400
out in society right now where you go

1648
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,078
whether whether you agree or disagree

1649
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,680
with various positions on things you go

1650
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,800
is that a facilitated belief even if

1651
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:56,078
that is true

1652
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,839
which is arguable anything so what next

1653
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,960
man so what where does this end one one

1654
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:00,480
is the positive

1655
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,400
what's the happy ending here and if they

1656
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,039
go well there is no happiness like okay

1657
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,079
so so now what so what do we do here and

1658
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,279
i guess uh

1659
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:11,760
so choose the facilitative belief and uh

1660
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,359
in your intuition believing that free

1661
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,480
will is real

1662
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:17,358
is uh is more productive for a

1663
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,280
successful life

1664
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:20,400
absolutely because otherwise how am i

1665
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,880
not

1666
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,880
how am i first of how can i how can

1667
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,760
society function if it's not real

1668
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,680
so how can i blame you or anyone else or

1669
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,440
hold anyone responsible for anything if

1670
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:35,118
free will isn't real

1671
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,559
well no that's exactly the point you but

1672
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,559
at the surface level what you're saying

1673
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,200
is true but perhaps if we

1674
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,079
truly internalize that free will as an

1675
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:43,919
illusion

1676
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,519
we'll start to figure out something that

1677
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,440
uh

1678
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:48,880
that transforms the way we see society

1679
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,079
for example

1680
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:55,920
we are very individual centric so

1681
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,839
uh believing that free will is real

1682
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,358
puts a lot of responsibility and blame

1683
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,960
on people when they

1684
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:05,199
do something bad maybe if we

1685
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,960
truly internalize that free will is an

1686
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:07,919
illusion we start to think about the

1687
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,679
system of

1688
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,240
humans together as um

1689
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,199
as like this mechanism for progress as

1690
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,919
opposed to where

1691
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:19,199
individual people are responsible for

1692
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,240
their actions

1693
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:24,239
uh good or bad so we like remove the

1694
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,519
value the weight we assigned to the

1695
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,719
accomplishments or

1696
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:30,559
the or the violence the negative stuff

1697
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,000
done by individuals and more look at the

1698
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,359
progress of society

1699
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,280
i don't know what that looks like but

1700
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:37,519
it's almost like as opposed to focusing

1701
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,440
on the individual ants of an ant colony

1702
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:40,960
looking at the entirety of the ant

1703
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,400
colony

1704
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,679
to that i think it makes perfect sense i

1705
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,639
would just say that that's a reasonable

1706
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,719
thing to suggest

1707
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:48,000
it's a seismic shift right and it's hard

1708
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:49,519
to say whether that would be

1709
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,358
you know better or worse but i guess

1710
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,159
i'll use this as a this is a convenient

1711
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,558
one for me

1712
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:55,358
um so i remember the last time we spoke

1713
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,440
i brought up

1714
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,279
you know one of the most reviled evil

1715
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,800
characters in certainly recent history

1716
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,359
probably human history period adolf

1717
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,800
hitler well i'm a big fan of making

1718
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:06,239
people live in the world that they want

1719
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,400
to believe in

1720
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,679
well if free will doesn't exist and it's

1721
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,960
just about how things move

1722
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:12,960
forward when are we going to be

1723
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,318
high-fiving this guy or what like this

1724
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,720
is you know because i remember what i

1725
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:16,239
said

1726
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:18,480
and you know that actually brings me to

1727
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:20,799
something else we discussed you know uh

1728
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,519
yeah for people who don't know ryan

1729
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,839
brought up

1730
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:25,920
or i brought up there's literally a

1731
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:26,719
giant book about hitler my so i've been

1732
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,400
obsessed with

1733
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,318
uh hitler world war ii and stalin

1734
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,599
recently uh for

1735
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:35,519
recently oh man

1736
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,960
this has become like a meme joe rogan

1737
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,880
with like dmt and

1738
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,000
me with it like i picked something more

1739
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,358
positive

1740
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,199
like cat in the head or something i

1741
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,759
don't know but we you brought up hitler

1742
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:47,439
as an example of something particular of

1743
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,559
the the some philosophical discussions

1744
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:54,559
we're having and uh the excellent

1745
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,359
eloquent and uh the the full of

1746
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,000
integrity

1747
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,519
mma journalists uh clipped out something

1748
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,199
you've said about

1749
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:05,039
uh about hitler and said that uh

1750
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:06,399
you know i i forget what the headlines

1751
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,318
are but there were

1752
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,680
the the most ridiculous possible

1753
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:12,000
implementation

1754
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:13,440
basically intentionally misrepresenting

1755
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,920
intentionally misunderstanding what i'm

1756
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,679
saying

1757
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,358
then it's like i get that they're stupid

1758
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:18,799
but i'm stupid too so i know what that's

1759
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:20,880
like so i don't have a lot of

1760
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,640
stupid yeah exactly it's it's yeah

1761
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,960
exactly i don't i can't give you pass on

1762
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:24,318
that

1763
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,000
but basically intentionally

1764
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:29,599
misunderstanding what's going on

1765
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
but what i find funny is that

1766
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,680
hey we got to be careful what we believe

1767
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,880
and again back to the cancel culture

1768
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:35,519
thing that we discussed last time as

1769
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,680
well

1770
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,719
where would i would i like to apologize

1771
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,000
i mean no actually something about

1772
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:41,439
cancer culture that we've been seeing

1773
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,119
things culturally like

1774
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,480
i will be damned if i apologize for

1775
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,760
anything that i don't need to apologize

1776
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,358
for because i was intentionally

1777
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,880
misunderstood in that instance now

1778
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:50,960
you could say that i don't know that i'm

1779
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,838
not a historical scholar which i would

1780
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,119
agree immediately and

1781
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:56,000
also that i'm that i oftentimes

1782
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:57,599
ineligibly phrase things which i'll

1783
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,838
agree that what again

1784
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,640
but uh ultimately you know going hey i

1785
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:02,239
want to make you

1786
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,759
believe live in the world that you will

1787
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:06,799
that you're suggesting

1788
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,200
ought to exist okay so if there's no

1789
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,839
free will

1790
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,679
is everything how far of a step back are

1791
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:14,558
we willing to take cosmically before we

1792
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:16,078
start going

1793
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,480
hey this is good because we're

1794
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,318
experiencing a social you know

1795
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,838
reckoning in our country at the moment

1796
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:24,239
you know for good and

1797
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,679
for other um probably i guess and

1798
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,639
basically uh

1799
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,159
but hey it all worked out right so that

1800
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:31,279
that's probably not something that would

1801
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:33,759
fly and and i think

1802
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,040
that's a fair thing that's interesting

1803
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,359
it might not fly from the individual

1804
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:40,800
perspective but if you zoom out

1805
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:43,199
and think of you know appreciate society

1806
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,039
as you know just like an ant colony as a

1807
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:47,118
beautifully complex system

1808
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:48,159
like we kind of from from the individual

1809
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,200
pro

1810
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,639
perspective we value progress

1811
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,799
especially progress of the individual

1812
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,558
but in whole progress of societies

1813
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,079
but if you accept that this is just a

1814
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,800
complex system that's not necessarily

1815
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,119
headed in you

1816
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,920
anywhere that this is almost like that

1817
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,039
river

1818
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,920
it's just flowing i think that removes

1819
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:08,639
the burden

1820
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,639
of always striving of always trying and

1821
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:13,039
always like the struggle and so on

1822
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:15,440
so it's possible that if we have no

1823
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:15,920
control you can like arrive at some kind

1824
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,079
of other

1825
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,599
zen state does that sound very human

1826
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,920
though that's that's

1827
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:28,720
that's that goes against i think

1828
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:30,400
uh our current uh human condition as we

1829
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:31,838
experience it but we've communicated

1830
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,519
that to each other like

1831
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:34,960
so we've taught like through these

1832
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,440
social forces taught

1833
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,000
each other that our lives matter and so

1834
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,119
on

1835
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,318
maybe if we convince ourselves that

1836
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,440
we're just sort of like little things in

1837
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,440
a stream

1838
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,800
and ultimately none of it matters there

1839
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,400
might be some kind of enjoyment to be

1840
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,039
discovered through that process i don't

1841
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,720
listen

1842
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:56,239
i'm a capitalist but i guess i think you

1843
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:58,239
bring up a really important point like i

1844
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:00,639
guess almost anything like capitalism

1845
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:01,279
i i only get to experience it as i as i

1846
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:03,118
sit here

1847
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,559
now and i get to live i was raised in

1848
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,920
the united states i've traveled around

1849
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,440
the world a little bit i've had the

1850
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,119
you know good fortune of meeting many

1851
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:12,800
people from many different places

1852
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:14,160
and um i'm an end user of capitalism i

1853
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,960
don't really know how it got here

1854
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:16,639
whether it was

1855
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,480
i wasn't there at the start of this idea

1856
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:19,920
i wasn't there for hey how do we come up

1857
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,358
with this idea how do we arrive and i'm

1858
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,240
nowhere near well read enough to

1859
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:24,799
understand

1860
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:26,639
any of that really uh even second hand

1861
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,039
and i guess recognizing that

1862
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,400
communism marxism socialism anarchism

1863
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:33,119
anything is uh

1864
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,680
these are all perspectives that all have

1865
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,920
i guess

1866
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,598
various strengths and weaknesses but i

1867
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,358
guess uh one thing i'm always

1868
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,680
i guess i would say the burden it seems

1869
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,719
to me that if you want to make a change

1870
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:46,399
uh the burden of proof

1871
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:48,000
is is on the person implying that there

1872
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,440
needs to be a change yeah and

1873
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,639
it doesn't mean that there's nothing

1874
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,240
there but it's like if you want to

1875
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:53,759
create a small shift a riffle that's

1876
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:55,919
fine but a seismic

1877
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,280
ripping shift in how we exist or how we

1878
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,400
experience the world as human beings and

1879
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,760
you mentioned fighting

1880
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,280
why watching someone undergo take abuse

1881
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,160
on a level in the ring

1882
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,119
that's just shocking and then triumph in

1883
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:09,118
spite of it is like

1884
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,640
it's you're like this is unbelievable

1885
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,519
this is part of the magic of combat

1886
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:13,199
sports

1887
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:14,239
now it's part of the the magic the other

1888
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:15,598
side of the match that doesn't get

1889
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,078
talked about sometimes is that the

1890
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,079
the trajectory of that individual's life

1891
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,680
later on is not always great

1892
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,519
um or there's a little phrase there's a

1893
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:26,318
cost for that but uh

1894
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:28,000
you know if if this if we remember you

1895
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:30,639
mentioned removing the struggle

1896
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,599
i don't personally the struggle is what

1897
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:33,838
makes life

1898
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,119
is what makes life life and also i guess

1899
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:37,039
you know something for us has brought up

1900
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,960
to me on a number of occasions is that

1901
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:40,159
as and it makes sense to me it's

1902
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,559
basically uh

1903
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:44,960
humans only understand things uh through

1904
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,519
relative comparison i only understand

1905
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,119
um you know heat because i've known cold

1906
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,798
i only unders it's i guess like it's

1907
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,318
like talking to someone that's uh never

1908
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:52,960
experienced any sort of hardship and

1909
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:54,880
then their

1910
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,159
their latte isn't right and then they

1911
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,680
they pitch a fit

1912
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:59,440
versus someone that's gone through a

1913
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:01,679
great deal of challenge struggle

1914
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,599
you know in their life they tend to have

1915
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:06,318
a little bit more of an even perspective

1916
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,160
and anyway and of course even as a

1917
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:09,440
relative thing and what i perceive to be

1918
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,279
even may not be even maybe i'm

1919
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,720
particularly soft or something the other

1920
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,599
direction without realizing because i

1921
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:14,558
can only understand what i can

1922
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,119
understand

1923
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,839
but the idea that that we want to

1924
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,400
fundamentally

1925
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:20,960
alter ourselves as a species and as

1926
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,000
people

1927
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,920
seems like a incredibly incredibly

1928
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,599
high bar to prove and also like an

1929
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,680
incredibly dangerous idea

1930
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,039
because it always comes back to who's

1931
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:32,399
going to be responsible for this who

1932
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,759
gets to do the choosing

1933
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,200
what's a good idea what's not a good

1934
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,240
idea and i guess that actually brings me

1935
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:37,519
kind of to a

1936
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:40,000
something i've been encountering

1937
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:42,079
recently in discussions with friends

1938
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
i feel like there's only two types of

1939
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:47,359
people that i that i encounter at this

1940
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,798
point um people with a more or less

1941
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:51,039
libertarian tilt

1942
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:52,318
to their thinking and people without it

1943
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:52,639
and when i say libertarian i don't mean

1944
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:54,719
that

1945
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:56,639
in the political party sense or even the

1946
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:58,639
belief system basically i'm like hey

1947
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,159
you do you buddy it's not my it's not

1948
00:56:58,639 --> 00:57:01,759
what you're up to is not my concern

1949
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,279
versus what you're up to is my concern

1950
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,559
and i guess i've always watched

1951
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,839
you know various points in history

1952
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,960
people on this side are people on that

1953
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:09,440
side are

1954
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,880
more more or less you know i guess

1955
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,599
problematic i guess you could say i

1956
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,079
don't mean that in the

1957
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,119
internet sense you know more of it more

1958
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,000
of an issue

1959
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,519
but um the world is always full of

1960
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,280
people that want to tell you

1961
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,039
what you need to be doing as opposed to

1962
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,400
more or less do no harm and i guess

1963
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,639
that's one of the ones anytime i'm

1964
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,639
trying to tell other people what to do

1965
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,480
i better hope i'm right and it's bizarre

1966
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:30,879
to me how many people are so confident

1967
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,880
that

1968
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,559
their side or their position is the one

1969
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,000
that's not only right for them but right

1970
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,680
enough that they can enforce it on

1971
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,639
others and that just seems incredibly

1972
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:40,239
dangerous to me

1973
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:42,639
and i guess that comes back to even

1974
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,959
sam's point about oh we want to

1975
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:46,558
if under trying to spread the idea that

1976
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,318
free will doesn't exist i'm not saying

1977
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:49,680
it's damaging but it very well may be

1978
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:51,599
and plenty of other things could be as

1979
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:53,118
well i'm not you know it goes way over

1980
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,400
my head as to you know the implications

1981
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,240
of all of these and i guess all of us

1982
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,760
are an evangelist for something

1983
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:00,719
but uh i i guess it's weird that we've

1984
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,720
gotten this far

1985
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:04,000
as a species and now we want to take

1986
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:05,838
like sharp

1987
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,599
sharp turns well we've been taking a

1988
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:09,279
bunch of sharp turns throughout history

1989
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,519
yeah that's so that's what you know

1990
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,400
that's that's the way

1991
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:16,000
you know okay humans love power and one

1992
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,599
way to attain power is to say

1993
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,358
everything that you guys are doing is

1994
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,760
wrong and i have the right thing and i'm

1995
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:24,159
going to build up a giant cult of people

1996
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,079
and i'm going to overthrow and

1997
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:27,039
indirectly what that results in me is me

1998
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:29,440
gaining power

1999
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:31,279
and that's how you get all the big

2000
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,440
revolutions in human history

2001
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,960
saying i'm done with the thing that the

2002
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,119
powerful are currently doing

2003
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,400
so i'm going to overthrow that's that's

2004
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,838
where probably

2005
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,838
all the identity politics that's

2006
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:43,039
happening now is people that didn't have

2007
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:45,519
power before

2008
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:46,079
are looking to gain power and they're

2009
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:48,000
also

2010
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,880
you know that's where jordan peterson

2011
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,199
criticizes identity politics is

2012
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,760
people with the right with the good

2013
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:58,719
intentions i should say

2014
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,839
are in seeking power allow power to

2015
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:03,039
corrupt them

2016
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:06,159
as power always does and so they

2017
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:08,558
lose track of like the

2018
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:09,358
the the devils that they're fighting by

2019
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,079
becoming

2020
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:13,598
the same kind of devils the the the same

2021
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,280
kind of evil that they're fighting

2022
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,280
and so that that's just the progress of

2023
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:20,960
human history but hopefully

2024
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:23,200
as these power greedy people keep

2025
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,639
attaining power with the with the

2026
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,078
progressive mindset

2027
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:27,838
over time things get better and better

2028
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,400
as they can as they have generation

2029
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:33,119
each generation a lot of a lot of

2030
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,000
unfairness happens a lot of

2031
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,318
hypocrisy happens a lot of people are

2032
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,358
trampled along the way

2033
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:43,119
by those who mean well but over time

2034
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:45,279
like lessons are learned or like

2035
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,240
human like civilization accumulates

2036
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,319
lessons

2037
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:50,318
and in part learns the lessons of

2038
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:50,719
history and gets better and better over

2039
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:52,960
time

2040
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:55,279
even though in the short term there's

2041
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,920
people acting not their best selves

2042
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,920
and you know

2043
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,599
that seems to be the progress of human

2044
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,760
history the

2045
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,359
idea of internalizing with free will not

2046
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,799
being real

2047
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:08,480
i mean you you're actually making me

2048
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,880
realize that that ultimately leads to a

2049
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,079
kind of um

2050
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,720
doesn't that go in a nihilistic

2051
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,440
direction yeah it's both nihilistic or

2052
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,039
if you want to

2053
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,200
make it a political system then it's

2054
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:21,920
more like communist type of

2055
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:23,358
a system where like the the value of the

2056
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,480
individual is completely

2057
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:29,519
uh reduced removed or

2058
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,679
another perspective is like the freedom

2059
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:33,039
of an individual is not to be valued or

2060
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:35,279
protected and so

2061
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,719
from us our current perspective the

2062
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,519
systems that seem to have worked the

2063
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:40,000
united states

2064
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:41,119
works pretty damn well uh despite all

2065
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,920
the different criticisms

2066
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:45,920
it seems like freedom of the individual

2067
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,000
in all its forms

2068
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,200
seems to be fundamental to the success

2069
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,559
of the united states

2070
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:53,439
and so we should it's uh however the

2071
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,760
hell you put it

2072
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,000
is like doesn't matter whether free will

2073
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:01,280
is or isn't an illusion

2074
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,719
the belief that it's real protects the

2075
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,000
individual from the group which is

2076
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:05,039
fundamentally correct me if i'm wrong

2077
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,719
that always seems like

2078
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:09,279
the big issue of history hey there's

2079
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:11,679
more of me than there is of you

2080
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,119
deal with it you're like yikes yeah and

2081
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:14,239
you want to be yourself you want to be

2082
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,599
different you want to have a different

2083
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:17,039
religion you want to be a different skin

2084
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,880
color you want to do this all the bad

2085
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:20,558
tribal things happen

2086
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,079
when there's more of me than you

2087
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,839
recreating from wrong yeah

2088
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,280
yeah absolutely but then that's always

2089
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:26,078
the fundamental power imbalance though

2090
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,280
right

2091
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,440
well the interesting thing about the

2092
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,040
libertarian thinking i guess i

2093
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,000
i don't know those words are maybe

2094
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:32,960
they're all charged i know what you can

2095
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,039
yeah and they're all

2096
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,318
i may not scale up but i mean more like

2097
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:37,358
on a philosophical underpinning where

2098
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:39,199
you're like yeah basically

2099
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:40,558
hey you feel free to believe i'm i'm a

2100
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,639
fool and

2101
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,599
plenty of people do i'm sure but as long

2102
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:45,440
as you don't

2103
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,119
chase me down the hall and hit me in the

2104
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,039
back of the head with a textbook

2105
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,720
what's the big deal yeah so the

2106
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:53,759
libertarian viewpoint

2107
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:56,719
which i probably espouse like that's i'm

2108
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,319
very much like uh freedom of the

2109
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,558
individual is very valuable

2110
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,880
and like leave others the [ __ ] alone

2111
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,839
unless they're trying to hurt you

2112
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,480
the thing is you also have to i believe

2113
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:09,679
put in the

2114
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:13,039
the work of empathy of understanding

2115
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:14,719
what others how what leaving people the

2116
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,400
[ __ ] alone means to others

2117
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:18,480
but isn't that an interesting thing if i

2118
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,920
believe in freedom of the individual

2119
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,440
and i take that like all of these like

2120
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,240
you said you take them past just their

2121
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,159
first

2122
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:26,159
why question you ask why why why why or

2123
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:28,239
how how many times

2124
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,159
should that not extend to respect for

2125
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:32,000
you respect for your position respect

2126
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:32,879
for your individual lived experience

2127
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,039
which could be

2128
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,400
grossly different than mine yeah this is

2129
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,160
the problem with saying

2130
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,318
i'm an individual i'm not going to

2131
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:43,038
bother you you don't bother me

2132
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:43,759
that's just like that's not actionable

2133
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,920
because

2134
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,039
to be to make it actionable you have to

2135
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,119
think the why why

2136
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,480
why why you have to do the steps beyond

2137
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,760
right you think what does that actually

2138
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,280
mean that means

2139
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:58,720
understanding how even my very existence

2140
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,400
uh like hurts others because

2141
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:02,159
you have to understand that like i'm not

2142
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,318
you're not just sitting alone in a room

2143
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:06,000
you're uh you're using like public

2144
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:07,199
transit you're using the police force

2145
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,440
you're using

2146
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,480
fire fighters you're using the like

2147
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,679
you're using a lot of

2148
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:17,280
resources that are publicly shared and

2149
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:18,798
some of those resources are are unfairly

2150
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,559
distributed

2151
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,719
like we've agreed that we're going to

2152
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,079
pay taxes and

2153
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:25,759
those taxes are going to go towards

2154
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,599
building some kind of infrastructure

2155
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,359
so that's already towards social that's

2156
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,119
so you're not a real

2157
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:32,880
you're you're not a real sort of i

2158
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,760
talked to michael malus like anarchists

2159
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:38,160
right saying like basically full

2160
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:39,839
just leave me the [ __ ] alone and i'm

2161
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:40,719
going to collaborate with whoever the

2162
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:42,318
hell i want

2163
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:43,838
we're not that's not the american

2164
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:46,880
society

2165
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:48,960
as it stands currently we've agreed

2166
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,000
that there's going to be certain social

2167
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,599
institutions

2168
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,199
that we pay into yes and uh some of the

2169
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,760
sort of discussions about race and all

2170
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:01,358
those kinds of things

2171
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:04,160
is about those institutions being

2172
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:05,838
uh institutionally unfair whether it's

2173
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:08,798
race or gender all those kinds of things

2174
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:10,798
listen i you know i have a bunch of

2175
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:12,639
criticisms of the way that conversation

2176
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:14,639
carries itself out but

2177
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:16,798
the thing is what's valuable is to

2178
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:20,400
actually listen and empathize

2179
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:22,000
and that's not over often talked about

2180
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,440
with the leaving the [ __ ] little

2181
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,639
mindset

2182
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,000
because your um

2183
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:30,159
it doesn't have it doesn't have that

2184
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,079
little component which i think

2185
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:34,078
could be fundamental to the function of

2186
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,880
a society which is like social

2187
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,359
like it's the what is it the obama you

2188
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,240
didn't

2189
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:40,798
build it or you didn't build it alone or

2190
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:43,279
whatever

2191
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:44,000
what however that goes but basically we

2192
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,119
wouldn't be

2193
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,798
we wouldn't be able to accomplish

2194
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,079
anything as individuals without the help

2195
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:50,400
of others

2196
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:52,798
and to be able to then start to think

2197
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,280
okay so what is

2198
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:57,440
what is what is my duty what is my

2199
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,319
responsibility to other human beings

2200
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,960
to be respectful to be loving to to help

2201
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:03,119
them

2202
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,798
as part of this functioning society that

2203
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,079
starts that's actually a lot of work to

2204
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:07,679
start to think about that for sure

2205
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,480
because then i have to like think okay

2206
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:10,159
ryan

2207
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,000
what's his life like like as a business

2208
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,000
owner doing covid

2209
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,119
what's that like and then he has uh

2210
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,519
there's employees that

2211
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:19,358
run the gym what's that like what's that

2212
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:20,639
stress like right or about the fighting

2213
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:23,119
and the injury and so on what's that

2214
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:26,239
like that empathy takes a lot of like

2215
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,720
compute cycles and also a lot of energy

2216
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:28,239
right

2217
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:30,959
but i have to go through that

2218
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:34,078
computation if i want to be

2219
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,880
an individual that's like

2220
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,440
doesn't hurt you if if i may i guess

2221
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,880
like to

2222
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,720
to come back to muhammad ali one of the

2223
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,640
things he said is service others is

2224
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:43,919
the rent is the rent that you pay for

2225
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:45,118
your you know there's these is the price

2226
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,680
you pay for right here on earth

2227
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,200
yeah and now i one of the things that i

2228
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:50,000
think that i see as a result of the

2229
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:52,960
internet all the time

2230
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,838
is people talking about global giant

2231
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,400
problems

2232
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:57,119
social problems that are society-wide

2233
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,838
that are

2234
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,960
massive like truly massive and frankly

2235
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:03,838
beyond the

2236
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,280
beyond the power of any of us to solve

2237
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:06,000
yeah that's certainly on an individual

2238
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,920
level

2239
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,039
so i've you know i've discussed things

2240
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,159
with friends like my father's an

2241
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,319
environmental attorney

2242
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:14,078
like uh ian has been for a long time and

2243
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:16,719
has been an engineer for a long time

2244
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:17,119
and uh you know so i'm not i barely know

2245
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:18,798
anything

2246
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:20,559
but i'm reading a little bit of various

2247
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,079
things but uh

2248
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,599
climate change oh my god i'm so

2249
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,720
concerned about climate change

2250
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,318
what am i supposed to do about climate

2251
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:27,358
change i'll tell you what i can do is i

2252
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:30,079
can not litter

2253
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:31,838
i can try to conserve energy where i can

2254
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,200
i can do whatever i want what can i

2255
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:36,239
personally do

2256
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:39,358
about some giant social problem

2257
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:41,118
that is that i didn't start and i is out

2258
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:42,880
of my control i'm like well i can be

2259
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:44,720
decent to the people around me i can

2260
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,000
mention i can demonstrate empathy and i

2261
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:48,000
can demonstrate consideration

2262
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,358
for the people in my circle and to the

2263
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,239
extent that i can the people outside of

2264
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:52,400
my circle

2265
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,759
but yelling at the trees over things

2266
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,559
that over problems that are

2267
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,240
borderline cosmic um doesn't seem very

2268
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,599
productive it just makes me feel like

2269
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:00,000
i'm cool and important because i'm

2270
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,440
talking

2271
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,798
about something well hundreds of years

2272
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,920
from now the water will rise maybe it

2273
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:05,358
will maybe it won't i can't

2274
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,000
it's completely over my head i know

2275
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:09,759
nothing but focusing on the problems

2276
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,280
that we can actually solve it comes back

2277
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,799
to the same thing i want to win a fight

2278
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,640
i would love to win a fight

2279
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:16,318
uh i can't control that what i can do is

2280
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:17,440
i can control each individual step that

2281
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:19,038
i take around the ring and trying to

2282
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:22,318
make the next correct move

2283
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:24,400
i can't look no it it gets people's uh

2284
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:25,679
you know they get all excited you know

2285
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,960
i'm trying to keep my language in check

2286
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:27,598
but they get all excited thinking about

2287
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,318
uh

2288
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,240
you know problems that are like superman

2289
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:34,318
couldn't solve these problems

2290
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:36,399
like you could be that powerful and you

2291
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:38,239
can't make all of the bad things go away

2292
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,079
but you can absolutely change yourself

2293
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:41,759
and i think a lot of the lessons that

2294
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:43,440
you know like the good lessons from

2295
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,799
religion that happened the good lessons

2296
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,639
from the great men and women throughout

2297
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:47,280
history that we and that we're inspired

2298
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:49,440
by

2299
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,319
that talk about change starting with

2300
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,599
within and

2301
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:52,960
you know again treating the people

2302
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,240
around you decently and feeding the

2303
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,760
people around too decently doesn't even

2304
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,358
necessarily mean the golden rule

2305
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,799
do unto others as you would like them to

2306
01:07:57,358 --> 01:08:00,318
do to you i go

2307
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:01,679
well maybe what i would like and what

2308
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:02,798
this person would like aren't the same

2309
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:03,838
thing well how am i going to get to the

2310
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:05,599
bottom of that because i could be

2311
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:07,279
attempting to be decent to this person

2312
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,960
and by my standard i am being decent but

2313
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,680
maybe i'm maybe i'm missing the mark by

2314
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,000
theirs

2315
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:13,038
well i can't possibly if i just

2316
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,079
interacted with you

2317
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:15,440
like it's like someone talking about

2318
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:16,560
some nonsense microaggression you're

2319
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,920
like so let me get this straight i've

2320
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,560
never met you before you've never met me

2321
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,239
before

2322
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,839
and you're interpreting some minor

2323
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:23,838
comment that that i've made

2324
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:25,119
in the least charitable way possible

2325
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:26,158
yeah i'm not saying that that you

2326
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:27,759
couldn't be annoyed but

2327
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:29,519
your expectation for that level of

2328
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,479
consideration is

2329
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,199
you're going to be you're going to be

2330
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:34,639
disappointed a lot now if you if we're

2331
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:36,079
someone that's in your life on a

2332
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,960
consistent basis and they're like hey i

2333
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:38,079
really don't appreciate what you're

2334
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,198
saying or what you're doing here do you

2335
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:40,318
realize that

2336
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,559
this is how i'm this is how i'm

2337
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,520
perceiving you go oh man i'm so sorry

2338
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,679
of course i would hear what you have to

2339
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:49,040
say but i guess trying to

2340
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:51,520
recognize that you know my i guess my

2341
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:52,399
job is to treat others with dignity in

2342
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,719
general

2343
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:56,318
but that level the level of specificity

2344
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:58,880
that that that requires

2345
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:00,640
increases as it gets closer to you and i

2346
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,359
have as a person i have a very finite

2347
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,520
amount of

2348
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,560
resources financially intellectually

2349
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,120
emotionally

2350
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,640
physically if i chuck you know point

2351
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:10,479
zero zero one percent of it in every

2352
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,920
single different direction

2353
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,759
what am i doing it's like when people go

2354
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,359
oh i care deeply about tibet

2355
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,119
like why aren't you over there go build

2356
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,120
a house man get on a plane

2357
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:20,399
go build a house oh you don't want to do

2358
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:21,838
that so really what you want to do is

2359
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:23,679
post on facebook and

2360
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:25,600
and accept high fives for how much of a

2361
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:27,520
good guy you are i got an idea

2362
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,279
go help somebody in your neighborhood go

2363
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,719
be go play with go play with some kids

2364
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,600
go be a friend to someone that doesn't

2365
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:33,920
have a friend

2366
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,359
read a book try to educate yourself and

2367
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,039
so i guess to come back

2368
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,798
it's all of these problems aren't

2369
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:41,119
solvable on a grand scale

2370
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:42,880
but it's almost like by attempting to

2371
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:43,599
address them in our personal lives we do

2372
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,679
better

2373
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,719
but rather than a giant airing of the

2374
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,640
grievances on a

2375
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,079
on a consistent basis not that that

2376
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,119
isn't you know sometimes necessarily

2377
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:53,600
even valuable

2378
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:54,640
but after you air your grievances you go

2379
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,960
hey how about we

2380
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,159
sort this out what's the next step and

2381
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,079
and i guess again

2382
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:01,439
when we're trying to address it on a

2383
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:02,000
giant social level just seems

2384
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:03,359
unmanageable

2385
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,920
to me even if you have the best of

2386
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:06,639
intentions yeah i mean but nevertheless

2387
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,399
there's that

2388
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,320
there's a lot you can do on social

2389
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:13,039
networks i mean i i enjoy

2390
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:13,439
uh tweeting and consuming twitter it's

2391
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:15,198
just

2392
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:16,960
i apply the exact same principle that

2393
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:20,399
you just said which is a

2394
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:23,760
free will and discussion which is like

2395
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:26,000
i approach it in a way that

2396
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,360
i don't get stuck in this loop that's

2397
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,479
counterproductive

2398
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:32,639
i try to do things that are productive

2399
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:34,079
and like it's just like you said that's

2400
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,600
like uh

2401
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:37,439
like what kind of things can i do in

2402
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,480
this world whether that's tweeting or

2403
01:10:37,439 --> 01:10:41,119
building things

2404
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:42,879
those are low effort tweeting or

2405
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:43,439
actually building businesses or building

2406
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,239
ideas

2407
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:47,678
out as high effort what can i do that

2408
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:49,599
will actually solve problems

2409
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:52,079
and that's that's the way i approach it

2410
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,960
and i do wonder if it's possible to at

2411
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:55,679
scale

2412
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,198
encourage each other to approach like

2413
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,800
social media and communication with

2414
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:00,079
fellow humans in that way

2415
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,000
i don't know how do you think that would

2416
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:03,679
be done i guess like to improve the

2417
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,359
improve the quality of discourse maybe

2418
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,960
like even like you said the empathy or

2419
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:10,000
the the decency of discourse

2420
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:12,158
i think people should be you know

2421
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,039
incentivized encouraged to do that i

2422
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:16,000
think

2423
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:18,079
most of what's we see happening on

2424
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,198
twitter and facebook and so on

2425
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:23,119
has to do with very small but very

2426
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:26,079
powerful

2427
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:28,000
implementation details it goes down to

2428
01:11:26,079 --> 01:11:28,559
like what is the source of the dopamine

2429
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,960
rush

2430
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,400
the like button uh the sharing

2431
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,719
mechanisms

2432
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:36,079
just even small tweaks and those can fix

2433
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,000
a lot really

2434
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:39,198
i i believe so so like a lot a lot of

2435
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,119
the stuff we see now

2436
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:43,039
is the result of just initial

2437
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:45,840
implementations of these systems

2438
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:46,880
that we didn't anticipate so the

2439
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,079
monetization

2440
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:53,119
comes from engagement and the

2441
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:55,840
the tools we have is clicking like and

2442
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:57,439
sharing it was not always obvious it was

2443
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:59,360
not obvious from the beginning it wasn't

2444
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,000
obvious while the twitter and facebook

2445
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:01,920
grew

2446
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,238
that there's a big dopamine rush from

2447
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,560
getting more followers and likes and

2448
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:07,759
shares so we've gotten addicted to this

2449
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,440
feeling like how many people are

2450
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:12,320
commenting how many people are saying

2451
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:14,319
like a clicking like and so on so that's

2452
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:16,399
that dopamine right so we want to say

2453
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:17,679
the thing that will get the most likes

2454
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:20,238
on and

2455
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:21,199
like on mass in society and then the

2456
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:23,359
other thing that was

2457
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:24,319
expected is the controversial the

2458
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:27,359
divisive

2459
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:29,119
will get the most likes so we it had to

2460
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:30,399
do with the initial mechanisms of likes

2461
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:32,238
and shares

2462
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:34,158
resulting in an outcome that was

2463
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:36,799
unpredicted which is

2464
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:38,000
huge amounts of division irrespective of

2465
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:41,199
like

2466
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,560
any of the basics of human connection

2467
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:45,279
that we've actually all come

2468
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,320
to understand society is valuable at the

2469
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:49,279
individual level

2470
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:51,359
like we're saying but on mass what

2471
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:53,519
results is like you throw all that out

2472
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:56,719
and it's all just divisive

2473
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:59,520
at scale uh

2474
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:00,480
discourse uh i think it could be fixed

2475
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,880
by

2476
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:05,279
incentivizing personal growth like

2477
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:08,159
incentivizing you to challenge yourself

2478
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:09,359
to grow as individual and most

2479
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:12,559
importantly to

2480
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:16,319
be happy at the end of the day so

2481
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:19,360
uh feed like incentivize

2482
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:21,840
you feeling good as in

2483
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:22,960
in a way that's long-lasting long-term i

2484
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,199
think what makes people

2485
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:26,480
actually feel good is being kind to

2486
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:28,879
others

2487
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:31,198
long-term in the short term what feels

2488
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,279
good is getting a lot of likes

2489
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:34,559
and i think those are just different

2490
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:36,639
incentives

2491
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,239
that if implemented correctly you could

2492
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,800
just build social networks that would do

2493
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:39,919
much better

2494
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,440
so do you think it comes from a

2495
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,719
structural perspective i guess at what

2496
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:43,839
point does you mention like

2497
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,679
you mentioned free will and also you

2498
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,000
mentioned you know feeling good like and

2499
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:47,679
again

2500
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,840
working hard you know you i know that

2501
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:52,800
you have the uh i guess the

2502
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,920
was it a race or um no it's oh the the

2503
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,920
the goggins thing yeah

2504
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,920
uh it's 4x40 4x4 by 48 challenge where

2505
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,199
you run four miles every four hours for

2506
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:04,239
two days that's awesome

2507
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:06,000
yeah it's it's a bunch of it's it's uh

2508
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:07,678
the the the challenge of it isn't just

2509
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,158
the running the running is very tough

2510
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,920
but

2511
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:11,679
it's mostly the sleep deprivation rises

2512
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,719
you're just training every four hours

2513
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,079
but it's a struggle right

2514
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,719
and that's but the struggle gives

2515
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:17,359
meaning and ultimately i guess so how

2516
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,480
can we

2517
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:20,399
because you mentioned like you said

2518
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:22,479
adjusting things on like a uh

2519
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:24,079
i guess like a programming level almost

2520
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:25,519
uh based programming levels so that the

2521
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:27,198
interface is different for the user

2522
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,960
but at what point does the user have a

2523
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:30,799
responsibility to

2524
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,480
you know as a as a man or a woman or a

2525
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,960
person to just

2526
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,079
behave more decently how can we i guess

2527
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,640
utilize

2528
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:40,800
what can we do it seems like you know

2529
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,000
like our society is so grossly missing

2530
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,400
like a martin luther king right

2531
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,679
now like the great inspiring characters

2532
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:46,799
throughout american history throughout

2533
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,800
world history

2534
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,400
where are the great leaders so

2535
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,079
leadership is part of it but i

2536
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:53,599
you know that's definitely word the

2537
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:55,519
great leaders is a very good question

2538
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,440
that's that's more of a question of

2539
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,520
our political systems why they're not

2540
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:02,879
pushing forward the great leaders but

2541
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:05,040
there's also just uh okay

2542
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,719
there's uh some just basic engineering

2543
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:09,920
[ __ ] which is

2544
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:11,840
when you and i when you ryan and i are

2545
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,760
in a room alone

2546
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,520
and we're talking even if we're

2547
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,400
strangers the incentives

2548
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,880
are for us to get along like just when

2549
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,879
we're

2550
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,079
together in person that's what i'm

2551
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,560
saying i'm not even saying some kind of

2552
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:24,880
but

2553
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,120
when you remove that when we remove that

2554
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:30,000
the the the implementation of

2555
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:31,679
of the of social networks as they stand

2556
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,158
right now in the digital space

2557
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,239
a very different set of incentives it's

2558
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:39,359
more fun to destroy others

2559
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:41,759
to be shitty to others and

2560
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:42,399
that and it becomes this loot endless

2561
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,920
loop

2562
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:45,119
uh like you were saying that's

2563
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,960
ultimately destructive and not

2564
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:50,719
productive and i think

2565
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:53,198
it has to do with just the interfaces of

2566
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:54,239
uh making it feel good to be nice to

2567
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:56,960
others

2568
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:58,319
because currently it doesn't feel nearly

2569
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,520
as good

2570
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:04,639
to be nice to others on the internet and

2571
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,480
if it doesn't feel nearly as bad

2572
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,320
as it does in real life to be shitty to

2573
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,279
others on the internet so the incentives

2574
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,399
are just wrong

2575
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:13,198
i i think there is a technology solution

2576
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:16,319
to this

2577
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:18,000
or at least the solution to improve this

2578
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:19,759
uh this communication mechanism it's not

2579
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,600
obvious how a bunch of sort of more

2580
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,760
detailed ideas but

2581
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,440
this is fascinating because uh i've

2582
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,000
gotten a chance to talk to jack dorsey

2583
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:29,439
quite a bit

2584
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,119
this is the ceo of twitter and he is

2585
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:34,158
legitimately

2586
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:36,960
has you know in this conversation

2587
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:38,479
he would agree with everything and he's

2588
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,840
a good human being

2589
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:42,079
and he has a lot of really good ideas

2590
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:45,039
how to improve things the question

2591
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:46,800
when you're a captain of a ship whether

2592
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:48,880
even it's a question whether ceo is even

2593
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,760
a captain how much can you actually

2594
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,600
steer that ship

2595
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:53,280
once it's gotten large enough there's so

2596
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,039
much momentum there's so many users

2597
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:57,039
there's so many people who are marketing

2598
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:59,279
in pr and lawyers

2599
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:01,119
it's very difficult to change things is

2600
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:02,800
it difficult because of the

2601
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:05,840
fallout or is it difficult because it's

2602
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:07,920
actually like literally out of his power

2603
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,119
uh so power is weird when you have a

2604
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,279
large organization

2605
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:12,640
this is why the great leaders well this

2606
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:14,960
is what great leaders do

2607
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,079
whether it's presidents or leaders of

2608
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,640
companies steve jobs

2609
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:19,760
i would argue musk is that way is to

2610
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,920
walk into a room

2611
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,039
full of people who don't want you to

2612
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,000
create drama

2613
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:28,880
it's weird man when people just kind of

2614
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:31,520
want to be nice

2615
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:33,119
the niceness creates momentum and nobody

2616
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,719
wants to it's the systems thing

2617
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:35,119
everybody just behaves in the way they

2618
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,198
were

2619
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,719
previously behaving in the way they're

2620
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:40,799
supposed to behave

2621
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:42,158
and nobody wants to raise a fuss it

2622
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,199
takes a great

2623
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:48,238
man or woman leader to step in and say

2624
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:50,319
what we've been doing is [ __ ]

2625
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:51,678
okay you're fired you're fight you're

2626
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,639
cool what is it that right

2627
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:55,199
i'm out yeah i i think you have to

2628
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,520
create

2629
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:59,759
constant revolutions within a company

2630
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,840
that's very very difficult to do

2631
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,960
structurally and psychologically it's

2632
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,920
very difficult to do

2633
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,719
to to be able to sort of yeah to

2634
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,319
constantly

2635
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:10,480
challenge the way things have been done

2636
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:13,279
in the past and

2637
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:15,279
which is why another way it's often done

2638
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:17,599
is a startup like a small company

2639
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:19,840
basically a small company becomes really

2640
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,600
successful and then no longer can

2641
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,440
turn the ship so a new startup comes

2642
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,440
along right a new competitor

2643
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:27,279
that then challenges the big ship and

2644
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:28,879
then that starts out the winner that's

2645
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:30,639
like google came to be

2646
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,319
saw twitter came to be in facebook and

2647
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:35,119
so on and

2648
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:35,599
uh apple has you know that that was the

2649
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:38,319
dream

2650
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,640
of steve jobs as it would succeed for

2651
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:42,880
for many decades for like centuries

2652
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,800
that was the idea that you would keep

2653
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,719
keep creating revolutions and the under

2654
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,960
steve jobs

2655
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:49,760
apple successfully pivoted a bunch of

2656
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,840
times right

2657
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,199
just like reinvented themselves which is

2658
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,480
funny very difficult to do

2659
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:55,599
because i mean i've heard at least i

2660
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:56,559
don't know if this is accurate because i

2661
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,360
wouldn't know anything but i've heard

2662
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,400
plenty of people

2663
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:02,399
complain about steve jobs yeah but

2664
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:03,839
in reality the reason that all of these

2665
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:05,198
amazing things were done was because

2666
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,800
this person was willing to

2667
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:08,879
obviously brilliant and also willing to

2668
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,239
to rattle the you know rattle everyone's

2669
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,440
cage periodically and say hey what's

2670
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:13,519
going on is

2671
01:19:11,439 --> 01:19:14,799
not what we need to be doing that's a

2672
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,360
really interesting thing so he would

2673
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,239
rattle

2674
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:19,519
the cage but he would also i don't know

2675
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:21,599
if those are

2676
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,560
intricately connected or always have to

2677
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,640
be connected but he would just be a dick

2678
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,239
so maybe by my maybe by his standard i

2679
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:31,119
am lazy and worthless

2680
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:32,799
well this is he being a dick though if

2681
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:33,840
by his standard i mean like again it's

2682
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,800
like everyone's stupid compared to

2683
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,279
somebody

2684
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,039
you know i guess uh but at the point so

2685
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:40,960
you you apparently are able to take that

2686
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:44,319
kind of thing it's

2687
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:46,079
uh sometimes you just

2688
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:47,759
you cross there's there's ways to cross

2689
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:50,000
the line and i mean this is

2690
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,960
okay the the fascinating thing about

2691
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,079
being a leader

2692
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,359
especially leader of companies is it's a

2693
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:58,479
people problem

2694
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:59,920
so each individual in a room so

2695
01:19:58,479 --> 01:20:01,359
as a leader you're only really

2696
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,560
interacting with a small number of

2697
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:04,319
people because there are leaders of

2698
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,239
other smaller groups and so on

2699
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:09,519
but each of those individuals in the

2700
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:11,279
room have their own different psychology

2701
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,800
some like to be pushed to the limits

2702
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:16,158
some some like

2703
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:18,000
like to be screamed at some have

2704
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:20,319
are very soft soft-spoken and almost

2705
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,840
afraid to speak and they have to be

2706
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:26,158
uh you have to you have to hear them out

2707
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,279
like there's a and those those could be

2708
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:28,559
all superstars

2709
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:29,759
we're not we're not talking about like

2710
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,480
the c students we're not talking about

2711
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,079
the

2712
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:33,919
students well it's funny that yeah but

2713
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:35,519
the thing to me the skill to manage all

2714
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:36,800
of those people is completely separate

2715
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,639
from the skill to innovate

2716
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,159
something i mean not that they're not

2717
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:41,600
connected but it's funny how it's

2718
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:43,198
it's almost like uh you know why do we

2719
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,000
have shitty why do we have shitty

2720
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:45,919
representatives

2721
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,359
yeah well i mean the thing that you do

2722
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,000
to get elected has nothing to do with

2723
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:50,079
governance

2724
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,920
yes yeah also well that's exactly it but

2725
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:52,479
the the great leaders have to have both

2726
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,760
skills

2727
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:57,759
so like you have to have the boldness of

2728
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,520
maybe if you look at the great

2729
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:02,079
presidents through history

2730
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,960
usually in a time of crisis is when they

2731
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:06,719
step up

2732
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:09,439
but they basically say okay stop this

2733
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:11,119
old way that congress works of this

2734
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:13,439
bickering of this like

2735
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:15,840
compromise [ __ ] here's a huge plan

2736
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:18,319
that cost billions of dollars in

2737
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,239
today's age trillions of dollars no

2738
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:22,880
extra pork no extra additions

2739
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:24,638
just like here's a clear plan we're

2740
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,440
going to build the best

2741
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:28,560
road network the the world has ever seen

2742
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:30,238
or we're going to build some

2743
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,480
huge infrastructure project we're going

2744
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:33,039
to revolutionize internet or we're going

2745
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:35,279
to for

2746
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:37,119
coronavirus we're going to build the

2747
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:38,559
largest like testing facility the world

2748
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:40,960
has ever seen in terms of the

2749
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,000
we're going to get everybody tested uh

2750
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,760
several times a day

2751
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,198
all those kinds of things huge projects

2752
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,679
and say uh

2753
01:21:45,198 --> 01:21:49,119
[ __ ] all this uh the details that

2754
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:50,000
everybody's bickering about we're gonna

2755
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:51,599
give everybody

2756
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,198
uh two thousand dollars and give

2757
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,600
everybody three thousand dollars

2758
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:56,799
like huge projects and at the same time

2759
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,840
so that's the boldness and the

2760
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:01,039
leadership and saying

2761
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:03,920
throw out all the [ __ ] of the past

2762
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:04,639
and at the same time be able to get in

2763
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,480
the room

2764
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,159
with the leaders of both parties over

2765
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:10,399
the powerful individuals

2766
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:12,399
and smooth talk the [ __ ] out of them in

2767
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:14,879
the way they need to be smooth talk to

2768
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:16,319
so like both of those skills it seems to

2769
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,800
when they're combined in one person

2770
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:19,840
that's

2771
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,840
that creates great leaders musk appears

2772
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:24,800
to have that elon

2773
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,880
i don't know if steve jobs it's

2774
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,719
interesting so the criticism of steve

2775
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,480
and a little bit on elon is he misses

2776
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:33,279
some of the human

2777
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:33,599
part um but maybe it's impossible to

2778
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:36,238
have

2779
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:39,280
a really uh you have like signia nadal

2780
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:41,439
who's the ceo of microsoft you have um

2781
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:42,880
who's really good on the human side

2782
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:44,638
really really good on the human side

2783
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:48,079
like everybody loves them

2784
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:50,079
the ceo of uh google and alphabet

2785
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:52,880
is also the same way so like i don't

2786
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:54,960
know if it's possible to have both

2787
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,079
uh you only get so many stat points yeah

2788
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:59,198
yo

2789
01:22:56,079 --> 01:23:03,119
in this in this rpg of life yeah

2790
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:04,879
you got very good at jiu jitsu very fast

2791
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:06,399
so you want i mean you told the story

2792
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,279
blue belt and so on but you

2793
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:10,960
you went to black belt really quickly uh

2794
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:12,559
and not just in terms of ranks but in

2795
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,639
terms of just skill level

2796
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,239
i mean uh you didn't go to black belt

2797
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:18,480
nearly as fast as

2798
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:20,158
your skill set developed you were like

2799
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:21,519
doing extremely well at high level

2800
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:24,879
competition

2801
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:26,560
so you're a good person to ask how does

2802
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,400
one get good at jiu jitsu

2803
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:31,120
we talked about solving problems at the

2804
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:33,599
elite level but when you're a beginner

2805
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:34,639
at the at the martial arts how do you

2806
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,639
get good

2807
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:38,480
how much training should you do the very

2808
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,359
basic stuff like how much training how

2809
01:23:38,479 --> 01:23:42,479
much drilling

2810
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:45,759
okay and then the mental stuff like

2811
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:47,599
where should your mind be how should you

2812
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,360
approach it from a mental perspective

2813
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,600
too i'll just tell you my perspective on

2814
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:54,559
this one i guess i would say uh i feel

2815
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:56,239
step one i feel lucky to have found uh

2816
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,960
you know a good training situation

2817
01:23:56,238 --> 01:24:00,238
particularly

2818
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,279
for the time um you know in uh in where

2819
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:04,319
in where i was at

2820
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:05,679
and uh i drilled a ton um i

2821
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:07,920
drilled and drilled and drilled and

2822
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:09,359
drilled and drilled and um

2823
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,199
one one thing that's really important to

2824
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:14,479
understand though is that

2825
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:15,359
it i was able to in a relatively brief

2826
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:18,158
period of years

2827
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:18,639
you'll go from zero to reasonably good

2828
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:21,599
but

2829
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,159
um i think i probably crammed more hours

2830
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,520
in those

2831
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:27,599
small years than most people did

2832
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:29,600
training let's say in two or three times

2833
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,600
the length so it may not

2834
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,199
it may masquerade as something else

2835
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,880
other than it is i i could say

2836
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:36,799
you have to put it in the hours yeah

2837
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:38,319
there's no way around that i i think so

2838
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,079
what did you put in those out so when

2839
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:40,799
you said drilling can you break that

2840
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:42,719
apart a little bit

2841
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,000
like what what does really look like is

2842
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:45,198
there any recommendations

2843
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,198
absolutely step one i would say your

2844
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:48,719
choices matter like uh there's a

2845
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:50,158
i think that one of the really important

2846
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:51,439
things that i think we should consider

2847
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:53,039
about jiu jitsu is that there's a lot of

2848
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:54,079
junk in the system right now it's like

2849
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:56,560
jujitsu has

2850
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:58,399
exploded in terms of uh the number of

2851
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,920
positions techniques strategies this

2852
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:01,519
that rule sets

2853
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,158
that's really cool on the one hand on

2854
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:06,960
the other hand there's probably a

2855
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:07,679
just metric [ __ ] ton of sub-optimal

2856
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,760
things

2857
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:12,319
that are out there that are being taught

2858
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,679
um myself included i've taught things

2859
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:15,198
that are looking back five years three

2860
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:16,800
years two years one year or i'm like oh

2861
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:18,000
i would not do it like that anymore

2862
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,840
straight up sometimes i wouldn't do it

2863
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,158
like that other times i would literally

2864
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,920
never do even that particular movement

2865
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:24,638
um i don't think the shrimp is a real

2866
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:27,840
move

2867
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:29,199
uh it's like it's a giant spell it's

2868
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,480
easier to show in person but long sword

2869
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:32,479
of is there's a lot of things that are

2870
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:34,158
we think of as fundamental that i think

2871
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:36,238
that are uh

2872
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:37,920
really pretty negative and also you know

2873
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:40,479
um that's heresy and jiu-jitsu

2874
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,039
isn't it the shrimp exactly is like the

2875
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:42,879
holy

2876
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:44,560
we all worship the shrimp we love the

2877
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:46,480
shrimp we love the shrimp

2878
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,679
now for people who don't do jiu jitsu

2879
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:51,919
and you should

2880
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:55,520
the shrimp is uh you scoot your butt

2881
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:57,039
away from your opponent yeah in a room

2882
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,560
it's like a really athletic looking

2883
01:25:57,039 --> 01:25:59,600
position where you look like like

2884
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,800
someone that's trying to stick their

2885
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,400
butt out on instagram

2886
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,079
and then you push your hands away and

2887
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:07,039
you expose your face

2888
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:08,000
and then uh you lay on your side because

2889
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:11,039
someone told you to do

2890
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,119
that and you look like uh

2891
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:14,479
yeah i guess you look like a shrimp yeah

2892
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:16,158
it's like that time that uh you know

2893
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:17,519
someone really credible told me to drink

2894
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:18,158
unleaded gasoline and i did it for a

2895
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:19,840
while

2896
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:21,439
and then uh you know it got to the point

2897
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,880
in my life where you know the next best

2898
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:24,238
the thing that i needed to do to really

2899
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:27,279
improve my life was stop

2900
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:28,559
drinking unleaded gasoline yes and uh i

2901
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:29,279
would say that there's like a lot of

2902
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,400
stuff that's

2903
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:35,279
that's in there that step one is like uh

2904
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:36,079
it's junk it's actual junk and it's it's

2905
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:38,399
not only

2906
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:40,238
will it waste your time it's it will

2907
01:26:38,399 --> 01:26:42,000
straight up it will it will be like an

2908
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:43,678
albatross hanging on you

2909
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
because it affects how you think about

2910
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:48,560
things going forward so although um

2911
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,439
i it was it's funny like the operating

2912
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,800
assumptions that

2913
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:54,000
we we work under um have a huge huge

2914
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,440
huge influence you mentioned like

2915
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,359
growing up in the united states or this

2916
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:59,119
being a capitalist society like whoo

2917
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:00,319
all right now of course i think that i

2918
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:01,439
don't really know any different

2919
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:02,639
otherwise and i think that a lot of

2920
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:03,919
times people go oh

2921
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,760
communism is better i'm like i haven't

2922
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,719
seen it i haven't read any books about

2923
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,960
it were being better

2924
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:10,560
but uh it's possible i mean i haven't

2925
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,800
experienced it much myself either

2926
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:14,239
so i can't dismiss it out right but i

2927
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,800
guess i would say it's a fundamentally

2928
01:27:14,238 --> 01:27:17,039
different

2929
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,400
differing operating system underpinning

2930
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:20,399
and all of my choices

2931
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:22,559
all of if i honestly believed in that

2932
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:24,399
thing many of my choices

2933
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,000
on a moment by moment on a day by day

2934
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:27,839
and certainly on a lifetime basis

2935
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,079
would be very different so i would say

2936
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:31,920
that uh it's tough when you're

2937
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:32,960
when you're young in the martial arts

2938
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,319
and i mean all of us are always trying

2939
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,760
to do our best to learn but when you're

2940
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:36,799
young in the martial arts you always go

2941
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,760
if you're a reasonable guy

2942
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,960
what are they what they call it like

2943
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,079
dunning kruger amnesia i can't even if

2944
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,520
this is the right one but basically you

2945
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:43,840
go like oh i know what i'm

2946
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:45,440
doing here so i can say that's not right

2947
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,119
but then i read a new story

2948
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:48,879
about baseball only about baseball

2949
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:49,599
sounds incredible um and it's it's

2950
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,039
[ __ ]

2951
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,000
yeah but i can't call [ __ ] if you're

2952
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:52,960
a reasonable person you can't call

2953
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,479
[ __ ] on things that you don't

2954
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,439
understand even if you suspect it's not

2955
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:56,879
right you're like well i've got to

2956
01:27:55,439 --> 01:28:00,879
reserve judgment

2957
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:03,359
you never ever ever set aside your your

2958
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,560
need and also obligation to understand

2959
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:06,000
why you were doing what you're doing and

2960
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:08,480
don't ask why once ask why

2961
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,198
over and over and over and over about

2962
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:11,279
the same thing

2963
01:28:09,198 --> 01:28:13,039
oh well i want to shrimp why to make

2964
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:14,079
space why do i want to make space to get

2965
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:14,960
away from the guy well why do you want

2966
01:28:14,079 --> 01:28:16,479
to get away from him

2967
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,840
well because he's dangerous why is he

2968
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:19,119
dangerous and you can oftentimes get

2969
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,920
down to wait a minute i didn't even need

2970
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:20,880
to move

2971
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,158
three quarters of the time you're

2972
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,039
actually acting in the other person's

2973
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:24,399
self-interest and

2974
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:26,158
i guess a lot of times i can't this kind

2975
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:27,599
of goes beyond what we can

2976
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:29,839
you know demonstrate here but i would

2977
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,760
just say uh trying to understand

2978
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,520
what my base operating assumptions are

2979
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,280
and consistently reevaluate them which

2980
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:37,199
can be freaking exhausting frankly and

2981
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:39,039
also consonants confidence destroying

2982
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:41,439
but you mentioned uh that that i did

2983
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:44,399
pretty well relatively quickly i was at

2984
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:46,319
um i started in 2004 and i was at abu

2985
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:48,399
dhabi adcc for the first time as an

2986
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:49,439
alternate in 2007

2987
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:51,599
i won a match there against the

2988
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:53,439
blackpool world champion um

2989
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,120
and the fact frankly the fact that i was

2990
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:56,399
able to beat someone like that was neat

2991
01:28:55,119 --> 01:28:57,920
but at the same time says a little bit

2992
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:00,559
more about

2993
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,719
what jiu jitsu is and some of the issues

2994
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:05,760
with it than it does about how cool

2995
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:08,399
i am was because

2996
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,000
that shouldn't really happen when you

2997
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:12,479
think about it you're like okay you're

2998
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,158
a champion at ostensibly a very high

2999
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:17,198
level of the sport

3000
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:19,119
you enjoy a three inch four inch height

3001
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:21,198
advantage and a 35 pound weight

3002
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:23,198
advantage and you just got beat

3003
01:29:21,198 --> 01:29:24,799
like that should not exist i'm serious

3004
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:26,399
i'm dead serious that should not exist

3005
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,840
if that happens you're doing it wrong is

3006
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:29,839
it that i'm doing it right or is it that

3007
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,920
you're doing it wrong and there's enough

3008
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,600
variance in the way that you're doing it

3009
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:35,119
that you're allowing

3010
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,840
me to win and now i did happen to win

3011
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:38,479
that with a 50 50 heel hook which was 50

3012
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,800
50.

3013
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:42,079
but um but basically which was one of

3014
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:44,079
the early examples of

3015
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:46,000
like hey guys by the way people can try

3016
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:46,319
to hurt your legs and that was something

3017
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,920
like

3018
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:49,840
we mentioned john danaher mentioned like

3019
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,199
you know myself dean lister a lot of the

3020
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,639
guys from the enzo gracie team that have

3021
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:53,839
had amazing success they've gone and

3022
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:55,920
done great things

3023
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,880
um craig jones in the competitive

3024
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,960
grappling world

3025
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,400
basically taking advantage of being very

3026
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,960
very good in what they're doing but also

3027
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:04,559
a glaring glaring glaring issue with the

3028
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,359
operating system of jiu jitsu

3029
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:09,280
which was you know a huge vulnerability

3030
01:30:07,359 --> 01:30:11,439
in the lower body and not only not

3031
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:12,800
attacking it but having no idea how one

3032
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:14,799
does attack it which means you can't

3033
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,840
understand how someone will assail you

3034
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:20,400
so anyway um i guess to come back

3035
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:22,319
is if in the in the absence of knowing

3036
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:23,439
what to do i try to polish what i've got

3037
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:24,238
so if i've got a knife and i'm like i

3038
01:30:23,439 --> 01:30:25,439
don't know how to use them

3039
01:30:24,238 --> 01:30:26,879
okay i'm just going to sharpen the edge

3040
01:30:25,439 --> 01:30:28,479
and polish it make sure that when i need

3041
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,119
to use this to anything i'll be able to

3042
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:31,759
do it

3043
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:32,800
because trying to put together a system

3044
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,400
when you don't

3045
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:36,000
have an idea of what's going on a lot of

3046
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:37,439
times you end up making

3047
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,119
you know sub-optimal choices but as long

3048
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:40,158
as you're consistently re-evaluating

3049
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:41,519
what you're doing and that's something

3050
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:42,799
i've tried to do over time

3051
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,560
over and over and over again and try to

3052
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:48,639
seek out the uh

3053
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:51,760
the most um the best and also most uh

3054
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:53,279
um articulate or insightful instructors

3055
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,639
or people of various love it doesn't

3056
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:56,079
matter if they're well known or not that

3057
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:57,279
could say hey ryan i think you should do

3058
01:30:56,079 --> 01:30:59,198
this i think you should do that

3059
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:00,800
and i i think all i've ever done in

3060
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:02,158
martial arts is try to treat people with

3061
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,800
respect honestly

3062
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:06,399
try to demonstrate appreciation for the

3063
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,920
many many people who have helped me over

3064
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:08,960
time and be the type of person that they

3065
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,000
want to train with

3066
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:11,439
not the type of because we've all

3067
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,479
trained with people that make us think

3068
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:14,638
about beating the

3069
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:16,079
ever loving crap i never wanted to be

3070
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,760
that guy and i was basically saying like

3071
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:18,319
if i train with a black belt when i'm a

3072
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,800
blue belt

3073
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:21,439
and and this person enjoys training with

3074
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,279
me

3075
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:24,479
that's in my interest selfishly not only

3076
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:25,439
do i not want them to beat me up but

3077
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,559
selfishly i should

3078
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:27,759
you mentioned being decent to other

3079
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,120
people you want to incentivize being

3080
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,960
decent to other people right with the

3081
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:33,039
structure of what you're doing

3082
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,480
selfishly i'm incentivized to be a nice

3083
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:35,920
guy even if i'm

3084
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:37,678
internally a scumbag which i like to

3085
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,399
think that i'm not but basically uh

3086
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:40,079
going like hey

3087
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:41,359
this guy's way more likely to help me or

3088
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:42,399
this person's way more likely to help me

3089
01:31:41,359 --> 01:31:44,000
if i shake their hand

3090
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:45,839
say thank you i really appreciate you

3091
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,039
helping me out and uh but that thing

3092
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,840
that they tapped me with four or five

3093
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:49,359
times

3094
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,400
i'm gonna ask them about it and then

3095
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:52,079
they don't have to tell me they're under

3096
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:53,198
no obligation but i'll say and

3097
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:54,319
will they tell me you don't thank you so

3098
01:31:53,198 --> 01:31:55,839
much for your time i really appreciate

3099
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:57,679
it and uh

3100
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,960
that that's it you know okay so to

3101
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,039
summarize those so

3102
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,239
what you brilliantly described i just

3103
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:03,198
want to make sure we're keeping track i

3104
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:05,039
went all over the place

3105
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:06,719
just no you didn't you're you're pretty

3106
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:08,880
on point but uh so

3107
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:10,158
the first thing is basically which is

3108
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,279
difficult i wonder if we can break it

3109
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:13,519
apart a little bit

3110
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:14,639
is don't trust authority essentially

3111
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,320
keep asking why

3112
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:18,000
be respectful without trusting authority

3113
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:19,039
right right which is and then the second

3114
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,880
thing is be

3115
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:23,359
the kind of person that others like

3116
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:26,639
training with or like being around

3117
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:28,479
sort of uh being a good

3118
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:30,079
friend so so many people just enjoy

3119
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:31,678
being around so one is

3120
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:34,000
complete which is yeah you're right it's

3121
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,440
attention which is like completely

3122
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,399
disrespect the

3123
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:38,839
the way that things are done so asking

3124
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:41,599
why

3125
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:43,199
constantly one of it is your own flaws

3126
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,639
and not understanding the fundamentals

3127
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:46,479
of what's being described

3128
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:48,000
and then once you get good enough not

3129
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:51,678
understanding

3130
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,679
um like going against the fact that the

3131
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,359
instructor doesn't understand

3132
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:56,719
and my inability to understand what

3133
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:57,599
you're saying though doesn't invalidate

3134
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:59,119
it and that's something like you

3135
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,800
mentioned like

3136
01:32:59,119 --> 01:33:02,479
mentioning keeping in mind our own flaws

3137
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,920
and then also again the flaws that any

3138
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:04,959
of us have is the instructor to your

3139
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,960
point and i guess

3140
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,399
i can speak to being kind of weird i

3141
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,279
don't you know i like to

3142
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:12,479
sit in the corner but um so everyone's a

3143
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:13,920
little bit different some people

3144
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:16,559
you know i wasn't terribly popular in

3145
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,480
high school i you know like uh

3146
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,840
i don't like high school very much but

3147
01:33:18,479 --> 01:33:21,439
anyway yeah i would

3148
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,880
not gonna be rude to people though i was

3149
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:24,238
never gonna bully anybody

3150
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,840
if you said hello to me i'd say hello

3151
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:26,718
back i would hold the door for you if

3152
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,239
you walk by

3153
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:29,760
you know and i would just say like

3154
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:31,839
simple things like that

3155
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,840
go a long long long way and that

3156
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,520
actually takes us back to our uh

3157
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,279
um to our social discussion where i'm

3158
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,120
like oh man how do i become great at jiu

3159
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:40,880
jitsu it's like well i'll start by

3160
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:42,960
not pissing off this person who can beat

3161
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,840
the crap out of me and not disrespecting

3162
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,319
the person

3163
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,679
who is probably the clearest the closest

3164
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:50,319
thing to a font of knowledge

3165
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:51,600
at that time for me so and then

3166
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:53,198
recognizing that

3167
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,320
i should do that for its own virtue

3168
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:55,759
because it's the right thing to do and i

3169
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:57,840
should try to treat people decently but

3170
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,760
beyond that even selfishly

3171
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:02,400
it's in my interest to do that but see

3172
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:06,320
the thing is this this is interesting

3173
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:08,079
is there's a culture in martial arts

3174
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:10,399
a culture that i like where the

3175
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:13,920
instructor legitimately so

3176
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:17,519
carries a aura of authority

3177
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:20,719
and it's not comfortable to really ask

3178
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,600
why i'm not it's it's a skill to be able

3179
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:23,840
to

3180
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:26,079
have a discussion as a white belt with

3181
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:29,360
the black belt instructor

3182
01:34:26,079 --> 01:34:32,639
of like why is it done this way

3183
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:35,039
like and saying why again

3184
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:36,239
like with i mean it's a skill to show

3185
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:38,399
that you're actually

3186
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:40,158
legitimately a curious and passionate

3187
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:42,158
and compassionate

3188
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:43,439
student versus like somebody who's just

3189
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:45,519
being an annoying dick

3190
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:47,039
who saw some stuff on youtube there's a

3191
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:49,280
line between

3192
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:50,560
to walk there i i just wonder because

3193
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:54,079
like

3194
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:55,600
it's the drilling thing and you know i

3195
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:57,840
um

3196
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,639
for example like in my and when i was

3197
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,560
coming up

3198
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:03,279
there was so much emphasis placed on

3199
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:05,039
like closed guard for example

3200
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:07,359
and you might you might actually teach

3201
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:10,319
me now i i don't know

3202
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:11,759
but to me it was like why do i need to

3203
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:15,198
master

3204
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:16,719
the close like why is the closed guard

3205
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:19,198
on top or the bottom but the bottom

3206
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,079
really this is the fundamental basics of

3207
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:23,118
jiu jitsu

3208
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:26,399
who decided that my body is not

3209
01:35:23,118 --> 01:35:28,079
my body says this is wrong i'm like

3210
01:35:26,399 --> 01:35:30,079
this like i have short legs but it

3211
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:31,920
doesn't even matter the length of legs

3212
01:35:30,079 --> 01:35:33,920
there's something about me that just i

3213
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:37,359
don't understand how leverage here

3214
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:40,800
works for my particular body

3215
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:41,599
like so it's just it's a feel thing too

3216
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,960
like

3217
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,880
it feels like in my basic understanding

3218
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,920
of leverage and movement and timing and

3219
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,199
so on

3220
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,880
it feels like these certain like

3221
01:35:49,198 --> 01:35:53,039
butterfly guard or even like half

3222
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:56,159
basically every guard except close guard

3223
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:59,359
i i can play i can dance

3224
01:35:56,158 --> 01:36:03,279
closed guard feels like you're

3225
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:04,158
shutting down uh like the play that is

3226
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:06,000
that wrong

3227
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:07,198
or is that make sure that's what you

3228
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,198
want because that's almost like an

3229
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:10,638
innate characteristic of this guard

3230
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:12,638
position but it's not sold that way

3231
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:15,520
right it's like hey this is a good guard

3232
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:16,079
it's like hey man here's a bow and arrow

3233
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,520
versus

3234
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:19,359
and you know how to use this thing right

3235
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,880
like make sure you're you're far away

3236
01:36:19,359 --> 01:36:21,920
and like up on a hill or something

3237
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,480
because you could take that bone hour

3238
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:26,960
run up on something and try to use it

3239
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:28,399
but if nobody told you not to do that

3240
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,840
and they told you it's foundational it's

3241
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:30,879
very foundational it's very important to

3242
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:33,199
everything else too

3243
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:34,480
right that's back to the shrimping thing

3244
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:37,118
how many things are we taught

3245
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:40,238
that even if it's not let's say itself

3246
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:42,000
is not a garbage thing

3247
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:43,359
it might be effectively garbage you

3248
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,279
could give me a ferrari

3249
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:46,639
but if i try to make it fly it's not

3250
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:48,079
going to work

3251
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:49,359
if you're like here's a plane here's

3252
01:36:48,079 --> 01:36:50,559
another plane here's another plane

3253
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:51,519
here's another plane here's a ferrari

3254
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,400
i'm like oh it must be a different type

3255
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,239
of plane

3256
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:55,519
like you could be forgiven for leap if

3257
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:56,799
we're going there you know like oh maybe

3258
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,080
the wings come out or you just go fast

3259
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,760
enough it's like a bullet like you can

3260
01:36:58,079 --> 01:37:00,800
make these crazy leaps in your mind and

3261
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:03,440
people are doing that

3262
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:05,039
all the time so if you don't provide the

3263
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:07,039
context for me

3264
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:08,399
or worse yet you provide improper

3265
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:10,319
context like

3266
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:11,519
how how much of a problem is that going

3267
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:13,599
to be well

3268
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:15,520
i think the skill of the white belt

3269
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:18,560
should be just be nice

3270
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:22,080
but so in the complicated human space of

3271
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:23,119
when your intention at least on the in

3272
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:26,399
the big picture view

3273
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:28,559
is good there's the question is it's not

3274
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:31,679
always when your intention is good

3275
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:34,719
the actual implementation of it

3276
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:36,880
is good so you might be just almost

3277
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,319
and that's much it's not the case for

3278
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,118
you it's much more the case for white

3279
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:40,799
belts

3280
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:42,238
they don't even know their intention

3281
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,400
might be good but they don't know

3282
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:45,678
all the lines they're crossing all the

3283
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:49,198
right so they're not actually

3284
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:51,039
able to and like interpret all the ways

3285
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:53,118
in which they're being totally

3286
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:55,039
insensitive to the requests of others

3287
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:58,079
right explicit requests of others

3288
01:37:55,039 --> 01:38:00,719
so your job as a beginner is to be

3289
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:01,198
a really good listener of those social

3290
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:02,399
cues

3291
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:04,158
it's like a visit in a foreign country

3292
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:05,920
right yeah like you're a representative

3293
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:07,359
of people that look like you people that

3294
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,480
talk like you people that have your

3295
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:10,079
passport and you're like man i'm gonna

3296
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:10,559
go over here oh i've got my foot up on

3297
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:11,920
my knee

3298
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,480
well if i was in certain conscious world

3299
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:15,920
that's rude i'm like oh i'm so sorry

3300
01:38:14,479 --> 01:38:17,198
but can you imagine if someone says hey

3301
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:18,960
i really appreciate if you take your

3302
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:20,158
foot off that's pretty rude and then i

3303
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,359
want to tell them well not where i'm

3304
01:38:20,158 --> 01:38:23,759
from man

3305
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:25,039
i'm in your house i better again i may

3306
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,880
go that direction but let's say i could

3307
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:28,479
get away with that now i'm a bully

3308
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,239
and if i can't get away with that well

3309
01:38:28,479 --> 01:38:32,238
i'm about to maybe be on the wrong side

3310
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:33,759
of something but i i guess uh

3311
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:35,039
like you said if we have positive

3312
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,320
intention that's fine but i also have to

3313
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:37,760
recognize who i am and i think that

3314
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:40,158
that's one thing that

3315
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:41,440
i tried to do and continue to try to do

3316
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:43,920
over time like we're

3317
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:45,678

01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:49,359
frazza hobby i'm a student of tristar

3357
01:39:47,118 --> 01:39:50,319
i'm a guest in the academy and if for us

3358
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:52,238

3359
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:53,679

for us no man the noise and it's and

3364
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,119
hopefully it should come with i guess

3365
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,320
a level of graciousness but i guess

3366
01:40:01,118 --> 01:40:03,599
that's kind of one of the things that i

3367
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:05,039
see nowadays with uh

3368
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,800
how accessible people are because i grew

3369
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:09,279
up you know being a big huge

3370
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,800
sports fan of all kinds i couldn't send

3371
01:40:09,279 --> 01:40:13,439
derek jeter a message

3372
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,560
and and much less have a possibility of

3373
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:17,759
reply

3374
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:19,039
and if i do it's like you know i have

3375
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:20,000
people send me messages it's very nice

3376
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:21,519
that people say

3377
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,600
some people again and everyone not

3378
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:24,800
everyone is coming from the same place

3379
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,560
but i've had plenty of things they're

3380
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,360
like yo dude i need you to do this for

3381
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,560
me i'm like

3382
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:31,198
well i'll tell you what's never going to

3383
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,840
happen that i have no idea who you are

3384
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:33,678
and that was

3385
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:34,960
how i was addressed and i don't need oh

3386
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:36,480
man you're the greatest one because

3387
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:38,639
that's weird and two because i'm not

3388
01:40:36,479 --> 01:40:40,479
but just hey ryan uh how are you doing

3389
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:42,079
um hey if you think you could do the

3390
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:43,359
following if you get a second like

3391
01:40:42,079 --> 01:40:45,198
if i get a second you're dang right i

3392
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:47,439
can't why not it's easy ask but

3393
01:40:45,198 --> 01:40:48,719
it started with some level of politeness

3394
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:50,559
and i guess like that's

3395
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:53,279
maybe being semi-southern like i grew up

3396
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:54,880
in virginia yes sir yes ma'am like

3397
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:56,800
yeah well and there's all different

3398
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,359
kinds of implementations of politics i

3399
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,520
mean all

3400
01:40:57,359 --> 01:41:01,519
most of the successful people i've met

3401
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:05,360
it's been surprising to me

3402
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:08,320
how much of you you mentioned piers

3403
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:10,000
like the like i could think of joe rogan

3404
01:41:08,319 --> 01:41:13,599
you mentioned joe rogan but

3405
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:16,319
elon musk they

3406
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,440
don't like they almost treat me like i'm

3407
01:41:16,319 --> 01:41:19,439
the superior

3408
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:21,118
you know what i mean like it's not even

3409
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,359
it's it's that's the politeness

3410
01:41:21,118 --> 01:41:25,039
like you know that's the approach the

3411
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:26,960
feeling of it is like i'm the student

3412
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:28,158
i'm the beginner i'm like approaching a

3413
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:32,319
situation like

3414
01:41:28,158 --> 01:41:34,399
it's it's uh it's almost like uh

3415
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:35,599
method acting of like you're better than

3416
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:37,439
me

3417
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,960
that and that's how i approach a lot of

3418
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:40,319
interactions like i have something to

3419
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,039
learn from this even if it's like a

3420
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:42,639
young

3421
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:44,158
do you think that they're ungenuine

3422
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:45,679
they're totally genuine

3423
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:46,799
but it's not a funny thing like in spite

3424
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:48,319
of who they are they're incredibly

3425
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,360
genuine because they respect correct me

3426
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:50,479
from wrong they respect you

3427
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:52,158
obviously for what you bring the table

3428
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:52,638
but also they approach it everybody but

3429
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:53,599
that's right

3430
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:54,719
that was they were done but i'm sure

3431
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,679
they're respectful which means well

3432
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:57,039
beyond that though

3433
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:59,039
they're treating with dignity as a human

3434
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:01,198
being as a human being which is right

3435
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:02,639
people when they could probably get away

3436
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,919
with treating most people without a

3437
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,960
whole heck of a lot of dignity and i

3438
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:06,158
guess what does that always say that

3439
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:07,279
like you know again like you can always

3440
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:08,879
tell someone of of

3441
01:42:07,279 --> 01:42:10,238
you know of quality because they treat

3442
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:11,600
the king and the and the janitor the

3443
01:42:10,238 --> 01:42:13,759
same way

3444
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:15,280
but that's what we're seeing a lot like

3445
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,560
like that's i guess i don't mean to like

3446
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:18,399
to nitpick but that's where would

3447
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,400
take issue i guess a little bit or

3448
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:22,879
disagree with are you going to criticize

3449
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:25,198
the internet again i know people on the

3450
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:28,400
internet oh man yells it yells at clouds

3451
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:30,319
but uh but um anyway but i guess uh

3452
01:42:28,399 --> 01:42:31,679
what what i mean is just like the way

3453
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:33,279
that people address each other because

3454
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,639
it's so casual now yes

3455
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:36,158
you know and it's like it's great on the

3456
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,480
one hand it's nice on the other hand you

3457
01:42:36,158 --> 01:42:39,839
go

3458
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:41,599
hey i just why can't do am i

3459
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,880
somehow demand am i worried about

3460
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,079
diminishing myself it's like the way

3461
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:45,600
that i'm sure that people talk to like

3462
01:42:44,079 --> 01:42:48,960
talk to women sometimes

3463
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:49,440
and words yo what's up girl oh man she's

3464
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:52,158
[ __ ]

3465
01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:53,759
you know versus like how am i that was

3466
01:42:52,158 --> 01:42:55,920
supposed to get a good response

3467
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,280
what about that was going to elicit a a

3468
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,520
favorable response

3469
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:00,880
you know versus being anything anything

3470
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,800
other than than just

3471
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,400
yo man what's going on and i guess that

3472
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,600
does that make any sense it makes total

3473
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:06,638
sense and that southern thing that

3474
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,440
you're referring to i

3475
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:10,880
i feel like that's an important uh

3476
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:12,638
that's an important part of human

3477
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:15,440
communication

3478
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:17,760
let me ask you this sure your new back

3479
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:21,039
attacks instructional

3480
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,920
first of all awesome yeah uh second of

3481
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:24,800
all

3482
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:26,560
you drop you drop a lot of fascinating

3483
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:28,560
insights in there but you quote uh

3484
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:30,400
galileo out of all people

3485
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,239
and saying that you can't teach a man

3486
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:35,359
anything you can only help him

3487
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:38,238
find it within himself so

3488
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:39,599
we talked about how to start in jiu

3489
01:43:38,238 --> 01:43:42,718
jitsu

3490
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:46,400
what about if we zoom out even more and

3491
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:49,439
how do you learn how to learn

3492
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:51,599
how do you optimize the learning process

3493
01:43:49,439 --> 01:43:52,879
i i don't know the answer to that but i

3494
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,440
can tell you what i like to do and i

3495
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,679
would say

3496
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:57,039
like i can't step one i don't i'm not

3497
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:58,000
maybe this is a little bit easier for me

3498
01:43:57,039 --> 01:43:59,679
because you know i've

3499
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,960
i've never had a ton of friends honestly

3500
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:02,560
i've you know i've got my close friends

3501
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:04,158
and people that i know but i

3502
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:06,080
never had tons and tons of people so i

3503
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:09,439
spent a lot of time you know thinking

3504
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:11,118
and anyway uh yeah i can't

3505
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:12,559
i can't control you i can't control

3506
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:16,719
anybody else i

3507
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:16,719
you know i uh um

3508
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,239
all i can i want to take my i'll get

3509
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,359
some marcus aurelius thing it's like you

3510
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:22,879
know i guess the trick to life is

3511
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:24,238
figuring out what's in our control and

3512
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,840
what's not and focusing on things that

3513
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:29,118
are in our control i guess

3514
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:30,719
and uh so step one is figuring out both

3515
01:44:29,118 --> 01:44:32,639
internally and then also

3516
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:35,039
out in in the world as it pertains to

3517
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:36,719
jitsu what is actually in my control and

3518
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:38,158
what is not like passing someone's guard

3519
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:39,118
is not in your control people think it

3520
01:44:38,158 --> 01:44:41,679
is it ain't

3521
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:43,439
if i can't just do an activity and be

3522
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:46,560
unchecked

3523
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:50,479
then it ain't in my control entirely

3524
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:53,039
i can always breathe i can always um

3525
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:55,439
you know be calm i can always no matter

3526
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:56,719
whether i'm concerned or not concerned

3527
01:44:55,439 --> 01:44:59,118
whatever you want to call it nerves you

3528
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:59,840
know i can step forward across the line

3529
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:01,759
and say i will

3530
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,279
i will face the challenge ahead that is

3531
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,639
all entirely no one can stop me from

3532
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:05,519
doing that that's entirely my control

3533
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:06,880
and that's why

3534
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:08,480
i know that every single time that i

3535
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:10,000
walk into the ring i'll walk in and out

3536
01:45:08,479 --> 01:45:10,799
of there with my head of high because

3537
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,198
there's

3538
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:14,880
i will fight with everything that i have

3539
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:17,039
i can't promise that i'll win

3540
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,560
i would say i take that same first

3541
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:20,000
principles you mentioned

3542
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:22,560
the last time we talked you know with

3543
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,479
elon and the importance of that

3544
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:25,920
and going what are the first principles

3545
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:27,279
and i guess to come back a lot of times

3546
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:30,319
in my opinion the things that people

3547
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:32,000
think are the basics are not the basics

3548
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:33,279
you can't learn if you think you're

3549
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,039
reasoning for first principles but

3550
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:37,519
you're actually like level six

3551
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:39,198
you're actually like layers up you're

3552
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,719
making so many there's so many baked in

3553
01:45:39,198 --> 01:45:42,238
assumptions to what's going on that

3554
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:44,239
you're going to struggle to understand

3555
01:45:42,238 --> 01:45:46,158
why anything is actually happening

3556
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:47,759
internally externally you name it

3557
01:45:46,158 --> 01:45:49,599
so i guess what i would start when it

3558
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,960
comes to learning is first principles

3559
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,000
and trying to understand what's going on

3560
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,158
but then also

3561
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,000
simple things first i can control my

3562
01:45:54,158 --> 01:45:58,879
posture

3563
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,560
i can control my breathing no one can

3564
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,239
stop me from doing that i can control

3565
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,520
where i place my frames i can control

3566
01:46:02,238 --> 01:46:06,158
where i place my limbs

3567
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:07,520
i can move my feet i can develop the

3568
01:46:06,158 --> 01:46:08,879
ability to do these things better of

3569
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,400
course and i do that through practice

3570
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,840
through drilling through watching people

3571
01:46:10,399 --> 01:46:13,279
i've been incredibly fortunate in my

3572
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:14,079
time in martial arts to train with many

3573
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:15,759
of my heroes

3574
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:17,439
to train with many of the people that i

3575
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:19,199
looked at and i was like that guy

3576
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:21,279
is amazing i want to train with this

3577
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:23,279
person like stephen thompson

3578
01:46:21,279 --> 01:46:24,880
kenny florian george st pierre raymond

3579
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:26,319
daniels ferraza hobby

3580
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:28,079
you know i mean like bruno farzada

3581
01:46:26,319 --> 01:46:28,719
marcelo garcia you know all of these

3582
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:31,760
guys

3583
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:33,679
that are just unbelievable and i go well

3584
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,199
they're moving in a way that's different

3585
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:36,319
well how do i do that well

3586
01:46:35,198 --> 01:46:38,000
sometimes you can ask them and they can

3587
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:38,559
tell you directly other times people

3588
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,920
part of the

3589
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:42,080
genius of what they do is that it's

3590
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:43,600
intuitive and maybe they don't think

3591
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:44,880
and understand and see the world the

3592
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,800
same way that i do that was something

3593
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:50,159
that i experienced with marcelo

3594
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,719
he's amazing but in in a different way

3595
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:53,759
then

3596
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:54,000
his it just we see things fundamentally

3597
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:55,360
different

3598
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,920
we experience the world differently it

3599
01:46:55,359 --> 01:46:59,359
seems to me that we do um and again

3600
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,719
that that taught me a really important

3601
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:01,920
lesson because i was wanting when i

3602
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:03,679
trained there to have someone go hey

3603
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,880
ryan do this this this and this and

3604
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:06,158
that's how it works and i'm like all

3605
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:09,118
right because that's how i understood

3606
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:11,839
martial arts at the time um i wasn't

3607
01:47:09,118 --> 01:47:15,198
ready to have someone tell me like hey

3608
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:16,239
um it feels a little bit like this and i

3609
01:47:15,198 --> 01:47:18,399
just kind of do it

3610
01:47:16,238 --> 01:47:20,000
which is kind of what marcelo would do

3611
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:20,638
at the time he was less experienced as a

3612
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,118
teacher

3613
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:23,920
but that is what he was doing i was

3614
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:26,079
completely

3615
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,359
i couldn't separate in my mind

3616
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:29,198
performance

3617
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:30,319
and understanding i thought that if i

3618
01:47:29,198 --> 01:47:31,678
understand i could do it and i would

3619
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:32,960
also want to i would also struggle

3620
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:35,279
sometimes to

3621
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:37,118
wonder why i couldn't execute things

3622
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:39,279
that i thought i understood

3623
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:41,118
and why guys like marcelo were just so

3624
01:47:39,279 --> 01:47:41,759
elemental i mean in like the like

3625
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:43,198
lightning

3626
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:45,039
wind like that type of thing like it's

3627
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:46,399
just so in touch with

3628
01:47:45,039 --> 01:47:48,479
what they wanted with with their

3629
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:50,638
capabilities they could summon their

3630
01:47:48,479 --> 01:47:54,000
powers at will

3631
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:55,920
i couldn't always do that and i guess

3632
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,279
so recognizing that there was more than

3633
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,960
one way to the top of the mountain and

3634
01:47:57,279 --> 01:48:00,479
also i had a lot of science but i didn't

3635
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:01,600
have a lot of art or i had some science

3636
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:02,399
i should say but i didn't have a lot of

3637
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,079
art

3638
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:05,599
meeting people like marcelo taught me

3639
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:07,679
and then josh waitskin actually

3640
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:09,280
brilliant guy uh chess champion um

3641
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:10,719
former owner maybe owner of martial's

3642
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:12,319
academy really great friend i think he

3643
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,760
has a book on learning he does yeah the

3644
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:15,118
art of learning actually

3645
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,960
but uh yeah he knows a thing or two

3646
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:18,319
about it but a great guy and anyway

3647
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,760
he sat me down one time was like look

3648
01:48:18,319 --> 01:48:20,639
man you're you're doing this wrong

3649
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:22,239
you're missing

3650
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:24,400
what the missing the genius the

3651
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:27,759
brilliance that's right in front of you

3652
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:30,879
and it took me once i mean

3653
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:32,639
that i was frustrated with uh with my

3654
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,279
inability to grasp certain things and

3655
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:34,719
and sometimes

3656
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:36,639
uh the teaching style being different

3657
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:38,319
i'm wrong just it was

3658
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:39,920
it it was it was tough for me at the

3659
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:41,519
time you were trying to replicate what

3660
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,719
marcelo was saying as opposed to

3661
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:45,280
understanding the

3662
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:46,000
the the the fundamentals from which it

3663
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:47,759
was coming

3664
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,198
right i couldn't see i couldn't see

3665
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,800
where it was coming from and also

3666
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:52,000
sometimes i'm like well why can't you

3667
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:53,440
explain it in the way that i would want

3668
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,960
you to explain it and he's like well

3669
01:48:53,439 --> 01:48:57,359
why can't i meet him where he's coming

3670
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:57,920
from yeah so anyway it was a really

3671
01:48:57,359 --> 01:48:59,279
important

3672
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:01,279
time unless i'm very very frustrating if

3673
01:48:59,279 --> 01:49:04,238
i'm honest but it's not um

3674
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:05,198
i'm so thankful for that time and anyway

3675
01:49:04,238 --> 01:49:06,479
uh

3676
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:07,919
you know i i just always first

3677
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:08,559
principles trying to understand the

3678
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,079
basics

3679
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:11,679
first starting at the place where you

3680
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:13,599
can't control things

3681
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:14,880
the the very basic elements of what you

3682
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:16,719
can work with

3683
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,920
and then when there's other mentors and

3684
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:19,520
teachers to

3685
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,679
to uh meet them where they're coming

3686
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:23,440
from meet them to the extent that i can

3687
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:25,359
rather i'm not like again it's like why

3688
01:49:23,439 --> 01:49:26,559
are you not talking to me the way i want

3689
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:27,839
you to talk to me

3690
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:30,080
as opposed to hey where are you coming

3691
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,880
from back to your point yeah but uh and

3692
01:49:30,079 --> 01:49:33,118
i know that's not

3693
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,800
entirely specific but you know like if

3694
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:36,000
you can focus on that and back to the

3695
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,840
whole you can't

3696
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,840
teach a man anything marcelo didn't

3697
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:41,679
teach me anything but he taught me

3698
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,279
in so doing like and other and other

3699
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:45,599
people like that to uh

3700
01:49:43,279 --> 01:49:46,960
you know to find it within and it's like

3701
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:48,159
yeah i guess something else that i've

3702
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:50,079
heard before is that

3703
01:49:48,158 --> 01:49:52,079
all learning is self-discovery but all

3704
01:49:50,079 --> 01:49:54,000
performance is self-expression

3705
01:49:52,079 --> 01:49:55,359
and i always thought that marcelo was a

3706
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,079
brilliant master of letting what's

3707
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:57,759
inside out

3708
01:49:56,079 --> 01:49:59,599
he would he was so consistent in his

3709
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,880
performances and

3710
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:02,400
a lot of times i felt like there was a

3711
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,760
block there personally particularly at

3712
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:05,839
the end of jujitsu when i was very very

3713
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:07,920
results oriented and i wasn't

3714
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:09,039
i think i think my focus was was not a

3715
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:10,239
deal it was definitely not

3716
01:50:09,039 --> 01:50:12,399
not in the place that i would like it to

3717
01:50:10,238 --> 01:50:13,678
be and whether i would have won more

3718
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:14,719
loss more hard to say but i know that i

3719
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:16,800
would perform better if i'd have

3720
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:19,359
adjusted that and anyway uh

3721
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:20,639
that recognizing that again jiu jitsu i

3722
01:50:19,359 --> 01:50:22,079
think i've said it before just to study

3723
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:23,920
as a science but expressed as an

3724
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:25,439
art it doesn't matter if you can

3725
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:27,039
articulate what you know how to do what

3726
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:28,319
matters is if you can do what you want

3727
01:50:27,039 --> 01:50:29,760
to do it only matters if you're you know

3728
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:30,719
i guess if you're teaching in a verbal

3729
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:32,400
fashions whether or not you can

3730
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:34,480
articulate it but uh

3731
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:36,559
recognizing the difference between

3732
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:38,000
learning on an intellectual level or a

3733
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:40,320
conceptual level and being able

3734
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,520
to to translate that into the physical

3735
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:43,359
and i guess like that's been the thing

3736
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,719
that i feel like fortunate over time in

3737
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:46,238
my own academy to be able to kind of

3738
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:48,319
fiddle around and learn on my own

3739
01:50:46,238 --> 01:50:49,678
and practice my students and you know

3740
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:50,960
sometimes i struggle to have great

3741
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,279
training partners like when i say great

3742
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,880
training

3743
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:55,279
i mean other world-class people to spar

3744
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:56,639
to roll with but i've gotten a lot

3745
01:50:55,279 --> 01:50:58,238
more honestly than i ever would have

3746
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:00,239
thought out of being able to practice

3747
01:50:58,238 --> 01:51:01,198
and learn and fail and try and succeed

3748
01:51:00,238 --> 01:51:04,000
on my own without

3749
01:51:01,198 --> 01:51:05,359
like my own little sandbox um figuring

3750
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,158
out how i can take

3751
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:08,799
an idea and then come up with drills and

3752
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:10,638
and

3753
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,239
drills to practice it so that i can

3754
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:12,960
actually practice putting it into play

3755
01:51:12,238 --> 01:51:15,359
because again

3756
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,560
knowing an idea and then not drilling

3757
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:17,839
what's the point i'll never have it it

3758
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,960
will never it'll never see the light of

3759
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:21,840
day

3760
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,639
so in that dvd in that instruction dvd

3761
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:25,119
sorry

3762
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:27,039
it's an online instructional dvd i keep

3763
01:51:25,118 --> 01:51:29,598

01:51:33,039 --> 01:51:36,079
i mean like i've never watched them what

3768
01:51:34,399 --> 01:51:39,039
do you use them for like uh

3769
01:51:36,079 --> 01:51:40,719
like a couple like a cup like a thing

3770
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:44,319
you put a drink on

3771
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:44,319

01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:52,560
uh what's that even called

3773
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:56,639
uh yeah my uh matrix coaster

3774
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:59,119
the matrix goes to zeros and ones okay

3775
01:51:56,639 --> 01:51:59,679
uh so in that instruction that people

3776
01:51:59,118 --> 01:52:01,359
should

3777
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:03,118

yeah it's uh it's

3783
01:52:09,439 --> 01:52:12,479
it's part one you're actually like ended

3784
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:14,000
up being like 18 hours long and i was

3785
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:14,399
like oh my god we gotta chop it in half

3786
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,920
and it

3787
01:52:14,399 --> 01:52:17,279
it when it comes together the whole

3788
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:17,679
thing i think i hope people will like it

3789
01:52:17,279 --> 01:52:19,198
yeah

3790
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:20,880
well it's uh even part one is really

3791
01:52:19,198 --> 01:52:22,638
good it's actually yeah yeah

3792
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:24,159
people on reddit were really excited for

3793
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:25,599
part two as well really and you also

3794
01:52:24,158 --> 01:52:28,000
have a back

3795
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:29,840
oh the old one the old one that i that

3796
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,479
was really helpful to me to understand

3797
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:32,880
some

3798
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:35,519
very basic aspects of control really

3799
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:37,520
back yeah that was uh

3800
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,960
you know that clicked with me there's

3801
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:41,760
very few instructionals

3802
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:43,439
there's very few things i've watched

3803
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:47,360
that ever clicked with me and that was

3804
01:52:43,439 --> 01:52:50,158
definitely it uh he taught me

3805
01:52:47,359 --> 01:52:50,960
one thing i don't know it's uh you drop

3806
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:52,879
a lot of

3807
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:54,639
sort of bombs you drop a lot of really

3808
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:58,319
interesting details

3809
01:52:54,639 --> 01:53:00,880
and it's funny that there's only

3810
01:52:58,319 --> 01:53:02,559
specific things that really click like a

3811
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:03,840
lot of it rings true and you kind of

3812
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:05,280
take it in it's like oh that's

3813
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,639
interesting okay yeah

3814
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:08,639
but there's certain things that really

3815
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:11,279
click and i remember

3816
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:12,079
when that first uh instruction will

3817
01:53:11,279 --> 01:53:15,279
click with me

3818
01:53:12,079 --> 01:53:16,719
is like the importance i i don't i don't

3819
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:18,399
remember anymore like how you

3820
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:20,639
communicated it because i'm now

3821
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:21,679
integrated it's not mine you know what i

3822
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:23,440
mean uh

3823
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:26,319
but it was more about you just

3824
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:28,000
describing upper body control and

3825
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:29,439
the importance of the upper body control

3826
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,439
from the back

3827
01:53:29,439 --> 01:53:32,479
and just like the there's certain grip

3828
01:53:31,439 --> 01:53:34,719
like

3829
01:53:32,479 --> 01:53:35,759
the the you describe different details

3830
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:38,480
on the grips and so on

3831
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:40,159
and as i started trying it i realized

3832
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:44,000
how important

3833
01:53:40,158 --> 01:53:46,559
upper body control is versus like me

3834
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,760
maybe as a blue belt or something it was

3835
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:49,520
i thought like

3836
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:51,280
you have achieved victory when you got

3837
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:53,440
the two hooks in

3838
01:53:51,279 --> 01:53:55,279
and then i realized like at least for me

3839
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:57,519
that the hooks were not

3840
01:53:55,279 --> 01:53:59,118
even for my body type for my style for

3841
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:00,800
the way i approached things

3842
01:53:59,118 --> 01:54:02,319
they were not even important at all

3843
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:04,239
they're supplemental for the most part

3844
01:54:02,319 --> 01:54:06,238
yeah so they were there for the points

3845
01:54:04,238 --> 01:54:07,678
but i can establish a huge amount of

3846
01:54:06,238 --> 01:54:10,879
control

3847
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:12,319
uh in fact the hooks were

3848
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:14,800
you you were talking about like illusion

3849
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:17,279
of choice it's it's uh

3850
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:18,560
it almost made people panic a lot more

3851
01:54:17,279 --> 01:54:20,000
when you were like fighting for

3852
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:22,400
or establishing that kind of control

3853
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,719
they were a lot less panicked when the

3854
01:54:22,399 --> 01:54:26,079
hooks weren't involved even though they

3855
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:28,000
should be a lot more panicked

3856
01:54:26,079 --> 01:54:29,679
anyway i realized a lot of those kinds

3857
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,198
of things especially that had to do with

3858
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:33,920
judo because

3859
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:34,879
so much of judo on the ground is

3860
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:37,599
centered around

3861
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:38,560
aggressive efficient very fast choking

3862
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:39,760
like

3863
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:41,760
different kinds of clock chokes and all

3864
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:43,039
that kind of stuff what a brilliant

3865
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,400
thing that is only going to start to

3866
01:54:43,039 --> 01:54:46,238
make its way into jiu jitsu coming up

3867
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:48,158
but like the judo style approach to like

3868
01:54:46,238 --> 01:54:49,439
clock choking triangling from the top of

3869
01:54:48,158 --> 01:54:52,319
the turtle and stuff

3870
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:53,519
it's so powerful yeah and the the

3871
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:54,238
there's something about judo that

3872
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:57,280
emphasizes

3873
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:59,279
obviously due to the rules the urgency

3874
01:54:57,279 --> 01:55:02,079
so there you only do techniques that go

3875
01:54:59,279 --> 01:55:04,960
fast and then the other thing is

3876
01:55:02,079 --> 01:55:05,920
which i guess uh jiu-jitsu emphasizes

3877
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:10,079
too but judo

3878
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:11,920
really does which is um the transition

3879
01:55:10,079 --> 01:55:13,920
so like while the person's flying in the

3880
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:15,599
air is the easiest time

3881
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:18,639
i mean this is like ryan hall type of

3882
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:20,880
[ __ ] which is like

3883
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:22,560
why not put in your submissions or

3884
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:23,599
positional control while they're in the

3885
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,440
air and if

3886
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:27,279
well if you could why would you not

3887
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:28,479
right and say oh well i don't throw well

3888
01:55:27,279 --> 01:55:30,479
we'll learn how to throw

3889
01:55:28,479 --> 01:55:32,479
and then do it and so you should think i

3890
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:34,399
mean in a transition

3891
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:35,519
when they're flying is the easiest time

3892
01:55:34,399 --> 01:55:38,319
to put in stuff and that's

3893
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:39,520
when you think about jokes as you're

3894
01:55:38,319 --> 01:55:40,639
throwing you should be thinking about

3895
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:42,719
the choke

3896
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:44,840
and then everything becomes a lot easier

3897
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:47,920
you ever see flavio canto

3898
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:50,000
uh man brazilian judoka yeah it's

3899
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:51,118
so cool like with stuff like that yeah

3900
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,560
yeah exactly but

3901
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:54,799
but that has to do with the first

3902
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,280
starting principle of like

3903
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:58,000
stop thinking this as a two-phase game

3904
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:00,719
of uh

3905
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,599
standing and then ground start thinking

3906
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:03,760
about

3907
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:05,279
like the the standing and the the

3908
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,880
standing comes before the ground comes

3909
01:56:05,279 --> 01:56:07,519
after but everything happens in the

3910
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,039
transition

3911
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:10,480
well unless you're attacking what is the

3912
01:56:09,039 --> 01:56:11,519
art of war like every we all like

3913
01:56:10,479 --> 01:56:13,279
everyone's like oh yeah the art of war

3914
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:14,639
oh yes he says and then they immediately

3915
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:16,880
throw it away and then fight like a

3916
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:19,520
freaking barbarian but uh

3917
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:20,880
yeah i mean like i'm serious but uh you

3918
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,360
know how many people quote stuff and

3919
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,880
then

3920
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:24,399
like you know it's like what is it the

3921
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:26,079
family guy joke or they're like you know

3922
01:56:24,399 --> 01:56:27,039
quoting jesus then jesus walks in he's

3923
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:29,279
like you're not sure about work what are

3924
01:56:27,039 --> 01:56:32,319
you talking about and anyway uh

3925
01:56:29,279 --> 01:56:33,519
basically um you know like what like the

3926
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:33,920
art of war you know one of the things

3927
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,440
that's like

3928
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:37,039
the only thing that you can be sure of

3929
01:56:35,439 --> 01:56:38,238
being successful in attacking is

3930
01:56:37,039 --> 01:56:41,279
something that's undefended

3931
01:56:38,238 --> 01:56:43,598
yeah well like yeah yeah but you know

3932
01:56:41,279 --> 01:56:45,439
in a fight though they're defended well

3933
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:45,920
are they there's moments all the time

3934
01:56:45,439 --> 01:56:48,158
where i'm

3935
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:49,440
borderline defenseless and if you were

3936
01:56:48,158 --> 01:56:51,279
to attack at that moment

3937
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:53,198
if you could see it and then seize the

3938
01:56:51,279 --> 01:56:54,399
moment if you were capable of both

3939
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:55,439
you should not only expect to be

3940
01:56:54,399 --> 01:56:56,638
successful you should be damn sure

3941
01:56:55,439 --> 01:56:57,839
you're gonna be successful and more more

3942
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:59,039
important than that you'll be successful

3943
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,000
and even if you're somehow not you won't

3944
01:56:59,039 --> 01:57:02,880
be countered

3945
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,359
and i guess like uh that's the trick of

3946
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:06,079
almost

3947
01:57:03,359 --> 01:57:07,679
all all like conflict right it's like

3948
01:57:06,079 --> 01:57:09,039
showing up when the other person's you

3949
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:10,719
know taking a nap

3950
01:57:09,039 --> 01:57:12,319
and then it's so funny like we take like

3951
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:13,039
a protracted war it's like oh it takes

3952
01:57:12,319 --> 01:57:14,639
five years

3953
01:57:13,039 --> 01:57:15,920
and there's you know lulls and there's a

3954
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:17,199
battle this month but then there's a

3955
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:18,560
couple weeks in another battle it's like

3956
01:57:17,198 --> 01:57:20,559
well if you just shrink that down it's

3957
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:22,320
the microcosm macrocosm idea

3958
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:23,920
that same thing that whole war is taking

3959
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:24,719
place in five minutes or 10 minutes or

3960
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:27,039
15 minutes

3961
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:28,800
and there's moments of laws of person

3962
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:30,158
effectively going for a snack

3963
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:31,440
you know being like you know in a horror

3964
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:32,879
movie like hey guys i'm gonna go get a

3965
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:34,079
beer from the uh from around the way

3966
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:37,359
like i'm dead for sure

3967
01:57:34,079 --> 01:57:39,760
so anyway um is there in this particular

3968
01:57:37,359 --> 01:57:41,039
instructional if you can convert into

3969
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:43,679
words

3970
01:57:41,039 --> 01:57:44,399
uh you talk about finishing submission

3971
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:47,520
is there some

3972
01:57:44,399 --> 01:57:48,960
interesting insights that you find

3973
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:51,840
beautiful or profound

3974
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:53,198
about finishing the rear neck choke or

3975
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:54,159
just finishing the submissions from the

3976
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:56,319
back control

3977
01:57:54,158 --> 01:57:58,479
is there some like you know you talk

3978
01:57:56,319 --> 01:58:01,118
about the squeeze and the crush and all

3979
01:57:58,479 --> 01:58:03,759
these kinds of principles

3980
01:58:01,118 --> 01:58:05,679
is there something about control about

3981
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:08,480
the process of finishing

3982
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:09,359
that uh you find especially profound

3983
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:11,439
about this position

3984
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:13,439
absolutely the opposite of one profound

3985
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:18,000
truth can be another profound truth

3986
01:58:13,439 --> 01:58:18,479
so like uh it's i i i do uh did jesus

3987
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,238
say that

3988
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:22,238
no i don't i actually was a guy on

3989
01:58:20,238 --> 01:58:24,319
tumblr um but uh

3990
01:58:22,238 --> 01:58:26,158
yeah it was really really cool there's

3991
01:58:24,319 --> 01:58:29,759
like a like a tree in the background

3992
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:31,598
but anyway uh uh but so let's say like

3993
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:33,360
i'll use i'll use examples like first

3994
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:35,039
off um i i saw

3995
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:36,719
someone finishing a 50 50 heel hook in

3996
01:58:35,039 --> 01:58:38,238
the ufc one promo

3997
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:40,079
that it was like some chubby dude in a

3998
01:58:38,238 --> 01:58:40,959
karate key like inside heel hook and

3999
01:58:40,079 --> 01:58:44,319
another dude

4000
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:45,679
and you go huh well i didn't know they

4001
01:58:44,319 --> 01:58:46,639
were doing that back then at least and

4002
01:58:45,679 --> 01:58:48,960
whether they were doing it

4003
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:50,960
how many times did someone do something

4004
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:52,399
and then that works and then we go

4005
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:54,560
okay cool versus hey maybe we should do

4006
01:58:52,399 --> 01:58:56,399
that all the time so anyway how long do

4007
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:58,080
we all talk to the seat belt the way we

4008
01:58:56,399 --> 01:59:00,559
all do the seat belt in jiu jitsu

4009
01:58:58,079 --> 01:59:02,719
like a long time why works in fact it

4010
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:04,560
works so well

4011
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:06,239
and it was so it was then the people who

4012
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:08,960
used it were so prolific

4013
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:10,000
that we went well solved that one good

4014
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:12,239
to go

4015
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
all right no more thinking and then you

4016
01:59:12,238 --> 01:59:14,799
go imagine you were to like the merkel

4017
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,079
and merkel flip

4018
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:17,520
all those positions that we're showing

4019
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:18,880
in the uh in the dvd which is pretty

4020
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:20,800
much or the whatever the heck it is i

4021
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:24,319
don't know the digital

4022
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:26,320
vd um no not vd i don't want that

4023
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:27,599
digital digital video something but

4024
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:29,679
basically uh

4025
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:31,039
recognizing that doing it on the wrong

4026
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:33,279
side

4027
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:34,800
is at least as effective doesn't mean

4028
01:59:33,279 --> 01:59:36,079
that the other side wasn't good

4029
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:38,320
there could be something that's the

4030
01:59:36,079 --> 01:59:42,479
literal borderline opposite of that

4031
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:44,399
and you go huh why is that something

4032
01:59:42,479 --> 01:59:45,678
like imagine like i would say almost all

4033
01:59:44,399 --> 01:59:46,879
of these things all the tactics and all

4034
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:48,079
the strategies so i guess that was

4035
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:50,560
something that we came to

4036
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:51,920
like training in the gym like a year ago

4037
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:53,119
maybe i've been playing with since and

4038
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:53,920
it's just it's huge i'm like oh wait so

4039
01:59:53,118 --> 01:59:55,359
let me get this straight

4040
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:57,359
first if i can use my strong side seat

4041
01:59:55,359 --> 01:59:59,039
belt my right arm over the shoulder any

4042
01:59:57,359 --> 02:00:00,079
all the time well that's that's really

4043
01:59:59,039 --> 02:00:01,439
helpful because that's a lot better than

4044
02:00:00,079 --> 02:00:02,158
my left i can do both sides of my left

4045
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:03,598
but if i had to

4046
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:05,679
bet my life on on being able to finish

4047
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:07,599
it i would want my right arm over huh

4048
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:09,359
everything that's a tactic or a strategy

4049
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:10,319
evolved from an idea like capitalism is

4050
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:12,079
an idea

4051
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:13,519
you know anarchy is an idea and then it

4052
02:00:12,079 --> 02:00:14,559
becomes what does that all mean what are

4053
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:16,000
they what are the consequences what's

4054
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:19,119
the fallout of all this right

4055
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,880
so what if we start with jiu jitsu the

4056
02:00:19,118 --> 02:00:22,319
idea of the guard right and we go well

4057
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:24,159
i mean wendy why do you use the guard

4058
02:00:22,319 --> 02:00:25,439
nor the martial art really has developed

4059
02:00:24,158 --> 02:00:26,960
the guard

4060
02:00:25,439 --> 02:00:28,238
in the same way the jiu jitsu has well

4061
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,760
what is the guard a guards are not a

4062
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:30,559
defensive idea where you're kind of on

4063
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:32,079
your back

4064
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:33,679
to some extent or another and you're

4065
02:00:32,079 --> 02:00:34,319
using your legs as a wall between you

4066
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:35,440
and

4067
02:00:34,319 --> 02:00:36,639
the other person and the other guy

4068
02:00:35,439 --> 02:00:38,158
represents danger and you're like yeah

4069
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:40,400
that's a great idea

4070
02:00:38,158 --> 02:00:41,439
is it i mean it clearly works at least

4071
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:43,198
to a certain extent

4072
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:44,879
but what where do i want to put my legs

4073
02:00:43,198 --> 02:00:46,000
when i want to get up

4074
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:47,840
not on the other dude i'm trying to put

4075
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,439
them on things on the floor if i want to

4076
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:50,960
generate a ton of power

4077
02:00:49,439 --> 02:00:52,799
what's the first thing i do with my feet

4078
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:54,319
i anchor them to the floor drive for a

4079
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:56,960
punch you name it move away

4080
02:00:54,319 --> 02:00:58,799
jump dart yeah you name it so does it

4081
02:00:56,960 --> 02:00:59,359
mean that that's a terrible idea to be

4082
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:01,840
on your back

4083
02:00:59,359 --> 02:01:03,118
no clearly it works and clearly it limit

4084
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:04,400
face has function

4085
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:06,079
but what if the function that we're

4086
02:01:04,399 --> 02:01:08,238
giving it and we're and the how much how

4087
02:01:06,079 --> 02:01:10,880
much focus we're assigning to it

4088
02:01:08,238 --> 02:01:12,959
is disproportionate to its effectiveness

4089
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:14,239
yeah maybe what if it's not a good idea

4090
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,079
i'm not saying it's not a good idea but

4091
02:01:14,238 --> 02:01:17,919
what if it wasn't that's a foundational

4092
02:01:16,079 --> 02:01:20,158
idea of jiu-jitsu and then how much

4093
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:22,000
because no one questions that foundation

4094
02:01:20,158 --> 02:01:23,920
how much innovation is built on

4095
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,439
top of the idea well of course i want to

4096
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:27,118
be my being on my back is an okay

4097
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:28,638
position so now they're innovating

4098
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:29,839
but they're innovating within a closed

4099
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:30,719
system that they don't they think

4100
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:32,800
they're innovating

4101
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:34,239
in like in this open space of oh my god

4102
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:35,520
it could be anything when in reality

4103
02:01:34,238 --> 02:01:37,118
it could be anything within this little

4104
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:38,239
set yeah but you don't realize that

4105
02:01:37,118 --> 02:01:39,359
you're in a set you don't realize that

4106
02:01:38,238 --> 02:01:40,799
you're in a box

4107
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:42,479
there would be answers that would become

4108
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:44,239
so immediately apparent to you

4109
02:01:42,479 --> 02:01:45,519
if you were willing to look outside of

4110
02:01:44,238 --> 02:01:46,959
that but you'll

4111
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:48,960
literally never even look over to your

4112
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:49,359
left because you don't even realize the

4113
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:50,800
left

4114
02:01:49,359 --> 02:01:52,799
exists do you think there's a lot of

4115
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:54,800
places in jiu jitsu whether it's back

4116
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:55,840
control or generally guards and all the

4117
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:58,960
different positions

4118
02:01:55,840 --> 02:02:02,159
where there's a lot of space like

4119
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:04,079
a lot a lot to be discovered by

4120
02:02:02,158 --> 02:02:05,679
questioning the basic assumptions maybe

4121
02:02:04,079 --> 02:02:06,960
if you can give examples of like back

4122
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:08,000
control like is there something you've

4123
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:10,719
discovered this like

4124
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,238
merkel versus seatbelt what's miracle

4125
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:13,039
seatbelt is uh right arm over the

4126
02:02:12,238 --> 02:02:15,678
shoulder

4127
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:17,519
left arm under the arm on i'm on the i'm

4128
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:19,199
on the same side as my choking arm

4129
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:21,280
merkel is just i do the same thing i

4130
02:02:19,198 --> 02:02:22,319
don't even adjust my hands i walk myself

4131
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:23,359
over to the left side i'm on the

4132
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:24,719
opposite side it's actually a more

4133
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:26,079
powerful position yeah for people

4134
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:29,359
listening or for people who

4135
02:02:26,079 --> 02:02:31,359
might not know jiu jitsu is uh seatbelt

4136
02:02:29,359 --> 02:02:33,359
is a control we're talking about when

4137
02:02:31,359 --> 02:02:33,920
one person is on the back of another

4138
02:02:33,359 --> 02:02:35,519
person

4139
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:37,599
which is a really dominant position jiu

4140
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:40,719
jitsu sea belt is a

4141
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:42,480
i guess widely accepted

4142
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:44,480
way of holding best practices almost

4143
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:45,118
best practices yeah and it's worked so

4144
02:02:44,479 --> 02:02:49,039
well

4145
02:02:45,118 --> 02:02:50,639
so it's a one arm over one arm under

4146
02:02:49,039 --> 02:02:52,319
and there's a certain side you're

4147
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:53,679
supposed to be on

4148
02:02:52,319 --> 02:02:55,840
when you're on the back you know

4149
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:57,359
everyone teaches there's a choking arm

4150
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:58,800
that's the arm that's over

4151
02:02:57,359 --> 02:03:00,960
and your body is supposed to be in a

4152
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:03,920
certain side relative to that

4153
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:04,880
and then ryan is describing questioning

4154
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:06,800
these like

4155
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:07,920
basic assumptions about which side

4156
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:09,199
you're supposed to be on and let's say

4157
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:10,319
that's even just like a mid-level

4158
02:03:09,198 --> 02:03:11,439
assumption it's not even a first

4159
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:13,279
principles assumption

4160
02:03:11,439 --> 02:03:14,879
but it's pretty supposed to it's getting

4161
02:03:13,279 --> 02:03:16,800
there but but let's just say for

4162
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:18,159
sake of argument it goes a lot deeper

4163
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:19,920
maybe um

4164
02:03:18,158 --> 02:03:21,679
i think most of the innovation that i

4165
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:23,760
see is not innovation

4166
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:24,800
it's like basically changing the color

4167
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:26,880
of a car

4168
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:28,480
or polishing like the window a little

4169
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:29,840
bit we're like hey you made it you made

4170
02:03:28,479 --> 02:03:30,718
it a little bit different you made it a

4171
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:32,319
little bit better

4172
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:33,920
it's like oh man what if i did the same

4173
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:35,679
guard and then grab the lapel

4174
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:37,359
i'm not saying it's bad but you're not

4175
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:39,199
fundamentally changing anything i think

4176
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:41,279
most of the big seismic shifts that we

4177
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:44,238
see in almost anything come from

4178
02:03:41,279 --> 02:03:45,439
hey that thing we thought was right was

4179
02:03:44,238 --> 02:03:47,919
wrong rather than

4180
02:03:45,439 --> 02:03:49,039
not only is it right it's even writer

4181
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:50,158
and you're like that's not wrong it's

4182
02:03:49,039 --> 02:03:52,078
not bad but that's

4183
02:03:50,158 --> 02:03:53,039
you're in it's like oh man let's say for

4184
02:03:52,078 --> 02:03:54,238
instance i didn't make the triangle

4185
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:55,760
better but let's say i made the triangle

4186
02:03:54,238 --> 02:03:59,198
a little bit better than it was or

4187
02:03:55,760 --> 02:04:00,560
then it was taught um yeah i mean you

4188
02:03:59,198 --> 02:04:02,078
call it innovation i don't know man it's

4189
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:03,520
not like the person that said hey have

4190
02:04:02,078 --> 02:04:05,039
you guys ever heard of a triangle before

4191
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:06,480
and came up with that we're like that is

4192
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:07,760
i feel like that's that's on the list

4193
02:04:06,479 --> 02:04:10,078
you can do this thing to people are you

4194
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:11,840
kidding me can you imagine you invented

4195
02:04:10,078 --> 02:04:13,198
the straight right hand you'd be like

4196
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,520
one punch man you can walk around and

4197
02:04:13,198 --> 02:04:15,439
just

4198
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:16,719
just lay low every single person you got

4199
02:04:15,439 --> 02:04:18,158
into a fight with because it didn't even

4200
02:04:16,719 --> 02:04:20,239
occur to them to hit you

4201
02:04:18,158 --> 02:04:22,078
with their backhand in a world full of

4202
02:04:20,238 --> 02:04:24,319
jabbers you throw your back hand

4203
02:04:22,078 --> 02:04:25,599
you're gonna kill people so basically

4204
02:04:24,319 --> 02:04:27,439
but by the way i mean

4205
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:28,960
just to pause on that that first of all

4206
02:04:27,439 --> 02:04:30,078
somebody did invent the triangle

4207
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:32,158
probably right sure

4208
02:04:30,078 --> 02:04:34,000
it's not a trivial thing once it's like

4209
02:04:32,158 --> 02:04:35,598
no it's how many of these giant

4210
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,279
things that we all go like oh yeah we

4211
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:38,960
all use that now can you imagine you

4212
02:04:37,279 --> 02:04:41,519
have triangles and heel hooks and rear

4213
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:42,800
naked chokes and i don't have those

4214
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:44,320
you're on b you're borderline i mean

4215
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:45,279
like that's that's why that's we all

4216
02:04:44,319 --> 02:04:46,399
experience every single one of this

4217
02:04:45,279 --> 02:04:47,840
particularly those of us i mean when did

4218
02:04:46,399 --> 02:04:51,359
you first start training likes

4219
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:53,039
uh 12 13 years well let's not count

4220
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:54,479
wrestling but 13 years ago with

4221
02:04:53,039 --> 02:04:55,439
jiu-jitsu right on so let's say

4222
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:56,959
let's say about that time where

4223
02:04:55,439 --> 02:04:58,000
particularly was still like kind of kind

4224
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:59,599
of underground-y

4225
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,198
you know and you're like hey we all

4226
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:03,840
experienced being like a

4227
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:05,519
relative like a mid-level wipeout and

4228
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:06,159
being able to easily beat up all our

4229
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,280
friends

4230
02:05:06,158 --> 02:05:08,719
because everyone wrestled all their

4231
02:05:07,279 --> 02:05:09,198
buddies and it was one of those ones

4232
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:11,599
where like

4233
02:05:09,198 --> 02:05:13,759
they don't have weapons to end the fight

4234
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:16,319
you have weapons to end the fight

4235
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:17,599
that's so cool that's such a crazy you

4236
02:05:16,319 --> 02:05:21,359
know asymmetric

4237
02:05:17,599 --> 02:05:22,960
advantage that if you lose it's on you

4238
02:05:21,359 --> 02:05:25,118
now man like you get like you had the

4239
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:26,560
next time it's like i've got this rifle

4240
02:05:25,118 --> 02:05:27,839
and you have nothing and i decide to put

4241
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:29,760
it on my back and then run over and try

4242
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:31,119
to karate chop you're like okay

4243
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:32,800
next time just make sure you use the

4244
02:05:31,118 --> 02:05:33,279
rifle bud i'm like oh yeah i should do

4245
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:35,199
that

4246
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:37,439
so yeah it's kind of fascinating to i

4247
02:05:35,198 --> 02:05:39,439
mean everything you're describing

4248
02:05:37,439 --> 02:05:41,118
is a there's a fascinating tension

4249
02:05:39,439 --> 02:05:42,638
between like whenever i show people for

4250
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:44,319
the first time what a triangle is just

4251
02:05:42,639 --> 02:05:46,319
like regular people

4252
02:05:44,319 --> 02:05:48,078
uh it's like they're discovering he's

4253
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:49,759
like oh okay that's interesting i mean

4254
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:51,439
mma has changed that but people have

4255
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:52,880
haven't watched mma

4256
02:05:51,439 --> 02:05:54,719
that's an interesting move it doesn't

4257
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:58,159
make sense why that would be a choke

4258
02:05:54,719 --> 02:06:00,880
and they kind of quickly accepted that's

4259
02:05:58,158 --> 02:06:02,479
a thing and they accept the basics

4260
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:04,560
without questioning

4261
02:06:02,479 --> 02:06:06,718
wait a minute what's actually being

4262
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:10,480
choked

4263
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:13,840
how is it that a shoulder of a person

4264
02:06:10,479 --> 02:06:14,638
can do the choking like i'm not sure i

4265
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:16,639
fully

4266
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:18,560
question the fundamentals of all of that

4267
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:21,199
like i claim i have either what exactly

4268
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:23,199
is the blood supply that's being cut off

4269
02:06:21,198 --> 02:06:24,799
like what what is the anatomy and the

4270
02:06:23,198 --> 02:06:26,319
physiology of all of that why does this

4271
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:28,079
work and if you understood all that what

4272
02:06:26,319 --> 02:06:29,439
else could we do here yeah what else can

4273
02:06:28,078 --> 02:06:31,439
we do here that's the really important

4274
02:06:29,439 --> 02:06:32,799
thing but if we know if i'm an end user

4275
02:06:31,439 --> 02:06:34,719
which almost everyone is of almost

4276
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:35,840
anything i'm serious where i'm like i

4277
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:37,118
think about stuff in my life the only

4278
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:38,000
things i really think about are like

4279
02:06:37,118 --> 02:06:40,000
martial arts and

4280
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,118
martial arts strategy and like i don't

4281
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,359
know some other couple

4282
02:06:41,118 --> 02:06:44,639
couple other things but not much and

4283
02:06:43,359 --> 02:06:46,319
anything else in my life is

4284
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:47,760
is borderline unexamined and i like to

4285
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:49,039
think that if i put a lot of effort into

4286
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:50,560
something i'd like to think that i could

4287
02:06:49,039 --> 02:06:52,158
figure at least some things out about it

4288
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:53,520
but i figured out almost nothing about

4289
02:06:52,158 --> 02:06:54,638
anything in my life because i haven't

4290
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:56,800
even looked

4291
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:57,760
and you know if you're an end user what

4292
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:59,599
are you capable of

4293
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:02,239
versus you can literally alter the

4294
02:06:59,599 --> 02:07:04,078
source code you are neo in the freaking

4295
02:07:02,238 --> 02:07:04,718
matrix if you can alter the code and i

4296
02:07:04,078 --> 02:07:07,198
can't

4297
02:07:04,719 --> 02:07:08,000
and it's like we think about haha but

4298
02:07:07,198 --> 02:07:10,879
imagine you

4299
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,319
are a world class anything or even not

4300
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:13,679
even world class forget it like a purple

4301
02:07:12,319 --> 02:07:15,279
belt compared to a white belt or

4302
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:16,880
compared to a no belt might as well be

4303
02:07:15,279 --> 02:07:18,800
jon jones or marcelo garcia you're going

4304
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:21,199
to beat them up comparably bed

4305
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:22,480
so it's uh that's that actually is a

4306
02:07:21,198 --> 02:07:23,359
common thing where people can't tell the

4307
02:07:22,479 --> 02:07:24,559
difference between levels they're like

4308
02:07:23,359 --> 02:07:25,839
oh man i'm training with my black belt

4309
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:27,840
instructor how much better could so and

4310
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:29,119
so be like

4311
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:30,239
so much better you're gonna have a hard

4312
02:07:29,118 --> 02:07:31,198
time wrapping your head around it i

4313
02:07:30,238 --> 02:07:33,279
remember when i first trained with

4314
02:07:31,198 --> 02:07:34,238
marcelo garcia in 2007 i was a decent

4315
02:07:33,279 --> 02:07:35,759
purple belt

4316
02:07:34,238 --> 02:07:38,000
and of course he molly walked me very

4317
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:39,119
gently and then uh training him again in

4318
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,118
2008

4319
02:07:39,118 --> 02:07:42,880
i was definitely better i won the gui

4320
02:07:41,118 --> 02:07:44,158
and nogi worlds that year at purple belt

4321
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:45,359
so definitely for the record i'm

4322
02:07:44,158 --> 02:07:46,799
definitely not a jujitsu world champion

4323
02:07:45,359 --> 02:07:48,399
i wanted a purple belt but like that's

4324
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:50,719
not the same at winning a black belt

4325
02:07:48,399 --> 02:07:51,759
um and uh tough accomplishment but not

4326
02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:54,880
in the same thing at all

4327
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,920
but anyway um i was definitely better he

4328
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:59,760
beat me up just the same

4329
02:07:55,920 --> 02:08:01,359
way okay 2009. i was a lot better got a

4330
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:03,840
medal at adcc that time

4331
02:08:01,359 --> 02:08:05,759
won the trials crushed everybody like no

4332
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:09,760
just submitted everybody like

4333
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:12,800
bob train marcelo garcia it was worse

4334
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:13,280
and uh 2010 training marcelo garcia same

4335
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:16,639
same

4336
02:08:13,279 --> 02:08:17,920
so the idea was uh i wouldn't be able to

4337
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:19,840
tell you the difference and

4338
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,960
that the outcome difference was the same

4339
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:22,800
in all of these rounds i was

4340
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:24,800
significantly more experienced and more

4341
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:25,920
more adept each time each time that this

4342
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:27,599
occurred but it was like

4343
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:28,719
how many number of times did this person

4344
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:29,920
submit you were past your guard in the

4345
02:08:28,719 --> 02:08:31,439
round i'm like i don't know probably

4346
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:31,679
like let's say five each one because

4347
02:08:31,439 --> 02:08:33,198
it's

4348
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:34,639
a brief period of time and let's say it

4349
02:08:33,198 --> 02:08:34,960
was three on one six on another or

4350
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:37,599
whatever

4351
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:39,198
it's comparable it's six one half dozen

4352
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:40,319
would i be able to easily tell the

4353
02:08:39,198 --> 02:08:42,158
difference

4354
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:43,679
no i would just say i know in concept

4355
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:45,118
that he's way better

4356
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:46,399
so much better but there's plenty of

4357
02:08:45,118 --> 02:08:48,078
other people that could have beaten me

4358
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:48,799
just as bad as marcelo did when i was a

4359
02:08:48,078 --> 02:08:50,238
purple belt

4360
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:51,679
or when i was a brown belt then maybe i

4361
02:08:50,238 --> 02:08:53,198
would watch marcelo walk through like

4362
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:55,920
their borderline not there

4363
02:08:53,198 --> 02:08:57,198
so it's neat like if you that's back to

4364
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:58,960
kind of what i was talking about about

4365
02:08:57,198 --> 02:09:01,359
certain people beginning to really

4366
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:02,399
like peel back some of what's really

4367
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:03,759
special about

4368
02:09:02,399 --> 02:09:06,158
the martial arts or any activity i

4369
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:07,760
presume um is they get to a level of

4370
02:09:06,158 --> 02:09:09,198
understanding and depth

4371
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:11,440
that they're playing with like the

4372
02:09:09,198 --> 02:09:13,519
almost the reality of that thing

4373
02:09:11,439 --> 02:09:14,559
and i'm i'm playing by rules that are

4374
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:16,079
not rules i'm not

4375
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:17,760
i'm not even wanted to use a matrix

4376
02:09:16,078 --> 02:09:18,078
analogy i'm not even an agent which is

4377
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:19,760
the

4378
02:09:18,078 --> 02:09:21,118
best version of something playing by the

4379
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:22,800
rules yes

4380
02:09:21,118 --> 02:09:24,238
i'm like one of the regular people or

4381
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:25,599
one of the regular people in

4382
02:09:24,238 --> 02:09:27,198
that got out of the matrix so i'm like

4383
02:09:25,599 --> 02:09:28,159
oh i'm cool but when i fight an agent i

4384
02:09:27,198 --> 02:09:29,919
lose

4385
02:09:28,158 --> 02:09:31,198
because we're both in the rules but they

4386
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:32,000
just play them to the play them to the

4387
02:09:31,198 --> 02:09:34,158
bone and i'm just

4388
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,118
here well and then the agent encounters

4389
02:09:34,158 --> 02:09:36,719
neo and they

4390
02:09:35,118 --> 02:09:38,880
can do nothing you're like why because

4391
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:40,239
operating outside of what the rules are

4392
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:41,599
but not really what the rules are what

4393
02:09:40,238 --> 02:09:43,118
they perceive to be the rules are

4394
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:44,719
clearly so anyway i guess that's kind of

4395
02:09:43,118 --> 02:09:45,759
my point about marcelo or certain other

4396
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:46,000
people that are doing things where you

4397
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:48,560
go

4398
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,760
that doesn't even seem real it doesn't

4399
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:51,119
seem real to me because i don't

4400
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:53,039
understand what's going on

4401
02:09:51,118 --> 02:09:54,319
and i guess if we can get down to base

4402
02:09:53,039 --> 02:09:56,000
assumptions but like if we can

4403
02:09:54,319 --> 02:09:56,719
constantly strip away strip away strip

4404
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,238
away

4405
02:09:56,719 --> 02:09:59,679
let's say we always thought that turning

4406
02:09:58,238 --> 02:10:01,598
left was right it was correct and it

4407
02:09:59,679 --> 02:10:04,719
turns out that turning right was correct

4408
02:10:01,599 --> 02:10:06,560
it changed your life yeah it's uh what

4409
02:10:04,719 --> 02:10:08,078
is the soccer you said the unexamined

4410
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:10,639
life is not worth living

4411
02:10:08,078 --> 02:10:12,880
so you just basically have to rigorously

4412
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:14,319
just constantly examine every

4413
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:15,920
assumption over and over and over but

4414
02:10:14,319 --> 02:10:17,359
doesn't that give your life meaning to

4415
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:19,039
come back to the struggle to come back

4416
02:10:17,359 --> 02:10:20,000
to free will to come back to what if we

4417
02:10:19,039 --> 02:10:21,439
could strip all that away

4418
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,719
all right cool all right let me just

4419
02:10:21,439 --> 02:10:23,359
stick the needle in my in my arm and

4420
02:10:22,719 --> 02:10:25,840
that's that

4421
02:10:23,359 --> 02:10:27,439
yeah no i mean that that constant

4422
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:30,560
striving

4423
02:10:27,439 --> 02:10:32,960
for understanding

4424
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:34,400
yet another lower layer of the

4425
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:37,279
simulation we're living in

4426
02:10:34,399 --> 02:10:38,638
is is is something that's actually

4427
02:10:37,279 --> 02:10:40,000
deeply fulfilling that

4428
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:41,840
i don't know if it's genetically built

4429
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
in but there's something about that

4430
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:46,719
striving to understand that seems to be

4431
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,599
uh deeply human but it's funny what

4432
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:49,198
makes us human

4433
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:50,719
we don't talk about the soul anymore man

4434
02:10:49,198 --> 02:10:52,238
i went to catholic school as a kid

4435
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:54,000
and whether you buy into all that stuff

4436
02:10:52,238 --> 02:10:55,279
or not you're like what what about the

4437
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,599
soul of a person

4438
02:10:55,279 --> 02:10:58,719
the spirit of a people the spirit of a

4439
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:01,279
nation

4440
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:02,800
anywhere the spirit of humanity we don't

4441
02:11:01,279 --> 02:11:04,800
we talk about everything like it's this

4442
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:06,239
quantifiable thing when maybe certain

4443
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:07,679
things are maybe everything is

4444
02:11:06,238 --> 02:11:10,319
but then what happens if there's things

4445
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:12,399
that just aren't quantifiable that

4446
02:11:10,319 --> 02:11:13,519
nothing in our understanding can or will

4447
02:11:12,399 --> 02:11:14,479
ever explain it that doesn't mean that

4448
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:15,520
that should be our assumptions through

4449
02:11:14,479 --> 02:11:16,559
our assumption that we can explain

4450
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:17,440
everything and let's get to the dang

4451
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:19,440
bottom

4452
02:11:17,439 --> 02:11:20,879
appeal but what if there is actually

4453
02:11:19,439 --> 02:11:24,158
something that

4454
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:25,520
like that you that we need challenge for

4455
02:11:24,158 --> 02:11:27,519
yeah and we could be looking in the

4456
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:28,639
wrong place by going oh wait is it in

4457
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:29,760
the genes maybe it is

4458
02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:30,719
again i'm not saying we're looking wrong

4459
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:32,719
places like i wouldn't know anything i

4460
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:36,239
do karate but basically uh

4461
02:11:32,719 --> 02:11:37,760
not even well um but uh yeah do karate

4462
02:11:36,238 --> 02:11:38,959
mediocre just asked grandma daniels or

4463
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:40,639
stephen thompson but uh

4464
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:42,000
uh i guess the to come back though you

4465
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:44,000
just are you yell about you

4466
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,679
or are you man i actually have you ever

4467
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,198
seen the seinfeld episode where kramer

4468
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:48,560
fights the kids

4469
02:11:47,198 --> 02:11:50,960
yeah i did that at raymond daniels

4470
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:53,039
school under the kids kids wanting class

4471
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:56,078
as in addition to the uh the alleyway

4472
02:11:53,039 --> 02:11:58,238
oh yeah yeah

4473
02:11:56,078 --> 02:11:59,439
exactly when i was on my last legs but

4474
02:11:58,238 --> 02:12:02,399
uh but yeah

4475
02:11:59,439 --> 02:12:03,118
i would just maybe it's funny i feel

4476
02:12:02,399 --> 02:12:06,000
like there's something

4477
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:07,439
deeply missing from you know from public

4478
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,479
understanding anymore that it's almost

4479
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:10,078
like the idea that

4480
02:12:08,479 --> 02:12:11,759
we can figure everything out which i

4481
02:12:10,078 --> 02:12:13,359
deeply believe in but also the

4482
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:14,880
possibility that there's some things

4483
02:12:13,359 --> 02:12:15,839
that we'll never really see and some

4484
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:17,359
things you'll never understand and

4485
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:18,880
there's something

4486
02:12:17,359 --> 02:12:21,439
like you said uniquely human about the

4487
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:23,840
human experience that even if i had the

4488
02:12:21,439 --> 02:12:25,598
power to change

4489
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:27,039
i don't want to [ __ ] with it man i don't

4490
02:12:25,599 --> 02:12:28,800
want to change that thing

4491
02:12:27,039 --> 02:12:30,560
oh yeah well wouldn't it be great if we

4492
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:31,920
just immediately knew the outcome of

4493
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:32,880
everything and you just press this

4494
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:34,158
button you're like oh that's kind of

4495
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:35,760
what's the point of living life then

4496
02:12:34,158 --> 02:12:36,879
even if you could do it it's it's the

4497
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:38,159
end you've seen drastically i'll leave

4498
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:40,239
you be sorry i know i'm talking about

4499
02:12:38,158 --> 02:12:41,439
ian malcolm jurassic park jeff goldblum

4500
02:12:40,238 --> 02:12:44,638
right life life

4501
02:12:41,439 --> 02:12:46,319
uh finds a way but we were so concerned

4502
02:12:44,639 --> 02:12:47,679
with whether or not we could

4503
02:12:46,319 --> 02:12:49,759
we didn't stop to think whether or not

4504
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:53,039
we should

4505
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:54,560
maybe i i think there's an ex

4506
02:12:53,039 --> 02:12:56,319
i mean it's a deeply human thing but

4507
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:58,880
it's also a really useful thing

4508
02:12:56,319 --> 02:13:00,319
to always kind of assume that there's

4509
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:01,599
this giant thing that you don't

4510
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:03,279
understand

4511
02:13:01,599 --> 02:13:04,639
so you can forever be striving to

4512
02:13:03,279 --> 02:13:07,920
understand

4513
02:13:04,639 --> 02:13:08,560
because that process gives you meaning

4514
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:10,960
but also

4515
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:12,800
keeps making you better like thinking

4516
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:13,760
that actually even just thinking that

4517
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:16,960
you can't understand

4518
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:20,239
everything will

4519
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:23,118
lead you to stop too early so like

4520
02:13:20,238 --> 02:13:24,799
uh i i think there's something to

4521
02:13:23,118 --> 02:13:26,799
whether it's the soul or whether it's

4522
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:28,159
like religious stuff like assuming that

4523
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:30,560
there's this thing

4524
02:13:28,158 --> 02:13:32,158
that you cannot possibly understand is a

4525
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:33,360
really good assumption under which to

4526
02:13:32,158 --> 02:13:34,879
operate

4527
02:13:33,359 --> 02:13:36,319
and underwish to do this first

4528
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:38,078
principles kind of thinking because you

4529
02:13:36,319 --> 02:13:39,840
can just keep digging and keep digging

4530
02:13:38,078 --> 02:13:41,039
keep digging even when it seems like

4531
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:42,400
you're at the bottom because you don't

4532
02:13:41,039 --> 02:13:42,800
[ __ ] know if you're at the bottom or

4533
02:13:42,399 --> 02:13:44,638
not

4534
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:46,719
and back to your original back to one of

4535
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:47,359
our i guess our other kind of tangents

4536
02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:48,800
was

4537
02:13:47,359 --> 02:13:50,559
that comes back to everyone's a human

4538
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:51,360
being the smartest human being in the

4539
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:54,480
history of

4540
02:13:51,359 --> 02:13:57,198
humanity is so hilariously

4541
02:13:54,479 --> 02:13:57,839
weak like short-lived and not

4542
02:13:57,198 --> 02:13:59,439
intelligent

4543
02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:00,880
for yourself bro i understand i didn't

4544
02:13:59,439 --> 02:14:02,879
say no i'm not saying comparison to me

4545
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:04,319
in comparison to me everyone is awesome

4546
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:06,560
but that's that's why i don't do the

4547
02:14:04,319 --> 02:14:08,960
goat thing but basically uh

4548
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:10,159
you know we're it's just on a cosmic

4549
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:11,920
level can you imagine if you were

4550
02:14:10,158 --> 02:14:13,279
vampire you're like 900 years old like

4551
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:14,480
how much you would seem you would seem

4552
02:14:13,279 --> 02:14:17,039
like a lowercase g

4553
02:14:14,479 --> 02:14:18,799
god to people yeah you'd be like how can

4554
02:14:17,039 --> 02:14:20,560
you how could you know so much how can

4555
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:21,760
you have such a long view perspective it

4556
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:23,280
would be insane

4557
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:24,639
so i mean that it seems like we're

4558
02:14:23,279 --> 02:14:25,679
talking about ai now right we're

4559
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:27,279
creating things that are

4560
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:28,960
infinitely smarter than us effectively

4561
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:31,439
and live all this time and it's probably

4562
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:33,920
going to do what we tell it to do right

4563
02:14:31,439 --> 02:14:36,638
no it's probably well i hope it keeps us

4564
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:39,199
around do you by the way think about

4565
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:40,480
ai and the existential threats like

4566
02:14:39,198 --> 02:14:44,638
speaking of gods

4567
02:14:40,479 --> 02:14:46,319
iu is this whole technological world we

4568
02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:49,760
talked about social networks and this

4569
02:14:46,319 --> 02:14:51,679
increasing power of technology around us

4570
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:53,360
we ourselves are becoming less human

4571
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:55,840
because we keep becoming

4572
02:14:53,359 --> 02:14:56,479
we we keep relying on technology more

4573
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:59,119
and more

4574
02:14:56,479 --> 02:15:01,198
so we're becoming kinds of cyborgs but

4575
02:14:59,118 --> 02:15:04,960
also there's a future that's

4576
02:15:01,198 --> 02:15:05,519
quite possible where the technology

4577
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:09,599
becomes

4578
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:12,639
smarter and more powerful than us humans

4579
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:14,960
and you know starts

4580
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:16,800
having a life of its own in ways that

4581
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:18,239
perhaps we don't imagine as human beings

4582
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:20,480
i don't just mean like

4583
02:15:18,238 --> 02:15:22,158
two-legged robots walking around and

4584
02:15:20,479 --> 02:15:27,359
being humans but smarter

4585
02:15:22,158 --> 02:15:27,359
i mean like an intelligent life that's

4586
02:15:28,078 --> 02:15:34,000
that's beyond and

4587
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:36,158
fundamentally different than our human

4588
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:38,800
life is it's infinite

4589
02:15:36,158 --> 02:15:39,679
it's uh also creating new species yeah

4590
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:42,000
yeah a new

4591
02:15:39,679 --> 02:15:42,719
a new kind of species not even just a

4592
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,279
new species

4593
02:15:42,719 --> 02:15:47,359
you talk about systems but like it it

4594
02:15:45,279 --> 02:15:50,479
lives in the space of information

4595
02:15:47,359 --> 02:15:52,639
it lives uh in a different time scale

4596
02:15:50,479 --> 02:15:53,759
and a different scale of also a spatial

4597
02:15:52,639 --> 02:15:56,719
scale

4598
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:58,400
it uh operate like we speak we spoke

4599
02:15:56,719 --> 02:16:00,639
about individuals it doesn't operate in

4600
02:15:58,399 --> 02:16:02,719
the sense of a single individual like

4601
02:16:00,639 --> 02:16:04,639
embodied it's not embodied so it's not

4602
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:07,118
like a thing that walks around

4603
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:09,599
and it like it looks at stuff it

4604
02:16:07,118 --> 02:16:12,078
consumes the world it's able to do

4605
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:13,520
much larger scale sensing of the

4606
02:16:12,078 --> 02:16:15,279
environment around it

4607
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:17,199
all that kind of stuff i can't barely

4608
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:18,559
even try to i can barely conceive of

4609
02:16:17,198 --> 02:16:20,399
what that would be like are you scared

4610
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:23,280
are you excited

4611
02:16:20,399 --> 02:16:24,799
i don't define like scared or excited i

4612
02:16:23,279 --> 02:16:28,078
feel like i try and tend to define them

4613
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:30,400
like the same way or i'm like

4614
02:16:28,078 --> 02:16:31,198
i guess i i'm kind of like before

4615
02:16:30,399 --> 02:16:32,959
karaoke

4616
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:34,558
it's the same well that's actually kind

4617
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:35,598
of my happy place it's not so much

4618
02:16:34,558 --> 02:16:37,039
everyone else's

4619
02:16:35,599 --> 02:16:38,558
you know it's uh everyone else is

4620
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:40,160
probably you know heading for the door

4621
02:16:38,558 --> 02:16:41,599
at that point but you know it's uh while

4622
02:16:40,159 --> 02:16:43,679
you're doing it or leading

4623
02:16:41,599 --> 02:16:45,200
or leading up to the karaoke well it

4624
02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:46,079
depends whether or not uh whether or not

4625
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:47,599
they know it's me

4626
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:49,200
if they know it's me that's before i

4627
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:50,398
start if they if they're like who's that

4628
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:51,519
guy then they're like halfway through

4629
02:16:50,398 --> 02:16:53,358
the song they're already you know

4630
02:16:51,519 --> 02:16:54,880
what's throwing their beer what category

4631
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:56,159
is a song or a particular song are we

4632
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:56,959
talking about in terms of like your

4633
02:16:56,159 --> 02:16:58,239
happy place

4634
02:16:56,959 --> 02:16:59,678
oh man are you kidding me i mean

4635
02:16:58,239 --> 02:17:00,000
obviously we came in rhapsody i mean

4636
02:16:59,679 --> 02:17:01,519
there's no

4637
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,558
question because oh yeah because i don't

4638
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:03,840
have to sing it here it's that it's like

4639
02:17:02,558 --> 02:17:05,358
you remember can you can i be

4640
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:07,359
oh yeah of course is he here no yeah

4641
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:08,960
then yeah yeah all right if you i like

4642
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:10,159
this here no that i can't i've a torn

4643
02:17:08,959 --> 02:17:11,598
i've uh

4644
02:17:10,159 --> 02:17:12,799
i've torn feelings about bohemian

4645
02:17:11,599 --> 02:17:15,599
rhapsody because i like the beginning

4646
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:17,599
part the sadness i like like the solo

4647
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:19,280
the heartbreak but the second part i

4648
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:21,040
understand it is so much just like

4649
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:22,319
it gets ridiculous it's so ridiculous it

4650
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:23,840
ruins it for me but it's more about

4651
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:24,318
flexing on people i think if you can

4652
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:26,079
actually

4653
02:17:24,318 --> 02:17:29,119
hit hit that hit that you know the

4654
02:17:26,079 --> 02:17:31,120
falsetto yeah so it's

4655
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:32,160
it's not okay so you appreciate enough

4656
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:34,000
for the musical

4657
02:17:32,159 --> 02:17:35,439
uh beauty and complexity of the song you

4658
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,359
just like to flex on board because like

4659
02:17:35,439 --> 02:17:39,519
for all yeah like what's the purpose of

4660
02:17:37,359 --> 02:17:43,359
anything except for just to let everyone

4661
02:17:39,519 --> 02:17:44,719
know that you think you're cool

4662
02:17:43,359 --> 02:17:47,200
and there's no better way of doing that

4663
02:17:44,718 --> 02:17:49,598
than karaoke so i'm not sure why bro

4664
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:50,719
captive audience yeah exactly oh fear

4665
02:17:49,599 --> 02:17:52,159
and excitement of artificial

4666
02:17:50,718 --> 02:17:53,438
intelligence i mean like you know me i

4667
02:17:52,159 --> 02:17:56,000
don't know anything about

4668
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:57,439
i just i basically i don't i don't

4669
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,799
understand the implications of

4670
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:01,200
of any of this i would just say that

4671
02:17:58,799 --> 02:18:03,119
like radically altering what it means to

4672
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:05,040
be human in such an unbelievably short

4673
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:06,719
period of time just seems like

4674
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:08,240
such a crazy thing and also it's not

4675
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:09,518
like we're i can't remember who said

4676
02:18:08,239 --> 02:18:10,638
this to me recently might even be like i

4677
02:18:09,519 --> 02:18:11,439
can't remember so this is definitely not

4678
02:18:10,638 --> 02:18:14,799
my idea

4679
02:18:11,439 --> 02:18:17,760
but uh we're we're not even going hey

4680
02:18:14,799 --> 02:18:18,718
would you like to opt in everyone

4681
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:20,960
everyone is being

4682
02:18:18,718 --> 02:18:21,839
opted in you know and particularly when

4683
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:24,079
you want to talk about

4684
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:26,318
like large-scale robotics a large-scale

4685
02:18:24,079 --> 02:18:28,239
ai like the world is changing people in

4686
02:18:26,318 --> 02:18:29,599
senegal are opting in right now without

4687
02:18:28,239 --> 02:18:30,879
realizing it it's not even like and

4688
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:32,318
again i don't mean to pick on senegal

4689
02:18:30,879 --> 02:18:33,679
it's just whatever country comes up to

4690
02:18:32,318 --> 02:18:35,439
mind but it's in the developing world

4691
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:38,799
but basically uh

4692
02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:41,439
you know recognizing that this

4693
02:18:38,799 --> 02:18:43,358
huge shift is coming we have no idea

4694
02:18:41,439 --> 02:18:44,960
this is a decent idea and also something

4695
02:18:43,359 --> 02:18:47,280
else i've always been considered

4696
02:18:44,959 --> 02:18:48,478
is uh you know you think about most of

4697
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:50,239
the really awful

4698
02:18:48,478 --> 02:18:52,558
awful awful things that have done in

4699
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:55,359
history large-scale slavery

4700
02:18:52,558 --> 02:18:56,478
hall you name it it didn't people say

4701
02:18:55,359 --> 02:18:58,399
that it came from

4702
02:18:56,478 --> 02:19:00,000
this motivation or that motivation maybe

4703
02:18:58,398 --> 02:19:01,199
it did maybe it didn't fundamentally the

4704
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:04,959
issue at least in my mind

4705
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:07,920
i'm not a historian power differential

4706
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:09,759
if you if you and i can't contest we

4707
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:11,280
don't contend it's not like you we fight

4708
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:12,559
and you might win or we fight even

4709
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:15,040
you'll win comfortably

4710
02:19:12,558 --> 02:19:16,638
it's you are so unbelievably powerful

4711
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:18,639
compared to me that there's nothing i

4712
02:19:16,638 --> 02:19:20,239
can do to stop you

4713
02:19:18,638 --> 02:19:21,920
that seems like a recipe for something

4714
02:19:20,239 --> 02:19:22,318
really really not great happening

4715
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:24,719
because

4716
02:19:22,318 --> 02:19:26,239
if you think about like uh you know

4717
02:19:24,718 --> 02:19:27,199
european countries encountering each

4718
02:19:26,239 --> 02:19:28,159
other and i'm just speculating i don't

4719
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:29,679
know anything about history but let's

4720
02:19:28,159 --> 02:19:31,039
say countries that can contend with one

4721
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:34,159
another

4722
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:36,559
versus countries that can't

4723
02:19:34,159 --> 02:19:38,000
let's say an alien species alien race

4724
02:19:36,558 --> 02:19:39,438
shows up you know right now we don't

4725
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,079
want that i think stephen hawking said

4726
02:19:39,439 --> 02:19:41,200
that that makes for

4727
02:19:40,079 --> 02:19:43,439
it makes perfect sense to me we don't

4728
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:45,519
want that if you can come here

4729
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:46,318
we better hope you're nice because what

4730
02:19:45,519 --> 02:19:47,760
are we going to do what are we going to

4731
02:19:46,318 --> 02:19:49,279
hope that you invade the water planet

4732
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:50,159
like they did in uh you know one of the

4733
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:51,680
uh

4734
02:19:50,159 --> 02:19:53,039
side lord of the year where the world so

4735
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,600
i guess what i'm trying to get across is

4736
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:55,439
like

4737
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:57,280
shocking levels of power differential

4738
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:57,680
between groups makes that makes the

4739
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:00,000
world

4740
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:01,600
ripe for horrific abuse in the event

4741
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,760
that someone decides to do it

4742
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:05,280
it's like like you imagine an adult

4743
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:06,559
hitting a child like hating hitting a

4744
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:07,120
child no one in their right mind would

4745
02:20:06,559 --> 02:20:09,439
ever go like

4746
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:10,160
that's a great idea because it's such an

4747
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:12,000
it's so

4748
02:20:10,159 --> 02:20:14,159
grossly imbalanced you're like this is

4749
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,639
wrong but but it's also on the table

4750
02:20:14,159 --> 02:20:18,000
only because of the gross imbalance so i

4751
02:20:16,639 --> 02:20:20,799
guess to come back it's like

4752
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:22,639
whether we create ai and it's on some

4753
02:20:20,799 --> 02:20:25,920
crazy level of its own or it's

4754
02:20:22,639 --> 02:20:26,639
i'm in charge of it or so i just it

4755
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:28,719
seems like we're

4756
02:20:26,639 --> 02:20:29,760
we're creating you mentioned like game

4757
02:20:28,719 --> 02:20:32,239
theory

4758
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:32,800
and nuclear war what prevented nuclear

4759
02:20:32,239 --> 02:20:35,199
war

4760
02:20:32,799 --> 02:20:36,719
i mean i presumably mutually assure

4761
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:37,439
destruction i mean hopefully also

4762
02:20:36,719 --> 02:20:39,519
humanity

4763
02:20:37,439 --> 02:20:40,880
and the humanity and the the reasonable

4764
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:41,439
you know cooler heads prevailing and

4765
02:20:40,879 --> 02:20:43,358
going

4766
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:45,280
hey i can i can understand the veil of

4767
02:20:43,359 --> 02:20:46,479
ignorance and i uh i don't go oh yeah

4768
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:48,159
let me kill those guys because i can i

4769
02:20:46,478 --> 02:20:50,799
go this is wrong period

4770
02:20:48,159 --> 02:20:51,600
and in concept this is not an action i

4771
02:20:50,799 --> 02:20:53,599
should take

4772
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:55,120
but it's also nice and easy to keep me

4773
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:56,559
honest if i know that i can't get you

4774
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:59,040
without being got myself

4775
02:20:56,559 --> 02:20:59,680
yeah but what happens when i can get

4776
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:01,680
anyone

4777
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:03,920
anything and i'm more or less

4778
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:04,398
untouchable like that seems to me to be

4779
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:06,719
like

4780
02:21:04,398 --> 02:21:08,000
like various times in colonial history

4781
02:21:06,719 --> 02:21:10,559
you know what i mean and

4782
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:12,478
what happened we know what happened but

4783
02:21:10,559 --> 02:21:16,000
so the possibility of

4784
02:21:12,478 --> 02:21:17,199
really bad things are plentiful the

4785
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:19,840
possibilities

4786
02:21:17,200 --> 02:21:21,200
but are the possibilities of really

4787
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:23,040
positive things applying for

4788
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:24,720
like what though i'm not saying wrong i

4789
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:25,600
don't know so i can give a million

4790
02:21:24,719 --> 02:21:28,159
examples

4791
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:29,600
one is just the examples of the parent

4792
02:21:28,159 --> 02:21:32,799
and the child

4793
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:34,479
uh you said uh there's a power

4794
02:21:32,799 --> 02:21:38,000
differential there

4795
02:21:34,478 --> 02:21:39,279
and we don't like a parent hitting their

4796
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,200
child

4797
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:43,120
about not just hitting like beating like

4798
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:47,040
really yeah great

4799
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:48,560
beating their child how often

4800
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:50,800
percentage-wise do you see that

4801
02:21:48,559 --> 02:21:53,519
happening even though that that that

4802
02:21:50,799 --> 02:21:54,000
uh power differential first of all other

4803
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:56,560
people's

4804
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:57,439
kids let's just put this on the table i

4805
02:21:56,559 --> 02:21:59,439
love kids

4806
02:21:57,439 --> 02:22:01,359
but other people's kids can be annoying

4807
02:21:59,439 --> 02:22:03,760
sometimes sometimes you got to deal out

4808
02:22:01,359 --> 02:22:05,680
some justice i get it

4809
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:07,600
but we don't practice we don't take

4810
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:09,760
advantage of that power differential

4811
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:10,800
so like there is ethics there's

4812
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:14,159
moralities that

4813
02:22:10,799 --> 02:22:15,279
emerge that allow the power differential

4814
02:22:14,159 --> 02:22:18,639
to be used for good

4815
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:19,520
versus for bad so like you're one of the

4816
02:22:18,639 --> 02:22:22,159
assumptions

4817
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:24,319
with stephen hawking or with uh if

4818
02:22:22,159 --> 02:22:25,920
russia became much more powerful than

4819
02:22:24,318 --> 02:22:28,000
america or america much more

4820
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:29,760
powerful than russia in the cold war

4821
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:31,359
your assumption that immediately

4822
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:32,800
that power differential not your

4823
02:22:31,359 --> 02:22:34,318
assumption but it would express itself

4824
02:22:32,799 --> 02:22:37,279
right would express itself

4825
02:22:34,318 --> 02:22:38,799
in the in the same way that it was

4826
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:39,840
trying to express itself when there was

4827
02:22:38,799 --> 02:22:41,920
a more

4828
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:43,280
uh level competition but it's also

4829
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:44,318
possible when the power differential

4830
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:46,880
grows

4831
02:22:44,318 --> 02:22:48,318
the incentive the joy whatever the

4832
02:22:46,879 --> 02:22:51,039
mechanisms that

4833
02:22:48,318 --> 02:22:51,760
uh made sense when it was at the same

4834
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:53,280
level

4835
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:55,760
that the incentives become very

4836
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:56,880
different it's not as fun to destroy the

4837
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:59,520
ant colony

4838
02:22:56,879 --> 02:23:00,879
you start becoming more the kind of a

4839
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:02,880
conservationist

4840
02:23:00,879 --> 02:23:04,079
like one hopes it's an evolved

4841
02:23:02,879 --> 02:23:06,000
perspective though yeah

4842
02:23:04,079 --> 02:23:07,680
well i don't know if it's evolved or not

4843
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,920
but it's definitely a possibility it's

4844
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:11,680
unclear to me that something that's many

4845
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:14,879
orders of magnitude more powerful than

4846
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:15,520
us will want to destroy us well i mean

4847
02:23:14,879 --> 02:23:17,519
what did we

4848
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:18,880
what did i mean how did how did mass

4849
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:21,600
slavery occur how did

4850
02:23:18,879 --> 02:23:22,318
you know like just big dogs playing with

4851
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:25,359
not

4852
02:23:22,318 --> 02:23:29,680
i think i think slavery and

4853
02:23:25,359 --> 02:23:31,920
a lot of the atrocities in history

4854
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:32,720
happened when the power differential was

4855
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:35,040
not as great

4856
02:23:32,719 --> 02:23:35,760
as as we're talking about with ai

4857
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:38,640
potentially

4858
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:39,359
is that not somehow worse than it's not

4859
02:23:38,639 --> 02:23:40,799
obvious to me

4860
02:23:39,359 --> 02:23:43,040
it's not obvious that things that are

4861
02:23:40,799 --> 02:23:44,959
way more powerful

4862
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:46,160
that's fair okay so i think i i think

4863
02:23:44,959 --> 02:23:47,199
you're i guess how do you restrain it

4864
02:23:46,159 --> 02:23:48,719
though

4865
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:50,399
uh there there's a lot of different

4866
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:52,159
discussions of how to

4867
02:23:50,398 --> 02:23:53,199
uh i just even restrain each other

4868
02:23:52,159 --> 02:23:54,559
because let's say i go and decide to

4869
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,520
strike someone's child which i'd like to

4870
02:23:54,559 --> 02:23:57,680
think i wouldn't do

4871
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:59,280
yes i will be promptly i will find

4872
02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:01,280
myself in front of a judge

4873
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:02,560
and so i feel like there's a lot can you

4874
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:03,280
imagine how many people used to get

4875
02:24:02,559 --> 02:24:06,159
murdered

4876
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:07,600
just in the woods yeah i mean i would

4877
02:24:06,159 --> 02:24:09,760
just presume it's a lot

4878
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:11,280
you know and i don't think most people

4879
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:12,159
are lunatics like that but i would just

4880
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:13,520
say that's the point

4881
02:24:12,159 --> 02:24:15,680
if you're given though if you're given

4882
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:17,600
to that your ability to get away with it

4883
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:19,520
was was greater in the past because a

4884
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:22,800
chance of detection was less

4885
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:24,319
so does it i don't know this is what

4886
02:24:22,799 --> 02:24:26,000
that's called an artificial intelligence

4887
02:24:24,318 --> 02:24:29,199
ai safety research

4888
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,920
called value alignment of ensuring as

4889
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:31,840
you build

4890
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:33,840
the the systems that become smarter and

4891
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:36,799
smarter and more powerful and powerful

4892
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:38,159
make sure that their values are aligned

4893
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:39,599
with the entities

4894
02:24:38,159 --> 02:24:42,079
over which they're becoming powerful

4895
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:44,000
with with humans so if you were to talk

4896
02:24:42,079 --> 02:24:45,600
to an ai that's becoming smarter first

4897
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,359
it's dumber than unit but it's becoming

4898
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:50,399
smarter and smarter

4899
02:24:47,359 --> 02:24:52,720
you have to create mechanisms

4900
02:24:50,398 --> 02:24:53,920
where you both value the same things i

4901
02:24:52,719 --> 02:24:56,719
guess one thing i wonder

4902
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:58,239
so i guess i'm probably not like sharp

4903
02:24:56,719 --> 02:25:00,000
enough to grasp this if i'm honest but i

4904
02:24:58,239 --> 02:25:03,039
guess like i wonder like uh

4905
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:04,000
i used the chess programs um you know

4906
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:06,319
was deep blue

4907
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:08,719
stock fish and then like alpha zero and

4908
02:25:06,318 --> 02:25:11,600
alpha zero teaching itself to beat

4909
02:25:08,719 --> 02:25:12,719
stock stockfish without any help in four

4910
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:15,200
hours yeah yeah like

4911
02:25:12,719 --> 02:25:17,519
it becomes orders of magnitude more

4912
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:19,760
intelligence than us in effectively

4913
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:21,200
an instantaneous period i guess what i

4914
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:24,398
always wondered like uh

4915
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:25,920
if you were that much smarter than me

4916
02:25:24,398 --> 02:25:27,199
i feel like your ability to manipulate

4917
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:28,559
me would be pretty significant or at

4918
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:32,079
least potentially you know

4919
02:25:28,559 --> 02:25:34,719
but manipulation

4920
02:25:32,079 --> 02:25:35,600
implies that the incentive is to

4921
02:25:34,719 --> 02:25:38,398
overpower

4922
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:39,600
everything around you like there's

4923
02:25:38,398 --> 02:25:42,639
implied incentives

4924
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:47,280
if your value is to actually

4925
02:25:42,639 --> 02:25:49,599
like uh it depends what you want in life

4926
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:51,280
okay what you want in your system like

4927
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:53,120
it's it's not clear

4928
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:55,040
that the goal of an ai system that's

4929
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:56,720
all-powerful is to destroy

4930
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,920
all humans no i don't think that i don't

4931
02:25:56,719 --> 02:26:00,318
think that it is either i guess we're

4932
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:01,760
going to even enslave all humans

4933
02:26:00,318 --> 02:26:03,840
that's fair i guess what i'm trying to

4934
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:04,478
suggest is that something adequately

4935
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:06,799
powerful

4936
02:26:04,478 --> 02:26:08,239
these these actions are on the table yes

4937
02:26:06,799 --> 02:26:09,358
they're on the table and that's scary

4938
02:26:08,239 --> 02:26:10,959
and that's why a lot of people are

4939
02:26:09,359 --> 02:26:12,720
really concerned about it and are

4940
02:26:10,959 --> 02:26:14,159
working on it i'm just trying to make

4941
02:26:12,719 --> 02:26:18,398
the case

4942
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:18,398
for agi because if they're watching this

4943
02:26:18,478 --> 02:26:22,000
he's the one to kill uh no actually i

4944
02:26:20,398 --> 02:26:25,119
was thinking i was uh

4945
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:28,799
yeah i i watched toilets like

4946
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:30,560
really well no i mean

4947
02:26:28,799 --> 02:26:32,478
that that's the main concern for all the

4948
02:26:30,559 --> 02:26:36,239
people in the aic to research

4949
02:26:32,478 --> 02:26:38,959
people talk about agis it's

4950
02:26:36,239 --> 02:26:39,600
uh it's kind of disturbing how little

4951
02:26:38,959 --> 02:26:43,438
people

4952
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:46,559
are working on trying to

4953
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:48,159
create mechanisms that keep ai's values

4954
02:26:46,559 --> 02:26:51,680
aligned with ours

4955
02:26:48,159 --> 02:26:55,280
that's completely unshocking yeah we

4956
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:56,800
we humans seem to do only good when like

4957
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:58,960
you know you even look at like

4958
02:26:56,799 --> 02:27:02,079
coronavirus it's like when

4959
02:26:58,959 --> 02:27:03,119
like the water has to be leaking from

4960
02:27:02,079 --> 02:27:05,359
the ceiling

4961
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:06,479
you have to be there fine fine blood

4962
02:27:05,359 --> 02:27:09,840
everywhere fire

4963
02:27:06,478 --> 02:27:10,559
just destruction we do we just seem to

4964
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:13,920
ignore

4965
02:27:10,559 --> 02:27:17,359
completely and all over the wall

4966
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:19,359
riding all over the wall this is fun

4967
02:27:17,359 --> 02:27:20,800
nothing to see here we'll be okay but we

4968
02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:22,000
do all right especially in the united

4969
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:24,478
states you figure out

4970
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,760
even when this becomes a really serious

4971
02:27:24,478 --> 02:27:27,920
problem

4972
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:30,880
taking actions last minute there's

4973
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:34,000
something about the innovative spirit

4974
02:27:30,879 --> 02:27:35,920
that results in a solution last minute

4975
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:37,280
right before the deadline it works out

4976
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:37,680
well i mean how i don't know how you did

4977
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:39,200
school

4978
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:40,960
probably a lot better than me but that

4979
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:42,960
was how i did school i couldn't be mo i

4980
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:44,879
was no motivation up until like the last

4981
02:27:42,959 --> 02:27:46,719
you feel like we have 22 hours to do the

4982
02:27:44,879 --> 02:27:48,719
entire semesters of work

4983
02:27:46,719 --> 02:27:51,199
like let's do this yeah and you get like

4984
02:27:48,719 --> 02:27:52,959
19 freaking mountain dews and then uh

4985
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:54,640
yeah well that's that's why you and i

4986
02:27:52,959 --> 02:27:55,358
are failures in life because i just

4987
02:27:54,639 --> 02:27:59,039
talked to i

4988
02:27:55,359 --> 02:28:01,520
mentioned cal newport uh with his book

4989
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:04,880
uh deep work and so on he is of the

4990
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:06,800
variety of these creatures that

4991
02:28:04,879 --> 02:28:08,879
basically does everything ahead of time

4992
02:28:06,799 --> 02:28:11,599
that's shocking because he

4993
02:28:08,879 --> 02:28:13,519
this dislikes the he thinks it's

4994
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:16,000
unproductive

4995
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:17,680
uh to experience the stress and anxiety

4996
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
of the deadline

4997
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:21,840
because you're just you're not going to

4998
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:23,680
be your best performance wise

4999
02:28:21,840 --> 02:28:25,439
and you're not going to do the best work

5000
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:26,960
so it doesn't make any it's completely

5001
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:28,800
irrational

5002
02:28:26,959 --> 02:28:30,239
to uh to a function based on the

5003
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:32,239
deadline you should have a system a

5004
02:28:30,239 --> 02:28:33,520
process that gets stuff a little bit of

5005
02:28:32,239 --> 02:28:36,719
stuff done every day

5006
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:38,640
so like you should be and constantly be

5007
02:28:36,719 --> 02:28:40,398
systematically honest with yourself if

5008
02:28:38,639 --> 02:28:41,840
you say i'm going to get this stuff done

5009
02:28:40,398 --> 02:28:43,279
today and this week

5010
02:28:41,840 --> 02:28:45,040
at the end of the day at the end of the

5011
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:46,399
week you have to then reflect on what

5012
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:48,560
you did who you planned

5013
02:28:46,398 --> 02:28:50,478
and improve that plan update it

5014
02:28:48,559 --> 02:28:52,559
constantly update every day every week

5015
02:28:50,478 --> 02:28:53,760
every quarter whatever those durations

5016
02:28:52,559 --> 02:28:55,519
are uh

5017
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:56,800
as i'm listening to this and reading his

5018
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:58,159
stuff it's like oh

5019
02:28:56,799 --> 02:28:59,920
yeah i agree with everything i'm like

5020
02:28:58,159 --> 02:29:01,760
yes i'm clapping

5021
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:04,079
but like the reality is and then i'd go

5022
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:06,159
back and just eat cheetos and like

5023
02:29:04,079 --> 02:29:08,559
don't do [ __ ] until like blasphemy and

5024
02:29:06,159 --> 02:29:08,559
cheesy

5025
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:15,200
but actually like again not that it'll

5026
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:16,559
ever matter not that it's ever going to

5027
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:17,840
matter because he's so shockingly

5028
02:29:16,559 --> 02:29:19,199
productive and well thought out that

5029
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:21,120
whatever i've decided to think about

5030
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:22,399
trying to monkey wrench in there is uh

5031
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:24,000
is definitely going to be able to deal

5032
02:29:22,398 --> 02:29:24,879
with but it's funny that again because

5033
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,639
you're a human being

5034
02:29:24,879 --> 02:29:28,398
not a god all of your strengths are you

5035
02:29:26,639 --> 02:29:30,079
have a corresponding weakness

5036
02:29:28,398 --> 02:29:31,760
the less you practice working under the

5037
02:29:30,079 --> 02:29:33,359
gun the less comfortable you are working

5038
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:34,559
under the gun the more practice you have

5039
02:29:33,359 --> 02:29:36,239
working under the gun the better you get

5040
02:29:34,559 --> 02:29:38,079
it the downside is you're always working

5041
02:29:36,239 --> 02:29:39,920
on the gun so you're less productive or

5042
02:29:38,079 --> 02:29:41,280
it's like your work quality maybe drops

5043
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:43,200
so it's an interesting thing it's like

5044
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:43,840
it's almost like hey i wonder if this i

5045
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,520
wonder if

5046
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:46,960
khabib nurmagomedov has a lot of heart

5047
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:47,600
and i'd say the answer is almost

5048
02:29:46,959 --> 02:29:49,438
certainly yes

5049
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:51,359
but you go well he hasn't struggled a

5050
02:29:49,439 --> 02:29:52,720
bunch maybe he doesn't struggle well and

5051
02:29:51,359 --> 02:29:53,760
it just so happens that he can also work

5052
02:29:52,719 --> 02:29:54,719
under the gun really well he just

5053
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:56,318
doesn't like to do it

5054
02:29:54,719 --> 02:29:57,679
yeah but uh yeah but it's an interesting

5055
02:29:56,318 --> 02:29:59,439
thing it's like i guess what is it the

5056
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:00,159
aristotle we are what we repeatedly do

5057
02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:01,760
we are all

5058
02:30:00,159 --> 02:30:04,000
we're all practicing something all the

5059
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:05,040
time so i guess it's it's funny

5060
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:07,200
i guess that's a question that i have

5061
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:11,040
though i would love to ask him

5062
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:12,720
really neat is uh in certain jobs i mean

5063
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:14,960
obviously you want to have preparation

5064
02:30:12,719 --> 02:30:16,239
always always but certain things have

5065
02:30:14,959 --> 02:30:19,519
like a degree of like

5066
02:30:16,239 --> 02:30:21,439
entropy in the system and you go i need

5067
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:22,720
to practice working under the gun

5068
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:24,398
and i'm not saying that's what i need to

5069
02:30:22,719 --> 02:30:25,599
do because fighting it should be for the

5070
02:30:24,398 --> 02:30:26,799
most part it's a really sterile

5071
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:28,559
environment the grand scheme of things

5072
02:30:26,799 --> 02:30:29,920
like fighting in a cage is very sterile

5073
02:30:28,559 --> 02:30:30,559
compared to most other things in life

5074
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:33,840
right

5075
02:30:30,559 --> 02:30:35,279
but dangerous but sterile and uh unless

5076
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:37,040
of course like you know

5077
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:38,960
like the other guy the ref decides to

5078
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:40,640
hit you should be hilarious but um

5079
02:30:38,959 --> 02:30:42,398
anyway i guess just going like okay so

5080
02:30:40,639 --> 02:30:45,680
at what value do you get

5081
02:30:42,398 --> 02:30:47,519
out of adding a degree of let's say you

5082
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:50,239
could even be planned by someone else

5083
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:51,920
but junk in the system and you just have

5084
02:30:50,239 --> 02:30:52,959
to work under the gun to make it happen

5085
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:54,318
let's say for instance for like

5086
02:30:52,959 --> 02:30:56,000
police or something like that the

5087
02:30:54,318 --> 02:30:58,000
situation turns left hard

5088
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:59,040
at some random point in time that could

5089
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,318
happen to

5090
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:02,000
any number of people so i guess it's

5091
02:31:00,318 --> 02:31:03,600
interesting things that allow for

5092
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,719
perfect planning or quasi-perfect

5093
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:06,318
planning versus things that are

5094
02:31:04,719 --> 02:31:07,760
inherently unstable

5095
02:31:06,318 --> 02:31:10,159
and then what are the what's the

5096
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:10,559
psychological fallout of comfort with

5097
02:31:10,159 --> 02:31:11,680
that

5098
02:31:10,559 --> 02:31:14,239
because i think a lot of people that are

5099
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:16,079
really comfortable under the gun

5100
02:31:14,239 --> 02:31:17,439
let it happen a lot for all the good and

5101
02:31:16,079 --> 02:31:17,760
the bad of that does that make sense no

5102
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:19,680
that

5103
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:20,880
totally makes sense it was i mean his

5104
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:23,600
answer would be

5105
02:31:20,879 --> 02:31:26,559
that you have to be honest with yourself

5106
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:29,680
if it's valuable for the your success

5107
02:31:26,559 --> 02:31:31,279
to practice being under the gun and then

5108
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:33,040
you should schedule that john then he's

5109
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:35,120
smart you should plan that

5110
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:36,240
you should systematically and then as

5111
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:38,479
opposed to doing it

5112
02:31:36,239 --> 02:31:41,199
half-assedly because it's as opposed to

5113
02:31:38,478 --> 02:31:42,719
letting the environment choose

5114
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:44,240
the randomness like control the

5115
02:31:42,719 --> 02:31:46,959
randomness to where

5116
02:31:44,239 --> 02:31:48,478
like you optimize it i was just it's so

5117
02:31:46,959 --> 02:31:48,959
efficient it's shocking just to hear

5118
02:31:48,478 --> 02:31:52,000
about it

5119
02:31:48,959 --> 02:31:53,519
yeah no he's he's i mean the same way

5120
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:55,600
you are he's annoying in the same way

5121
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:58,319
which is like he he drops

5122
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:59,439
truth bombs it's like yeah yeah that's

5123
02:31:58,318 --> 02:32:01,600
so true

5124
02:31:59,439 --> 02:32:04,720
yeah we're probably comparably you know

5125
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:04,720
doing that you know

5126
02:32:04,959 --> 02:32:08,559
but he's so he his profession requires

5127
02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:10,000
that so he's not just like a

5128
02:32:08,559 --> 02:32:13,359
motivational speaker or whatever he

5129
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:15,120
uh he's a a computer science theoretical

5130
02:32:13,359 --> 02:32:18,079
computer scientist and

5131
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:18,560
he needs the long hours in the day of

5132
02:32:18,079 --> 02:32:20,559
doing

5133
02:32:18,559 --> 02:32:21,840
like serious math so it's mostly math

5134
02:32:20,559 --> 02:32:23,600
proofs and

5135
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:26,159
for that you have to sit and think

5136
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:28,479
really deeply it's like really hard work

5137
02:32:26,159 --> 02:32:29,200
compared to like uh what most people do

5138
02:32:28,478 --> 02:32:31,358
like

5139
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:33,359
even when i i mean what i do like

5140
02:32:31,359 --> 02:32:35,680
programming is way easier than

5141
02:32:33,359 --> 02:32:37,680
rigorous math proofs because you have to

5142
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:41,280
basically have this machine

5143
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:41,600
and you have to uh your brain to churn

5144
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:45,359
out

5145
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:46,880
logic in a focused way while visualizing

5146
02:32:45,359 --> 02:32:47,680
a bunch of things and holding that in

5147
02:32:46,879 --> 02:32:49,839
your brain

5148
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:52,559
and holding that for 10 minutes 20

5149
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:55,040
minutes hopefully several hours

5150
02:32:52,559 --> 02:32:57,119
and you're not just like doing homework

5151
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:58,800
you're doing totally novel stuff so like

5152
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:00,720
stuff that nobody's ever done before

5153
02:32:58,799 --> 02:33:02,639
so you keep running up against the wall

5154
02:33:00,719 --> 02:33:05,438
of like [ __ ] this is a dead

5155
02:33:02,639 --> 02:33:07,760
end oh no wait is this a dead end and

5156
02:33:05,439 --> 02:33:09,760
like that whole frustration

5157
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:11,520
that's serious mental work that's like

5158
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:12,800
incredibly difficult mental work so he

5159
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:13,200
knows what he's talking about that's

5160
02:33:12,799 --> 02:33:15,039
something

5161
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:16,479
that's amazing but like you said he's

5162
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:18,840
like this seems like the standard for

5163
02:33:16,478 --> 02:33:19,599
the quality of work that he needs is so

5164
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:21,439
high so

5165
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:23,520
almost anything less than this level of

5166
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:25,040
systematization and organization would

5167
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:26,640
preclude it right so he can't

5168
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:28,640
afford the kind of [ __ ] that i don't

5169
02:33:26,639 --> 02:33:29,599
know about you but that certainly i do

5170
02:33:28,639 --> 02:33:31,119
which is like last

5171
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:33,040
deadline kind of stuff because you can't

5172
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:37,040
do that kind of work

5173
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:38,960
uh uh last minute on kind of stuff so

5174
02:33:37,040 --> 02:33:40,080
my question for him in general is like

5175
02:33:38,959 --> 02:33:42,959
and for you and i

5176
02:33:40,079 --> 02:33:45,200
is like well here's these negative

5177
02:33:42,959 --> 02:33:48,959
patterns that we do

5178
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:52,000
of like doing [ __ ] last minute and so on

5179
02:33:48,959 --> 02:33:52,639
is this just who we are now or are there

5180
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,478
some

5181
02:33:52,639 --> 02:33:55,920
i don't think i'm really big into a free

5182
02:33:54,478 --> 02:33:57,760
will you know i was thinking that it's

5183
02:33:55,920 --> 02:33:59,760
mostly predestination

5184
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:01,520
at least in this regard it's the same

5185
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:02,159
with like communism like as long as it

5186
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:04,560
fits my

5187
02:34:02,159 --> 02:34:06,239
uh whatever is the lazy thing to do i'll

5188
02:34:04,559 --> 02:34:08,478
i'll just not believe in freedom yeah

5189
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:09,439
i'm not a congressman opportunist or uh

5190
02:34:08,478 --> 02:34:14,000
yeah that's when

5191
02:34:09,439 --> 02:34:16,398
that was i'm an opportunistic communist

5192
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:18,000
and capitalist i just do whatever

5193
02:34:16,398 --> 02:34:22,159
whatever is cool at the time

5194
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:24,478
exactly uh let me ask you um

5195
02:34:22,159 --> 02:34:26,478
to examine some fundamental principles

5196
02:34:24,478 --> 02:34:28,159
of a particular thing that joe rogan

5197
02:34:26,478 --> 02:34:29,599
brought up to me several times online

5198
02:34:28,159 --> 02:34:33,039
and offline okay

5199
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:36,079
which is that he thinks that

5200
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:39,359
the tie that i wear okay is

5201
02:34:36,079 --> 02:34:42,239
something that makes me uh vulnerable

5202
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:44,479
to attack that you sh should be the

5203
02:34:42,239 --> 02:34:45,439
reason he doesn't wear a tie is because

5204
02:34:44,478 --> 02:34:47,199
he can get choked

5205
02:34:45,439 --> 02:34:48,479
very easily with a tie it's a big

5206
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:51,600
concern

5207
02:34:48,478 --> 02:34:53,519
okay my contention

5208
02:34:51,600 --> 02:34:55,439
and by the way he wore a suit last time

5209
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:56,960
too uh he didn't wear it on the podcast

5210
02:34:55,439 --> 02:34:58,559
he wore it for dinner later

5211
02:34:56,959 --> 02:35:00,959
yeah i wore a suit the other day and i i

5212
02:34:58,559 --> 02:35:02,639
had uh no socks on i didn't realize

5213
02:35:00,959 --> 02:35:03,919
yeah you're supposed to wear socks yeah

5214
02:35:02,639 --> 02:35:05,680
that's that's my understanding why'd you

5215
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:09,120
wear a suit did you go to court

5216
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:09,120
no no and i didn't know no

5217
02:35:09,439 --> 02:35:12,479
yeah i don't know i just wanted to play

5218
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:12,960
i wanted to pretend i was an adult for a

5219
02:35:12,478 --> 02:35:16,318
day

5220
02:35:12,959 --> 02:35:19,839
okay cool yeah so uh so

5221
02:35:16,318 --> 02:35:22,639
my contention is like the jacket

5222
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:23,600
everything is more dangerous than a tie

5223
02:35:22,639 --> 02:35:24,959
that's kind of where i was going with

5224
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:26,000
that that's kind of where it was my

5225
02:35:24,959 --> 02:35:28,719
first thought too like if

5226
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:29,920
once the tie becomes an issue like yeah

5227
02:35:28,719 --> 02:35:31,920
like everything else is already

5228
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:34,000
it's already an issue yeah because the

5229
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:34,639
tie to me now without like messing with

5230
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:37,920
it now is

5231
02:35:34,639 --> 02:35:40,559
is to me has some of the

5232
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:41,920
similar problems that a belt does so

5233
02:35:40,559 --> 02:35:43,199
like for example i don't know about you

5234
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:46,079
maybe you can correct me

5235
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:48,560
but i'm not sure you can use the belt as

5236
02:35:46,079 --> 02:35:48,559
tied

5237
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:54,719
you know i know there's some kind of

5238
02:35:52,959 --> 02:35:56,318
guards you can probably utilize the belt

5239
02:35:54,719 --> 02:35:57,920
with but

5240
02:35:56,318 --> 02:35:59,600
the belt sorry when it's tight around

5241
02:35:57,920 --> 02:36:01,520
the waist and we're talking about a belt

5242
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:02,159
belt or a keyboard it's a g belt okay

5243
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:05,840
sorry

5244
02:36:02,159 --> 02:36:08,879
but importantly it's it's not that great

5245
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:10,960
of a thing to use

5246
02:36:08,879 --> 02:36:13,039
in most cases i would say because it

5247
02:36:10,959 --> 02:36:16,318
slides

5248
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:17,840
it doesn't you can probably invent a few

5249
02:36:16,318 --> 02:36:20,159
interesting

5250
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:21,200
ways to use it as leverage as control

5251
02:36:20,159 --> 02:36:23,280
and so on

5252
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:25,359
but there's just so many more things

5253
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:27,600
around that are better built better

5254
02:36:25,359 --> 02:36:28,720
better yeah and so for me the time when

5255
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:30,399
people don't realize

5256
02:36:28,719 --> 02:36:31,920
i suppose are we trying to sell a dvd

5257
02:36:30,398 --> 02:36:33,279
here and have some some widgets and

5258
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:34,639
bells and whistles because in that case

5259
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:35,920
the belt is really important part of

5260
02:36:34,639 --> 02:36:37,279
what we do and i would really encourage

5261
02:36:35,920 --> 02:36:39,280
you guys to look into it yeah

5262
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:40,399
uh if we're trying to actually like

5263
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:41,760
learn something and say

5264
02:36:40,398 --> 02:36:43,519
like you said we're surrounded by better

5265
02:36:41,760 --> 02:36:44,639
options well that's the thing i mean

5266
02:36:43,520 --> 02:36:47,359
it's not obvious to me

5267
02:36:44,639 --> 02:36:49,599
that the belt maybe there's actually

5268
02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:51,040
undiscovered things about using the belt

5269
02:36:49,600 --> 02:36:52,960
you know i think people have used like

5270
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:53,680
like putting a foot inside the belt

5271
02:36:52,959 --> 02:36:55,438
somehow

5272
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:57,040
inside inside the keyboard there's some

5273
02:36:55,439 --> 02:36:57,920
this is a no punches ski grappling

5274
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:59,200
situation yes

5275
02:36:57,920 --> 02:37:00,879
okay yeah i guess so it's already fairly

5276
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:01,680
contrived right but with punches too

5277
02:37:00,879 --> 02:37:03,119
like is there

5278
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:04,800
okay let's let's talk about a street

5279
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:06,960
fight with a belt that's like a jeans

5280
02:37:04,799 --> 02:37:08,318
belt like a belt clothing belt okay so i

5281
02:37:06,959 --> 02:37:09,919
get to take it off and whip them in the

5282
02:37:08,318 --> 02:37:11,519
face of the buckle

5283
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:13,840
how serious is this street fight are we

5284
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:15,600

oh yikes whoa okay oh you you ever

5288
02:37:20,239 --> 02:37:24,239
like i i'm in this situation all the

5289
02:37:22,079 --> 02:37:24,239
time

5290
02:37:24,318 --> 02:37:27,439
and there's a reason i'm still here i

5291
02:37:26,159 --> 02:37:28,398
had something

5292
02:37:27,439 --> 02:37:30,159
i saw we tried to fight with the

5293
02:37:28,398 --> 02:37:31,119
starbucks we were talking about power

5294
02:37:30,159 --> 02:37:32,719
differentials yeah

5295
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:34,479
hey beat up kids all the time just pick

5296
02:37:32,719 --> 02:37:35,199
the easy w you got to get the ecws you

5297
02:37:34,478 --> 02:37:36,639
want the hardware

5298
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:38,319
i'm undefeated come around the

5299
02:37:36,639 --> 02:37:38,559
playground watch what happens no like to

5300
02:37:38,318 --> 02:37:41,359
the

5301
02:37:38,559 --> 02:37:42,959
to the death what is their clothing

5302
02:37:41,359 --> 02:37:44,880
that's useful

5303
02:37:42,959 --> 02:37:46,398
you know they're from my perspective for

5304
02:37:44,879 --> 02:37:49,679
your use or their use

5305
02:37:46,398 --> 02:37:52,478
uh both am i used to their use no like

5306
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:54,159
i like how you want to take the belt off

5307
02:37:52,478 --> 02:37:55,438
and use the buckle to hit them with but

5308
02:37:54,159 --> 02:37:55,680
first of all how you're gonna take off

5309
02:37:55,439 --> 02:37:57,439
the

5310
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:58,880
like the belt well there's a lot of

5311
02:37:57,439 --> 02:38:01,680
effort involved in

5312
02:37:58,879 --> 02:38:02,959
unclothing well what i was figuring was

5313
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:04,559
when they started to see me take my

5314
02:38:02,959 --> 02:38:06,239
pants off in the fight they were like

5315
02:38:04,559 --> 02:38:07,680
what they're going to pause and rethink

5316
02:38:06,239 --> 02:38:09,119
the situation for a second

5317
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:11,439
yes and i'm making dead eye contact

5318
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:12,880
obviously yeah exactly

5319
02:38:11,439 --> 02:38:14,559
nodding and then you know by the time

5320
02:38:12,879 --> 02:38:15,839
they realized you took a belt off until

5321
02:38:14,559 --> 02:38:16,959
you could whip them with it yeah you

5322
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:19,200
actually you're already

5323
02:38:16,959 --> 02:38:20,719
one possibly two steps ahead okay so

5324
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:21,840
fine let's not talk about your own

5325
02:38:20,719 --> 02:38:22,879
clothing let's talk about their clothes

5326
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:23,439
okay i'll take off their belt and hit

5327
02:38:22,879 --> 02:38:25,519
them with it

5328
02:38:23,439 --> 02:38:26,960
no but that's that's much harder no

5329
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:28,079
question but if you can do it oh i'm

5330
02:38:26,959 --> 02:38:31,599
maintaining i got no

5331
02:38:28,079 --> 02:38:33,920
i just [ __ ] how did it come to this

5332
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:35,120
there's alt but the point is there's

5333
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:37,600
alternatives that are

5334
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:39,600
perhaps more effective yeah in my

5335
02:38:37,600 --> 02:38:42,559
perspective this might be clueless

5336
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:43,760
there's almost no clothing that's more

5337
02:38:42,559 --> 02:38:45,680
effective than

5338
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:46,880
almost assuming the situation is no gee

5339
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:49,920
grappling

5340
02:38:46,879 --> 02:38:51,119
like i feel like clothing particularly

5341
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:52,398
when you start to add hitting

5342
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:53,760
like every single time i start grabbing

5343
02:38:52,398 --> 02:38:55,039
your clothes if you start you start

5344
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:55,520
hitting it's not like nothing could work

5345
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:56,800
but

5346
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:58,800
most of the time you're like why am i

5347
02:38:56,799 --> 02:39:00,559
not using my arms for something better

5348
02:38:58,799 --> 02:39:04,239
than what i'm doing them right now

5349
02:39:00,559 --> 02:39:06,239
right yeah it's very difficult for me to

5350
02:39:04,239 --> 02:39:08,079
i don't know in terms of just distance i

5351
02:39:06,239 --> 02:39:11,359
can't imagine a case of different

5352
02:39:08,079 --> 02:39:13,840
distances even like situations where

5353
02:39:11,359 --> 02:39:15,920
let's not talk about like like a

5354
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:18,639
situation where you haven't both yet

5355
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:20,159
agreed that a fight is happening

5356
02:39:18,639 --> 02:39:22,478
solid clothing's nice if they have it on

5357
02:39:20,159 --> 02:39:23,760
then i mean solid clothing oh yeah like

5358
02:39:22,478 --> 02:39:24,000
something like a good jacket because you

5359
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:26,559
can

5360
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,920
snatch somebody on their face yeah you

5361
02:39:26,559 --> 02:39:29,519
know it's like if you if you took my

5362
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:31,359
like you know like he snapped down in

5363
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:32,000
judo like how easy it is to snap down a

5364
02:39:31,359 --> 02:39:34,399
beginner

5365
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:36,000
yeah it's like so i agree with you

5366
02:39:34,398 --> 02:39:38,000
actually a tie in that sense might be a

5367
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:40,239
really effective way to snap down so the

5368
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,280
snapdown is really powerful to change

5369
02:39:40,239 --> 02:39:43,920
the

5370
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:45,600
like disorient the situation and give

5371
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:48,079
you a lot of different opportunities

5372
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:49,359
for you know taking their back taking

5373
02:39:48,079 --> 02:39:50,959
them down

5374
02:39:49,359 --> 02:39:52,640
doing hilarious stuff like snapping them

5375
02:39:50,959 --> 02:39:53,919
down with their tie into your knee

5376
02:39:52,639 --> 02:39:55,760
and then when they come back up doing

5377
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:57,520
this and you're already so yeah

5378
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:59,120
in that sense i agree but not as a

5379
02:39:57,520 --> 02:40:00,800
choking mechanism because the effect

5380
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:02,160
of joe had is a choke i think you would

5381
02:40:00,799 --> 02:40:03,199
probably choke me with your tie more

5382
02:40:02,159 --> 02:40:04,719
easily than i could choke you with your

5383
02:40:03,200 --> 02:40:06,079
tongue probably i'm serious because like

5384
02:40:04,719 --> 02:40:07,119
if you get you can get like you get my

5385
02:40:06,079 --> 02:40:08,559
back and you can

5386
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:10,880
put it around somebody's neck you know

5387
02:40:08,559 --> 02:40:11,359
like uh like like you ever see a die

5388
02:40:10,879 --> 02:40:13,920
hard

5389
02:40:11,359 --> 02:40:15,439
yeah yeah you remember when the super uh

5390
02:40:13,920 --> 02:40:17,120
swedish looking blonde dude or whatever

5391
02:40:15,439 --> 02:40:18,000
was was trying to choke bruce willis

5392
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:19,600
with the uh

5393
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,879
with the chain and then he ended up

5394
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:21,920
getting choked himself with the chain if

5395
02:40:20,879 --> 02:40:24,159
i recall this properly

5396
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:25,840
but anyway yeah like like that but uh

5397
02:40:24,159 --> 02:40:27,039
yeah i don't feel like i feel like if i

5398
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:29,920
start grabbing your tie

5399
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:31,439
you have too many other great options i

5400
02:40:29,920 --> 02:40:32,719
mean i do like the snap down that you

5401
02:40:31,439 --> 02:40:33,279
actually made me realize no i think

5402
02:40:32,719 --> 02:40:34,719
you're

5403
02:40:33,279 --> 02:40:36,560
good there what's that i think you're on

5404
02:40:34,719 --> 02:40:37,679
the right path with it with a snapdragon

5405
02:40:36,559 --> 02:40:39,039
yeah particularly if you start with like

5406
02:40:37,680 --> 02:40:40,318
one of these like you know like

5407
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:42,240
like you like you poke your finger in my

5408
02:40:40,318 --> 02:40:44,799
chest and then snap down real quick

5409
02:40:42,239 --> 02:40:45,279
oh yeah because it it also socially

5410
02:40:44,799 --> 02:40:47,599
speaking

5411
02:40:45,279 --> 02:40:48,319
it's not a threatening thing to just you

5412
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:49,680
know to

5413
02:40:48,318 --> 02:40:50,959
to reach for the tide it's not

5414
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:51,359
particularly like a business setting you

5415
02:40:50,959 --> 02:40:53,679
know i mean

5416
02:40:51,359 --> 02:40:54,640
they'll never see it coming yeah because

5417
02:40:53,680 --> 02:40:56,559
i was thinking choke

5418
02:40:54,639 --> 02:40:58,559
but it's not it's a really good leverage

5419
02:40:56,559 --> 02:41:00,079
point because like grabbing a jacket the

5420
02:40:58,559 --> 02:41:00,639
jacket will slide if you try to snap

5421
02:41:00,079 --> 02:41:02,398
down

5422
02:41:00,639 --> 02:41:03,519
you really have to get a whole like a

5423
02:41:02,398 --> 02:41:04,318
really good hold well that's a good

5424
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:05,520
point because around the back and the

5425
02:41:04,318 --> 02:41:06,799
neck what if it's a clip on

5426
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:09,040
how much of a jackass would you look

5427
02:41:06,799 --> 02:41:09,438
like you feel like and then they just

5428
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:10,399
yeah

5429
02:41:09,439 --> 02:41:12,159
they stick you one would you ever see

5430
02:41:10,398 --> 02:41:13,760
the uh japanese politician or i think it

5431
02:41:12,159 --> 02:41:15,600
was japan

5432
02:41:13,760 --> 02:41:17,040
yeah it was that guy is so he was so

5433
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:19,279
calm and cool had

5434
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:20,399
like it was ever it was beautiful

5435
02:41:19,279 --> 02:41:22,319
technique

5436
02:41:20,398 --> 02:41:24,318
the level of uh of actually the throw

5437
02:41:22,318 --> 02:41:26,879
was even gentle yeah but uh yeah it was

5438
02:41:24,318 --> 02:41:28,559
perfect it's amazing well executed yeah

5439
02:41:26,879 --> 02:41:29,839
more of our politicians you just toss

5440
02:41:28,559 --> 02:41:31,199
the [ __ ] out of it yeah we need more

5441
02:41:29,840 --> 02:41:32,639
teddy roosevelt

5442
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:33,920
exactly i like our politicians like

5443
02:41:32,639 --> 02:41:34,959
talking about fighting when it's clear

5444
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:37,040
that none of them even

5445
02:41:34,959 --> 02:41:38,639
it would ever have been in a fight ever

5446
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:39,359
yeah somebody was saying teddy roosevelt

5447
02:41:38,639 --> 02:41:41,519
is interesting

5448
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:44,079
i didn't realize this as he's one of the

5449
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:46,000
greatest presidents this country's had

5450
02:41:44,079 --> 02:41:47,520
and he was one of the greatest

5451
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:50,079
presidents even though he faced

5452
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:50,880
no crisis whatsoever he literally willed

5453
02:41:50,079 --> 02:41:52,159
himself

5454
02:41:50,879 --> 02:41:54,959
like nothing happened during his

5455
02:41:52,159 --> 02:41:57,039
presidency he's just a bad [ __ ]

5456
02:41:54,959 --> 02:41:58,159
who made really great speeches yeah so

5457
02:41:57,040 --> 02:42:00,800
you like you know

5458
02:41:58,159 --> 02:42:03,119
uh this made me realize i was just

5459
02:42:00,799 --> 02:42:04,639
talking to a historian that like

5460
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:06,880
most of the people who we think are

5461
02:42:04,639 --> 02:42:07,358
great need also a good crisis that

5462
02:42:06,879 --> 02:42:09,519
they've

5463
02:42:07,359 --> 02:42:11,760
that reveal their greatness but muhammad

5464
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:12,640
ali right this muhammad ali i mean in

5465
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:13,920
sports

5466
02:42:12,639 --> 02:42:15,358
but but you know what i mean like the

5467
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:16,639
circumstances what is greatness you know

5468
02:42:15,359 --> 02:42:18,399
i mean it's like you have to

5469
02:42:16,639 --> 02:42:20,239
it's not just your capacity it's what

5470
02:42:18,398 --> 02:42:21,920
you what you face right it's a quality

5471
02:42:20,239 --> 02:42:22,719
of opposition circumstance what you

5472
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:24,079
overcome

5473
02:42:22,719 --> 02:42:26,799
so i guess what you're saying is joe

5474
02:42:24,079 --> 02:42:28,000
rogan is wrong about the thai thing

5475
02:42:26,799 --> 02:42:29,519
you know i don't want to go so far as

5476
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:31,120
saying is wrong you know the man is not

5477
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:32,399
here to defend himself maybe he has some

5478
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:32,880
things that i'm not understanding i'm

5479
02:42:32,398 --> 02:42:34,398
willing

5480
02:42:32,879 --> 02:42:36,398
he has not deeply thought that this is

5481
02:42:34,398 --> 02:42:37,199
my main criticism of joe he's not deeply

5482
02:42:36,398 --> 02:42:39,199
thought to this

5483
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:41,840
and the mma journalist would be like

5484
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:42,640
ryan hall says joe rogan is wrong and

5485
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:45,840
hates ties

5486
02:42:42,639 --> 02:42:46,719
and has ties they'll integrate hitler

5487
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:50,398
back in there

5488
02:42:46,719 --> 02:42:51,920
somehow nice what's uh you talking about

5489
02:42:50,398 --> 02:42:54,478
greatness

5490
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:55,359
and greatness requiring a difficult

5491
02:42:54,478 --> 02:42:58,239
moment

5492
02:42:55,359 --> 02:42:58,960
in time can you like reflect back and

5493
02:42:58,239 --> 02:43:01,199
think

5494
02:42:58,959 --> 02:43:02,639
what are some of the hardest if not the

5495
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:04,240
hardest thing you've ever had to do in

5496
02:43:02,639 --> 02:43:06,318
your life

5497
02:43:04,239 --> 02:43:07,520
well you know i think i've had a bunch

5498
02:43:06,318 --> 02:43:08,719
of things you know i've had a lot of

5499
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:10,159
things not going my way

5500
02:43:08,719 --> 02:43:11,920
um you know i've been incredibly

5501
02:43:10,159 --> 02:43:13,119
fortunate i've had a lot of things go my

5502
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:16,478
way also

5503
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:17,439
um but uh leaving leaving teamwork urban

5504
02:43:16,478 --> 02:43:19,840
in 2008

5505
02:43:17,439 --> 02:43:20,720
which i firmly believe was the right

5506
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:23,760
thing to do

5507
02:43:20,719 --> 02:43:25,679
um is one of the uh

5508
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:27,439
that was very difficult at the time not

5509
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:28,318
like not a difficult choice but it was

5510
02:43:27,439 --> 02:43:31,520
uh because of

5511
02:43:28,318 --> 02:43:32,079
why i was leaving but um psychologically

5512
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:34,319
first of all

5513
02:43:32,079 --> 02:43:36,239
lost in general leaving yeah team a

5514
02:43:34,318 --> 02:43:37,920
family of all kinds doesn't matter what

5515
02:43:36,239 --> 02:43:39,199
the circumstances i didn't lose any

5516
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:40,159
friends but i lost a lot of people i

5517
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:43,279
thought were my friends

5518
02:43:40,159 --> 02:43:45,200
and i uh i lost training i lost i had

5519
02:43:43,279 --> 02:43:46,560
also had like a really serious my wrist

5520
02:43:45,200 --> 02:43:49,680
only does that

5521
02:43:46,559 --> 02:43:51,439
so like uh at a really serious uh

5522
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:52,720
wrist surgery like that i didn't know if

5523
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:54,398
i was gonna be able to compete anymore

5524
02:43:52,719 --> 02:43:55,278
after that i just got my brown belt that

5525
02:43:54,398 --> 02:43:57,119
was uh

5526
02:43:55,279 --> 02:43:58,800
it was a tough time like uh

5527
02:43:57,120 --> 02:44:00,640
psychologically physically everything

5528
02:43:58,799 --> 02:44:03,119
but i was very very motivated to do my

5529
02:44:00,639 --> 02:44:04,719
best and to push through it and to uh

5530
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:06,720
just to carry on in a positive direction

5531
02:44:04,719 --> 02:44:09,519
no matter what in a different direction

5532
02:44:06,719 --> 02:44:11,438
and uh we lonely this is the thing about

5533
02:44:09,520 --> 02:44:12,560
family even if it's an abusive family

5534
02:44:11,439 --> 02:44:15,040
leaving

5535
02:44:12,559 --> 02:44:16,719
it's tough people are complicated and

5536
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:18,720
even people that i that i don't think

5537
02:44:16,719 --> 02:44:20,398
very well of that i think on the whole

5538
02:44:18,719 --> 02:44:23,519
i don't think very well of it's it's

5539
02:44:20,398 --> 02:44:25,358
unfair to paint them with one brush

5540
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:26,960
um you know obviously there's greater

5541
02:44:25,359 --> 02:44:28,800
and lesser examples of that like the

5542
02:44:26,959 --> 02:44:30,879
person we discussed last time who's

5543
02:44:28,799 --> 02:44:32,079
an infinitely you know beyond almost

5544
02:44:30,879 --> 02:44:33,679
anyone that we could ever imagine

5545
02:44:32,079 --> 02:44:36,799
meeting in our own personal lives

5546
02:44:33,680 --> 02:44:40,000
yeah yeah bloody elbow

5547
02:44:36,799 --> 02:44:40,879
yeah in terms of forgiveness and hate i

5548
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:43,200
mean do you

5549
02:44:40,879 --> 02:44:44,478
do you have hate in your heart for for

5550
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:46,720
people in your past

5551
02:44:44,478 --> 02:44:47,920
i don't know for that process no i mean

5552
02:44:46,719 --> 02:44:48,318
there were definitely times where i've

5553
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:50,639
been

5554
02:44:48,318 --> 02:44:51,760
negatively motivated to prove people

5555
02:44:50,639 --> 02:44:52,959
wrong or to

5556
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:55,760
accomplish things in spite and i think

5557
02:44:52,959 --> 02:44:57,119
that some of that is valuable if i'd be

5558
02:44:55,760 --> 02:44:59,680
lying if i felt differently

5559
02:44:57,120 --> 02:45:00,880
i think particularly uh i do really well

5560
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:02,720
in conflict

5561
02:45:00,879 --> 02:45:04,239
um i'm useless without the usual

5562
02:45:02,719 --> 02:45:04,719
deadline thing i'm used to yeah i'm

5563
02:45:04,239 --> 02:45:06,799
using

5564
02:45:04,719 --> 02:45:08,719
chaos i'm using i do i'm used to that an

5565
02:45:06,799 --> 02:45:11,519
antagonist i like fighting

5566
02:45:08,719 --> 02:45:13,119
i like competition i like being pushed i

5567
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:14,319
like feeling like if i don't play well

5568
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:16,479
i'm going to get hurt

5569
02:45:14,318 --> 02:45:18,079
i mean i have no choice but to play well

5570
02:45:16,478 --> 02:45:19,199
i'd play with everything i got at the

5571
02:45:18,079 --> 02:45:19,840
very least and i guess i would say

5572
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:22,720
though

5573
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:23,600
is uh you know as i've gotten uh you

5574
02:45:22,719 --> 02:45:25,840
know more time

5575
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:27,040
and you know lived a little bit longer

5576
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:30,239
you see

5577
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:33,279
you know various situations for uh

5578
02:45:30,239 --> 02:45:34,799
you know you know with increased uh

5579
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:36,399
increased color i guess i would say

5580
02:45:34,799 --> 02:45:40,000
increased clarity and

5581
02:45:36,398 --> 02:45:41,920
uh you know there are a lot of

5582
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:43,600
lessons to be learned even from from

5583
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:44,799
times in history or bad experience that

5584
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:46,559
we have and the question is can we take

5585
02:45:44,799 --> 02:45:47,679
those lessons and move forward

5586
02:45:46,559 --> 02:45:50,000
and that's again what i think we're

5587
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:51,439
seeing and sometimes socially right now

5588
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:53,600
we're forgetting important lessons of

5589
02:45:51,439 --> 02:45:55,920
the past and that's not good

5590
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:57,439
not saying hey i don't get why we why we

5591
02:45:55,920 --> 02:45:59,040
could be going in this direction or that

5592
02:45:57,439 --> 02:46:01,040
i understand entirely but

5593
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:02,319
hey let's not forget the lesson so we

5594
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:04,399
don't have to learn them again

5595
02:46:02,318 --> 02:46:06,318
because that doesn't really serve

5596
02:46:04,398 --> 02:46:07,840
anybody and anyway i guess i would say

5597
02:46:06,318 --> 02:46:10,159
i'm thankful for all of the

5598
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:11,600
experiences difficult and otherwise

5599
02:46:10,159 --> 02:46:13,119
mostly difficult honestly most of the

5600
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:14,079
times i remember i'm thankful for every

5601
02:46:13,120 --> 02:46:16,319
loss i've ever had

5602
02:46:14,079 --> 02:46:17,200
particularly the tough ones i'm thankful

5603
02:46:16,318 --> 02:46:19,119
for uh

5604
02:46:17,200 --> 02:46:20,159
you know for all the relationships many

5605
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:21,439
people have taught me many things and

5606
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:22,799
continue to teach them anything some of

5607
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:24,079
them are still some of my closest

5608
02:46:22,799 --> 02:46:25,438
friends some of whom are people i really

5609
02:46:24,079 --> 02:46:26,478
don't get along with at all and some of

5610
02:46:25,439 --> 02:46:29,520
whom are people

5611
02:46:26,478 --> 02:46:30,719
i think really poorly of oh there's not

5612
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:32,960
many of that last group

5613
02:46:30,719 --> 02:46:34,239
what i guess i would say is uh there's

5614
02:46:32,959 --> 02:46:37,039
there's been a lot of

5615
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:37,439
things and opportunities to learn and uh

5616
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:38,960
you know

5617
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:40,720
throughout that and also it's not as if

5618
02:46:38,959 --> 02:46:41,358
i've never done made any mistakes myself

5619
02:46:40,719 --> 02:46:43,599
now again

5620
02:46:41,359 --> 02:46:45,439
they're magnitude differences i like to

5621
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:46,720
think and i can definitely say that none

5622
02:46:45,439 --> 02:46:48,479
of the mistakes that i've ever made have

5623
02:46:46,719 --> 02:46:49,679
been mistakes of intention

5624
02:46:48,478 --> 02:46:52,079
you know i've screwed up a lot of things

5625
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:53,520
in my life but i can confidently and and

5626
02:46:52,079 --> 02:46:55,120
easily say that i've never

5627
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:56,560
had ill intent towards people as i've

5628
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:57,439
done it so you sit there like man this

5629
02:46:56,559 --> 02:46:58,959
is the right thing it's the right thing

5630
02:46:57,439 --> 02:47:01,359
and sometimes i've been wrong

5631
02:46:58,959 --> 02:47:03,119
but uh you know you never sit out with

5632
02:47:01,359 --> 02:47:04,960
malicious intent and i think that

5633
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:06,720
when i find that i think people do

5634
02:47:04,959 --> 02:47:07,839
things differently when i do think that

5635
02:47:06,719 --> 02:47:09,519
there's malicious intent i have a

5636
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:13,520
difficult time forgiving that

5637
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:16,159
how does love win over hate ryan hall

5638
02:47:13,520 --> 02:47:17,520
in this world we talk about social media

5639
02:47:16,159 --> 02:47:21,119
we talk about

5640
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:23,760
forgiveness of uh some of the more

5641
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:27,520
complicated people in your past

5642
02:47:23,760 --> 02:47:30,719
uh if we scale that to the entire world

5643
02:47:27,520 --> 02:47:32,640
before the ai destroys us and although

5644
02:47:30,719 --> 02:47:35,119
the human race is lost

5645
02:47:32,639 --> 02:47:35,760
to history how do you think love wins

5646
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:37,680
over hate

5647
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:39,680
well i'd like to preface this by saying

5648
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:43,120
i tried to make pancakes the other day

5649
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:46,079
yes it didn't work

5650
02:47:43,120 --> 02:47:47,200
but i'm happy to comment on this so uh

5651
02:47:46,079 --> 02:47:49,760
basically uh

5652
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:50,560
wow i i think like i think most of the

5653
02:47:49,760 --> 02:47:53,040
times

5654
02:47:50,559 --> 02:47:54,478
that that i can think of that i've

5655
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:57,200
struggled

5656
02:47:54,478 --> 02:47:58,879
you know it's uh and can and the times

5657
02:47:57,200 --> 02:48:00,720
that i've read about is

5658
02:47:58,879 --> 02:48:02,318
being unable to see the humanity in

5659
02:48:00,719 --> 02:48:03,920
other people and also

5660
02:48:02,318 --> 02:48:05,439
even in sometimes our enemies and the

5661
02:48:03,920 --> 02:48:06,719
people that have done awful things and

5662
02:48:05,439 --> 02:48:09,200
you go

5663
02:48:06,719 --> 02:48:10,799
what would allow people to do this that

5664
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:12,640
or the other and that doesn't forgive

5665
02:48:10,799 --> 02:48:13,920
what they've done depending upon you

5666
02:48:12,639 --> 02:48:14,799
know some things are forgivable some

5667
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:16,639
things are less so

5668
02:48:14,799 --> 02:48:18,719
but you want to understand why it's like

5669
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:19,358
to our knowledge demons don't populate

5670
02:48:18,719 --> 02:48:22,159
our world

5671
02:48:19,359 --> 02:48:24,000
neither do like literal angels walking

5672
02:48:22,159 --> 02:48:25,920
around being actually perfect

5673
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:27,120
a lot of times the things that it's i

5674
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:28,719
find it deeply amusing

5675
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:30,160
watching you know people hoisted by

5676
02:48:28,719 --> 02:48:32,239
their own batard on twitter even though

5677
02:48:30,159 --> 02:48:34,159
it's gross and it's really unproductive

5678
02:48:32,239 --> 02:48:35,680
it's actually like equal parts amusing

5679
02:48:34,159 --> 02:48:37,600
and like awful because you're not you're

5680
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:38,760
not happy that someone's being raked

5681
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:40,640
over the coals particularly

5682
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:42,639
unjustifiably

5683
02:48:40,639 --> 02:48:44,000
but it is funny when it's the exact same

5684
02:48:42,639 --> 02:48:45,840
thing they were raking others over the

5685
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,719
coals for not like a week or two prior

5686
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:48,239
and that's happened

5687
02:48:46,719 --> 02:48:49,760
repeatedly and will continue to happen

5688
02:48:48,239 --> 02:48:52,159
and i guess i would say

5689
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:54,000
as you mentioned you know a uh prior you

5690
02:48:52,159 --> 02:48:55,039
know like a recognition of the humanity

5691
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:57,200
of others of that

5692
02:48:55,040 --> 02:48:58,880
all of us make mistakes that it's

5693
02:48:57,200 --> 02:49:00,479
difficult to understand intention i've

5694
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:01,519
had arguments with close friends of mine

5695
02:49:00,478 --> 02:49:03,840
over text message

5696
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:05,279
where both of us ended up super pissed

5697
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:07,600
because we were completely

5698
02:49:05,279 --> 02:49:08,880
misreading what the tone the intention

5699
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:10,479
of what the other person was doing and

5700
02:49:08,879 --> 02:49:12,799
even if i was reading it correctly

5701
02:49:10,478 --> 02:49:14,000
which i wasn't it's so easy to uh

5702
02:49:12,799 --> 02:49:16,879
ascribe the most

5703
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:17,680
negative possible you know the least

5704
02:49:16,879 --> 02:49:19,039
charitable

5705
02:49:17,680 --> 02:49:21,200
assessment of what they're doing and i

5706
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:22,720
think that that's such a dangerous way

5707
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:24,079
to live your life and it's also just a

5708
02:49:22,719 --> 02:49:25,840
fruitless way to live your life

5709
02:49:24,079 --> 02:49:27,279
you know it's one thing to go hey why

5710
02:49:25,840 --> 02:49:28,799
did you do that i was pissed

5711
02:49:27,279 --> 02:49:30,000
did you what did you do you just you did

5712
02:49:28,799 --> 02:49:31,199
that to make yourself feel better like

5713
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:34,079
you damn right i did

5714
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:35,359
and have i done that plenty of times my

5715
02:49:34,079 --> 02:49:35,840
life yeah i would lie if i said that i

5716
02:49:35,359 --> 02:49:37,439
didn't

5717
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:38,880
you know uh why did why did you punch

5718
02:49:37,439 --> 02:49:40,000
that guy in the face he was going crazy

5719
02:49:38,879 --> 02:49:41,920
at me and hit me and i asked

5720
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:43,359
him to stop and then i gave a warning

5721
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:44,318
and i'd put him on his ass i'm like no

5722
02:49:43,359 --> 02:49:47,040
i'm not sorry

5723
02:49:44,318 --> 02:49:48,159
but then looking back now with years to

5724
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:49,920
sit on him like

5725
02:49:48,159 --> 02:49:51,279
do i understand why i did what i did

5726
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:53,120
absolutely

5727
02:49:51,279 --> 02:49:55,279
would i like to respond differently now

5728
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:55,840
yeah i would you know it and it doesn't

5729
02:49:55,279 --> 02:49:57,760
mean that

5730
02:49:55,840 --> 02:49:59,200
i think plenty of things that people do

5731
02:49:57,760 --> 02:50:01,120
are understandable

5732
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:03,040
doesn't mean understandable doesn't mean

5733
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:04,720
correct understandable doesn't mean that

5734
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:06,640
you go oh yeah that's great you go i

5735
02:50:04,719 --> 02:50:07,760
could i could see someone doing such a

5736
02:50:06,639 --> 02:50:09,119
thing

5737
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:10,639
but i guess just wrecking trying to

5738
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:11,120
understand and see the humanity in

5739
02:50:10,639 --> 02:50:12,559
others

5740
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:14,399
because if i can't see the humanity in

5741
02:50:12,559 --> 02:50:16,398
others how can i see it in myself

5742
02:50:14,398 --> 02:50:17,760
and also you know how am i meant to

5743
02:50:16,398 --> 02:50:18,239
interact with everyone as you said

5744
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:19,840
whether

5745
02:50:18,239 --> 02:50:21,279
you know even if we're a society of

5746
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:22,000
individuals for at least for the time

5747
02:50:21,279 --> 02:50:24,720
being hopefully

5748
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:26,318
you know in perpetuity we still come

5749
02:50:24,719 --> 02:50:29,119
together as a whole

5750
02:50:26,318 --> 02:50:32,079
and watching it's weird like you said

5751
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:33,279
it's if i only ask why once i start with

5752
02:50:32,079 --> 02:50:34,719
stay out of my way and i'll stay out of

5753
02:50:33,279 --> 02:50:35,520
yours leave me the [ __ ] alone you're

5754
02:50:34,719 --> 02:50:37,199
like okay

5755
02:50:35,520 --> 02:50:38,800
that's fine ryan but that's easy for you

5756
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:40,319
to say living in a society that doesn't

5757
02:50:38,799 --> 02:50:42,159
actually function like that

5758
02:50:40,318 --> 02:50:43,840
so it's a little bit cheap but if i

5759
02:50:42,159 --> 02:50:45,279
recognize that that's step one is i

5760
02:50:43,840 --> 02:50:48,159
don't hurt you and you don't hurt me but

5761
02:50:45,279 --> 02:50:50,000
then we go well but how can i help you

5762
02:50:48,159 --> 02:50:51,200
that's step two and then it goes way

5763
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,079
beyond that and a lot further than i've

5764
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:53,600
thought about it but i guess what i

5765
02:50:52,079 --> 02:50:55,039
would just say is again recognition of

5766
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:56,880
the humanity and others

5767
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:57,920
and that we all have different strengths

5768
02:50:56,879 --> 02:50:59,199
we all have different weaknesses and

5769
02:50:57,920 --> 02:51:00,318
it's you can never really be sure where

5770
02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:01,200
the other person is coming from but if

5771
02:51:00,318 --> 02:51:03,199
we approach things

5772
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:05,520
charitably as charitably as we would

5773
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:06,720
hope others would approach us

5774
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:08,239
i think we'll do a lot better and i

5775
02:51:06,719 --> 02:51:09,358
guess one thing that i read that i liked

5776
02:51:08,239 --> 02:51:11,119
that i thought was accurate and

5777
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:11,840
unfortunately disappointing was everyone

5778
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:14,160
is a great

5779
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:15,680
uh you know jury or their i'm sorry a

5780
02:51:14,159 --> 02:51:17,200
great lawyer for themselves and a judge

5781
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:18,318
for others

5782
02:51:17,200 --> 02:51:19,760
and i think that's a terrible way to

5783
02:51:18,318 --> 02:51:20,318
live life even if it's an understandable

5784
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:21,520
one

5785
02:51:20,318 --> 02:51:23,439
yeah i don't know what's happening and

5786
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:24,640
then probably flipping that is the right

5787
02:51:23,439 --> 02:51:27,120
way to live

5788
02:51:24,639 --> 02:51:28,478
being uh being constantly judgmental of

5789
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:30,479
yourself

5790
02:51:28,478 --> 02:51:31,760
and a defender of others and that

5791
02:51:30,478 --> 02:51:34,559
results ultimately in

5792
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:35,279
interaction that de-escalates versus

5793
02:51:34,559 --> 02:51:37,359
escalates

5794
02:51:35,279 --> 02:51:38,640
right yeah and you can you can we can

5795
02:51:37,359 --> 02:51:39,920
all live in a world like that and

5796
02:51:38,639 --> 02:51:41,599
sometimes you're like hey man people

5797
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:43,359
that deserve punishment won't get it

5798
02:51:41,600 --> 02:51:45,200
like okay hey what do they say better to

5799
02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:46,880
have you know 10 guilty people go free

5800
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:50,240
then one innocent person you know

5801
02:51:46,879 --> 02:51:51,920
burn and ultimately that is i think that

5802
02:51:50,239 --> 02:51:53,279
is a better world than the other way

5803
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:56,318
around

5804
02:51:53,279 --> 02:51:58,319
and if all else fails uh

5805
02:51:56,318 --> 02:52:00,159
join the team that builds the ai that

5806
02:51:58,318 --> 02:52:01,359
kills all humans yeah obviously i mean

5807
02:52:00,159 --> 02:52:02,159
if you have to be on a team pick the

5808
02:52:01,359 --> 02:52:03,520
winning team what

5809
02:52:02,159 --> 02:52:05,279
that's been the uh that's that's my

5810
02:52:03,520 --> 02:52:05,680
hiring pitch actually it's a good hiring

5811
02:52:05,279 --> 02:52:08,640
pitch

5812
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:10,800
you're still taking resumes you want to

5813
02:52:08,639 --> 02:52:12,239
be on the team that doesn't die

5814
02:52:10,799 --> 02:52:13,519
during the great apocalypse not

5815
02:52:12,239 --> 02:52:14,000
immediately you want to be on the one

5816
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:15,840
that that's

5817
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:17,040
uh you know eventually long suffering

5818
02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:19,680
and stepped on right

5819
02:52:17,040 --> 02:52:21,600
yeah life is suffering ryan hall this

5820
