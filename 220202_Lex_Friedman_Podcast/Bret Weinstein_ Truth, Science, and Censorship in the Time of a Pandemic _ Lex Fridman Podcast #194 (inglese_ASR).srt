1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,080
brett weinstein

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,600
evolutionary biologist author co-host of

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,280
the dark horse podcast

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,279
and as he says reluctant radical

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,279
even though we've never met or spoken

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,519
before this we both felt like

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,519
we've been friends for a long time i

9
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,160
don't agree on everything with brett

10
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:25,039
but i'm sure as hell happy he exists in

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,359
this weird and wonderful world of ours

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,840
quick mention of our sponsors jordan

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,399
harbinger show

14
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:34,000
expressvpn magic spoon and four sigmatic

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,759
check them out in the description to

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,759
support this podcast

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,199
as a side note let me say a few words

18
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,519
about covet 19

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
and about science broadly i think

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,520
science is beautiful

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,558
and powerful it is the striving of the

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,719
human mind

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,000
to understand and to solve the problems

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,320
of the world

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,238
but as an institution it is susceptible

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,320
to the flaws of human nature

27
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,718
to fear to greed power and ego

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,600
2020 is the story of all of these that

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,640
has both

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,680
scientific triumph and tragedy we needed

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,000
great leaders

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,680
and we didn't get them what we needed is

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,920
leaders who communicate in an

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,000
honest transparent and authentic way

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,000
about the uncertainty of what we know

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,519
and the large-scale scientific efforts

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,079
to reduce that uncertainty

38
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,679
and to develop solutions i believe there

39
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,118
are several candidates for solutions

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,520
that could have all saved

41
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,239
hundreds of billions of dollars and

42
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,798
lessened

43
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,078
or eliminated the suffering of millions

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,079
of people

45
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,759
let me mention five of the categories of

46
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,239
solutions masks

47
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,959
at home testing anonymized contact

48
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,000
tracing

49
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,919
antiviral drugs and vaccines within

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,078
each of these categories institutional

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,960
leaders should have constantly asked

52
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,879
and answered publicly honestly the

53
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,919
following three questions

54
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,599
one what data do we have on the solution

55
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,118
and what studies are we running to get

56
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,039
more and better data

57
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,879
two given the current data and

58
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,000
uncertainty how effective

59
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,158
and how safe is the solution three what

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,078
is the timeline and cost involved

61
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,359
with mass manufacturing distribution of

62
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,199
the solution

63
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,038
in the service of these questions no

64
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,919
voices should have been silenced

65
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,039
no ideas left off the table open data

66
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,958
open science

67
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,560
open honest scientific communication and

68
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,520
debate was the way

69
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,959
not censorship there are a lot of ideas

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,760
out there that are bad

71
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,719
wrong dangerous but the moment we have

72
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,840
the hubris

73
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,359
to say we know which ideas those are is

74
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,400
the moment we'll lose our ability to

75
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,200
find the truth

76
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,640
to find solutions the very things that

77
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,719
make science beautiful

78
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,559
and powerful in the face of all the

79
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,680
dangers that threaten the well-being and

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,239
the existence

81
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
of humans on earth this conversation

82
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,878
with brett

83
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,959
is less about the ideas we talk about we

84
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,199
agree on some disagree on others

85
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,239
it is much more about the very freedom

86
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,679
to talk

87
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,800
to think to share ideas this freedom

88
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,000
is our only hope brett should never have

89
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
been censored

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,360
i asked brad to do this podcast to show

91
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,239
solidarity

92
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,159
and to show that i have hope for science

93
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,239
and for humanity

94
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:11,679
this is the lex friedman podcast and

95
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,360
here's my conversation

96
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,000
with brett weinstein what to you

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,519
is beautiful about the study of biology

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,280
the science the engineering

99
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,280
the philosophy of it it's a very

100
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,318
interesting question i must say

101
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,598
at one level it's not a

102
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:31,439
conscious thing i can say a lot about

103
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,798
why as an adult i find biology

104
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,840
compelling but

105
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,280
as a kid i was completely fascinated

106
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,439
with animals i loved

107
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
to watch them and think about why they

108
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,878
did what they did

109
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,400
and that developed into a very conscious

110
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:51,199
passion as an adult but i think uh

111
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,760
in the same way that one is drawn to a

112
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,878
person

113
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:58,158
i was drawn to

114
00:03:54,878 --> 00:04:00,560
the never-ending series of

115
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,318
near-miracles that exists across

116
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,000
biological nature

117
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,679
when you see a living organism do you

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,318
see it from an

119
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,080
evolutionary biology perspective of like

120
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:10,798
this entire thing that moves around in

121
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,879
this world

122
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,159
or do you see like from an engineering

123
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,039
perspective

124
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,319
they're like uh first principles almost

125
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,079
down to the physics like the

126
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,560
little components that build up

127
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,680
hierarchies that you have cells if the

128
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,439
first proteins and cells and

129
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,800
organs and all that kind of stuff so do

130
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,719
you see low level or dc high level

131
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,600
well the human mind is a strange thing

132
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,639
and i think it's probably a bit like a

133
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,800
time sharing machine in which

134
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,960
i have different modules we don't know

135
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,360
enough about biology for them to connect

136
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,439
right so they exist in isolation and i'm

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,400
always aware that they do connect but i

138
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,839
basically have to

139
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:54,239
step into a module in order to see

140
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,159
the evolutionary dynamics of the

141
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,079
creature and the lineage that it belongs

142
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,360
to i have to step into a different

143
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,079
module to think of

144
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,240
that lineage over a very long time scale

145
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,399
a different module still to understand

146
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,840
what the mechanisms inside would have to

147
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,038
look like to account for

148
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:14,638
what we can see from the outside

149
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:18,240
and i think that probably sounds

150
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,079
really complicated but one of the things

151
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,038
about being

152
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,240
involved in a topic like biology and

153
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,000
doing so for

154
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,439
one you know really not even just my

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,240
adult life for my whole life

156
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,160
is that it becomes second nature and you

157
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,800
know when when we see somebody

158
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,600
do an amazing parkour routine or

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
something

160
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,840
like that we think about what they must

161
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
be doing

162
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,959
in order to accomplish that but of

163
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,160
course what they are doing

164
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,120
is tapping into some kind of zone right

165
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
they are

166
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,560
in a zone in which they are in such

167
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,600
um command of their center of gravity

168
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,160
for example

169
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,840
that they know how to hurl it around a

170
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,199
landscape so that they always

171
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:04,000
land on their feet and

172
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,960
i would just say for anyone who hasn't

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
found a topic

174
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,279
on which they can develop that kind of

175
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,918
facility it is

176
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,599
absolutely worthwhile it's really

177
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,159
something that human beings are capable

178
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,479
of doing

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,240
across a wide range of topics many

180
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,519
things our ancestors didn't even have

181
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,079
access to

182
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,359
and that flexibility of humans that

183
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,478
ability to

184
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,840
repurpose our machinery for

185
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,599
topics that are novel means really

186
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,119
the world is your oyster you can you can

187
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,759
figure out what your passion is and then

188
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,439
figure out

189
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,160
all of the angles that one would have to

190
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,879
pursue to really deeply understand it

191
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,720
and it is uh it is well worth having at

192
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,600
least one topic like that

193
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,639
you mean embracing the full adaptability

194
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,240
of the

195
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,918
both the the body and the mind so like

196
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,439
because i don't know what to attribute

197
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,519
to parkour too

198
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,478
like biomechanics of how our bodies can

199
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,279
move

200
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,079
or is it the mind like how much percent

201
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,198
wise

202
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,359
is it the entirety of the

203
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,879
hierarchies of biology that we've been

204
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,160
talking about or is it just

205
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,000
all the mind the way to think about

206
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,120
creatures is that every creature

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,240
is two things simultaneously a creature

208
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,038
is a machine of sorts right it's not a

209
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,038
machine in

210
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,159
in the you know it's it's i call it an

211
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:23,918
aqueous machine

212
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,360
right and it's run by an aqueous

213
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,079
computer right so it's not

214
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,960
identical to our our technological

215
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,839
machines

216
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,120
but every creature is both a machine

217
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,679
that does things in the world

218
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,120
sufficient to accumulate enough

219
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,240
resources to continue

220
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,439
surviving to reproduce it is also a

221
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,879
potential

222
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,560
so each creature is potentially

223
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,319
for example the most recent common

224
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,598
ancestor of some future clade of

225
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,479
creatures that will look very different

226
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,800
from it

227
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,000
and if a creature is very very good at

228
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,160
being a creature but

229
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,680
not very good in terms of the potential

230
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,479
it has going forward

231
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,319
then that lineage will not last very

232
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,439
long into the future because change

233
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,280
will uh throw at challenges that its

234
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,959
descendants will not be able to meet

235
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:14,159
so the thing about humans is we are

236
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,318
a generalist platform and

237
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,439
we have the ability to swap out our

238
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,720
software

239
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:23,759
to exist in many many different niches

240
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
and i was once watching a an interview

241
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,560
with

242
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,918
with this british group of parkour

243
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,160
experts who were

244
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,839
being you know just they were discussing

245
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
what it is they do and how it works and

246
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,240
what they essentially said is

247
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,839
look you're tapping into

248
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,680
deep monkey stuff right and i thought

249
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,800
yeah that's about right

250
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,278
and you know anybody who

251
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,958
is proficient at something like skiing

252
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:53,360
or skateboarding

253
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:56,239
you know has the experience of

254
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,039
flying down the hill on skis for example

255
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,839
bouncing

256
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,559
from the top of one mogul to the next

257
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,720
and

258
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,399
if you really pay attention you will

259
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,480
discover that your conscious mind is

260
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,320
actually a spectator it's there

261
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,920
it's involved in the experience but it's

262
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,278
not driving some part of you knows how

263
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,719
to ski and it's not the part of you that

264
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,399
knows how to think

265
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,278
and i would just say that the

266
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,839
what accounts for this flexibility in

267
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,000
humans

268
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,000
is the ability to bootstrap a new

269
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,720
software program

270
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,480
and then drive it into the unconscious

271
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,000
layer where it can be applied very

272
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,639
rapidly

273
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,278
and you know i will be shocked if the

274
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,240
exact

275
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,639
thing doesn't exist in robotics you know

276
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,399
if you

277
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,319
if you programmed a robot to deal with

278
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,679
circumstances that were novel to it how

279
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,040
would you do it it would have to look

280
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,599
something like this

281
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,079
there's a certain kind of magic you're

282
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,399
right

283
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,160
with the consciousness being an observer

284
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,919
when you play guitar for example

285
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,360
or piano for me music when you get truly

286
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,559
lost in it

287
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,039
i don't know what the heck is

288
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,079
responsible for the flow of the music

289
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,919
the kind of

290
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,160
the loudness of the music going up and

291
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,319
down the timing

292
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,078
the intricate like even the mistakes all

293
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,079
those things that doesn't seem to be the

294
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,319
conscious mind

295
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,199
uh it's it is just observing and yet

296
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,360
it's somehow

297
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,959
intricately involved more like because

298
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,959
you mentioned parkour

299
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,719
the dance is like that too when you

300
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,119
start i've been tango dancing

301
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,000
you if when you truly lose yourself in

302
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,879
it

303
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,639
then it's just like you're an observer

304
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,039
and how the hell is the body able to do

305
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,720
that

306
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,559
and not only that it's the physical

307
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,920
motion is also creating

308
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,958
the emotion the

309
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,360
like that damn is good to be alive

310
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,359
feeling

311
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,399
so but then that's also intricately

312
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,240
connected to the full biology stack

313
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,159
that we're operating in i don't know how

314
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,759
difficult it is to replicate that we

315
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,799
were talking offline about

316
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:56,639
boston dynamics robots

317
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,838
they've recently been they did both

318
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,240
parkour

319
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,000
they did flips they've also done some

320
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,519
dancing

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,679
and something i think a lot about

322
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,879
because what most people

323
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,000
don't realize because they don't look

324
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,838
deep enough is

325
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,159
those robots are hard-coded to do those

326
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,680
things

327
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,439
the robots didn't figure it out by

328
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,278
themselves and yet

329
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,640
the the fundamental aspect of what it

330
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,720
means to be human

331
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,078
is that process of figuring out of

332
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,120
making mistakes

333
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,199
and then there's something about

334
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,039
overcoming those challenges and the

335
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
mistakes and like figuring out

336
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,559
how to lose yourself in the magic of the

337
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,120
dancing uh or

338
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,039
just movement is what it means to be

339
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,959
human that learning process

340
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,240
so that's what i want to do with the

341
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,879
with the um

342
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,720
almost as a fun side thing with the the

343
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,039
boston dynamics robots

344
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,399
is to have them learn and see what they

345
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,958
figure out

346
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,879
even if it even if they make mistakes i

347
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:56,078
want to let

348
00:11:52,879 --> 00:12:00,159
spot make mistakes and in so

349
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:02,479
doing discover what it means to be alive

350
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:05,439
discover beauty because i think that's

351
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,920
the essential aspect of mistakes

352
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,200
boston dynamics folks want spot to be

353
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,479
perfect

354
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,399
because they don't want spot to ever

355
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,159
make mistakes because it wants to

356
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,039
operate in the factories it wants to be

357
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,958
you know very safe and so on for me if

358
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:22,240
you construct the environment

359
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:24,319
if you construct a safe space for robots

360
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,639
and allow them to make mistakes

361
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,680
something beautiful might be discovered

362
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,240
but that requires a lot of brain power

363
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,879
so spot is currently very dumb and i'm

364
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,600
gonna add

365
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,720
give it a brain uh so first make it c

366
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,720
currently can't see

367
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,160
meaning computer vision he has to

368
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,200
understand his environment has to see

369
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,838
all the humans

370
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,040
but then also has to be able to learn

371
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,160
learn about his movement

372
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,958
learn how to use his body to communicate

373
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,639
with others

374
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,039
all those kinds of things that dogs know

375
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,079
how to do well humans know how to do

376
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,159
somewhat well i think that's a beautiful

377
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,319
challenge but first you have to allow

378
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:03,360
the robot to make mistakes

379
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,720
well i think um your objective is

380
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,839
laudable but you're going to realize

381
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,920
that the boston

382
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,040
dynamics folks are right the first time

383
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,958
spot poops on your rug

384
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,360
um i hear the same thing about kids and

385
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,679
so on yes i still want to have kids no

386
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,440
you should it's it's a great experience

387
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,278
um so let me step back into what you

388
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,600
said in a couple of different places

389
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,720
one i have always believed that the

390
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,920
missing element

391
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,200
in robotics and artificial intelligence

392
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:33,679
is a proper development right it is no

393
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,040
accident it is no mere coincidence that

394
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,879
human beings are

395
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,159
the most dominant species on planet

396
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,439
earth and that we have the longest

397
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,319
childhoods of any

398
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,680
creature on earth by far right the

399
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,800
development is the key to the

400
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,559
flexibility

401
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:52,000
and so the capability

402
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:55,278
of a human at adulthood is

403
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,120
the mirror image it's the flip side of

404
00:13:55,278 --> 00:14:00,480
our helplessness at birth um so

405
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,240
i'll be very interested to see what

406
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,240
happens in your

407
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,480
robot project if you do not end up

408
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,079
reinventing childhood for robots which

409
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,759
of course is foreshadowed in

410
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:14,319
2001 quite brilliantly

411
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,278
but i also want to point out you can you

412
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,600
can see

413
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,120
this issue of your conscious mind

414
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,159
becoming a spectator

415
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,198
very well if you compare tennis

416
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:28,480
to table tennis right if you

417
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,479
watch a tennis game you could imagine

418
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,399
that the players are highly conscious as

419
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,320
they play

420
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,679
you cannot imagine that if you've ever

421
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,560
played ping pong

422
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,278
decently a volley in ping pong is so

423
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,039
fast

424
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,799
that your conscious mind if it had if

425
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,599
your reactions had to go through your

426
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,439
conscious mind

427
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,120
you wouldn't be able to play so you can

428
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,160
detect that your conscious mind

429
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,159
while very much present isn't there and

430
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,480
you can also detect where consciousness

431
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,559
does usefully intrude

432
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,600
if you go up against an opponent in

433
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,599
table tennis

434
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,680
that knows a trick that you don't know

435
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,440
how to respond to

436
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,719
you will suddenly detect that something

437
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,880
about your game

438
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,560
is not effective and you will start

439
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,480
thinking about what might be how do you

440
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,000
position yourself so that move that puts

441
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,519
the ball just in that corner of the

442
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,879
table or something like that

443
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:20,879
doesn't catch you off guard and

444
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:22,720
this i believe is we

445
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,159
highly conscious folks those of us who

446
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,079
try to think through things very

447
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,240
deliberately and carefully

448
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,239
mistake consciousness for like the

449
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,039
highest kind of thinking

450
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,079
and i really think that this is an error

451
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,480
consciousness is an

452
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,679
intermediate level of thinking what it

453
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,120
does is it allows you

454
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:43,278
it's basically like uncompiled code and

455
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,360
it doesn't run very fast it is capable

456
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,480
of being adapted to new circumstances

457
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,278
but once the code

458
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,039
is roughed in right it gets driven into

459
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:52,879
the unconscious layer and you become

460
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,559
highly effective at whatever it is

461
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,879
and that from that point your conscious

462
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,559
mind basically remains there to detect

463
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,919
things that aren't anticipated by the

464
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,838
code you've already written

465
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:05,759
and so i don't exactly know how

466
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,120
one would establish this how one would

467
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,519
demonstrate it

468
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,560
but it must be the case that the human

469
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,000
mind

470
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,958
contains sandboxes in which things are

471
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,480
tested

472
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,319
right maybe you can build a piece of

473
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
code and run it in parallel

474
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,600
next to your active code so you can see

475
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,560
how it would have done

476
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,680
comparatively but there's got to be some

477
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,078
way of writing

478
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,599
new code and then swapping it in and

479
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,239
frankly i think this has a lot to do

480
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,159
with things like sleep cycles very often

481
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,079
you know when i get good at something i

482
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,159
often don't get better at it while i'm

483
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,000
doing it i get better at it when i'm not

484
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,600
doing it especially if there's time to

485
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,919
sleep and think on it

486
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,839
so there's some sort of you know new

487
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,879
program swapping in for old program

488
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,680
phenomenon

489
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,000
which um you know will be a lot easier

490
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,758
to see

491
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,919
in machines it's going to be hard with

492
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,680
the the the wet wear

493
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,439
i like i mean it is true because

494
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,638
somebody that played i played tennis for

495
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,480
many years

496
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,839
i do still think the highest form of

497
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,078
excellence in tennis

498
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,199
is when the conscious mind is a

499
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,279
spectator

500
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,919
so it's the compiled code is the

501
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,318
highest form of being human and then

502
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,959
consciousness is just some

503
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,639
like specific compiler he has to have

504
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,640
like borland c

505
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,160
plus plus compile you could just have

506
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,199
different kind of compilers

507
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,880
ultimately the the thing that by which

508
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,160
we measure

509
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,080
the the power of life the intelligence

510
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,679
of life is the compiled code and you can

511
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,798
probably do that compilation all kinds

512
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,798
of ways

513
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,558
yep yeah i'm not saying that tennis is

514
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,079
played consciously and table tennis

515
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,399
isn't i'm saying that because

516
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,678
tennis is slowed down by the just the

517
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,600
space on the court

518
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,038
you could you could imagine that it was

519
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,798
your conscious mind playing

520
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,079
but when you shrink the court down it

521
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:51,918
was obvious it becomes

522
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,359
obvious that your conscious mind is just

523
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,360
present rather than

524
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,279
knowing where to put the paddle and

525
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,599
weirdly for me

526
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,599
um i would say this probably isn't true

527
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,240
in a podcast situation

528
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,798
but if i have to give a presentation uh

529
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,798
especially if i have not overly prepared

530
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,480
i often find the same phenomenon when

531
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,160
i'm giving the presentation my conscious

532
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,519
mind is there watching some other part

533
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,279
of me present

534
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:19,519
which is a little jarring i have to say

535
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,558
well that means you've you've gotten

536
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,079
good at it

537
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,639
not let the conscious mind get in the

538
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,639
way of the flow of words

539
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
yeah that's that's the sensation to be

540
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,880
sure and that's the highest form of

541
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,319
podcasting too i mean that's why i have

542
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,559
that that's what it looks like when a

543
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:38,480
podcast is really in the pocket like

544
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:40,240
like joe rogan just having fun

545
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,759
and just losing themselves and that's

546
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,000
that's something i aspire to as well

547
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,359
just

548
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,200
losing yourself in the conversation

549
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,000
somebody that has a lot of anxiety with

550
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,000
people like i'm

551
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,599
such an introvert i'm scared i was

552
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,480
scared before you showed up i'm scared

553
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,879
right now

554
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,720
um there's just anxiety there's just

555
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,799
it's a giant mess

556
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,319
uh it's hard to lose yourself it's hard

557
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,798
to just

558
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,000
get out of the way of your own mind yeah

559
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,119
actually uh

560
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,880
trust is a big component of that your

561
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,199
your conscious mind

562
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,799
retains control if you are very

563
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,240
uncertain

564
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,079
um but when you do when you do get into

565
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,519
that zone when you're speaking

566
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,879
i realize it's different for you with

567
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,400
english as a second language although

568
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,960
maybe you present in russian

569
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,720
and you know and it happens but do you

570
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,038
ever hear yourself say something and you

571
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,759
think

572
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,440
oh that's really good right like like

573
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,079
you didn't come up with it some other

574
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,120
part of you that you don't exactly know

575
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,759
came up with it i i don't think i've

576
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,719
ever

577
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,079
heard myself in that way because i have

578
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,279
a much louder voice

579
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:43,839
that's constantly yelling in my head at

580
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,759
why the hell did you say that there's a

581
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,599
very self-critical voice

582
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:51,359
that's much louder so i'm very

583
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:53,038
maybe i need to deal with that voice but

584
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,719
it's been like without what is it called

585
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,480
like a megaphone just screaming so i

586
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,079
can't hear you oh no

587
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,640
good job you said that thing really

588
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,480
nicely so i'm kind of focused right now

589
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,520
on on the megaphone person

590
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,880
in the audience versus the deposit but

591
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,200
that's definitely something to think

592
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,080
about it's been productive

593
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,880
but you know the the place where i find

594
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,359
gratitude

595
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,880
and beauty and appreciation of life is

596
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,519
in the quiet moments

597
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,480
when i don't talk when i listen to the

598
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:24,720
world around me when i listen to others

599
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,599
i'm when i talk i'm extremely

600
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,919
self-critical

601
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,519
in my mind uh when i when i produce

602
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,480
anything out into the world

603
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,359
that's that originated with me like any

604
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,400
kind of creation

605
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,959
extremely self-critical it's good for

606
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,640
productivity for like always striving to

607
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,000
improve and so on

608
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,440
it might be bad for for like

609
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,720
just appreciating the things you've

610
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,919
created i'm a little bit with marvin

611
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,279
minsky on this where he says the the key

612
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,400
to um to a productive life is to hate

613
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,359
everything you've ever done

614
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,240
in the past i didn't know he said that i

615
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:05,599
must say i resonate with it a bit

616
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,279
and you know i i unfortunately my life

617
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,798
currently has me putting a lot of stuff

618
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:14,798
into the world and i effectively

619
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,798
watch almost none of it i can't stand it

620
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,038
yeah what what do you make of that i

621
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:19,759
don't know i just recently i just

622
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,319
yesterday

623
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:24,079
read um metamorphosis by cough we read

624
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,839
metamorphosis by kafka where he turns

625
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,199
into jan bug

626
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,959
because of the stress that the world

627
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,840
puts on him

628
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,480
his parents put on him to succeed and

629
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,079
you know

630
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,759
i think that's you have to find the

631
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,960
balance because

632
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,279
if you if you allow the self-critical

633
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,880
voice to become too heavy the burden of

634
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,558
the world the pressure

635
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,080
that the world puts on you to be the

636
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:47,359
best version of yourself and so on to

637
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,558
strive

638
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,678
then you become a bug and that's a big

639
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,440
problem

640
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,280
and then uh and then every and then the

641
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,360
world turns against you

642
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,279
because you're a bug you become some

643
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:03,038
kind of caricature of yourself

644
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,839
uh i don't know become the worst version

645
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:06,960
of yourself

646
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:09,439
and then thereby end up destroying

647
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,400
yourself and then the world moves on

648
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,720
that's the story that's a lovely story

649
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,798
i do think this is one of these places

650
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,960
and frankly you could

651
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,400
map this on to all of modern human

652
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,600
experience but this is one of these

653
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,240
places where our

654
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,199
ancestral programming does not serve our

655
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,519
modern selves

656
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,880
yeah so i used to talk to students about

657
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,200
the question of

658
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,960
dwelling on things you know dwelling on

659
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,600
things is famously

660
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,640
understood to be bad and it can't

661
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,240
possibly be bad

662
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,240
it wouldn't exist a tendency toward it

663
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,720
wouldn't exist if it was bad

664
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,839
so what is bad is dwelling on things

665
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,679
past the point

666
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:49,839
of utility and you know that's obviously

667
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,038
easier to say than to operationalize but

668
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,519
if you realize

669
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,759
that your dwelling is the key in fact to

670
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,400
upgrading your program for

671
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,279
future well-being and that there's a

672
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
point you know

673
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,678
presumably from diminishing returns if

674
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,959
not counter productivity

675
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,960
there is a point at which you should

676
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,319
stop because that is what is in your

677
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,319
best interest

678
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,759
then knowing that you're looking for

679
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,200
that point is useful

680
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,960
right this is the point at which it is

681
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,000
no longer useful for me to dwell on this

682
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,600
error i have made

683
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,640
right that is that's what you're looking

684
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,719
for and um it also gives you license

685
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,400
right if some part of you feels like it

686
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,519
you know is punishing you rather than

687
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,600
searching then that also has a

688
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,319
point at which it's no longer valuable

689
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,240
and there's some liberty in realizing

690
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:37,279
yep even the part of me that was

691
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,839
punishing me knows it's time to stop

692
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,519
so if we uh map that onto compiled code

693
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,119
discussion as a computer science person

694
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,558
i find that very compelling

695
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,599
you know there's a when you compile code

696
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:52,639
you get warnings

697
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:54,000
sometimes and usually

698
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,400
if you're a good software engineer

699
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,960
you're going to make sure there's no

700
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,559
you know you treat warnings as errors so

701
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,159
you make sure that the compilation

702
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,278
produces no warnings

703
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,840
but a certain point when you have a

704
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,798
large enough system you just let the

705
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:08,798
warnings go

706
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,319
it's fine like i don't know where that

707
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,359
warning came from

708
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,038
but you know it's just uh

709
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,678
ultimately you need to compile the code

710
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:20,400
and and run with it and uh hope nothing

711
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,080
terrible happens well i think what you

712
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,400
will find and believe me i think

713
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,839
what you're what you're talking about

714
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,480
with respect to

715
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,918
robots on learning is going to end up

716
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,400
having to go to a

717
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,320
deep developmental state and a

718
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,000
helplessness that evolves into hyper

719
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,278
competence and all of that

720
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,519
but um i live

721
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,440
i noticed that i live by something that

722
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,440
i for lack of a better

723
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,038
descriptor call the theory of close

724
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,759
calls

725
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,879
and the theory of close calls says that

726
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,480
people

727
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,480
typically miscategorize the

728
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,960
events in their life where something

729
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,679
almost went wrong

730
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,679
and you know for example if you i have a

731
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,200
friend who um

732
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,720
i was walking down the street with my

733
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,319
college friends and one of my friends

734
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,278
stepped into the street thinking it was

735
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:11,839
clear and was

736
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,798
nearly hit by a car going 45 miles an

737
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,959
hour would have been an

738
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,079
absolute disaster might have killed her

739
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,200
certainly would have

740
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:21,759
permanently injured her but she didn't

741
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,798
you know car didn't touch her right now

742
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,038
you could

743
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,720
walk away from that and think nothing of

744
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,679
it because well what is there to think

745
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,440
nothing happened or you could think well

746
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,919
what is the difference between what did

747
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,038
happen

748
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,520
and my death the difference is luck

749
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,200
i never want that to be true right i

750
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:40,000
never want the difference between what

751
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,159
did happen

752
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,200
and my death to be luck therefore i

753
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,840
should count this as very close to death

754
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,360
and i should prioritize coding so it

755
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,319
doesn't happen again at a very high

756
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,839
level

757
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:57,359
so anyway my my basic point is

758
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,720
the accidents and disasters and

759
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:02,158
misfortune

760
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,000
describe a distribution that tells you

761
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,480
what's really likely to get you in the

762
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,359
end and so

763
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,360
personally you can use them to figure

764
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,278
out where the dangers are so that you

765
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,558
can afford to take great risks because

766
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:15,599
you have a really good sense of how

767
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:17,359
they're going to go wrong

768
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,959
but i would also point out civilization

769
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,079
has this problem

770
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,798
civilization is now producing these

771
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,879
events

772
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,240
that are major disasters but they're not

773
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,799
existential scale

774
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,919
yet right they're very serious errors

775
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,079
that we can see

776
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,679
and i would argue that the pattern is

777
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,038
you discover that we are involved in

778
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,159
some industrial process

779
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:41,359
at the point it has gone wrong right so

780
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,919
i'm now always asking the question okay

781
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,798
in light of the fukushima triple

782
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,960
meltdown

783
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,960
the financial collapse of 2008 the

784
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,319
deepwater horizon

785
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,120
blowout covet 19 and its probable

786
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:57,038
origins

787
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:58,639
in the wuhan lab what processes do i not

788
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:00,558
know the name of yet

789
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,120
that i will discover at the point that

790
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:04,798
some gigantic accident has happened and

791
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,959
can we talk about the wisdom

792
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,119
or lack thereof of engaging in that

793
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,360
process before the accident right that's

794
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,839
what a wise civilization would be doing

795
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,038
and yet we don't i just want to mention

796
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,918
something that happened

797
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,798
a couple of days ago i don't know if you

798
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,960
know who jb

799
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:24,000
strawball is he's the co-founder of

800
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,960
tesla cto of tesla for many many years

801
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,558
his wife just died she was riding a

802
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,240
bicycle

803
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:35,678
and in the same in that same thin

804
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,960
line between death and life that many of

805
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,440
us have been

806
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,679
in where you walk into the intersection

807
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,798
and there's this close call

808
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,798
every once in a while

809
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:52,080
it you get um

810
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:55,278
short straw i wonder how much

811
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:57,519
of our own individual lives and the

812
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,720
entirety of the human civilization

813
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,480
rests on this little roll of the dice

814
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,480
well this is sort of my point about the

815
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,720
close calls is that there's a there's a

816
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,759
level at which we can't control it right

817
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,640
the

818
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,158
gigantic asteroid that comes from deep

819
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,960
space that you don't have time to do

820
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,799
anything about

821
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,919
there's not a lot we can do to hedge

822
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,918
that out or at least not short term

823
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,840
but there are lots of other things you

824
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,278
know obviously

825
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:27,119
the financial collapse of 2008 didn't

826
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,798
break down the entire world economy it

827
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,000
threatened to but a herculean effort

828
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,240
managed to pull us back

829
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,359
from the brink the triple meltdown at

830
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,759
fukushima

831
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,719
was awful but every one of the seven

832
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,798
fuel pools

833
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,558
held there wasn't a major fire that made

834
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:41,519
it impossible to manage the disaster

835
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,960
going forward

836
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,798
we got lucky you know we could say the

837
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,519
same thing about the

838
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,079
the blowout at the deepwater horizon

839
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,319
where

840
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,599
a hole in the ocean floor large enough

841
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:55,278
that we couldn't have plugged it could

842
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,359
have opened up all of these things

843
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:58,480
could have been much much worse right

844
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,798
and i think we can say the same thing

845
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,278
about covet as terrible as it is

846
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,720
and i you know we cannot say for sure

847
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,880
that it came from the wuhan lab but

848
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,240
there's a strong likelihood that it did

849
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,720
and it also could be much much worse

850
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,679
so in each of these cases something is

851
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,480
telling us

852
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,480
we have a process that is unfolding that

853
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,599
keeps creating risks where it is luck

854
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,360
that is the difference between

855
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,639
us and some scale of disaster that is

856
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,839
unimaginable

857
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,360
and that wisdom you know you can be

858
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,798
highly intelligent and cause these

859
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,678
disasters

860
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,200
to be wise is to stop causing them right

861
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,399
and that would require

862
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,919
a process of restraint

863
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,239
a process that i don't see a lot of

864
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,080
evidence of yet so

865
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,399
i think we have to generate it and

866
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,918
somehow

867
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,439
we you know at the moment we don't have

868
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,720
a political structure

869
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,159
that would be capable of

870
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,440
taking a protective algorithm and

871
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,559
actually deploying it

872
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,240
right because it would have important

873
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:00,319
economic consequences and so it would

874
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,278
almost certainly be shot down

875
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,038
but we can obviously also say you know

876
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:08,558
we paid a huge price

877
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,278
for all of the disasters that i i've

878
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,119
mentioned

879
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,720
and we have to factor that into the

880
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,079
equation something can be very

881
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,038
productive short term and very

882
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:19,599
destructive long term

883
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:20,879
also the question is how many disasters

884
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,918
we avoided

885
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,000
because of the ingenuity of humans

886
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,000
or just the integrity and character of

887
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,640
humans

888
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,119
that's sort of an open question we may

889
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,120
be more

890
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:39,199
intelligent than lucky that's the hope

891
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,200
because the optimistic message here that

892
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,960
you're getting at is

893
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,278
maybe the process that we should be

894
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,840
that maybe we can overcome luck with

895
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,278
ingenuity

896
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:52,558
meaning i guess you're suggesting the

897
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:54,000
process is we should be

898
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,038
listing all the ways that human

899
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,319
civilization can destroy itself

900
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:03,119
uh assigning likelihood to it and

901
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:05,359
thinking through how can we avoid that

902
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,599
and being very honest

903
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,398
with the data out there about the close

904
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,839
calls

905
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:14,000
and using those close calls to uh

906
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:14,879
to then create sort of mechanism by

907
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,720
which we

908
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,320
minimize the probability of those close

909
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,759
calls and just being

910
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:22,960
honest and transparent with the data

911
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:24,640
that's out there

912
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,600
well i think we need to do a couple

913
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,919
things for it to work

914
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:31,359
so i've been an advocate for the idea

915
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,720
that sustainability

916
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,479
is actually it's difficult to

917
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,519
operationalize but it is an objective

918
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,640
that we have to

919
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,480
meet if we're to be around long term and

920
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,278
i realize that we also need to have

921
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,679
reversibility of all of our processes

922
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,038
because processes very frequently when

923
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,080
they start do not appear

924
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,519
dangerous and then they when they scale

925
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,240
they become very dangerous so for

926
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,359
example

927
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,679
if you imagine the

928
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,599
first internal combustion engine in a

929
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,200
vehicle driving down the street

930
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,879
and you imagine somebody running after

931
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,240
them saying hey if you do enough of that

932
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,440
you're going to alter the atmosphere and

933
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,880
it's going to change the temperature of

934
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,480
the planet it's preposterous

935
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,240
right why would you stop the person

936
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,319
who's invented this marvelous new

937
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,519
contraption but of course eventually you

938
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:14,480
do get to the place where you're doing

939
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,000
enough of this

940
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,079
that you do start changing the

941
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,119
temperature of the planet so

942
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,798
if we built the capacity if we basically

943
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,038
said look you can't

944
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,440
involve yourself in any process that you

945
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:30,398
couldn't reverse if you had to

946
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,000
then progress would be slowed but our

947
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:35,439
safety would go up

948
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,278
dramatically and i think

949
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,519
i think in some sense if we are to be

950
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,119
around long term we have to begin

951
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,759
thinking that way we're just involved in

952
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,798
too many very dangerous processes

953
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:48,000
so let's talk about one of the things

954
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,240
that

955
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,440
if not threatened human civilization

956
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,839
certainly

957
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,640
heard it at a deep level which is

958
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,398
covid19

959
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,240
what percent probability would you

960
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,398
currently place

961
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,519
on the hypothesis that covet 19 league

962
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,479
from the

963
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,200
wuhan institute of virology so i

964
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,440
maintain

965
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,720
a flow chart of all the possible

966
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,679
explanations

967
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,278
and it doesn't break down exactly that

968
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,120
way

969
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:20,000
the likelihood that it emerged from a

970
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,839
lab is very very high

971
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,599
if it emerged from a lab the likelihood

972
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:26,480
that the lab was the wuhan institute is

973
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:29,759
very very high

974
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,960
the there are multiple different kinds

975
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,200
of evidence that point

976
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,960
the lab and there is literally no

977
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,960
evidence that points to nature

978
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,079
either the evidence points nowhere or it

979
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,000
points to the lab

980
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,839
and the lab could mean any lab but

981
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,798
geographically obviously

982
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,240
the labs in wuhan are the most likely

983
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:47,440
and the lab that was most directly

984
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,480
involved with research

985
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,159
on viruses that look like covid that

986
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,480
look like sarsko v2

987
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,679
is obviously the place uh that one would

988
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,480
start

989
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,600
but i would say the likelihood that this

990
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,000
virus

991
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:06,079
came from a lab is well above 95

992
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,759
we can talk about the question of could

993
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,279
a virus have been brought into the lab

994
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,559
and escape from there without being

995
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,800
modified that's also

996
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,799
possible but it doesn't explain any of

997
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,919
the anomalies in the genome

998
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,919
of sarsko v2

999
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,638
could it have been delivered from

1000
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,799
another lab could wuhan be a distraction

1001
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,480
um in order that we would connect the

1002
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,560
dots in the wrong way

1003
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,719
that's conceivable i currently have that

1004
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,599
below one percent on my flow chart but i

1005
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,759
have a very dark

1006
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,519
thought that somebody would would do

1007
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,159
that almost as a

1008
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,039
a political attack on china well it

1009
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,960
depends

1010
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,239
i don't even think that's one

1011
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,599
possibility

1012
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,239
sometimes when eric and i talk about

1013
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,399
these issues we will

1014
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,358
generate a scenario just to prove that

1015
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,199
something could

1016
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:52,480
could live in that space right it's a

1017
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,638
placeholder for whatever

1018
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,079
may actually have happened and so it

1019
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,240
doesn't have to have been

1020
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,200
an attack on china that's certainly one

1021
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,879
possibility

1022
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:07,039
but i would point out if you can predict

1023
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,920
the future in some unusual way

1024
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,679
better than others you can print money

1025
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,240
right that's what markets that allow you

1026
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:17,358
to bet for or against

1027
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:20,559
virtually any sector allow you to do so

1028
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:24,960
you can imagine a

1029
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:26,880
simply amoral person or entity

1030
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,720
generating a pandemic attempting to

1031
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,079
cover their tracks because it would

1032
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,039
allow them to bet against

1033
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,240
things like you know cruise ships air

1034
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:37,039
travel

1035
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:37,759
whatever it is and bet in favor of i

1036
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:40,880
don't know

1037
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,400
uh sanitizing gel

1038
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,000
and whatever else you would do so

1039
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,599
am i saying that i think somebody did

1040
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,159
that no i really don't think it happened

1041
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,359
we've seen

1042
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,279
zero evidence that this was

1043
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,679
intentionally released

1044
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,200
however were it to have been

1045
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,078
intentionally released by somebody who

1046
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,399
did not know

1047
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,200
did not want it known where it had come

1048
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,880
from

1049
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,239
releasing it into wuhan would be one way

1050
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,760
to cover their tracks so

1051
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:05,439
we have to leave the possibility

1052
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,440
formally open but

1053
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,599
acknowledge there's no evidence so and

1054
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,519
the probability therefore is law i tend

1055
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,838
to believe

1056
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,400
maybe this is the optimistic nature that

1057
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,719
i have that

1058
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,599
people who are competent enough to do

1059
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:24,639
the kind of thing we just described

1060
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,320
are not going to do that because it

1061
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,000
requires a certain kind of i don't want

1062
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,800
to use the word evil but whatever word

1063
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,079
you want to use to describe the kind of

1064
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,119
uh this regard for human life required

1065
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,519
to do that

1066
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,119
you're just that that that's just not

1067
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:41,119
going to be coupled

1068
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,320
with competence i feel like there's a

1069
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,039
trade-off chart

1070
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,760
where competence on one axis and evil is

1071
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,880
on the other

1072
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,079
and the more evil you become the the

1073
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,400
the crappier you are at doing great

1074
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,640
engineering scientific work required

1075
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,079
to deliver weapons of different kinds

1076
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,679
whether it's bioweapons or nuclear

1077
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,000
weapons all those kinds of things

1078
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,279
that seems to be the lessons i i take

1079
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,800
from history but that doesn't

1080
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,839
necessarily mean that's

1081
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,000
what's going to be happening in the

1082
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:11,119
future

1083
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,800
but to stick on the lab leak idea

1084
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,240
because the flow chart is probably huge

1085
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,119
here because there's a lot of

1086
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,118
fascinating

1087
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,440
possibilities one question i want to ask

1088
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,838
is what would evidence for natural

1089
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,920
origins look like

1090
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:27,119
so one piece of evidence

1091
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,159
for natural origins is um that

1092
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,440
it has happened in the past

1093
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:36,319
that that viruses have jumped

1094
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,800
oh they do jump they so like that's one

1095
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,200
like that's possible to have happened

1096
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,960
you know so that that's a sort of like a

1097
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:46,159
historical evidence like okay

1098
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,760
well it's possible that it hap it's not

1099
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,159
it's not evidence of the kind you think

1100
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,200
it is it's a justification for a

1101
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,519
presumption

1102
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,279
right right so the presumption upon

1103
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:56,800
discovering a new virus circulating is

1104
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,920
certainly that it came from nature

1105
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,160
right the problem is the presumption

1106
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,079
evaporates in the face of evidence or at

1107
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:06,078
least it logically should

1108
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,680
and it didn't in this case it was

1109
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,440
maintained by people who

1110
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,879
privately in their emails acknowledged

1111
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,119
that they had

1112
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,800
grave doubts about the natural origin of

1113
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:16,960
of this virus

1114
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,560
is there some other piece of evidence

1115
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,679
that we could

1116
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,440
look for and see that would say

1117
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,719
this increases the probability that it's

1118
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,599
natural origins

1119
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:30,959
yeah in fact there is evidence you know

1120
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,280
i always worry that somebody is going to

1121
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,559
make up some evidence in order to

1122
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,880
reverse the flow

1123
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,400
boy well let's say i am a lot of

1124
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,920
incentive for that actually there's a

1125
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,720
huge amount of incentive on the other

1126
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,838
hand

1127
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,358
why didn't the powers that be the powers

1128
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:47,119
that lied to us about weapons of mass

1129
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:47,679
destruction in iraq why didn't they ever

1130
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,599
fake

1131
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,039
weapons of mass destruction in iraq

1132
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,960
whatever force it is

1133
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:54,880
i hope that force is here too and so

1134
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,480
whatever evidence we find is real

1135
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,800
it's the competence thing i'm talking

1136
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,800
about but okay go ahead sorry

1137
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,320
well we can get back to that but i would

1138
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,560
say yeah the the the

1139
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,039
giant piece of evidence that will shift

1140
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,599
the probabilities in the other direction

1141
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:12,159
is the discovery of either a human

1142
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,559
population in which the virus circulated

1143
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,399
prior to showing up in wuhan that would

1144
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,599
explain where the virus learned all of

1145
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,960
the tricks that it knew

1146
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:24,000
instantly upon spreading from wuhan so

1147
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,280
that would do it or an animal population

1148
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,760
in which an ancestor epidemic can be

1149
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,680
found

1150
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,440
in which the virus learned this before

1151
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,838
jumping to humans but i point out in

1152
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,320
that

1153
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,119
second case you would certainly expect

1154
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,680
to see

1155
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,680
a great deal of evolution in the early

1156
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,159
epidemic which we don't see

1157
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,078
so there almost has to be a human

1158
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,399
population somewhere else that had the

1159
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,000
virus circulating or an ancestor of the

1160
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,760
virus that we first saw in wuhan

1161
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,838
circulating and it has to have gotten

1162
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,800
very sophisticated in that prior

1163
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:54,880
epidemic

1164
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,480
before hitting wuhan in order to explain

1165
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,800
the total lack of evolution

1166
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,079
and extremely effective virus that

1167
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,240
emerged

1168
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,240
at the end of 2019. so you don't believe

1169
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,598
in the magic of evolution to spring up

1170
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,039
with all the tricks already there

1171
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,359
like everybody who doesn't have the

1172
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,960
tricks they die quickly

1173
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,358
and then you just have this beautiful

1174
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,000
virus that comes in with a spike protein

1175
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,318
and the

1176
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,119
and the through mutation uh and

1177
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:21,920
selection

1178
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:24,240
just do like the ones that succeed

1179
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,920
and succeed big are the ones that are

1180
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:26,719
going to just spring into life with the

1181
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,920
tricks

1182
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,480
well no that's that's called a hopeful

1183
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,119
monster

1184
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,400
and hopeful monsters don't work it's too

1185
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,838
the job of

1186
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,960
becoming a new pandemic virus is too

1187
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:40,880
difficult it involves two very difficult

1188
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,639
steps and they both have to work one

1189
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,039
is the ability to infect a person and

1190
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:46,960
spread in their tissues

1191
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:49,039
sufficient to make an infection and the

1192
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,039
other is to jump between individuals

1193
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:53,199
at a sufficient rate that it doesn't go

1194
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,199
extinct for one reason or another

1195
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:56,960
those are both very difficult jobs they

1196
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,519
require as you describe

1197
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,159
selection and the point is selection

1198
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:02,239
would leave

1199
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:04,000
a mark we would see evidence that it was

1200
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,879
in animals or humans

1201
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,239
both right and you see this evolutionary

1202
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,640
trace of uh

1203
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,159
of the virus gathering the tricks up

1204
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:13,519
yeah you would see the virus

1205
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,199
you would see the clumsy virus get

1206
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,280
better and better and yes i am a full

1207
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:18,399
believer in the power of that process in

1208
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,400
fact i believe it

1209
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,240
uh what i know from studying the process

1210
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,559
is that it is much more powerful than

1211
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:29,279
most people imagine that what we teach

1212
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:31,599
in the evolution 101 textbook is too

1213
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,359
clumsy a process to do what we see it

1214
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,920
doing and that actually people should

1215
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,119
increase their expectation of the

1216
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,079
rapidity with which

1217
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,960
that process can produce just

1218
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,920
jaw-dropping

1219
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,119
adaptations that said we just don't see

1220
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,838
evidence that it happened here which

1221
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,358
doesn't mean it doesn't exist but it

1222
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:50,559
means in spite of immense pressure to

1223
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,559
find it somewhere

1224
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:53,838
there's been no hint which probably

1225
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,960
means it took place

1226
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,239
inside of a laboratory so inside the

1227
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,880
laboratory

1228
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,318
gain of functional research on viruses

1229
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,200
and i believe

1230
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,480
most of that kind of research is doing

1231
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,318
this exact thing that you're

1232
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,639
referring to which is accelerated

1233
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,480
evolution and just watching evolution do

1234
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:14,879
its thing and a bunch of viruses

1235
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,159
and seeing what kind of uh tricks get

1236
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,680
developed

1237
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:23,440
the other method is

1238
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:26,078
engineering viruses so manually adding

1239
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,079
on the tricks

1240
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,000
what which do you think we should be

1241
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,519
thinking about

1242
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,358
here so mind you i learned what i know

1243
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:38,000
in the aftermath of this pandemic

1244
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:41,519
emerging i started studying the question

1245
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,920
and i would say based on the content of

1246
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,759
the genome and other evidence in

1247
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,400
publications from the various labs that

1248
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,800
were

1249
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,318
involved in in generating this

1250
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,680
technology

1251
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:56,960
a couple of things seem likely this

1252
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,679
sarsko v2 does not appear to be entirely

1253
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,720
the result

1254
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:03,838
of either a splicing process

1255
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,959
or serial passaging it appears to have

1256
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:07,679
both

1257
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,199
things in its past or it's at least

1258
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,679
highly likely that it does

1259
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:13,358
so for example the fern cleavage site

1260
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,919
looks very much like it

1261
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,199
was added in to the virus and it was

1262
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,639
known that that would increase its

1263
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:22,159
infectivity

1264
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:26,159
in humans and increase its tropism

1265
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:29,519
the virus appears

1266
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:32,559
to be excellent at spreading in

1267
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:34,079
humans and minks and ferrets

1268
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,679
now minks and ferrets are very closely

1269
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,519
related to each other and ferrets are

1270
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,039
very likely to have been used in a

1271
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,358
serial passage experiment

1272
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,960
the reason being that they have an ace2

1273
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,440
receptor that looks very much like the

1274
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,519
human as2 receptor and so

1275
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,800
were you going to passage the virus or

1276
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:50,719
its ancestor

1277
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,400
through an animal in order to increase

1278
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,399
its infectivity in humans which would

1279
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,240
have been necessary

1280
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,880
ferrets would have been very likely it

1281
00:43:56,239 --> 00:44:02,559
is also quite likely that humanized mice

1282
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,000
were utilized and it is possible that

1283
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,799
human airway tissue

1284
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,280
was utilized i think it is vital that we

1285
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,400
find out what the protocols were if this

1286
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,400
came from the wuhan

1287
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,838
institute we need to know it and we need

1288
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,318
to know what the protocols were

1289
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:18,239
exactly because they will actually give

1290
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:21,440
us some tools that would be useful

1291
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,799
in fighting sars kovi 2 and hopefully

1292
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,240
driving it to extinction which ought to

1293
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,240
be our priority

1294
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,078
it is a it's a priority that does not it

1295
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,799
is not apparent from our behavior

1296
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,318
but it really is uh it should be our

1297
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,519
objective if we understood where our

1298
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:37,119
interests lie

1299
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:38,639
we would be much more focused on it but

1300
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,880
those protocols would tell us a great

1301
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,078
deal if it wasn't the wuhan institute we

1302
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,240
need to know that

1303
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,839
if it was nature we need to know that

1304
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:47,279
and if it was some other laboratory we

1305
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:49,358
need to figure out

1306
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,400
who what and where so that we can

1307
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,078
determine what is

1308
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,760
what we can determine about about what

1309
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,480
was done you're opening

1310
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,119
up my mind about why we should

1311
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,240
investigate why we should know the truth

1312
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,480
of the origins of this virus so for me

1313
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,358
personally let me just tell the story of

1314
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,838
my own kind of journey

1315
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:12,799
when i first started looking into the

1316
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:15,199
lab leak hypothesis

1317
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,318
what became terrifying to me and

1318
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:20,000
important to under

1319
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:22,239
understand and obvious is the

1320
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,679
sort of like sam harris way of thinking

1321
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:26,479
which is

1322
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:29,440
it's obvious that a lab leak of a deadly

1323
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,480
virus will eventually happen

1324
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,119
my mind was it doesn't even matter

1325
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,920
if it happened in this case it's obvious

1326
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,720
that it's going to

1327
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,559
happen in the future so why the hell are

1328
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,480
we not freaking out about this

1329
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,039
and kova 19 is not even that deadly

1330
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,440
relative to the possible future viruses

1331
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,119
it's this the way i disagree with sam on

1332
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,639
this but he thinks about this way about

1333
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,640
agi as well

1334
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,400
about artificial intelligence it's a

1335
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:55,920
different discussion i think but with

1336
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,480
viruses it seems like something that

1337
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,119
could happen

1338
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,000
on the scale of years maybe a few

1339
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,240
decades

1340
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,199
agi is a little bit farther out for me

1341
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,759
but it seemed

1342
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,239
the terrifying thing it seemed obvious

1343
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,880
that

1344
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,919
this will happen very soon for a much

1345
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,160
deadlier virus

1346
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,760
as we get better and better at both

1347
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:15,759
engineering viruses

1348
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,119
and doing this kind of evolutionary

1349
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,560
driven research gain and functional

1350
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,599
research

1351
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:23,599
okay but then you started

1352
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,920
speaking out about this as well but also

1353
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,119
started to say no no we should hurry up

1354
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,760
and figure out the origins

1355
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,599
now because it will help us figure out

1356
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,599
how to actually

1357
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:37,599
respond uh to this particular virus how

1358
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,599
to treat this particular virus

1359
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,200
what is in terms of vaccines in terms of

1360
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,640
antiviral drugs in terms of

1361
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:46,399
just and although the the

1362
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:48,318
the number of responses we should have

1363
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,838
okay

1364
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:53,838
i still am much more freaking out about

1365
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:57,039
the future

1366
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:57,599
maybe you can break that apart a little

1367
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,599
bit

1368
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:04,880
which are you most

1369
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,880
focused on now which

1370
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,480
are you most freaking out about now in

1371
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,559
terms of the importance of figuring out

1372
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,719
the origins of this virus

1373
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:13,599
i am most freaking out about both of

1374
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:15,279
them

1375
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,000
because they're both really important

1376
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,480
and you know we can put bounds on this

1377
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,400
let me say first this is a perfect test

1378
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,599
case for the theory of close calls

1379
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,400
because as much as

1380
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,480
covet is a disaster it is also a close

1381
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,079
call from which we can learn much

1382
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,000
you are absolutely right if we keep

1383
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,280
playing this game in the lab

1384
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,960
if we are not if we are especially if we

1385
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,480
do it under pressure and when we are

1386
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,358
told that a virus is going to leap from

1387
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,280
nature

1388
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,639
any day and that the more we know the

1389
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,800
better we'll be able to fight it we're

1390
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:48,078
going to create the disaster

1391
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,920
all the sooner so yes that should be

1392
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,280
an absolute focus the fact that there

1393
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,639
were people saying that this was

1394
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,680
dangerous back in

1395
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,400
2015 ought to tell us something the fact

1396
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,440
that the system

1397
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,000
bypassed a ban and offshored the work to

1398
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,679
china

1399
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
ought to tell us this is not a chinese

1400
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:07,039
failure this is a failure of something

1401
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,920
larger and harder to see

1402
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:10,480
but i also think that there's a there's

1403
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,760
a

1404
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,079
clock ticking with respect to sars kovi

1405
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,800
ii

1406
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,240
and covid the disease that it creates

1407
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,800
and that has to do with whether or not

1408
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:22,318
we are stuck with it permanently

1409
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,880
so if you think about the cost to

1410
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:27,279
humanity of being stuck with influenza

1411
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,559
it's an immense cost year after year and

1412
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,040
we just stopped thinking about it

1413
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,359
because

1414
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,039
it's there some years you get the flu

1415
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,000
most years you don't maybe you get the

1416
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:35,679
vaccine to prevent

1417
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,119
it maybe the vaccine isn't particularly

1418
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,679
well targeted

1419
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,039
but imagine just simply doubling that

1420
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,000
cost

1421
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,119
imagine we get stuck with sars kovi 2

1422
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,159
and its descendants

1423
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,079
going forward and that it just settles

1424
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:51,759
in and becomes a fact of

1425
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,680
modern human life that would be a

1426
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,920
disaster right the number of people we

1427
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:57,039
will ultimately lose is incalculable

1428
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,760
the amount of suffering that will be

1429
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:02,558
caused is incalculable the loss of

1430
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,720
well-being and wealth incalculable so

1431
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,960
that ought to be a very high priority

1432
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,078
driving this extinct before it becomes

1433
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,119
permanent

1434
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,000
and the ability to drive extinct goes

1435
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,519
down

1436
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,599
the longer we delay effective responses

1437
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,880
to the extent that we let it have this

1438
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,800
very large canvas

1439
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,240
large numbers of people who have the

1440
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,318
disease in which

1441
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:26,078
mutation and selection can result in

1442
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:26,880
adaptation that we will not be able to

1443
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,039
counter

1444
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,960
the greater its ability to figure out

1445
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:31,920
features of our immune system and use

1446
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,960
them

1447
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,838
to its advantage so i'm feeling the

1448
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,920
pressure

1449
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:39,279
of driving it extinct i believe we could

1450
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,358
have driven it extinct

1451
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,599
six months ago and we didn't do it

1452
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:44,000
because of very mundane concerns among a

1453
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,640
small

1454
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,599
number of people and i'm not alleging

1455
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,960
that

1456
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,760
they were brazen about

1457
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,119
um or that they were callous about

1458
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,559
deaths that would be caused

1459
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,480
i have the sense that they were working

1460
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,800
from a kind of autopilot

1461
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,639
in which you you know let's say you're

1462
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,400
in some kind of a corporation a

1463
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:07,679
pharmaceutical corporation

1464
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,440
you have a portfolio of

1465
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:11,440
therapies that in the context of a

1466
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,079
pandemic might be very lucrative

1467
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,920
those therapies have competitors you of

1468
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,960
course want to position your product so

1469
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,280
that it

1470
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,519
succeeds and the competitors don't and

1471
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,119
lo and behold at some point

1472
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:25,280
through means that i think those of us

1473
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,800
on the outside can't really

1474
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,400
intuit you end up saying things about

1475
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,640
competing therapies that work

1476
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,838
better and much more safely than the

1477
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:35,838
ones you're selling

1478
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:38,558
that aren't true and do cause people to

1479
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:40,719
die in large numbers

1480
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,119
but it you know it's some kind of

1481
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:46,000
autopilot at least part of it is

1482
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,358
so the there's a complicated coupling of

1483
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,199
the autopilot

1484
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:54,159
of uh institutions

1485
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:56,639
companies governments and then there's

1486
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:58,879
also the geopolitical game

1487
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,400
theory thing going on where you want to

1488
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,960
keep secrets

1489
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,880
it's the chernobyl thing where if you

1490
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,720
messed up

1491
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:11,519
there's a big incentive i think to hide

1492
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:11,838
the fact that you messed up so how do we

1493
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:14,318
fix

1494
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:15,838
this and what's more important to fix

1495
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:18,960
the autopilot

1496
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:19,679
which is the response that we often

1497
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,480
criticize

1498
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:24,159
about our institutions especially the

1499
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,599
leaders in those institutions anthony

1500
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:27,279
fauci and so on

1501
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,119
uh some of the members of the scientific

1502
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,800
community

1503
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:35,838
and the second part is the

1504
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,200
the game with china of hiding the

1505
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:40,239
information

1506
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,799
in terms of on the fight between nations

1507
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,159
well in our live streams on dark horse

1508
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,800
heather and i have been talking from the

1509
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:47,519
beginning

1510
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,400
about the fact that although yes what

1511
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,039
happens

1512
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,559
began in china it very much looks like a

1513
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:55,199
failure of the international

1514
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,240
scientific community and that's

1515
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,719
frightening

1516
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:00,959
but it's also hopeful in the sense that

1517
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:04,000
actually if we did the right thing now

1518
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:07,039
we're not navigating a puzzle about

1519
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,318
chinese responsibility we're navigating

1520
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:12,000
a question of collective responsibility

1521
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:15,119
for something that has been

1522
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,400
terribly costly to all of us so

1523
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,200
that's not a very happy process but as

1524
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,119
you point out

1525
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:22,239
what's at stake is in large measure at

1526
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,318
the very least

1527
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:26,239
the strong possibility this will happen

1528
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:26,558
again and that at some point it will be

1529
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,239
far

1530
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,280
worse so you know just as a person that

1531
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,159
does not learn

1532
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,839
the lessons of their own errors doesn't

1533
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:39,598
get smarter and they remain

1534
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:41,358
in danger we collectively humanity has

1535
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,119
to say well

1536
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:44,960
there sure is a lot of evidence that

1537
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,000
suggests that this is a self-inflicted

1538
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,159
wound

1539
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,239
when you have done something that has

1540
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:53,039
caused a massive self-inflicted

1541
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:53,919
wound self-inflicted wound it makes

1542
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:56,558
sense

1543
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,079
to dwell on it exactly to the point that

1544
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,400
you have learned the lesson that makes

1545
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,318
it

1546
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,680
very very unlikely that something

1547
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:03,759
similar will happen again

1548
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,358
i think this is a good place to kind of

1549
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,440
ask you to do almost like a thought

1550
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:11,759
experiment

1551
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,920
or to steal man

1552
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,520
the argument against the lab leak

1553
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,200
hypothesis

1554
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:22,318
so if you were to

1555
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:23,279
argue you know you said 95 percent

1556
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:26,318
chance

1557
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,400
that it the virus leaked from a lab

1558
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:29,920
there's a bunch of ways i think you can

1559
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,519
argue

1560
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,960
that even talking about it

1561
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:39,280
is uh bad for the world

1562
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,000
so i if i just put something on the

1563
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,359
table

1564
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,679
it's to say that um

1565
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:48,078
for one it would be racism versus

1566
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:50,799
chinese people

1567
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,000
that talking about that a leak from a

1568
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,318
lab there's a kind of

1569
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,039
immediate kind of blame and it can

1570
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:59,199
spiral down into this idea that's

1571
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,239
somehow the people are responsible for

1572
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:02,719
the virus and

1573
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:04,479
this kind of thing is it possible for

1574
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:08,239
you to come up with other

1575
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:10,480
steel man arguments against

1576
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:13,519
talking or against the possibility of

1577
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:16,639
the lab leak hypothesis

1578
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:20,159
well so i think steel manning is a tool

1579
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:23,358
that is extremely valuable but it's also

1580
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:25,118
possible to abuse it i think that you

1581
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:28,480
can only steal man a good faith

1582
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:30,160
argument and the problem is we now know

1583
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,159
that we have not been engaged

1584
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:33,759
in opponents who are wielding good faith

1585
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:36,078
arguments because privately

1586
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,599
their emails reflect their own doubts

1587
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,480
and what they were doing publicly was

1588
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,039
actually

1589
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,119
a punishment a public punishment for

1590
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:46,079
those of us who spoke up

1591
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:48,079
with i think the purpose of either

1592
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,240
backing us down or more likely

1593
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,400
warning others not to engage in the same

1594
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:54,479
kind of behavior and obviously for

1595
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,480
people like you and me who

1596
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:01,838
regard science as our likely best hope

1597
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:04,159
for navigating difficult waters shutting

1598
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:07,440
down people who are using those tools

1599
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:09,838
honorably is itself dishonorable

1600
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,440
so i i don't really i don't feel that it

1601
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:13,039
is

1602
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,480
i don't feel that there's anything to

1603
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:17,279
steal man and

1604
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,480
i also think that you know immediately

1605
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,400
at the point that the world

1606
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,920
suddenly with no new evidence on the

1607
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,838
table switched

1608
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,280
years with respect to the lab leak you

1609
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:27,039
know at the point that nicholas wade had

1610
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,319
published his article and suddenly the

1611
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:30,239
world was going to admit

1612
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:32,880
that this was at least a possibility if

1613
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:35,039
not a likelihood

1614
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,039
we got to see something of the

1615
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:37,440
rationalization process that had taken

1616
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:39,440
place

1617
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,599
inside the institutional world and it

1618
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,240
very definitely involved the claim

1619
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:44,960
that what was being avoided was the

1620
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:48,959
targeting

1621
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,960
of chinese scientists

1622
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,079
and my point would be i don't want to

1623
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,280
see the targeting of

1624
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:57,200
anyone i don't want to see racism of any

1625
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,559
kind on the other hand

1626
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:03,838
once you create license to lie

1627
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:06,319
in order to protect individuals

1628
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,440
when the world has a stake in knowing

1629
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:10,079
what happened

1630
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,599
then it is inevitable that that process

1631
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,519
that license to lie

1632
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,079
will be used by the thing that captures

1633
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:19,679
institutions for its own purposes so

1634
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:22,640
my sense is it may be very unfortunate

1635
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:23,039
if the story of what happened here can

1636
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,719
be

1637
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:29,519
used against uh chinese people

1638
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:31,039
that would be very unfortunate and as i

1639
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:32,960
think i mentioned

1640
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,880
heather and i have taken great pains to

1641
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,480
point out that this doesn't look like a

1642
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,760
chinese failure it looks like a failure

1643
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,798
of the international scientific

1644
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,400
community so

1645
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:43,119
i think it is important to broadcast

1646
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,639
that message along with the analysis

1647
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,720
of the evidence but no matter what

1648
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:49,759
happened we have a right to know

1649
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:51,598
and um i frankly do not take the

1650
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,440
institutional layer at its word

1651
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,039
that its motivations are honorable and

1652
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,880
that it was protecting

1653
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,480
you know good-hearted scientists at the

1654
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,760
expense of the world that that

1655
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,000
explanation does not add up well this is

1656
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,559
a

1657
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,239
very interesting question about whether

1658
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,760
it's ever okay to lie

1659
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:12,879
at the institutional layer to

1660
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:15,359
protect the populace

1661
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,838
i think both you and i are probably on

1662
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:17,838
the same

1663
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:21,838
have the same sense that it's a slippery

1664
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:24,400
slope

1665
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:26,239
even if it's an effective mechanism in

1666
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,880
the short term in the long term

1667
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:30,879
it's going to be destructive this

1668
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,559
happened with masks

1669
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,680
this happened with with other things if

1670
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:39,040
you look at just history pandemics

1671
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:41,358
there is um there's an idea that panic

1672
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,480
is destructive amongst the populace so

1673
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,558
you you

1674
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,079
want to construct a narrative whether

1675
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:49,440
it's a lie or not

1676
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:52,160
to minimize panic

1677
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,760
but you're suggesting that almost in all

1678
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:57,440
cases and i think that was

1679
00:57:53,760 --> 00:58:01,200
the lesson from the the pandemic

1680
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:05,119
in the early 20th century that

1681
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:06,838
lying creates distrust and distrust

1682
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,240
in the institutions is ultimately

1683
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:10,798
destructive

1684
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:11,279
that's your sense that lying is not okay

1685
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:14,159
well

1686
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,559
okay you know there are obviously places

1687
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,960
where

1688
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,559
complete transparency is not a good idea

1689
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:21,358
right to the extent that you

1690
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,079
broadcast a technology that allows one

1691
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:24,239
individual

1692
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,119
to hold the world hostage right

1693
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:27,598
obviously

1694
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,400
you've got a something to be navigated

1695
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,519
but

1696
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,880
in general i don't believe that the

1697
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:36,079
scientific system

1698
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:39,760
should be lying to us

1699
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:43,839
in the case of this particular lie

1700
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:47,040
the idea that the well-being of chinese

1701
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:48,480
scientists outweighs the well-being of

1702
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:51,039
the world

1703
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,838
is preposterous yeah right as you as you

1704
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:53,519
point out

1705
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:55,119
one thing that rests on this question is

1706
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:55,920
whether we continue to do this kind of

1707
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,680
research

1708
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,760
going forward and the scientists in

1709
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:02,399
question all of them american

1710
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,119
chinese all of them were pushing the

1711
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,680
idea

1712
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:07,760
that the risk of a zoonotic spillover

1713
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:09,679
event causing a major and highly

1714
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,559
destructive pandemic was so great

1715
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:14,318
that we had to risk this now if they

1716
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,400
themselves have caused it

1717
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:18,400
and if they are wrong as i believe they

1718
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,639
are about the likelihood of a major

1719
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,960
world pandemic spilling out of nature

1720
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:24,558
in the way that they uh wrote into their

1721
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,639
grant applications

1722
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,000
then the danger is you know the call is

1723
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:31,199
coming from inside the house

1724
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,159
and we have to look at that

1725
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,719
and yes whatever we have to do to

1726
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:38,239
protect

1727
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:42,159
scientists from retribution we should do

1728
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:43,759
but we cannot protecting them by lying

1729
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:46,798
to the world and even

1730
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:50,160
worse by

1731
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:54,159
demonizing people like

1732
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:57,920
me like uh josh rogan

1733
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:58,480
like yuri dagan the entire drastic group

1734
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,880
on

1735
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,760
twitter by demonizing us for simply

1736
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,440
following the

1737
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:07,280
evidence is to set a terrible precedent

1738
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,119
right you're demonizing people for using

1739
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,680
the scientific method to evaluate

1740
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,838
evidence

1741
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:14,000
that is available to us in the world

1742
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:16,719
what a terrible crime it is to

1743
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,079
teach that lesson right thou shalt not

1744
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,399
use scientific tools

1745
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,480
no i'm sorry whatever your license to

1746
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:25,358
lie is it doesn't extend to that

1747
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,719
yeah i've seen the the attacks on you

1748
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:31,598
the pressure on you

1749
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:35,118
has a very important effect on

1750
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:38,480
thousands of world-class biologists

1751
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:40,838
actually at mit colleagues of mine

1752
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,079
people i know there's a there's a slight

1753
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:45,440
pressure

1754
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:48,720
to not be allowed to uh

1755
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:51,838
one speak publicly and to

1756
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:53,759
actually think like

1757
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:56,318
to even think about these ideas it

1758
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,640
sounds kind of ridiculous but just the

1759
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:00,318
in the in the privacy of your own home

1760
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:03,279
to to read things to

1761
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:04,318
to think it's many people many

1762
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,160
world-class

1763
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:11,358
biologists that i know will just avoid

1764
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,798
looking at the data there's not even

1765
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:14,960
that many people that are publicly

1766
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:17,679
opposing gain of function research

1767
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,639
they they're they're also like it's not

1768
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:20,318
worth it

1769
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:22,318
it's not worth the battle and there's

1770
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:23,920
many people that kind of argue that

1771
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:25,440
those battles should be fought in

1772
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,318
private

1773
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,280
in uh um you know with colleagues in the

1774
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,639
um

1775
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,680
in the privacy of the scientific

1776
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:36,239
community that the public is somehow not

1777
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:38,480
maybe intelligent enough to be able to

1778
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:39,679
deal with the the complexities of this

1779
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,838
kind of discussion

1780
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:44,078
i don't know but the final result is

1781
01:01:41,838 --> 01:01:47,119
combined with the bullying of you

1782
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,960
and uh all the different pressures in

1783
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,680
the academic institutions is that

1784
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,280
it's just people are self-censoring and

1785
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:55,038
silencing themselves

1786
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,160
and silencing the most important thing

1787
01:01:55,039 --> 01:02:01,440
which is the power of their brains

1788
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:03,118
like these people are brilliant

1789
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,318
and the fact that they're not utilizing

1790
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:08,880
their brain to come up with solutions

1791
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:09,920
uh outside of the conformist line of

1792
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,680
thinking

1793
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:16,000
is tragic well it is i also think

1794
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:17,679
that it we have to look at it and

1795
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,559
understand it for what it is

1796
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:20,879
for one thing it's kind of a cryptic

1797
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,119
totalitarianism

1798
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,640
somehow people's sense of what they're

1799
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,680
allowed to think about talk about

1800
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:28,078
discuss

1801
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:29,519
is causing them to self-censor and i can

1802
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,440
tell you it's causing many of them to

1803
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:33,119
rationalize which is even worse they are

1804
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:37,760
blinding themselves to what they can

1805
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:39,358
see but it is also the case i believe

1806
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,440
that what you're describing about what

1807
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:44,239
people said and a great many

1808
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:46,000
people understood that the lab leak

1809
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:46,879
hypothesis could not be taken off the

1810
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,760
table

1811
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:50,318
but they didn't say so publicly and i

1812
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,720
think

1813
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:54,480
that their discussions with each other

1814
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:55,519
about why they did not say what they

1815
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,838
understood

1816
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:59,038
that's what capture sounds like on the

1817
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:01,440
inside

1818
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:02,799
i don't know exactly what force captured

1819
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,400
the institutions

1820
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:07,759
i don't think anybody knows for sure out

1821
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,960
here in public

1822
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,599
i don't even know that it wasn't just

1823
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,159
simply a process but

1824
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:15,440
you have these institutions they are

1825
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:18,879
behaving

1826
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,440
towards a kind of somatic obligation

1827
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,440
they have

1828
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,720
lost sight of what they were built to

1829
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:26,079
accomplish

1830
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:28,480
and on the inside the way they avoid

1831
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:30,079
going back to their original mission is

1832
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,920
to say things to themselves

1833
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:34,160
like the public can't have this

1834
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,440
discussion it can't be trusted with it

1835
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:36,960
yes we need to be able to talk about

1836
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,400
this but it has to be private whatever

1837
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,240
it is they say to themselves that is

1838
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,720
what capture sounds like on the inside

1839
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:43,679
it's

1840
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:44,399
a institutional rationalization

1841
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:46,639
mechanism

1842
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,000
and it's very very deadly and at the

1843
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:50,960
point you go from

1844
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,079
lab leak to repurposed drugs you can see

1845
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,679
that it's very deadly

1846
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,559
in a very direct way yeah i see this on

1847
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:59,919
in my

1848
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:01,680
field of with uh things like autonomous

1849
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,920
weapon systems

1850
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:05,838
people in ai do not talk about the use

1851
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,079
of ai in weapon systems

1852
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:09,679
they they kind of avoid the idea that ai

1853
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,000
is used in the military

1854
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,598
it's kind of funny there there's this

1855
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
like kind of discomfort and they're like

1856
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,519
they all hurry like uh you know like

1857
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,358
something scary happens and a bunch of

1858
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:21,199
sheep kind of like run a run away that's

1859
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:22,798
what it looks like

1860
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:24,798
and it i don't even know what to do

1861
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:27,519
about it because and then i feel this

1862
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:29,119
natural pull every time i bring up

1863
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:31,038
autonomous weapon systems

1864
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,798
to go along with the sheep there's a

1865
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,520
natural kind of pull towards that

1866
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:35,519
direction

1867
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:37,038
because it's like what can i do as one

1868
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:39,119
person

1869
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,720
now there's currently nothing

1870
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,920
destructive happening with autonomous

1871
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:43,679
weapons systems

1872
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,200
so we're in like in the early days of

1873
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:47,279
this race that

1874
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:49,118
in 10 20 years might become a real

1875
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,880
problem now where

1876
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,358
the discussion we're having now we're

1877
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,880
not facing the result of that in the

1878
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:57,519
space of viruses

1879
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,318
uh like for many years avoiding the

1880
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:01,440
conversations here

1881
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:03,440
i don't know what to do that in the

1882
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,200
early days um

1883
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,159
but i think we have to i guess create

1884
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:11,038
institutions where people can stand out

1885
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:11,358
people can stand out and like basically

1886
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,079
be

1887
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:14,880
individual thinkers and break out into

1888
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,599
all kinds of

1889
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,240
spaces of ideas that allow us to think

1890
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:20,079
freely

1891
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,598
freedom of thought and maybe that

1892
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,798
requires the decentralization of

1893
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:26,079
institutions

1894
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:29,119
well years ago i came up with a concept

1895
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:30,318
called cultivated insecurity and the

1896
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,318
idea is

1897
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:33,759
let's just take the example of the

1898
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:36,639
average joe

1899
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,599
right the average joe has a job

1900
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:40,798
somewhere

1901
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:44,160
and their mortgage their

1902
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:47,358
medical insurance their retirement

1903
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:49,679
their connection with the economy is

1904
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:51,119
to one degree or another dependent on

1905
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,879
their relationship

1906
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:57,280
with the employer that means

1907
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,480
that there is a strong incentive

1908
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,559
especially in

1909
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,159
any industry where it's not easy to move

1910
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,519
from one employer to the next there's a

1911
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:06,639
strong incentive

1912
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:08,559
to stay in your employer's good graces

1913
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,000
right so it creates a very top-down

1914
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:13,039
dynamic not only

1915
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,199
in terms of who gets to tell

1916
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,880
other people what to do but it really

1917
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:18,719
comes down to who gets to tell other

1918
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:22,160
people how to think

1919
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:25,358
so that's extremely dangerous the way

1920
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:27,199
out of it is to cultivate security

1921
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:28,719
to the extent that somebody is in a

1922
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:31,598
position to

1923
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:33,358
go against the grain and have it not be

1924
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:35,280
a catastrophe for their family

1925
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:36,798
and their ability to earn you will see

1926
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,160
that behavior a lot more so

1927
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:40,079
i would argue that some of what you're

1928
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,159
talking about is just a simple

1929
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,599
uh predictable consequence of the

1930
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:48,078
concentration

1931
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:51,519
of the uh the sources of well-being

1932
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:54,400
and that this is a solvable problem

1933
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,199
you got a chance to talk with joe rogan

1934
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,400
yesterday

1935
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:59,279
yes i did and i just saw the episode was

1936
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,920
released

1937
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:05,280
and uh ivermectin is trending on twitter

1938
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,960
joe told me it was an incredible

1939
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,319
conversation i look forward to listening

1940
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,240
today many people

1941
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:12,960
have probably by the time this is

1942
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:14,239
released i've already listened to it

1943
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,639
i think it would be interesting to

1944
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:19,838
discuss

1945
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:21,038
uh a postmortem how do you feel how that

1946
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:25,519
conversation went

1947
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:28,960
maybe broadly how do you see the story

1948
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:32,559
as its unfolding of ivermectin from

1949
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:35,519
the origins from before covert 19

1950
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:39,039
through 2020 to today i very much

1951
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,038
enjoyed talking to joe and i'm

1952
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,720
indescribably grateful that he would

1953
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:44,639
take

1954
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,439
the risk of such a discussion that he

1955
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:49,279
would as he described it do an emergency

1956
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,960
podcast on the subject

1957
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,920
which i i think that was not an

1958
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:57,440
exaggeration this needed to happen

1959
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:59,200
for various reasons that he uh

1960
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,280
he took us down the road of talking

1961
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:03,038
about the censorship campaign against

1962
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:06,079
ivermectin which i find

1963
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,839
utterly shocking and talking about

1964
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,760
the drug itself and i should say we

1965
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:12,798
talked we had pierre corey

1966
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:15,920
available he came on the podcast as well

1967
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:18,560
he is of course the face of the

1968
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,920
fl triple c the frontline covet 19

1969
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,920
critical care

1970
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,359
alliance these are doctors who have

1971
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,960
innovated

1972
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,719
ways of treating covet patients and they

1973
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,319
happened on ivermectin

1974
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:32,560
and have been using it and

1975
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,000
i hesitate to use the word advocating

1976
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,798
for it because that's not really the

1977
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,560
role

1978
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:38,319
of doctors or scientists but they are

1979
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,600
advocating for it in the sense that

1980
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,679
there is this

1981
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,759
uh pressure not to talk about its

1982
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:46,640
effectiveness for reasons that we can

1983
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:47,279
go into so maybe step back and say what

1984
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,798
is

1985
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:52,480
ivermectin and how much

1986
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:54,399
studies have been done to show its

1987
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:56,479
effectiveness

1988
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,519
so ivermectin is an interesting drug it

1989
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:01,119
was discovered

1990
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:04,400
in the 70s by a japanese scientist

1991
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:08,158
named satoshi omura and he found it

1992
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:10,399
in soil near a japanese golf course

1993
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,759
so i would just point out in passing

1994
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:15,519
that if we were to stop

1995
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:18,238
self-silencing over the possibility that

1996
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,239
asians will be demonized over the

1997
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,119
possible lab leak in wuhan and to

1998
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,798
recognize

1999
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,158
that actually the natural course of the

2000
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:27,679
story

2001
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:30,719
has a likely lab leak in china

2002
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:35,119
it has a unlikely hero

2003
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:38,000
in japan the story is naturally

2004
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:38,960
not a simple one but in any case uh

2005
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,479
amura

2006
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:45,600
discovered this molecule he uh

2007
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:46,879
sent it to a friend who was at merck a

2008
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,480
scientist named campbell

2009
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,960
they won a nobel prize for the discovery

2010
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:55,039
of

2011
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:57,279
the ivermectin molecule in 2015.

2012
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:58,640
its initial use was in treating

2013
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:02,000
parasitic infections

2014
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:04,960
it's very effective in treating the

2015
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,359
the worm that causes river blindness uh

2016
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,359
the

2017
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:08,639
pathogen that causes elephantitis

2018
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,799
scabies

2019
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,880
it's a very effective anti-parasite drug

2020
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,279
it's extremely safe it's on the who's

2021
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,319
list

2022
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:17,920
of essential medications it's safe for

2023
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,399
children it has been administered

2024
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,960
something like four billion times in the

2025
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:23,599
last

2026
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,600
four decades it has been given away in

2027
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,880
the millions of doses

2028
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:30,960
by merck in africa people have

2029
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,159
been on it for long periods of time and

2030
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,039
in fact one of the

2031
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:37,039
reasons that africa may have had less

2032
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:37,920
severe impacts from covid19 is that

2033
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:39,840
ivermectin

2034
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,158
is widely used there to prevent

2035
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,159
parasites and the drug appears to have a

2036
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:45,599
long lasting impact so it's an

2037
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:48,079
interesting molecule

2038
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,360
it was discovered some time ago

2039
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:51,279
apparently

2040
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:52,479
that it has antiviral properties and so

2041
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:55,039
it was tested

2042
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:56,718
in early in the covet 19 pandemic to see

2043
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:59,279
if it might work

2044
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,840
to treat humans with covid it turned out

2045
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:02,639
to have

2046
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,119
very promising uh evidence that it did

2047
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,920
treat

2048
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:07,760
humans it was tested in tissues it was

2049
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,760
tested at a very high dosage which

2050
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,079
confuses people they think that those of

2051
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,320
us

2052
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,439
who believe that ivermectin might be

2053
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:14,880
useful

2054
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:16,719
in confronting this disease are

2055
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,640
advocating those high doses which is not

2056
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,079
the case

2057
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,840
but in any case there have been quite a

2058
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:24,399
number of studies

2059
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,239
a wonderful meta-analysis was finally

2060
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:27,439
released we had seen it in pre-print

2061
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:29,919
version but it was finally

2062
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:30,799
peer-reviewed and published this last

2063
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,840
week

2064
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,360
um it reveals that the drug as

2065
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,719
clinicians have been telling us those

2066
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:38,238
who've been using it it's highly

2067
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:39,760
effective at treating people with the

2068
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:40,559
disease especially if you get to them

2069
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,640
early

2070
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,560
and it showed an 86 percent

2071
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,719
effectiveness as a prophylactic to

2072
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,760
prevent people from contracting

2073
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:53,119
covid and that number 86 percent

2074
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:56,159
is high enough to drive sars cov2

2075
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:59,359
to extinction if we wished to deploy it

2076
01:11:56,158 --> 01:12:02,479
first of all the the the meta analysis

2077
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:05,119
is this the uh ivermectin foucault 19

2078
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:06,879
real-time meta-analysis of 60 studies

2079
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,399
or there's a bunch of meta-analysis

2080
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,400
there because i i was really impressed

2081
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:11,198
by the real-time meta-analysis that

2082
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:13,198
keeps getting

2083
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:16,238
updated i don't know it's the same kind

2084
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:16,238
of the one at uh

2085
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:21,840
ivmmeta.com

2086
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:23,920
well i saw it it's uh c19

2087
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,520
no this is not that meta-analysis stuff

2088
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,279
so that is as you say a living meta

2089
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,040
analysis where you can watch as

2090
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:31,039
evidence which is super cool by the way

2091
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:32,719
it's really cool and they've got some

2092
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:34,640
really nice graphics that allow you to

2093
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:34,960
understand well what is the evidence you

2094
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,640
know

2095
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,880
it's concentrated around this level of

2096
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,800
effectiveness etc so anyway it's great

2097
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,920
site well worth paying attention to

2098
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,520
no this is a meta-analysis um i don't

2099
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,560
know any of the authors but

2100
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,360
one second author is tess laurie of the

2101
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,960
bird group

2102
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:55,920
bird being a a group of

2103
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:58,079
analysts and doctors in britain that is

2104
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,399
playing a role similar to the fl triple

2105
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:01,198
c

2106
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:03,439
here in the u.s so anyway this is a

2107
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:06,319
meta-analysis that that

2108
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,519
that uh test laurie and others did of

2109
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:10,639
all of the available

2110
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:12,400
evidence and um it's quite compelling

2111
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,760
people if people can look for it on my

2112
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:15,039
twitter i will i will put it up and

2113
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,800
people can find it there

2114
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:21,760
so what about those here that

2115
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,279
in terms of safety uh what do we

2116
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,159
understand about the the kind of dust

2117
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:27,119
required to

2118
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:28,559
to have that level of effectiveness and

2119
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:30,479
what do we understand about is

2120
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,400
the safety of that kind of dose so let

2121
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:36,319
me just say i'm not a medical doctor

2122
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:39,679
i'm a biologist i'm on ivermectin

2123
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:42,399
uh in lieu of vaccination in terms of

2124
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:44,319
dosage there is one reason for concern

2125
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:45,759
which is that the most effective dose

2126
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,759
for prophylaxis

2127
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,440
involves something like weekly

2128
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,679
administration

2129
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:52,639
and that that is because that is not a

2130
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:55,840
historical

2131
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:57,280
pattern of use for the drug um it is

2132
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,880
possible that there is some long-term

2133
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:01,519
implication of being on it

2134
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,319
for being on it weekly for a long period

2135
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,000
of time

2136
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:06,000
there's not a strong indication of that

2137
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,079
the safety signal that we have

2138
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,560
uh over people using the drug over many

2139
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:14,079
years and using it in high doses in fact

2140
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:16,080
dr corey told me yesterday that there

2141
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:18,238
are cases in which people have made

2142
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:20,319
uh calculation errors and taken a

2143
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:21,359
massive overdose of the drug and had no

2144
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:23,279
ill effect

2145
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:24,880
so anyway there's lots of reasons to

2146
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:26,880
think the drug is comparatively safe but

2147
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,239
no drug is perfectly safe

2148
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,640
and i do worry about the long-term

2149
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:34,319
implications of taking it

2150
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,320
i also think it's very likely

2151
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:41,119
because the drug is administered

2152
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:44,400
in a dose something like let's say

2153
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:45,760
15 milligrams for somebody my size once

2154
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:47,359
a week after you've gone through the

2155
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,440
initial

2156
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:51,198
the initial double dose that you take 48

2157
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:53,759
hours apart

2158
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:54,319
it is apparent that if the amount of

2159
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,239
drug

2160
01:14:54,319 --> 01:14:58,319
in your system is sufficient to be

2161
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:59,359
protective at the end of the week then

2162
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:01,279
it was probably far

2163
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:03,198
too high at the beginning of the week so

2164
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:06,719
there's a question about whether or not

2165
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:09,759
you could flatten out the intake so that

2166
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:11,600
the amount of ivermectin goes down but

2167
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,640
the protection remains i have

2168
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,039
little doubt that that would be

2169
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,600
discovered if we looked for it

2170
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:18,800
but that said it does seem to be quite

2171
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,199
safe

2172
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,239
highly effective at preventing covid the

2173
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:24,559
86

2174
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:25,599
number is plenty high enough for us to

2175
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,080
drive

2176
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,280
uh sarsko v2 to extinction in light of

2177
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:32,960
its r naught number

2178
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:34,559
of slightly more than two um

2179
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,560
and so why we are not using it as a bit

2180
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,280
of a a mystery

2181
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:42,480
so even if everything you said now turns

2182
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:42,479
out to be not correct

2183
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:47,440
it is nevertheless obvious that it's

2184
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:47,920
sufficiently promising it always has

2185
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:51,519
been

2186
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:53,840
in order to merit rigorous scientific

2187
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,120
exploration investigation doing a lot of

2188
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,400
studies

2189
01:15:55,119 --> 01:16:00,158
and certainly not censoring the science

2190
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:03,679
or the discussion of it

2191
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:06,639
so before we talk about the various

2192
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,079
vaccines for code 19 i'd like to talk to

2193
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,719
you about censorship

2194
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:12,479
given everything you're saying why did

2195
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:16,239
youtube

2196
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:21,519
and other places censor

2197
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:23,039
discussion of um have a mechtin

2198
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,560
well there's a question about why they

2199
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:26,719
say they did it and there's a question

2200
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:30,400
about why they actually did it

2201
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:33,520
now it is worth mentioning that youtube

2202
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:37,198
is part of a consortium

2203
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:40,239
it is partnered with twitter facebook

2204
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:43,039
reuters ap financial times

2205
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:44,799
washington post some other notable

2206
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:49,840
organizations

2207
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:52,400
and that this group has appointed itself

2208
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,119
the arbiter of truth in effect they have

2209
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:57,279
decided

2210
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:58,559
to control discussion ostensibly

2211
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:00,559
to prevent the distribution of

2212
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,400
misinformation

2213
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,159
now how have they chosen to do that in

2214
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:07,679
this case they have chosen

2215
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:08,319
to simply utilize the recommendations of

2216
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,199
the who

2217
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:14,840
and the cdc and apply them as if they

2218
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:17,359
are synonymous with scientific truth

2219
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:20,000
problem even at their best

2220
01:17:17,359 --> 01:17:22,399
the who and cdc are not scientific

2221
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,039
entities they are entities that are

2222
01:17:22,399 --> 01:17:25,439
about public health and public health

2223
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:28,719
has

2224
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:31,279
this whether it's right or not and i

2225
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:32,480
believe i disagree with it but it has

2226
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,519
this

2227
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:38,879
uh self-assigned right

2228
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,360
to lie that comes from the fact that

2229
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,359
there is

2230
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:43,039
game theory that works against for

2231
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:44,319
example a successful vaccination

2232
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:48,000
campaign

2233
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:50,000
that if everybody else takes a vaccine

2234
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,679
and therefore the herd becomes immune

2235
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,840
through vaccination

2236
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:55,199
and you decide not to take a vaccine

2237
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,960
then you benefit from

2238
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:58,559
the immunity of the herd without having

2239
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,198
taken the risk

2240
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,920
so people who do best are the people who

2241
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:04,559
opt out

2242
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:08,319
that's a hazard and the who and cdc as

2243
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,320
public health entities effectively

2244
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:12,319
oversimplify stories in order that that

2245
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,079
game theory does not

2246
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:15,439
cause a predictable tragedy of the

2247
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:17,760
commons

2248
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:19,119
with that said once that right to lie

2249
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,000
exists

2250
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:23,519
then it finds out it turns out to serve

2251
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,960
the interests of for example

2252
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,040
pharmaceutical companies

2253
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:28,719
which have emergency use authorizations

2254
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:29,840
that require that there not be a safe

2255
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,158
and effective treatment

2256
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,520
and have immunity from liability for

2257
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:36,158
harms caused by

2258
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,040
their product so that's a recipe for

2259
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:38,879
disaster

2260
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:40,479
right you don't need to be a

2261
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,640
sophisticated

2262
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:44,959
thinker about complex systems to see the

2263
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,679
hazard of immunizing

2264
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,239
a company from the harm of its own

2265
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,480
product

2266
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:52,399
at the same time that that product can

2267
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:55,039
only exist in the market

2268
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:57,039
if some other product that works better

2269
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:59,920
somehow fails to be noticed

2270
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:02,238
so somehow youtube is doing the bidding

2271
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,600
of merck and others

2272
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:05,839
whether it knows that that's what it's

2273
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,400
doing i have no idea i think this may

2274
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,600
be another case of an autopilot that

2275
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:10,399
thinks it's doing the right thing

2276
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,280
because it's

2277
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:14,158
parroting the corrupt wisdom of the who

2278
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:16,238
and the cdc

2279
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:17,920
but the who and the cdc have been wrong

2280
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:20,559
again and again in this pandemic

2281
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:22,158
and the irony here is that with youtube

2282
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,640
coming after me

2283
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:26,639
well my channel has been right where the

2284
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:30,079
who and cdc have been wrong

2285
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:32,880
consistently over the whole pandemic so

2286
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:35,039
how is it that youtube is censoring us

2287
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,760
because the who and cdc disagree with us

2288
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:37,279
when in fact

2289
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,039
in past disagreements we've been right

2290
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:43,759
and they've been wrong there's

2291
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:43,760
so much to talk about here so

2292
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,880
i've heard this many times actually on

2293
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:50,238
the inside of youtube

2294
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,400
and with colleagues that i've talked

2295
01:19:50,238 --> 01:19:55,759
about talked with

2296
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:56,799
is they kind of in a very casual way say

2297
01:19:55,760 --> 01:20:00,320
their

2298
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:03,520
job is simply to slow or prevent the

2299
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:03,519
spread of misinformation

2300
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,880
and they say like that's an easy thing

2301
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:10,158
to do

2302
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,679
like to know what is true or not is an

2303
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:14,399
easy thing to do

2304
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:16,079
and so from the youtube perspective i

2305
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:19,759
think

2306
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:22,158
they basically outsource of

2307
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,039
of the the task of knowing what is true

2308
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:27,279
or not

2309
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:30,238
to public institutions that on a basic

2310
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:33,039
google search claim to be the arbiters

2311
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:36,479
of truth

2312
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:38,960
so if you were youtube who are

2313
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:40,638
exceptionally profitable and

2314
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,840
exceptionally powerful

2315
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:45,600
in terms of controlling what people get

2316
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:48,800
to see or not

2317
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:51,920
what would you do would you take a stand

2318
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:55,199
a public stand against the w.h.o who

2319
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:58,158
cdc or would you

2320
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:58,719
instead say you know what let's open the

2321
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:02,879
damn

2322
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:04,880
and let any video on anything fly

2323
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,039
what do you what do you do here if you

2324
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:08,319
say you were put if brett weinstein was

2325
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:11,679
put in charge

2326
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:13,599
of youtube for a month in this

2327
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:16,000
most critical of times where youtube

2328
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:19,360
actually has incredible amounts of power

2329
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,560
to educate the populace to give

2330
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:24,319
power of knowledge to the populace such

2331
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,719
that they can reform institutions what

2332
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:29,679
would you do how would you run youtube

2333
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:30,560
well unfortunately or fortunately this

2334
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:33,760
is actually

2335
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,719
quite simple the founders the american

2336
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,400
founders

2337
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:37,760
settled on a counter-intuitive

2338
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:40,399
formulation

2339
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,039
that people should be free to say

2340
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:43,279
anything

2341
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:45,279
they should be free from the government

2342
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:47,840
blocking them from doing so

2343
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:48,559
they did not imagine that in formulating

2344
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,400
that right

2345
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:52,320
that most of what was said would be of

2346
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:54,399
high quality nor did they imagine it

2347
01:21:52,319 --> 01:21:56,559
would be free of harmful things

2348
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:57,599
what they correctly reasoned was that

2349
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,199
the benefit

2350
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:03,280
of leaving everything so it can be said

2351
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:05,678
exceeds the cost which everyone

2352
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:07,519
understands to be substantial

2353
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:09,520
what i would say is they could not have

2354
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:13,520
anticipated

2355
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:16,880
the impact the centrality of platforms

2356
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:20,000
like youtube facebook twitter etc

2357
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,840
if they had they would not have limited

2358
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,079
the first amendment as they did

2359
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,600
they clearly understood that the power

2360
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:29,198
of the federal government

2361
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,760
was so great that it needed to be

2362
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:32,399
limited

2363
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,800
by granting explicitly the right of

2364
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:38,719
citizens to say anything

2365
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,920
in fact youtube twitter facebook may be

2366
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,600
more powerful

2367
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,199
in this moment than the federal

2368
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,079
government of their worst nightmares

2369
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:46,158
could have been

2370
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:47,119
the power that these entities have to

2371
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:49,359
control

2372
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:50,158
thought and to shift civilization is so

2373
01:22:49,359 --> 01:22:51,439
great

2374
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:53,439
that we need to have those same

2375
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:54,399
protections it doesn't mean that harmful

2376
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:56,319
things won't be said

2377
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:58,960
but it means that nothing has changed

2378
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:01,759
about the cost benefit analysis

2379
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:03,198
of building the right to censor so if i

2380
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,239
were running youtube

2381
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:08,000
the limit of what should be allowed is

2382
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:10,479
the limit of the law

2383
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,319
right if what you are doing is legal

2384
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:14,718
then it should not be youtube's place

2385
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:15,519
to limit what gets said or who gets to

2386
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,920
hear it

2387
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,199
that is between speakers and audience

2388
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,239
will harm come from that

2389
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:22,879
of course it will but will net harm come

2390
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:24,638
from it

2391
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:26,480
no i don't believe it will i believe

2392
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:28,159
that allowing everything to be said does

2393
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:30,319
allow a process in which

2394
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:31,679
better ideas do come to the fore and win

2395
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:34,319
out so

2396
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,760
you believe that in the end when there's

2397
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:39,679
complete freedom

2398
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:42,480
to share ideas that truth will win out

2399
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:44,079
so what i've noticed just as a brief

2400
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:48,158
side comment

2401
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:51,519
that certain things become viral

2402
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:52,319
irregardless of their truth i i've

2403
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,760
noticed that

2404
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:58,479
things that are dramatic and or funny

2405
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,679
like things that become memes are not

2406
01:23:58,479 --> 01:24:01,919
don't have to be grounded

2407
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,039
in truth and so that what worries me

2408
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:06,880
there

2409
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:09,920
is that we basically maximize

2410
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,840
for drama versus maximize for truth in a

2411
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:14,840
system where everything is

2412
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:16,239
free and that's worrying in the time of

2413
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,239
emergency

2414
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:19,678
well yes it's all worrying in time of

2415
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:21,198
emergency to be sure

2416
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,880
but i want you to notice that what

2417
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:24,799
you've happened on is actually an

2418
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,719
analog for a much deeper and older

2419
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:30,159
problem

2420
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:31,840
human beings are the

2421
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:33,359
we are not a blank slate but we are the

2422
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,000
blankest slate that nature has ever

2423
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:35,599
devised

2424
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,359
and there's a reason for that right it's

2425
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:42,480
where our flexibility comes from

2426
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:45,519
we have effectively we are robots

2427
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:48,479
in which the a large fraction

2428
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,120
of the cognitive capacity has been or of

2429
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:51,359
the

2430
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:53,359
behavioral capacity has been offloaded

2431
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:57,039
to the software layer which gets written

2432
01:24:53,359 --> 01:25:00,238
and rewritten over evolutionary time

2433
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:00,880
that means effectively that much of what

2434
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:02,319
we are

2435
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,639
in fact the important part of what we

2436
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:07,039
are is housed in the in the cultural

2437
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:07,760
layer and the conscious layer and not in

2438
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:10,719
the hardware

2439
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,719
hard coding layer

2440
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:17,359
that layer is prone to make errors right

2441
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:17,759
and anybody who's watched a child grow

2442
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:19,679
up

2443
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,039
knows that children make absurd errors

2444
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:22,158
all the time right that's

2445
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:24,079
part of the process as we were

2446
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:26,479
discussing earlier

2447
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:27,279
it is also true that as you look across

2448
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:29,678
a

2449
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:31,359
field of people discussing things a lot

2450
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:32,960
of what is said is pure nonsense it's

2451
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:36,479
garbage

2452
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:38,639
but the tendency of garbage to

2453
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:39,678
emerge and even to spread in the short

2454
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:41,840
term

2455
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:42,719
does not say that over the long term

2456
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,920
what sticks

2457
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:49,198
is not the valuable ideas

2458
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:50,880
so there is a high tendency for

2459
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:52,399
novelty to be created in the cultural

2460
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,560
space but there's also a high tendency

2461
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:56,000
for it to go extinct and you have to

2462
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,719
keep that in mind it's not like the

2463
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,560
genome

2464
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:00,158
right everything is happening at a much

2465
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,440
higher rate things are being created

2466
01:26:00,158 --> 01:26:03,920
they're being destroyed

2467
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:06,079
and i can't say that you know i mean

2468
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,039
obviously we've seen totalitarianism

2469
01:26:06,079 --> 01:26:09,679
arise

2470
01:26:07,039 --> 01:26:11,679
many times and it's very destructive

2471
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:14,000
each time it does so it's not like

2472
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,359
hey freedom to come up with any idea you

2473
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,039
want hasn't produced

2474
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:18,479
a whole lot of carnage but the question

2475
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:21,600
is over time

2476
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:22,319
does it produce more open fairer more

2477
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,639
decent

2478
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:25,439
societies and i believe that it does i

2479
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,000
can't prove it

2480
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:29,519
but that does seem to be the pattern i i

2481
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,800
believe so as well

2482
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:36,000
the thing is in the short term

2483
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:38,719
freedom of speech absolute freedom of

2484
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,000
speech can be quite destructive

2485
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:42,480
but you nevertheless have to hold on to

2486
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,238
that

2487
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:46,799
because in the long term i think you and

2488
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:49,198
i i guess

2489
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:51,360
are optimistic in the sense that good

2490
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:54,079
ideas will win out

2491
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:55,439
i don't know how strongly i believe that

2492
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:58,158
it will work but i will say i haven't

2493
01:26:55,439 --> 01:27:01,279
heard a better idea

2494
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:02,319
yeah i would also point out that there's

2495
01:27:01,279 --> 01:27:05,119
something very

2496
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:07,359
significant in this question of the

2497
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:09,039
hubris involved in imagining that you're

2498
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:10,238
going to improve the discussion by

2499
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:13,760
censoring

2500
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:18,079
which is the majority of

2501
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:21,199
concepts at the fringe are nonsense

2502
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:23,559
that's automatic but the

2503
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:24,799
heterodoxy at the fringe which is

2504
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:28,000
indistinguishable

2505
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:31,440
at the beginning from the nonsense ideas

2506
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,600
is the key to progress so if you decide

2507
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:35,678
hey the fringe is 99

2508
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,120
garbage let's just get rid of it right

2509
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:38,239
hey that's a strong win we're getting

2510
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:40,000
rid of 99

2511
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:41,678
garbage for one percent something or

2512
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,679
other and the point is yeah but that one

2513
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:46,000
percent something rather is the key

2514
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:48,239
you're throwing out the key and so

2515
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
that's what youtube is doing

2516
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:52,000
frankly i think at the point that it

2517
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
started censoring my channel

2518
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,520
you know in the immediate aftermath of

2519
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,119
this major reversal of

2520
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,320
lab for lab leak it should have looked

2521
01:27:57,119 --> 01:27:59,359
at itself and said well what the hell

2522
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:00,880
are we doing

2523
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:02,719
who are we sensory we're sensory

2524
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,800
somebody who was just right

2525
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:06,719
right in a conflict with the very same

2526
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:08,239
people on whose behalf we are now

2527
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:09,279
censoring right that should have caused

2528
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:11,039
them to wake up

2529
01:28:09,279 --> 01:28:14,319
so you said one approach if you were on

2530
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:16,319
youtube was just basically

2531
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:17,920
let all videos go that do not violate

2532
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:19,920
the law well i should fix that

2533
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,319
okay i believe that that is the basic

2534
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,158
principle eric makes an excellent point

2535
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:27,599
about the distinction between

2536
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:29,920
ideas and personal attacks doxing

2537
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,039
these other things so i agree there's no

2538
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,119
value in allowing

2539
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:35,119
people to destroy each other's lives

2540
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:37,439
even if there's a technical

2541
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:39,039
legal defense for it now how you draw

2542
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:41,519
that line i don't know

2543
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:43,279
but you know what i'm talking about is

2544
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,960
yes people should be free to traffic and

2545
01:28:43,279 --> 01:28:47,119
bad ideas and they should be free to

2546
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,359
expose that the ideas are bad

2547
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:50,559
and hopefully that process results in

2548
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:53,198
better ideas winning out

2549
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,920
yeah there's an interesting line between

2550
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:56,559
you know

2551
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,039
like uh ideas like the earth is flat

2552
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,239
which

2553
01:28:57,039 --> 01:29:00,800
i believe you should not censor and then

2554
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:03,119
like

2555
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,320
you start to encroach on like personal

2556
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:06,800
attacks

2557
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:08,639
so not not you know doxxing yes but like

2558
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,560
not even getting to that like there's a

2559
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:14,880
certain point where it's like

2560
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,880
that's no longer ideas that's more

2561
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:18,319
that's somehow not productive even if

2562
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:20,479
it's

2563
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,319
it feels like uh believing the earth is

2564
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:25,119
flat it's somehow productive

2565
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:26,399
because maybe this tiny percent chance

2566
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:28,158
it is

2567
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:29,679
you know like it just feels like

2568
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:32,799
personal attacks

2569
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:34,560
it doesn't um well you know it's i'm

2570
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,239
torn on this because

2571
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,840
there's [ __ ] in this world there's

2572
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:39,678
fraudulent people in this world so

2573
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:41,840
sometimes personal attacks are useful to

2574
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:44,719
reveal that

2575
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,440
but there's a line you can cross like

2576
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:48,480
there's a

2577
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:49,279
comedy where people make fun of others i

2578
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:50,879
think that's

2579
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:53,039
amazing that's very powerful and that's

2580
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:56,239
very useful even if it's painful

2581
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:58,560
but then there's like once it gets to be

2582
01:29:56,238 --> 01:30:00,559
um yeah there's a certain line it's a

2583
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,840
gray area where you cross where it's no

2584
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,880
longer

2585
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:07,679
in any possible world productive

2586
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:09,199
and that's a really weird gray area for

2587
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:10,319
youtube to operate in

2588
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:12,479
and it feels like should be a

2589
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:14,479
crowdsource thing

2590
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:16,479
where people vote on it but then again

2591
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:19,039
do you trust the majority to vote

2592
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:20,959
on what is crossing the line and not i

2593
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:23,519
mean this is where

2594
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,158
this is really interesting on this

2595
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,199
particular

2596
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:29,759
like the scientific aspect of this

2597
01:30:27,198 --> 01:30:30,960
do you think youtube should take more of

2598
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,560
a stance

2599
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:35,679
not censoring but to actually have

2600
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,840
scientists

2601
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:38,960
within youtube having these kinds of

2602
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,960
discussions

2603
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,079
and then be able to almost speak out in

2604
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,679
a transparent way

2605
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:46,238
this is what we're going to let this

2606
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:47,520
video stand but here's all these other

2607
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:50,000
opinions

2608
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:52,400
almost like take a more active role in

2609
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,719
uh its recommendation system

2610
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:57,039
in trying to present a full picture to

2611
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:59,679
you right now they're not and they're

2612
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,960
the recommender systems are not human

2613
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:03,119
fine-tuned

2614
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:05,439
they're all based on how you click and

2615
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:07,198
there's this clustering algorithms

2616
01:31:05,439 --> 01:31:09,839
they're not taking an active role on

2617
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:10,960
giving you the full spectrum of ideas in

2618
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:14,000
the space of science

2619
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:16,000
they just censor or not well

2620
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,198
at the moment it's going to be pretty

2621
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,279
hard to compel me

2622
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:21,439
that these people should be trusted with

2623
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:24,639
any sort of curation

2624
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:26,238
or comment on matters of evidence

2625
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:28,239
because they have demonstrated that they

2626
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:31,039
are incapable of doing it well

2627
01:31:28,238 --> 01:31:32,638
um you could make such an argument and i

2628
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:35,198
guess i'm open to the idea

2629
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:36,719
of institutions that would look

2630
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:39,039
something like youtube that would be

2631
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,960
capable of offering something valuable i

2632
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:42,560
mean and you know even just the fact of

2633
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,039
them literally curating things and

2634
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:48,080
putting some videos next to others

2635
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:49,519
you know implies something so

2636
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:51,600
yeah there's a question to be answered

2637
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,920
but at the moment no

2638
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,120
at the moment what it is doing is quite

2639
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:58,480
literally putting

2640
01:31:55,119 --> 01:31:59,519
not only individual humans in tremendous

2641
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:01,839
jeopardy by

2642
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:03,520
censoring discussion of useful tools and

2643
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:04,800
making tools that are

2644
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:07,040
more hazardous than has been

2645
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:10,000
acknowledged seems safe

2646
01:32:07,039 --> 01:32:11,439
right but it is also placing humanity in

2647
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,238
danger of a permanent

2648
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:15,359
relationship with this pathogen i cannot

2649
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:17,519
emphasize enough

2650
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:18,639
how expensive that is it's effectively

2651
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:20,400
incalculable

2652
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:22,639
if the relationship becomes permanent

2653
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:25,039
the number of people who will ultimately

2654
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:26,000
suffer and die from it is indefinitely

2655
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:28,079
large

2656
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,158
yeah there's uh currently the algorithm

2657
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:33,600
is very rabbit hole driven

2658
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:36,799
meaning if you uh if you click on the

2659
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,480
flat earth videos that's all you're

2660
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,400
going to be presented with

2661
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:41,919
and you're not going to be nicely

2662
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:42,799
presented with arguments against the

2663
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:46,158
flat earth

2664
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,159
and the flip side of that

2665
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:50,719
if you watch like quantum mechanics

2666
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:52,399
videos or no general relativity videos

2667
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:53,840
it's very rare you're going to get a

2668
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:54,879
recommendation have you considered the

2669
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:57,760
earth as flat

2670
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:59,039
and i think you should have both same

2671
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,880
with vaccine

2672
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:02,880
videos that present the power and the

2673
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:05,600
incredible

2674
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,639
like biology genetics biology about the

2675
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,840
vaccine

2676
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:13,039
you're rarely going to get videos

2677
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:15,600
from well-respected

2678
01:33:13,039 --> 01:33:17,279
scientific minds presenting possible

2679
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,039
dangers of the vaccine and the vice

2680
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:21,279
versa is true as well

2681
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:23,359
which is if you're looking at the danger

2682
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:25,119
of the vaccine on youtube

2683
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:27,198
you're not going to get the highest

2684
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:28,880
quality of videos recommended to you

2685
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:30,799
and i'm not talking about like manually

2686
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:33,440
inserted cdc videos

2687
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:35,440
that are like the most untrustworthy

2688
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:37,119
things you can possibly watch about how

2689
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:39,279
everybody should take the vaccine it's

2690
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:42,000
the safest thing ever no it's about

2691
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:44,399
incredible again mit colleagues of mine

2692
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,840
incredible biologists biologists that

2693
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:49,599
talk about the the details of how the

2694
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,679
mrna vaccines work and all those kinds

2695
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:54,719
of things i think

2696
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:57,039
maybe this is me with the ai hat

2697
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,079
on is i think the algorithm can fix a

2698
01:33:57,039 --> 01:33:59,840
lot of this

2699
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:02,079
and youtube should build better

2700
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:05,039
algorithms and trust that

2701
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:06,319
to and a couple of complete freedom of

2702
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:09,920
speech

2703
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:11,599
to expand the what people are

2704
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,960
able to think about present always

2705
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:15,039
varied views not

2706
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,158
balanced in some artificial way

2707
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:17,519
hard-coded way

2708
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:19,839
but balanced in a way that's

2709
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,520
crowdsourced i think that's an algorithm

2710
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,159
problem that could be solved

2711
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,360
because that then you can delegate it to

2712
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:28,479
the algorithm

2713
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:32,399
as opposed to this hard code

2714
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:34,559
censorship of basically

2715
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:36,079
creating artificial boundaries on what

2716
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:39,120
can and can't be discussed

2717
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:40,960
instead creating a full spectrum of

2718
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:42,479
exploration that can be done and

2719
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,679
trusting the intelligence of

2720
01:34:42,479 --> 01:34:48,000
people to do the exploration well

2721
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:50,079
there's a lot there i would say we have

2722
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:54,158
to keep in mind that we're talking

2723
01:34:50,079 --> 01:34:55,920
about a um a publicly held company with

2724
01:34:54,158 --> 01:34:57,759
shareholders and obligations to them and

2725
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:01,760
that that may make it impossible

2726
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:03,679
and i remember many years ago back in

2727
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:07,600
the early days of google

2728
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:11,679
i remember a sense of terror at the loss

2729
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:14,480
of general search right it used to be

2730
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:16,239
that that google if you searched came up

2731
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:16,959
with the same thing for everyone and

2732
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:19,198
then

2733
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,560
it got personalized and for a while it

2734
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:22,319
was possible to turn off the

2735
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,840
personalization which was still not

2736
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:25,519
great because if everybody else is

2737
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:27,119
looking at a personalized search

2738
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:29,600
and you can tune into one that isn't

2739
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:31,279
personalized what are you know

2740
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,880
that doesn't tell you why the world is

2741
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:34,238
sounding the way it is

2742
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,920
but nonetheless it was at least an

2743
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:38,000
option and then that vanished

2744
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:40,239
and the problem is i think this is

2745
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,880
literally deranging us

2746
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:44,319
that in effect i mean what you're

2747
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:47,359
describing is unthinkable

2748
01:35:44,319 --> 01:35:49,679
it is unthinkable that in the face of

2749
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:51,759
a campaign to vaccine vaccinate people

2750
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:55,679
in order to reach hurt immunity

2751
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:59,039
that um youtube would give you

2752
01:35:55,679 --> 01:36:01,279
videos on hazards of vaccines

2753
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:02,800
when this is you know how hazardous the

2754
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:05,840
vaccines are is an

2755
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:07,360
unsettled question why is it unthinkable

2756
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:09,520
that doesn't make any sense for well

2757
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:14,559
from a company perspective

2758
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:17,520
if intelligent people in large amounts

2759
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,159
are open-minded and are thinking through

2760
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,159
the

2761
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:21,439
the hazards and the benefits of a

2762
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:23,920
vaccine

2763
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:25,359
a company should should find the best

2764
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:28,239
videos

2765
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:28,639
to present what people are thinking

2766
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:30,638
about

2767
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:32,719
well let's come up with a hypothetical

2768
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:35,359
okay let's come up with a

2769
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:36,480
a very deadly disease for which there's

2770
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:38,719
a vaccine

2771
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:40,000
that is very safe though not perfectly

2772
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:42,960
safe

2773
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,479
and we are then faced with youtube

2774
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:47,198
trying to figure out what to do for

2775
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:49,439
somebody searching on vaccine safety

2776
01:36:47,198 --> 01:36:51,359
suppose it is necessary in order to

2777
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:53,039
drive the pathogen to extinction

2778
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:54,399
something like smallpox

2779
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:57,039
that people get on board with the

2780
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:57,039
vaccine

2781
01:36:57,198 --> 01:37:00,799
but there's a tiny fringe of people who

2782
01:36:59,359 --> 01:37:04,639
thinks that the vaccine

2783
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:08,159
is a mind control agent

2784
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:11,279
right so should youtube

2785
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:12,960
direct people to the only claims

2786
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:15,279
against this vaccine which is that it's

2787
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:18,399
a mind control agent

2788
01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:22,319
when in fact uh the

2789
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:24,479
vaccine is very safe whatever that means

2790
01:37:22,319 --> 01:37:25,519
if that were the actual configuration of

2791
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:28,000
the puzzle

2792
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,960
then youtube would be doing active harm

2793
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,039
pointing you

2794
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:35,039
to um this other video potentially

2795
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:36,319
now yes i would love to live in a world

2796
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:38,880
where people

2797
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:39,519
are up to the challenge of sorting that

2798
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,159
out but

2799
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:43,600
my basic point would be if it's an

2800
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:45,759
evidentiary question

2801
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:47,760
and there is essentially no evidence

2802
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,119
that the vaccine is a mind control

2803
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:51,520
agent and there's plenty of evidence

2804
01:37:49,118 --> 01:37:52,880
that the vaccine is safe then

2805
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,960
well you look for this video we're going

2806
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,960
to give you this one puts it on a par

2807
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,239
right so for the mind that's tracking

2808
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,639
how much

2809
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:02,799
uh thought is there behind it's safe

2810
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:05,279
versus how much thought is there behind

2811
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,400
it's a mind control agent will result in

2812
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:08,479
artificially

2813
01:38:06,399 --> 01:38:09,679
uh elevating this now in the current

2814
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:12,879
case what we've seen

2815
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:15,920
is not this at all we have seen evidence

2816
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:17,199
obscured in order to create a false

2817
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:20,560
story about

2818
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:23,599
safety and we saw the inverse with

2819
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:26,880
ivermectin we saw a campaign

2820
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:28,639
to portray the drug as

2821
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,880
more dangerous and less effective than

2822
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:33,600
the evidence clearly suggested it was

2823
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,960
so we're not talking about a comparable

2824
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:38,560
thing but i guess my point is the

2825
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:40,000
algorithmic solution that you point to

2826
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,000
creates a problem of its own which is

2827
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,639
that it means that the way to get

2828
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,719
exposure is to generate something fringy

2829
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:48,159
if you're the only thing on some fringe

2830
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:50,399
then suddenly youtube would be

2831
01:38:48,158 --> 01:38:52,638
recommending those things and that's

2832
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:53,118
that's obviously a gameable system at

2833
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:55,199
best

2834
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:56,960
yeah but the solution to that i know

2835
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:57,599
you're you're creating a thought

2836
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,198
experiment

2837
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:00,639
maybe playing a little bit of a devil's

2838
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:02,479
advocate

2839
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:04,400
i think the solution to that is not to

2840
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:05,839
uh limit the algorithm in the case of

2841
01:39:04,399 --> 01:39:08,319
the super deadly virus

2842
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:09,760
it's for the scientists to step up and

2843
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:10,880
become better communicators more

2844
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:14,000
charismatic

2845
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:16,560
is fight the battle of ideas

2846
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,279
so to create better videos you know the

2847
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:21,280
like if the virus is truly deadly

2848
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:23,439
you have a lot more ammunition a lot

2849
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:24,880
more data a lot more material to work

2850
01:39:23,439 --> 01:39:26,638
with in terms of communicating with the

2851
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:29,039
public

2852
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,920
so be better at communicating and stop

2853
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:32,639
being

2854
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,480
uh you have to start trusting the

2855
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:35,359
intelligence of people and also being

2856
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:37,039
transparent

2857
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:39,198
and playing the game of the internet

2858
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:40,800
which is like what is the internet

2859
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:43,839
hungry for i believe

2860
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,520
authenticity stop looking like you're

2861
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,840
full of [ __ ]

2862
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,119
it's the scientific community if there's

2863
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:51,039
any

2864
01:39:49,118 --> 01:39:52,960
flaw that i currently see especially the

2865
01:39:51,039 --> 01:39:54,960
people that are in public office

2866
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,079
that like anthony fauci they look like

2867
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,319
they're full of [ __ ]

2868
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:59,840
and i know they're brilliant why don't

2869
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:02,319
they look more authentic

2870
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:03,920
so they're losing that game and i think

2871
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:05,198
a lot of people observing this entire

2872
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:08,399
system now

2873
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:11,519
younger scientists are seeing this

2874
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:12,079
and saying okay if i want to continue

2875
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:14,239
being a

2876
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:16,000
scientist in the public eye and i want

2877
01:40:14,238 --> 01:40:17,279
to be effective in my job

2878
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,198
i'm going to have to be a lot more

2879
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:21,519
authentic so they're learning the lesson

2880
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:24,319
this evolutionary system is working

2881
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:25,840
uh so there's just a younger generation

2882
01:40:24,319 --> 01:40:27,039
of minds coming up that i think will do

2883
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:30,000
a much better job

2884
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:30,560
in this battle of ideas that when the

2885
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,719
when the

2886
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,760
much more dangerous virus comes along

2887
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:34,480
they'll be able to be better

2888
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:37,199
communicators

2889
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:39,198
at least that's the hope the the using

2890
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:42,079
the algorithm to control that

2891
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:43,519
is uh i feel like is a big problem so

2892
01:40:42,079 --> 01:40:45,039
you're going to have the same problem

2893
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:47,520
with a deadly virus

2894
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:48,238
as with the current virus if you let

2895
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:51,600
youtube

2896
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:52,718
draw hard lines by the pr and the

2897
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:56,000
marketing people

2898
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:58,719
versus the broad community of scientists

2899
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,840
well in some sense you're you're

2900
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:01,760
suggesting something that's

2901
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:03,039
close akin to what i was saying about

2902
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,679
you know

2903
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:07,679
freedom of expression ultimately uh

2904
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:10,239
provides an advantage to to better ideas

2905
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:12,319
so i'm in agreement broadly speaking

2906
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:13,519
um but i would also say there's probably

2907
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:15,519
some sort of you know

2908
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:17,280
let's imagine the world that you propose

2909
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,159
where youtube shows you the

2910
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:21,840
alternative point of view that has the

2911
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:23,920
problem that i suggest but

2912
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:25,760
one thing you could do is you could give

2913
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,960
us the tools to understand what we're

2914
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,960
looking at

2915
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,480
right you could give us so first of all

2916
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:34,158
there's something

2917
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:37,439
i think myopic solipsistic

2918
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:38,000
narcissistic about a an algorithm that

2919
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:40,238
serves

2920
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,840
shareholders by showing you what you

2921
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:42,399
want to see rather than what you need to

2922
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,079
know

2923
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:46,399
right that's the distinction is

2924
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:47,600
flattering you you know playing to your

2925
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:49,198
blind spot

2926
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:51,039
is something that algorithm will figure

2927
01:41:49,198 --> 01:41:51,839
out but it's not healthy for us all to

2928
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:53,600
have

2929
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,520
google playing to our blind spot it's

2930
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:58,880
very very dangerous so

2931
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:01,600
what i really want is analytics

2932
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:04,079
that allow me or maybe options and

2933
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,280
analytics the options should allow me to

2934
01:42:04,079 --> 01:42:07,840
see

2935
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:08,559
what alternative perspectives are being

2936
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,560
explored

2937
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:12,080
right so here's the thing i'm searching

2938
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,159
and it leads me down this road right

2939
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:15,359
let's let's say it's ivermectin okay

2940
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:16,879
i find all of this evidence that

2941
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:18,719
ivermectin works i find all of these

2942
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:20,560
discussions and people talk about

2943
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:22,800
various protocols and this and that and

2944
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:25,760
then i could say all right

2945
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,239
what is the other side and i could see

2946
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,360
who

2947
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:31,039
is searching not as individuals but what

2948
01:42:29,359 --> 01:42:33,198
demographics are searching

2949
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:35,198
alternatives and maybe you could even

2950
01:42:33,198 --> 01:42:37,759
combine it with something reddit like

2951
01:42:35,198 --> 01:42:40,319
where effectively let's say that there

2952
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:42,880
was a position that

2953
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:44,158
i don't know that that a vaccine is a

2954
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,639
mind control device

2955
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:47,839
and you could have a steel man this

2956
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:49,760
argument

2957
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,199
uh competition effectively and the

2958
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,320
better answers that steel man and as

2959
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:54,158
well as possible

2960
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:55,679
would rise to the top and so you could

2961
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:57,279
read the top three or four

2962
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:59,118
explanations about why this really

2963
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:02,238
credibly is a mind control

2964
01:42:59,118 --> 01:43:03,759
uh uh product and you can say well

2965
01:43:02,238 --> 01:43:05,359
that doesn't really add up i can check

2966
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,880
these three things myself and they can't

2967
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:08,559
possibly be right

2968
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,000
right and you could dismiss it and then

2969
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:12,719
as an argument that was credible

2970
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,960
let's say plate tectonics before that

2971
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:17,198
was an accepted concept

2972
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:18,319
you'd say wait a minute there is

2973
01:43:17,198 --> 01:43:20,479
evidence

2974
01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:22,079
for plate tectonic as crazy as it sounds

2975
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:23,359
that the continents are floating around

2976
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:25,760
on liquid

2977
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:27,839
actually that's not so implausible you

2978
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:30,400
know we've got these subduction zones

2979
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:32,000
we've got uh geology that is compatible

2980
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:33,118
we've got puzzle piece continents that

2981
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,118
seem to fit together

2982
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:36,639
wow that's a surprising amount of

2983
01:43:35,118 --> 01:43:37,198
evidence for that position so i'm going

2984
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:38,960
to

2985
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:40,399
file some bayesian probability with it

2986
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,840
that's updated for the fact that

2987
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:43,039
actually the steel man argument's better

2988
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,800
than i was expecting

2989
01:43:43,039 --> 01:43:46,079
right so i could imagine something like

2990
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,440
that where a

2991
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:49,198
i would love the search to be

2992
01:43:47,439 --> 01:43:50,879
indifferent to who's searching

2993
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:52,238
right the the solipsistic thing is too

2994
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:53,840
dangerous so

2995
01:43:52,238 --> 01:43:55,279
the search could be general so we would

2996
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,960
all get a sense for what everybody else

2997
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:58,719
was seeing too

2998
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,158
and then some layer that didn't have

2999
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:02,319
anything to do with what

3000
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:03,519
youtube points you to or not but allowed

3001
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:06,880
you to see

3002
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:10,719
you know the general pattern of

3003
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:13,440
uh adherence to searching for um

3004
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:14,880
information and again a layer in which

3005
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:16,319
those things could be defended so you

3006
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:16,639
could hear what a good argument sounded

3007
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:18,479
right

3008
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:21,199
like rather than just hear a caricatured

3009
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:24,079
argument yeah and also reward people

3010
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:26,238
creators that have demonstrated like a

3011
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:28,800
track record of open-mindedness

3012
01:44:26,238 --> 01:44:30,879
and correctness correctness as much as

3013
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:35,440
it could be measured over a long term

3014
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:38,520
and sort of uh i mean

3015
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:42,399
a lot of this maps to

3016
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:45,760
incentivizing good long-term behavior

3017
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:50,238
not immediate kind of dopamine rush

3018
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:53,440
uh kind of signals

3019
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:56,879
i think ultimately the algorithm

3020
01:44:53,439 --> 01:45:00,158
on the individual level should optimize

3021
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:03,199
for personal growth

3022
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:05,759
long-term happiness just

3023
01:45:03,198 --> 01:45:07,678
growth intellectually growth in terms of

3024
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:08,880
lifestyle personally and so on as

3025
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:11,359
opposed to

3026
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,800
immediate uh i think that's going to

3027
01:45:11,359 --> 01:45:14,000
build a better society not even just

3028
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,560
like truth because i think

3029
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:19,279
truth is a complicated thing it's more

3030
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:21,920
just you growing as a person

3031
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:23,198
exploring the space of ideas changing

3032
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,639
your mind often

3033
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:26,238
increasing the level to which you're

3034
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:27,920
open-minded the knowledge base you're

3035
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:31,279
operating from

3036
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:32,800
the willingness to empathize with others

3037
01:45:31,279 --> 01:45:34,000
all those kinds of things the algorithm

3038
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,600
should optimize for

3039
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,920
like creating a better human at the

3040
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:40,239
individual level that you're all

3041
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:42,000
i think that's a great business model

3042
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:45,359
because the person

3043
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,039
that's using this tool will then be

3044
01:45:45,359 --> 01:45:48,000
happier with themselves for having used

3045
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:50,719
it and will be

3046
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:53,279
a lifelong quote-unquote customer i

3047
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:55,920
think it's a great business model

3048
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:57,039
to make a happy open-minded

3049
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:58,960
knowledgeable

3050
01:45:57,039 --> 01:46:00,560
better human being it's a terrible

3051
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:03,198
business model

3052
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:04,800
under the current system what you want

3053
01:46:03,198 --> 01:46:06,238
is to build the system in which it is a

3054
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,679
great business model why is it a

3055
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:10,399
terrible model

3056
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:12,800
because it will be decimated by those

3057
01:46:10,399 --> 01:46:15,039
who play to the short term

3058
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:16,079
i don't think so why well i mean i think

3059
01:46:15,039 --> 01:46:18,399
we're living it

3060
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:20,000
we're living it well no because if if

3061
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:20,960
you have the alternative that presents

3062
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,439
itself

3063
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:24,560
it it it points out the emperor has no

3064
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:26,638
clothes i mean

3065
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:28,400
it points out that youtube is operating

3066
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:28,800
in this way twitter's operating in this

3067
01:46:28,399 --> 01:46:30,960
way

3068
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,480
so facebook is operating in this way how

3069
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:36,079
long term would you like

3070
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:38,879
the wisdom to to prove that

3071
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:40,000
well even though a week is better what's

3072
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,400
currently happening

3073
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,560
right but the problem is you know if a

3074
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:48,079
week loses out to an hour

3075
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:50,080
right and i don't think it loses out

3076
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:51,198
it loses out in the short term that's my

3077
01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:52,000
point at least you're a great

3078
01:46:51,198 --> 01:46:55,118
communicator

3079
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,840
and you basically say look here's the

3080
01:46:55,118 --> 01:46:57,599
metrics

3081
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:59,199
and a lot of it is like how people

3082
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,880
actually feel

3083
01:46:59,198 --> 01:47:02,399
like this this is what people experience

3084
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:04,319
with social media

3085
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:06,158
they look back at the previous month and

3086
01:47:04,319 --> 01:47:08,319
say

3087
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:09,679
i felt shitty and a lot of days because

3088
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:12,799
of social media right

3089
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:14,639
like if you look back at the previous

3090
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:17,119
few weeks and say

3091
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:18,400
wow i'm a better person because that

3092
01:47:17,118 --> 01:47:20,319
month happened

3093
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:22,079
that's they immediately choose the

3094
01:47:20,319 --> 01:47:24,479
product that's going to lead to that

3095
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:25,840
that's what love for products looks like

3096
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:27,439
if you if you love

3097
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:29,360
like a lot of people love their tesla

3098
01:47:27,439 --> 01:47:31,839
car like that's

3099
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:33,359
or iphone or like beautiful design

3100
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,079
that's what love looks like you look

3101
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:36,158
back

3102
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:37,600
i'm a better person for having used this

3103
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:39,198
thing well you got to ask yourself the

3104
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,239
question though if this is such a great

3105
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:43,039
business model

3106
01:47:40,238 --> 01:47:44,479
why isn't it devolving why don't we see

3107
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:46,560
it

3108
01:47:44,479 --> 01:47:47,678
honestly it's competence it's like

3109
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:51,199
people are just it's not

3110
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:54,639
it's not easy to build new it's not

3111
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:58,719
easy to build products tools

3112
01:47:54,639 --> 01:48:00,639
systems on new ideas it's kind of a new

3113
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:03,359
idea we've gone through this

3114
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:03,679
everything we're seeing now comes from

3115
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:05,359
the

3116
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,600
ideas of the initial birth of the

3117
01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:08,960
internet this just needs to be new sets

3118
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:12,000
of tools that are

3119
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:13,359
uh incentivizing long term personal

3120
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
growth and happiness

3121
01:48:13,359 --> 01:48:18,238
that's it right but but what we have is

3122
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,279
a market that doesn't favor this right i

3123
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:22,238
mean for one thing

3124
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:23,599
you know we had an alternative to

3125
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:25,198
facebook

3126
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:27,840
right that looked you know you owned

3127
01:48:25,198 --> 01:48:30,559
your own data it wasn't exploitative

3128
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:30,960
and facebook bought a huge interest in

3129
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:33,440
it

3130
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,880
and it died i mean who do you know who's

3131
01:48:33,439 --> 01:48:37,519
on diaspora

3132
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:39,359
the execution there was not good right

3133
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:42,400
but it could have gotten better

3134
01:48:39,359 --> 01:48:42,799
right i don't think that the argument

3135
01:48:42,399 --> 01:48:44,960
that

3136
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,000
why hasn't somebody done it a good

3137
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:48,319
argument for it's

3138
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,079
not going to completely destroy all of

3139
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:50,960
twitter and facebook when somebody does

3140
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:53,679
it

3141
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:54,719
or twitter will catch up and pivot to to

3142
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:55,920
the algorithm

3143
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:57,840
this is not what this is not what i'm

3144
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:59,039
saying there's obviously great ideas

3145
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,119
that remain

3146
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:02,319
unexplored because nobody has gotten to

3147
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:03,039
the foothill that would allow you to

3148
01:49:02,319 --> 01:49:05,359
explore them

3149
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:06,880
that's true but you know an internet

3150
01:49:05,359 --> 01:49:09,679
that was non-predatory

3151
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,800
is an obvious idea and many of us know

3152
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:13,118
that we want it

3153
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,880
and many of us have seen prototypes of

3154
01:49:13,118 --> 01:49:16,639
it and we don't move because there's no

3155
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:18,400
audience there so the network effects

3156
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:19,440
cause you to stay with the predatory

3157
01:49:18,399 --> 01:49:23,279
internet

3158
01:49:19,439 --> 01:49:25,039
um but let me just i wasn't kidding

3159
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:28,319
about build the system in which

3160
01:49:25,039 --> 01:49:31,599
your idea is a great business plan

3161
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:33,359
um so in our upcoming book heather and i

3162
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:35,119
in our last chapter explore something

3163
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:36,639
called the fourth frontier and fourth

3164
01:49:35,118 --> 01:49:39,039
frontier has to do with

3165
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:40,400
sort of a 2.0 version of civilization

3166
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:42,479
which we freely admit

3167
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:43,839
we can't tell you very much about it's

3168
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:45,519
something that would have to be

3169
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:47,039
we would have to prototype our way there

3170
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:48,080
we would have to effectively navigate

3171
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:49,840
our way there

3172
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:51,439
but the result would be very much like

3173
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,239
what you're describing it would be

3174
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:54,839
something

3175
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:56,079
that effectively liberates humans

3176
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:59,279
meaningfully

3177
01:49:56,079 --> 01:50:02,000
and most importantly it has to feel

3178
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:02,800
like growth without depending on growth

3179
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,359
in other words

3180
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:07,039
human beings are creatures that like

3181
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:09,519
every other creature

3182
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:10,639
is effectively looking for growth right

3183
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:12,320
we are looking for

3184
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:14,800
underexploited or unexploited

3185
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:16,479
opportunities and when we find them

3186
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,560
our ancestors for example if they

3187
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:19,598
happened into a new valley that was

3188
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:22,080
unexplored by

3189
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:23,520
people their population would grow until

3190
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:24,000
it had carrying capacity so there would

3191
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:26,000
be this great

3192
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,279
feeling of there's abundance until you

3193
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,198
hit carrying capacity which is

3194
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:30,399
inevitable and then zero-sum dynamics

3195
01:50:29,198 --> 01:50:32,879
would set in

3196
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:33,839
so in order for human beings to flourish

3197
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:36,719
long-term

3198
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:38,800
the way to get there is to satisfy the

3199
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,239
desire for growth without hooking it to

3200
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,960
actual growth which

3201
01:50:40,238 --> 01:50:45,198
only moves in fits and starts and this

3202
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:48,000
is actually i believe the key

3203
01:50:45,198 --> 01:50:49,839
to avoiding these you know spasms of

3204
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,560
human tragedy when in the absence of

3205
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:53,360
growth

3206
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:55,360
people do something that causes their

3207
01:50:53,359 --> 01:50:56,719
population to experience growth which is

3208
01:50:55,359 --> 01:50:58,880
they go and

3209
01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:00,399
make war on or commit genocide against

3210
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:01,520
some other population which is something

3211
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:04,719
we obviously have to

3212
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:06,159
stop by the way this is uh

3213
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:08,239
a hunter hunter-gatherer's guide to the

3214
01:51:06,158 --> 01:51:09,759
21st century co-authored

3215
01:51:08,238 --> 01:51:11,359
that's right with your wife heather

3216
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:13,599
being released to september i

3217
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:15,519
believe you said you're going to do a

3218
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:17,199
little bit of a preview videos on each

3219
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:19,040
chapter leading up to the release

3220
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:20,559
so i'm looking forward to the last

3221
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:22,800
chapter

3222
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:24,480
as well as well as all the the previous

3223
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:27,279
one i have a few questions on that

3224
01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:28,638
so you you have um you generally have

3225
01:51:27,279 --> 01:51:30,800
faith

3226
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:31,840
to clarify that technology could be the

3227
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:36,239
thing

3228
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:40,400
that empowers this kind of future

3229
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:43,678
well if you just let technology evolve

3230
01:51:40,399 --> 01:51:46,238
it's going to be our undoing right

3231
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:47,520
one of the things that i um fault my

3232
01:51:46,238 --> 01:51:49,839
libertarian friends

3233
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,639
for is this faith that the market is

3234
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,800
going to find

3235
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:53,679
solutions without destroying us and my

3236
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,840
sense is

3237
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:57,599
i'm a very strong believer in markets

3238
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:00,159
right i believe in their power

3239
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:01,760
even above some market fundamentalists

3240
01:52:00,158 --> 01:52:04,638
but what i don't believe

3241
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:06,000
is that they should be allowed to plot

3242
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:08,159
our course

3243
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,840
right markets are very good at figuring

3244
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:11,920
out how to do things

3245
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:13,279
they are not good at all about figuring

3246
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:15,359
out what we should do

3247
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:16,960
right what we should want we have to

3248
01:52:15,359 --> 01:52:17,598
tell markets what we want and then they

3249
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:20,800
can tell us

3250
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:22,079
how to do it best and if we adopted that

3251
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:24,800
kind of

3252
01:52:22,079 --> 01:52:27,039
pro market but in a context where it's

3253
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:28,800
not steering where human well-being is

3254
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:31,039
actually the driver

3255
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:32,960
we can do remarkable things and the

3256
01:52:31,039 --> 01:52:33,279
technology that emerges would naturally

3257
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:35,920
be

3258
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:36,399
enhancing of human well-being perfectly

3259
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:39,039
so

3260
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:39,759
no but overwhelmingly so but at the

3261
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:42,000
moment

3262
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:44,079
markets are finding our every defect of

3263
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,840
character and exploiting them and making

3264
01:52:44,079 --> 01:52:49,840
huge profits and making us

3265
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:53,760
worse to each other in the process

3266
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:57,679
before we leave covet 19 let me

3267
01:52:53,760 --> 01:53:01,360
ask you about a very difficult topic

3268
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:02,319
which is the vaccines so i took the fisa

3269
01:53:01,359 --> 01:53:07,118
vaccine

3270
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:10,840
the two shots you did not

3271
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:15,039
you have been taking ivermectin

3272
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:17,679
yep so one of the arguments

3273
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:19,359
against the discussion of ivermectin is

3274
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:22,480
that

3275
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:25,039
it prevents people from being

3276
01:53:22,479 --> 01:53:26,000
fully willing to get the vaccine how

3277
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:29,439
would you compare

3278
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:32,319
ivermectin and the vaccine

3279
01:53:29,439 --> 01:53:33,198
for coven 19. all right that's a good

3280
01:53:32,319 --> 01:53:35,039
question

3281
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:37,359
i would say first of all there are some

3282
01:53:35,039 --> 01:53:38,800
hazards with the vaccine that people

3283
01:53:37,359 --> 01:53:40,399
need to be aware of there are some

3284
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:43,360
things that we cannot

3285
01:53:40,399 --> 01:53:44,319
rule out and for which there is some

3286
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:45,519
evidence

3287
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:48,000
the two that i think people should be

3288
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:50,639
tracking is the

3289
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,520
possibility some would say a likelihood

3290
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:56,560
that a vaccine of this nature

3291
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:59,760
that is to say very narrowly focused on

3292
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:02,639
a single antigen is

3293
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:03,280
a an evolutionary pressure that will

3294
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:05,359
drive

3295
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:07,118
the emergence of variants that will

3296
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:08,719
escape the protection that comes from

3297
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:12,479
the vaccine

3298
01:54:08,719 --> 01:54:14,319
so this is a hazard it is a particular

3299
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:15,198
hazard in light of the fact that these

3300
01:54:14,319 --> 01:54:16,880
vaccines

3301
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:18,799
have a substantial number of

3302
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:21,118
breakthrough cases

3303
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:22,400
so one danger is that a person who has

3304
01:54:21,118 --> 01:54:26,639
been vaccinated

3305
01:54:22,399 --> 01:54:28,799
will shed viruses that are specifically

3306
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:31,760
less visible or invisible to the

3307
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:34,239
immunity created by the vaccines

3308
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:34,880
so we may be creating the next pandemic

3309
01:54:34,238 --> 01:54:37,598
by

3310
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:40,560
applying the pressure of vaccines at a

3311
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:41,920
point that it doesn't make sense to

3312
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,599
the other danger has to do with

3313
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:45,118
something called antibody dependent

3314
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:46,319
enhancement

3315
01:54:45,118 --> 01:54:48,639
which is something that we see in

3316
01:54:46,319 --> 01:54:51,599
certain diseases like dengue fever

3317
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:53,440
you may know that dengue one gets a case

3318
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:55,760
and then their second case is much more

3319
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:57,279
devastating so break bone fever

3320
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:59,920
is when you get your second case of

3321
01:54:57,279 --> 01:55:01,920
dengue and dengue effectively

3322
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:04,560
utilizes the immune response that is

3323
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:06,319
produced by prior exposure

3324
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:08,719
to attack the body in ways that it is

3325
01:55:06,319 --> 01:55:10,880
incapable of doing before exposure

3326
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:12,000
so this is apparently this pattern has

3327
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:15,199
apparently blocked

3328
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:17,840
past efforts to make vaccines

3329
01:55:15,198 --> 01:55:19,118
against coronaviruses whether it will

3330
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:20,800
happen here or not

3331
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:22,719
it is still too early to say but before

3332
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:25,920
we even get to the question

3333
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:28,000
of harm done to individuals by

3334
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:29,679
these vaccines we have to ask about what

3335
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,399
the overall impact is going to be and

3336
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:32,319
it's not

3337
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:33,839
clear in the way people think it is that

3338
01:55:32,319 --> 01:55:35,359
if we vaccinate enough people the

3339
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:37,039
pandemic will end

3340
01:55:35,359 --> 01:55:38,639
it could be that we vaccinate people and

3341
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:40,639
make the pandemic worse

3342
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:41,920
and while nobody can say for sure that

3343
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:43,840
that's where we're headed

3344
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:46,239
it is at least something to be aware of

3345
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:47,360
so don't vaccines usually create that

3346
01:55:46,238 --> 01:55:50,319
kind of

3347
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:51,279
evolutionary pressure to create more

3348
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:55,039
deadlier

3349
01:55:51,279 --> 01:55:57,118
different strains of the virus so isn't

3350
01:55:55,039 --> 01:55:59,760
so is there something particular with

3351
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:01,198
these mrna vaccines that's uniquely

3352
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:02,719
dangerous in this regard

3353
01:56:01,198 --> 01:56:04,879
well it's not even just the mrna

3354
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:05,840
vaccines the mrna vaccines and the

3355
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,239
adenovector

3356
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:10,239
dna vaccine all share the same

3357
01:56:08,238 --> 01:56:12,559
vulnerability which is they are very

3358
01:56:10,238 --> 01:56:14,158
narrowly focused on one subunit of the

3359
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:16,080
spike protein

3360
01:56:14,158 --> 01:56:18,079
so that is a very concentrated

3361
01:56:16,079 --> 01:56:20,800
evolutionary signal

3362
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:22,559
we are also deploying it in mid pandemic

3363
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:23,440
and it takes time for immunity to

3364
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:26,320
develop

3365
01:56:23,439 --> 01:56:28,238
so part of the problem here if you if

3366
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:31,359
you inoculated a population

3367
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:32,158
before encounter with a pathogen then

3368
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:35,359
there might be

3369
01:56:32,158 --> 01:56:37,439
substantially enough immunity to prevent

3370
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:38,880
this phenomenon from happening but in

3371
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:40,799
this case

3372
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:43,039
we are inoculating people as they are

3373
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,920
encountering those who are sick with the

3374
01:56:43,039 --> 01:56:46,158
disease

3375
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:48,800
and what that means is the disease is

3376
01:56:46,158 --> 01:56:50,799
now faced with a lot of opportunities to

3377
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:52,400
effectively evolutionarily practice

3378
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:54,880
escape strategies

3379
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:56,638
so one thing is the timing the other

3380
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:58,560
thing is the narrow focus

3381
01:56:56,639 --> 01:57:00,000
now in a traditional vaccine you would

3382
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:02,639
typically not have one

3383
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,319
antigen right you would have basically a

3384
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:06,000
virus full of antigens

3385
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:08,079
and the immune system would therefore

3386
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,479
produce a broader response

3387
01:57:08,079 --> 01:57:11,519
so that is the case for people who have

3388
01:57:10,479 --> 01:57:12,879
had covet

3389
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:14,880
right they have an immunity that is

3390
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:16,960
broader because it wasn't so focused on

3391
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:19,039
one part of the spike protein

3392
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:20,480
so anyway there is something unique here

3393
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:22,238
so these platforms

3394
01:57:20,479 --> 01:57:24,319
create that special hazard they also

3395
01:57:22,238 --> 01:57:26,638
have components that we haven't

3396
01:57:24,319 --> 01:57:28,079
used before in people so for example the

3397
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:31,279
lipid nanoparticles

3398
01:57:28,079 --> 01:57:33,439
that coat the rnas are

3399
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:34,719
distributing themselves around the body

3400
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:38,079
in a way that will have

3401
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:39,039
unknown consequences so anyway there's

3402
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:41,599
there's reason

3403
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:43,599
reason for concern is it possible for

3404
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:46,239
you to steal man

3405
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:47,920
the argument that everybody should get

3406
01:57:46,238 --> 01:57:49,839
vaccinated

3407
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:51,359
of course the argument that everybody

3408
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:54,639
should get vaccinated

3409
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:58,319
is that nothing is perfectly safe

3410
01:57:54,639 --> 01:58:00,400
phase 3 trials showed good safety

3411
01:57:58,319 --> 01:58:01,840
for the vaccines now that may or may not

3412
01:58:00,399 --> 01:58:05,039
be actually true

3413
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:06,400
but what we saw suggested high degree of

3414
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:09,599
efficacy and

3415
01:58:06,399 --> 01:58:11,839
a high degree of safety for the vaccines

3416
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:13,119
that inoculating people quickly and

3417
01:58:11,840 --> 01:58:15,119
therefore

3418
01:58:13,118 --> 01:58:17,839
dropping the landscape of available

3419
01:58:15,118 --> 01:58:19,839
victims for the pathogen

3420
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:22,000
to a very low number so that herd

3421
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:24,000
immunity drives it to extinction

3422
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,439
requires us all to take our share of the

3423
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,719
risk

3424
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:30,479
and that that

3425
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:32,399
because driving it to extinction should

3426
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:35,439
be our highest priority that really

3427
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:36,879
people shouldn't think uh too much about

3428
01:58:35,439 --> 01:58:38,319
the various nuances because

3429
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:40,960
overwhelmingly

3430
01:58:38,319 --> 01:58:42,158
fewer people will die if the population

3431
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:43,760
is vaccinated

3432
01:58:42,158 --> 01:58:45,279
from the vaccine then will die from

3433
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:47,039
covet if they're not vaccinated

3434
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:48,880
and with the vaccine as the current as

3435
01:58:47,039 --> 01:58:52,800
being deployed that is a

3436
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:55,920
quite a likely scenario that

3437
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:58,719
the everything you know

3438
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,679
the virus will fade away in in the

3439
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:02,000
following sense

3440
01:58:59,679 --> 01:59:04,480
that the the probability that a more

3441
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:08,479
dangerous strain will be created

3442
01:59:04,479 --> 01:59:10,959
is non-zero but it's not 50

3443
01:59:08,479 --> 01:59:12,158
it's something smaller and so the most

3444
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,599
likely well i don't know maybe you

3445
01:59:12,158 --> 01:59:15,359
disagree with that but the

3446
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:17,279
the scenario we're most likely to see

3447
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:19,920
not that the vaccine is here

3448
01:59:17,279 --> 01:59:21,519
is that the via the effects of the virus

3449
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,719
will fade away

3450
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:25,119
first of all i don't believe that the

3451
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:27,840
probability of creating a worse pandemic

3452
01:59:25,118 --> 01:59:29,359
is low enough to discount i think the

3453
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:31,840
probability is fairly high

3454
01:59:29,359 --> 01:59:32,880
and frankly we are seeing a wave of

3455
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:36,560
variance

3456
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:38,480
that um we will have to do a careful

3457
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:40,639
analysis to figure out what exactly that

3458
01:59:38,479 --> 01:59:42,000
has to do with campaigns of vaccination

3459
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:44,000
where they have been where they haven't

3460
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,599
been where the variance emerged from but

3461
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,960
i believe that what we are seeing is a

3462
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:49,599
disturbing pattern

3463
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:51,439
that reflects that those who were

3464
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:53,279
advising caution may well have been

3465
01:59:51,439 --> 01:59:56,079
right the data here by the way

3466
01:59:53,279 --> 01:59:57,118
a small tangent is terrible terrible

3467
01:59:56,079 --> 01:59:59,039
right and

3468
01:59:57,118 --> 02:00:00,639
why is it terrible is another question

3469
01:59:59,039 --> 02:00:01,198
right this is where i started getting

3470
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:03,520
angry

3471
02:00:01,198 --> 02:00:06,399
yeah it's like there's a obvious

3472
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:08,000
opportunity for exceptionally good data

3473
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:10,559
for exceptionally rigorous like even the

3474
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,719
self like the website for self reporting

3475
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:14,320
side effects for not side effects but

3476
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:18,480
negative effects adverse events

3477
02:00:14,319 --> 02:00:20,479
at first event sorry for the vaccine

3478
02:00:18,479 --> 02:00:22,479
like there's many things i could say

3479
02:00:20,479 --> 02:00:26,000
from both the study perspective but

3480
02:00:22,479 --> 02:00:29,759
mostly let me just put on my hat of like

3481
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:32,719
html and like web design

3482
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:34,639
like it's like the worst website it

3483
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:36,079
makes it so unpleasant to report

3484
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:38,079
it makes it so unclear what you're

3485
02:00:36,079 --> 02:00:39,840
reporting if somebody actually has

3486
02:00:38,079 --> 02:00:41,359
serious effect like if you have very

3487
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,360
mild effects what are the

3488
02:00:41,359 --> 02:00:45,039
incentives for you to even use that

3489
02:00:43,359 --> 02:00:47,039
crappy website with

3490
02:00:45,039 --> 02:00:49,118
many pages and forms that don't make any

3491
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:51,439
sense if you have adverse effects

3492
02:00:49,118 --> 02:00:53,118
what are the incentives for you to use

3493
02:00:51,439 --> 02:00:55,039
that website

3494
02:00:53,118 --> 02:00:56,880
what is the trust that you have that

3495
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:59,039
this information will be used well

3496
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:01,039
all those kinds of things and the data

3497
02:00:59,039 --> 02:01:03,439
about who's getting vaccinated

3498
02:01:01,039 --> 02:01:04,560
anonymized data about who's getting

3499
02:01:03,439 --> 02:01:07,359
vaccinated where

3500
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:08,960
when what that with what vaccine coupled

3501
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:10,880
with the adverse effects

3502
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:13,198
all of that we should be collecting

3503
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:15,599
instead we're completely not

3504
02:01:13,198 --> 02:01:17,839
we're doing it in a crappy way and using

3505
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:20,159
that crappy data to make conclusions

3506
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:23,520
that you then twist you're basically

3507
02:01:20,158 --> 02:01:25,519
collecting in a way that can

3508
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:27,520
arrive at whatever conclusions you want

3509
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:30,480
and the data is being collected by

3510
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:31,360
uh the institutions by governments and

3511
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:33,118
so therefore

3512
02:01:31,359 --> 02:01:35,118
it's obviously they're going to try to

3513
02:01:33,118 --> 02:01:36,880
construct any kind of narratives they

3514
02:01:35,118 --> 02:01:39,198
want based on this crappy data reminds

3515
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,679
me of much of psychology the field that

3516
02:01:39,198 --> 02:01:42,479
i love

3517
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:43,599
but is flawed in many fundamental ways

3518
02:01:42,479 --> 02:01:46,638
so rant

3519
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:47,840
over but uh coupled with the dangers

3520
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:49,118
that you're speaking to we don't have

3521
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:52,560
even the data

3522
02:01:49,118 --> 02:01:54,799
to um to understand the dangers yeah

3523
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:55,599
uh i'm going to pick up on your rant and

3524
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,119
say

3525
02:01:55,599 --> 02:02:00,000
we estimates of the degree of under

3526
02:01:59,118 --> 02:02:03,198
reporting in

3527
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:05,920
vares are uh that it is

3528
02:02:03,198 --> 02:02:07,039
ten percent of the real to a hundred

3529
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:08,960
percent and that's the one

3530
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:10,719
for reporting yeah the fair system is

3531
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:11,760
the is the system for reporting adverse

3532
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:14,960
events so

3533
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:18,960
um in the u.s we have above

3534
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:20,480
5 000 unexpected deaths that seem

3535
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:23,359
in time to be associated with

3536
02:02:20,479 --> 02:02:26,399
vaccination that is an undercount

3537
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:27,839
almost certainly and by uh a large

3538
02:02:26,399 --> 02:02:29,359
factor

3539
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:31,279
we don't know how large i've seen

3540
02:02:29,359 --> 02:02:34,639
estimates 25

3541
02:02:31,279 --> 02:02:37,759
000 dead in the u.s alone um

3542
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:39,359
now you can make the argument that okay

3543
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:42,159
that's a large number

3544
02:02:39,359 --> 02:02:43,279
but the necessity of immunizing the

3545
02:02:42,158 --> 02:02:46,559
population to drive

3546
02:02:43,279 --> 02:02:48,238
sars kovi 2 to extinction is such that

3547
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:50,000
it's an acceptable number but i would

3548
02:02:48,238 --> 02:02:51,759
point out that that actually does not

3549
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,639
make any sense and the reason it doesn't

3550
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:55,280
make any sense

3551
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:57,118
is actually there's several reasons one

3552
02:02:55,279 --> 02:02:59,118
if that was really your point

3553
02:02:57,118 --> 02:03:01,359
that yes many many people are going to

3554
02:02:59,118 --> 02:03:03,279
die but many more will die if we don't

3555
02:03:01,359 --> 02:03:06,000
do this

3556
02:03:03,279 --> 02:03:07,840
were that your approach you would not be

3557
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:10,479
inoculating people who had had

3558
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:12,319
covet 19 which is a large population

3559
02:03:10,479 --> 02:03:14,399
there is no reason to expose those

3560
02:03:12,319 --> 02:03:16,238
people to danger their risk of adverse

3561
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:19,198
events in the case that they

3562
02:03:16,238 --> 02:03:20,879
have them is greater so there's no

3563
02:03:19,198 --> 02:03:22,559
reason that we would be allowing those

3564
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:25,039
people to face a risk of death if this

3565
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:27,679
was really about an acceptable number

3566
02:03:25,039 --> 02:03:29,039
of deaths arising out of this uh the set

3567
02:03:27,679 --> 02:03:31,118
of vaccines

3568
02:03:29,039 --> 02:03:33,760
i would also point out there's something

3569
02:03:31,118 --> 02:03:36,238
incredibly bizarre and i would

3570
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:37,920
i struggle to find language that is

3571
02:03:36,238 --> 02:03:41,359
strong enough

3572
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:44,800
for the horror of vaccinating

3573
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:47,519
children in this case because children

3574
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:48,159
suffer a greater risk of long-term

3575
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,760
effects

3576
02:03:48,158 --> 02:03:51,279
because they are going to live longer

3577
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:53,360
and because this is earlier in their

3578
02:03:51,279 --> 02:03:54,479
development therefore it impacts systems

3579
02:03:53,359 --> 02:03:57,759
that are still

3580
02:03:54,479 --> 02:04:01,359
forming they tolerate covid well

3581
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:04,000
and so the benefit to them is very small

3582
02:04:01,359 --> 02:04:05,759
and so the only argument for doing this

3583
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,439
is that they may cryptically be carrying

3584
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:09,679
more covert than we think

3585
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:10,879
and therefore they may be integral to

3586
02:04:09,679 --> 02:04:11,760
the way the virus spreads to the

3587
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:13,199
population

3588
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:14,800
but if that's the reason that we are

3589
02:04:13,198 --> 02:04:16,399
inoculating children and there has been

3590
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:18,079
some revision in the last day or two

3591
02:04:16,399 --> 02:04:18,559
about the recommendation on this because

3592
02:04:18,078 --> 02:04:20,479
of the

3593
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,400
adverse events that have shown up in

3594
02:04:20,479 --> 02:04:24,078
children but to the extent that we were

3595
02:04:22,399 --> 02:04:27,759
vaccinating children

3596
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:29,759
we were doing it to protect old infirm

3597
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:34,079
people who are the most likely

3598
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:37,119
to succumb to covet 19. what society

3599
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:40,479
puts children in danger

3600
02:04:37,118 --> 02:04:43,118
robs children of life to save old infirm

3601
02:04:40,479 --> 02:04:45,198
people that's upside down

3602
02:04:43,118 --> 02:04:46,799
so there's something about the way we

3603
02:04:45,198 --> 02:04:49,519
are going about

3604
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:52,159
vaccinating who we are vaccinating what

3605
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:55,679
dangers we are pretending don't exist

3606
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:57,759
that suggests that to some set of people

3607
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:59,840
vaccinating people is a good in and of

3608
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:01,679
itself that that is the objective of the

3609
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:03,920
exercise not hurt immunity and

3610
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:05,440
the last thing i'm sorry i don't want to

3611
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:07,199
prevent you from jumping in here

3612
02:05:05,439 --> 02:05:08,559
but the second reason in addition to the

3613
02:05:07,198 --> 02:05:09,118
fact that we're exposing people to

3614
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:11,760
danger

3615
02:05:09,118 --> 02:05:13,598
that we should not be exposing them to

3616
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:16,400
by the way as a tiny tangent

3617
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:17,840
another huge part of the soup that

3618
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:19,198
should have been part of it that's an

3619
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:22,639
incredible solution

3620
02:05:19,198 --> 02:05:25,678
is large-scale testing but that

3621
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:27,760
that might be another couple-hour but

3622
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:29,199
conversation but there's these solutions

3623
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:30,560
that are obvious that were available

3624
02:05:29,198 --> 02:05:33,198
from the very beginning

3625
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:34,560
so you could argue that ivaractin is not

3626
02:05:33,198 --> 02:05:38,000
that obvious

3627
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:41,280
but maybe the whole point is you have

3628
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
aggressive very fast research that leads

3629
02:05:41,279 --> 02:05:43,840
to

3630
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,000
meta-analysis and then large-scale

3631
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:49,440
production and deployment

3632
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:52,000
okay at least that possibility should be

3633
02:05:49,439 --> 02:05:53,439
uh seriously considered coupled with a

3634
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:55,840
serious consideration

3635
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:56,799
of large-scale deployment of testing at

3636
02:05:55,840 --> 02:06:00,078
home testing

3637
02:05:56,800 --> 02:06:03,840
that could have uh accelerated

3638
02:06:00,078 --> 02:06:06,880
the the speed at which we reach that

3639
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:08,880
um hurt immunity

3640
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:10,400
but i don't even want to well let me

3641
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:12,719
just say i am also

3642
02:06:10,399 --> 02:06:15,839
completely shocked that we did not get

3643
02:06:12,719 --> 02:06:17,760
on high quality testing early and that

3644
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:19,520
we are still suffering

3645
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:21,599
from this even now because just the

3646
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:23,599
simple ability to track

3647
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:25,039
where the virus moves between people

3648
02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:26,000
would tell us a lot about its mode of

3649
02:06:25,039 --> 02:06:28,078
transmission

3650
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,920
which would allow us to protect

3651
02:06:28,078 --> 02:06:30,719
ourselves better instead that

3652
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:33,440
information

3653
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:34,399
was hard won and for no good reason so i

3654
02:06:33,439 --> 02:06:38,319
i also find this

3655
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:40,719
mysterious you've spoken with eric

3656
02:06:38,319 --> 02:06:41,439
weinstein your brother on his podcast

3657
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:44,560
the portal

3658
02:06:41,439 --> 02:06:45,839
about the ideas that eventually led to

3659
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:50,239
the paper you published

3660
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:50,239
titled the reserved capacity hypothesis

3661
02:06:50,399 --> 02:06:58,399
i think first can you

3662
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:59,840
explain this paper and the ideas that

3663
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:03,039
led up to it

3664
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:04,400
sure easier to explain the conclusion of

3665
02:07:03,039 --> 02:07:07,279
the paper

3666
02:07:04,399 --> 02:07:08,479
um there's a question about why a

3667
02:07:07,279 --> 02:07:11,039
creature

3668
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:12,718
that can replace its cells with new

3669
02:07:11,039 --> 02:07:15,279
cells grows

3670
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:16,880
feeble and inefficient with age we call

3671
02:07:15,279 --> 02:07:18,880
that process which

3672
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:20,880
is otherwise called aging we call it

3673
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:24,400
senescence

3674
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:27,760
and senescence in this paper

3675
02:07:24,399 --> 02:07:29,198
it is hypothesized is the unavoidable

3676
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:32,880
downside

3677
02:07:29,198 --> 02:07:36,158
of a cancer prevention

3678
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:39,279
feature of our bodies

3679
02:07:36,158 --> 02:07:40,638
that each cell has a limit on the number

3680
02:07:39,279 --> 02:07:42,158
of times it can divide

3681
02:07:40,639 --> 02:07:44,239
there are a few cells in the body that

3682
02:07:42,158 --> 02:07:45,679
are exceptional but most of our cells

3683
02:07:44,238 --> 02:07:47,839
can only divide a limited number of

3684
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:51,679
times that's called the hayflick limit

3685
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:55,119
and the hayflick limit uh reduces the

3686
02:07:51,679 --> 02:07:56,719
ability of the organism to replace

3687
02:07:55,118 --> 02:07:59,279
tissues it therefore

3688
02:07:56,719 --> 02:08:00,239
results in a failure over time of

3689
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:03,279
maintenance and

3690
02:08:00,238 --> 02:08:06,078
repair and that explains why we we

3691
02:08:03,279 --> 02:08:09,359
become decrepit as we grow old

3692
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:12,000
the question was why would that be

3693
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:12,799
especially in light of the fact that the

3694
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,039
mechanism

3695
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:16,560
that seems to limit the ability of cells

3696
02:08:15,039 --> 02:08:19,279
to reproduce

3697
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:20,000
is something called a telomere telomere

3698
02:08:19,279 --> 02:08:22,319
is a

3699
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:24,719
it's a not a gene but it's a dna

3700
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:26,559
sequence at the ends of our chromosomes

3701
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:28,158
that is just simply repetitive and the

3702
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:30,560
number of repeats

3703
02:08:28,158 --> 02:08:32,399
functions like a counter so there's a

3704
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:34,400
number of repeats that you have

3705
02:08:32,399 --> 02:08:35,920
uh after development is finished and

3706
02:08:34,399 --> 02:08:37,519
then each time the cell divides a little

3707
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:38,719
bit of telomere is lost

3708
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:40,880
and at the point that the telomere

3709
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:42,719
becomes critically short the cell

3710
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:44,560
stops dividing even though it still has

3711
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:45,840
the capacity to do so

3712
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:47,760
stops dividing and it starts

3713
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:48,719
transcribing different genes than it did

3714
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:52,719
when it had

3715
02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:54,639
more telomere so what my work did

3716
02:08:52,719 --> 02:08:56,560
was it looked at the fact that the

3717
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:57,679
telomeric shortening was being studied

3718
02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:00,159
by two different groups

3719
02:08:57,679 --> 02:09:00,800
it was being studied by people who were

3720
02:09:00,158 --> 02:09:03,439
interested

3721
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:04,320
in counteracting the aging process and

3722
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:06,399
it was being

3723
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:08,078
studied in exactly the opposite fashion

3724
02:09:06,399 --> 02:09:10,879
by people who were interested

3725
02:09:08,078 --> 02:09:11,519
in tumerogenesis and cancer the thought

3726
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:13,199
being

3727
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:15,280
because it was true that when one looked

3728
02:09:13,198 --> 02:09:17,519
into tumors they always had

3729
02:09:15,279 --> 02:09:18,960
telomerase active that's the enzyme that

3730
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:22,320
lengthens our telomeres

3731
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:24,560
so those folks were interested in

3732
02:09:22,319 --> 02:09:26,000
uh bringing about a halt to the

3733
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:27,360
lengthening of telomeres in order to

3734
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,118
counteract cancer

3735
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:30,399
and the folks who were studying the

3736
02:09:29,118 --> 02:09:32,158
senescence process

3737
02:09:30,399 --> 02:09:34,399
were interested in lengthening telomeres

3738
02:09:32,158 --> 02:09:36,879
in order to generate greater

3739
02:09:34,399 --> 02:09:38,719
repair capacity and my point was

3740
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:42,000
evolutionarily speaking

3741
02:09:38,719 --> 02:09:45,198
this looks like a plyotropic

3742
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:48,719
effect that the

3743
02:09:45,198 --> 02:09:50,879
genes which create the tendency of

3744
02:09:48,719 --> 02:09:53,198
the cells to be limited in their

3745
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:55,679
capacity to replace themselves

3746
02:09:53,198 --> 02:09:56,799
are providing a benefit in youth which

3747
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:59,440
is that we are

3748
02:09:56,800 --> 02:10:00,079
largely free of tumors and cancer at the

3749
02:09:59,439 --> 02:10:02,319
inevitable

3750
02:10:00,078 --> 02:10:03,279
late life cost that we grow feeble and

3751
02:10:02,319 --> 02:10:06,479
inefficient and

3752
02:10:03,279 --> 02:10:09,279
eventually die and that matches

3753
02:10:06,479 --> 02:10:10,158
a very old hypothesis in evolutionary

3754
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:12,158
theory

3755
02:10:10,158 --> 02:10:14,000
by somebody i was fortunate enough to

3756
02:10:12,158 --> 02:10:17,519
know george williams one of the great

3757
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:19,599
20th century evolutionists who argued

3758
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:21,280
that senescence would have to be caused

3759
02:10:19,599 --> 02:10:23,840
by plyotropic genes

3760
02:10:21,279 --> 02:10:25,118
that cause early life benefits at

3761
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:28,159
unavoidable late life

3762
02:10:25,118 --> 02:10:30,078
costs and although this isn't the exact

3763
02:10:28,158 --> 02:10:30,879
nature of the system he predicted it

3764
02:10:30,078 --> 02:10:34,078
matches

3765
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:35,760
what he was expecting in many regards uh

3766
02:10:34,078 --> 02:10:39,439
to a shocking degree

3767
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:41,280
that said the the the focus of the paper

3768
02:10:39,439 --> 02:10:44,000
is about the

3769
02:10:41,279 --> 02:10:45,679
well let me just read the abstract we

3770
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,520
observed that captive rodent

3771
02:10:45,679 --> 02:10:48,880
breeding protocol is designed this is

3772
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:50,880
the end of the abstract

3773
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:52,239
we observe that captive rodent breeding

3774
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:53,599
protocol is designed to increase

3775
02:10:52,238 --> 02:10:55,678
reproductive output

3776
02:10:53,599 --> 02:10:57,920
simultaneously exert strong selection

3777
02:10:55,679 --> 02:11:00,078
against reproductive senescence

3778
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:01,760
and virtually eliminates selection that

3779
02:11:00,078 --> 02:11:04,479
would otherwise favor

3780
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:06,400
tumor suppression this appears to have

3781
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:07,759
greatly elongated the telomeres of

3782
02:11:06,399 --> 02:11:09,598
laboratory mice

3783
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:11,520
with their telomeric fail-safe

3784
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:13,440
effectively disabled these animals are

3785
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:15,119
unreliable models of normal senescence

3786
02:11:13,439 --> 02:11:18,238
and tumor formation

3787
02:11:15,118 --> 02:11:20,319
so basically using these mice is not

3788
02:11:18,238 --> 02:11:21,519
going to lead to the right kinds of

3789
02:11:20,319 --> 02:11:24,158
conclusions

3790
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:26,560
safety tests employing these animals

3791
02:11:24,158 --> 02:11:29,118
likely overestimate cancer risks

3792
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:29,920
and underestimate tissue damage and

3793
02:11:29,118 --> 02:11:33,839
consequent

3794
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:36,239
accelerated senescence so

3795
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:38,159
i think especially with your discussion

3796
02:11:36,238 --> 02:11:41,598
with eric

3797
02:11:38,158 --> 02:11:43,359
the conclusion of this paper has to do

3798
02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:46,400
with the fact that

3799
02:11:43,359 --> 02:11:49,519
like we shouldn't be using these mice to

3800
02:11:46,399 --> 02:11:51,039
test the safety or to make conclusions

3801
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:53,520
about

3802
02:11:51,039 --> 02:11:54,078
uh cancer or senescence is that the

3803
02:11:53,520 --> 02:11:56,719
basic

3804
02:11:54,078 --> 02:11:58,078
takeaway like basically saying that the

3805
02:11:56,719 --> 02:12:00,000
length of these telomeres is an

3806
02:11:58,078 --> 02:12:02,238
important variable to consider

3807
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,359
well let's put it this way i think there

3808
02:12:02,238 --> 02:12:06,078
was a reason

3809
02:12:03,359 --> 02:12:08,799
that the world of scientists who was

3810
02:12:06,078 --> 02:12:10,880
working on telomeres did not spla

3811
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:13,039
did not spot the plyotropic relationship

3812
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:16,239
that was the

3813
02:12:13,039 --> 02:12:17,760
key argument in my paper

3814
02:12:16,238 --> 02:12:20,559
the reason they didn't spot it was that

3815
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:24,239
there was a result that everybody knew

3816
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:26,960
which seemed inconsistent the result was

3817
02:12:24,238 --> 02:12:28,158
that mice have very long telomeres but

3818
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:31,439
they do not have

3819
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:32,719
very long lives now we can talk about

3820
02:12:31,439 --> 02:12:35,039
what the actual meaning of

3821
02:12:32,719 --> 02:12:35,840
don't have very long lives is but in the

3822
02:12:35,039 --> 02:12:39,118
end

3823
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:41,440
i was confronted with a hypothesis

3824
02:12:39,118 --> 02:12:43,359
that would explain a great many features

3825
02:12:41,439 --> 02:12:45,678
of the way mammals and indeed

3826
02:12:43,359 --> 02:12:48,319
vertebrates age but it was inconsistent

3827
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:49,599
with one result and at first i thought

3828
02:12:48,319 --> 02:12:51,279
maybe there's something wrong with the

3829
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:52,880
result maybe this is one of these cases

3830
02:12:51,279 --> 02:12:55,759
where the result was

3831
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:57,520
achieved once through some bad protocol

3832
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:59,119
and everybody else was repeating it

3833
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:00,719
didn't turn out to be the case many

3834
02:12:59,118 --> 02:13:02,719
laboratories had established that mice

3835
02:13:00,719 --> 02:13:05,198
had ultra-long telomeres

3836
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:06,399
and so i began to wonder whether or not

3837
02:13:05,198 --> 02:13:09,439
there was something

3838
02:13:06,399 --> 02:13:12,000
about the breeding protocols

3839
02:13:09,439 --> 02:13:12,879
that generated these mice and what that

3840
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,319
would predict

3841
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:16,078
is that the mice that have long

3842
02:13:14,319 --> 02:13:19,519
telomeres would be laboratory

3843
02:13:16,078 --> 02:13:22,000
mice and that wild mice would not and

3844
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:23,199
carol grider who agreed to collaborate

3845
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:26,238
with me

3846
02:13:23,198 --> 02:13:27,519
tested that hypothesis and showed that

3847
02:13:26,238 --> 02:13:29,759
it was indeed true

3848
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:30,719
that while derived mice or at least mice

3849
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:32,320
that had been in

3850
02:13:30,719 --> 02:13:35,118
captivity for a much shorter period of

3851
02:13:32,319 --> 02:13:38,639
time did not have ultra-long telomeres

3852
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:41,839
now what this implied though as you read

3853
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:43,199
is that our breeding protocols generate

3854
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:45,599
lengthening of telomeres and the

3855
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:47,519
implication of that is that the animals

3856
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:47,840
that have these very long telomeres will

3857
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:51,400
be

3858
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:54,400
hyperprone to create tumors they will be

3859
02:13:51,399 --> 02:13:55,839
extremely resistant to toxins

3860
02:13:54,399 --> 02:13:58,158
because they have effectively an

3861
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:58,960
infinite capacity to replace any damaged

3862
02:13:58,158 --> 02:14:02,238
tissue

3863
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:04,000
and so ironically if you give one of

3864
02:14:02,238 --> 02:14:07,359
these ultra-long telomere

3865
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,920
lab mice a toxin if the toxin doesn't

3866
02:14:07,359 --> 02:14:09,839
outright

3867
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:11,520
kill it it may actually increase its

3868
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:14,319
lifespan because

3869
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:14,880
it functions as a kind of chemotherapy

3870
02:14:14,319 --> 02:14:17,039
so

3871
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:19,118
the reason the chemotherapy works is

3872
02:14:17,039 --> 02:14:21,039
that dividing cells are more vulnerable

3873
02:14:19,118 --> 02:14:23,759
than cells that are not dividing

3874
02:14:21,039 --> 02:14:26,158
and so if this mouse has effectively had

3875
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:28,400
its cancer protection turned off

3876
02:14:26,158 --> 02:14:29,759
and it has cells dividing too rapidly

3877
02:14:28,399 --> 02:14:31,839
and you give it a toxin

3878
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:33,840
you will slow down its tumors faster

3879
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:35,599
than you harm its other tissues

3880
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:38,239
and so you'll get a paradoxical result

3881
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:41,360
that actually some drug that's toxic

3882
02:14:38,238 --> 02:14:43,039
seems to benefit the mouse now i don't

3883
02:14:41,359 --> 02:14:45,279
think that that was understood

3884
02:14:43,039 --> 02:14:46,719
before i published my paper now i'm

3885
02:14:45,279 --> 02:14:48,960
pretty sure it has to be

3886
02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:50,639
and the problem is that this actually is

3887
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:53,039
a system

3888
02:14:50,639 --> 02:14:54,078
that serves pharmaceutical companies

3889
02:14:53,039 --> 02:14:57,118
that have the difficult

3890
02:14:54,078 --> 02:15:00,158
job of bringing compounds to market

3891
02:14:57,118 --> 02:15:01,759
many of which will be toxic maybe all of

3892
02:15:00,158 --> 02:15:04,799
them will be toxic

3893
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:06,560
and these mice predispose our system to

3894
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:09,760
declare these toxic compounds

3895
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:11,599
safe and in fact i believe we've seen

3896
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:13,599
the errors that result from using these

3897
02:15:11,599 --> 02:15:14,960
mice a number of times most famously

3898
02:15:13,599 --> 02:15:17,119
with vioxx which

3899
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:18,319
turned out to do conspicuous heart

3900
02:15:17,118 --> 02:15:20,639
damage

3901
02:15:18,319 --> 02:15:21,359
why do you think this paper on this idea

3902
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:24,719
has not

3903
02:15:21,359 --> 02:15:27,759
gotten significant traction well

3904
02:15:24,719 --> 02:15:29,039
my collaborator carol grider said

3905
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:32,079
something to me

3906
02:15:29,039 --> 02:15:34,880
that rings in my ears to this day

3907
02:15:32,078 --> 02:15:36,799
she initially after she showed that

3908
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:38,719
laboratory mice have anomalously long

3909
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:39,920
telomeres and that wild mice don't have

3910
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:41,279
long telomeres

3911
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:42,960
i asked her where she was going to

3912
02:15:41,279 --> 02:15:44,399
publish that result so that i could cite

3913
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:46,000
it in my paper

3914
02:15:44,399 --> 02:15:47,519
and she said that she was going to keep

3915
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:51,118
the result in-house

3916
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:54,320
rather than publish it and at the time

3917
02:15:51,118 --> 02:15:55,198
i was a young graduate student i didn't

3918
02:15:54,319 --> 02:15:58,559
really understand

3919
02:15:55,198 --> 02:16:01,598
what she was saying but in some sense

3920
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:03,599
the knowledge that a model organism is

3921
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:05,199
broken in a way that

3922
02:16:03,599 --> 02:16:08,159
creates the likelihood that certain

3923
02:16:05,198 --> 02:16:10,158
results will be reliably generatable

3924
02:16:08,158 --> 02:16:11,839
you can publish a paper and make a big

3925
02:16:10,158 --> 02:16:13,679
splash with such a thing

3926
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:16,000
or you can exploit the fact that you

3927
02:16:13,679 --> 02:16:18,639
know how those models will misbehave

3928
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:20,319
and other people don't so there's a

3929
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:23,118
question if somebody is

3930
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:23,679
motivated cynically and what they want

3931
02:16:23,118 --> 02:16:25,679
to do

3932
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:27,520
is appear to have deeper insight into

3933
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:29,118
biology because they predict things

3934
02:16:27,520 --> 02:16:31,440
better than others do

3935
02:16:29,118 --> 02:16:33,439
knowing where the flaw is so that your

3936
02:16:31,439 --> 02:16:36,558
predictions come out true

3937
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:38,960
is advantageous at the same time

3938
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:40,638
i can't help but imagine that the

3939
02:16:38,959 --> 02:16:42,558
pharmaceutical industry when it figured

3940
02:16:40,638 --> 02:16:45,598
out that the mice were predisposed

3941
02:16:42,558 --> 02:16:48,079
to suggest that drugs were safe

3942
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:48,960
didn't leap to fix the problem because

3943
02:16:48,079 --> 02:16:50,799
in some sense

3944
02:16:48,959 --> 02:16:52,879
it was the perfect cover for the

3945
02:16:50,799 --> 02:16:54,239
difficult job of

3946
02:16:52,879 --> 02:16:56,638
bringing drugs to market and then

3947
02:16:54,239 --> 02:16:57,359
discovering their actual toxicity

3948
02:16:56,638 --> 02:16:59,039
profile

3949
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:01,120
right this made things look safer than

3950
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:04,000
they were and i believe a lot of profits

3951
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:06,880
have likely been generated downstream

3952
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:08,558
so to kind of play devil's advocate it's

3953
02:17:06,879 --> 02:17:10,799
also possible

3954
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:12,558
that this particular the length of the

3955
02:17:10,799 --> 02:17:13,679
telomeres is not a strong variable for

3956
02:17:12,558 --> 02:17:15,518
the conclusions

3957
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:17,200
for for the drug development and for the

3958
02:17:15,519 --> 02:17:19,519
conclusions that carol and others

3959
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:21,679
have been studying is that is that is it

3960
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:24,478
possible for that to be the case

3961
02:17:21,679 --> 02:17:27,120
that this like so one reason she and

3962
02:17:24,478 --> 02:17:29,358
others could be ignoring this

3963
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:31,120
is because it's not a strong variable

3964
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:31,840
well i don't believe so and in fact at

3965
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:35,040
the point that i

3966
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:36,159
went to publish my paper carol published

3967
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:38,240
her result

3968
02:17:36,159 --> 02:17:39,439
um she did so in a way that did not make

3969
02:17:38,239 --> 02:17:42,159
a huge splash

3970
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:42,479
did she like whoa i apologize if i don't

3971
02:17:42,159 --> 02:17:46,398
know

3972
02:17:42,478 --> 02:17:49,760
how what was the emphasis

3973
02:17:46,398 --> 02:17:52,079
of her publication of that paper

3974
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:53,280
was it purely just kind of showing data

3975
02:17:52,079 --> 02:17:54,718
or is there more

3976
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:56,399
because in your paper there's a kind of

3977
02:17:54,718 --> 02:17:57,518
more of a philosophical statement as

3978
02:17:56,398 --> 02:18:00,879
well

3979
02:17:57,519 --> 02:18:02,880
well my paper was motivated by interest

3980
02:18:00,879 --> 02:18:04,239
in the evolutionary dynamics around

3981
02:18:02,879 --> 02:18:07,199
senescence i wasn't

3982
02:18:04,239 --> 02:18:08,718
um you know pursuing grants or anything

3983
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:10,800
like that i was just working on a puzzle

3984
02:18:08,718 --> 02:18:13,358
i thought was interesting

3985
02:18:10,799 --> 02:18:14,638
carol has of course gone on to win a

3986
02:18:13,359 --> 02:18:17,359
nobel prize for

3987
02:18:14,638 --> 02:18:17,839
her co-discovery with elizabeth grider

3988
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:19,599
of

3989
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:21,679
telomerase the enzyme that lengthens

3990
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:24,000
telomeres

3991
02:18:21,679 --> 02:18:25,599
but anyway she's a heavy hitter in the

3992
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,120
academic world

3993
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:29,040
i don't know exactly what her purpose

3994
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:30,800
was i do know that she told me she

3995
02:18:29,040 --> 02:18:32,399
wasn't planning to publish and i do know

3996
02:18:30,799 --> 02:18:33,599
that i discovered that she was in the

3997
02:18:32,398 --> 02:18:35,358
process of publishing

3998
02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:36,799
very late and when i asked her to send

3999
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:40,079
me the paper

4000
02:18:36,799 --> 02:18:42,079
to see whether or not she had put

4001
02:18:40,079 --> 02:18:43,439
evidence in it that the hypothesis had

4002
02:18:42,079 --> 02:18:45,679
come from me

4003
02:18:43,439 --> 02:18:47,840
she grudgingly sent it to me and my name

4004
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:51,200
was nowhere mentioned and she has

4005
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:52,880
she broke contact at that point

4006
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:54,800
what it is that motivated her i don't

4007
02:18:52,879 --> 02:18:57,199
know but i don't think it can possibly

4008
02:18:54,799 --> 02:18:59,679
be that this result is unimportant

4009
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:01,760
the fact is the reason i called her in

4010
02:18:59,679 --> 02:19:04,960
the first place and established contact

4011
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:06,000
that generated our collaboration was

4012
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:08,718
that she was a leading

4013
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,760
light in the field of telomeric studies

4014
02:19:08,718 --> 02:19:12,318
and

4015
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:14,079
um because of that this question about

4016
02:19:12,318 --> 02:19:18,000
whether the model organisms

4017
02:19:14,079 --> 02:19:19,679
are distorting the uh the understanding

4018
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,239
of the functioning of telomeres is

4019
02:19:19,679 --> 02:19:23,439
it's central do you feel like you you've

4020
02:19:22,239 --> 02:19:26,558
been

4021
02:19:23,439 --> 02:19:28,159
as a young graduate student do you think

4022
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:30,558
carol or do you think the scientific

4023
02:19:28,159 --> 02:19:32,159
community broadly screwed you over

4024
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:35,599
in some way you know i don't think of it

4025
02:19:32,159 --> 02:19:38,398
in those terms probably partly because

4026
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:38,799
it's not productive but you know i have

4027
02:19:38,398 --> 02:19:41,840
a

4028
02:19:38,799 --> 02:19:44,239
a complex relationship with this story

4029
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:46,000
right on the one hand i'm livid with

4030
02:19:44,239 --> 02:19:48,159
carol grider for what she did

4031
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:49,920
right she absolutely pretended that i

4032
02:19:48,159 --> 02:19:51,840
didn't exist in this story

4033
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:53,760
and i don't think i was a threat to her

4034
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:54,559
my interest was as an evolutionary

4035
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:57,359
biologist

4036
02:19:54,559 --> 02:19:59,439
i had made an evolutionary contribution

4037
02:19:57,359 --> 02:20:00,640
she had tested a hypothesis and frankly

4038
02:19:59,439 --> 02:20:01,520
i think it would have been better for

4039
02:20:00,639 --> 02:20:03,680
her

4040
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:05,120
if she had acknowledged what i had done

4041
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:09,600
i think it would have enhanced

4042
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:11,040
her work and you know i was

4043
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:12,960
let's put it this way when i watched her

4044
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:14,640
nobel lecture and i should say there's

4045
02:20:12,959 --> 02:20:16,239
been a lot of confusion about this nobel

4046
02:20:14,639 --> 02:20:16,879
stuff i've never said that i should have

4047
02:20:16,239 --> 02:20:19,840
gotten

4048
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:21,279
a nobel prize people have misportrayed

4049
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:25,760
that

4050
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:28,239
um my in listening to her lecture

4051
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:29,040
i had one of the most bizarre emotional

4052
02:20:28,239 --> 02:20:32,318
experiences

4053
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:33,040
of my life because she presented the

4054
02:20:32,318 --> 02:20:36,079
work

4055
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:37,120
that resulted from my hypothesis she

4056
02:20:36,079 --> 02:20:39,600
presented it

4057
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:41,840
as she had in her paper with no

4058
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:46,079
acknowledgment of where it had come

4059
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:48,478
from and she had in fact portrayed

4060
02:20:46,079 --> 02:20:49,840
the distortion of the telomeres as if it

4061
02:20:48,478 --> 02:20:52,398
were a lucky

4062
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:54,799
fact because it allowed testing

4063
02:20:52,398 --> 02:20:58,079
hypotheses that would otherwise not be

4064
02:20:54,799 --> 02:21:01,199
testable you have to understand as

4065
02:20:58,079 --> 02:21:04,398
a young scientist to watch

4066
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:07,200
work that you have done presented

4067
02:21:04,398 --> 02:21:08,079
in what's surely the most important

4068
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:11,359
lecture of her

4069
02:21:08,079 --> 02:21:14,719
career right it's thrilling

4070
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:18,000
it was thrilling to see you know her

4071
02:21:14,719 --> 02:21:19,599
uh her figures projected on the screen

4072
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,040
there right to have been

4073
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:23,680
part of work that was important enough

4074
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:25,600
for that felt great and of course to be

4075
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:27,680
erased from the story felt absolutely

4076
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:29,920
terrible

4077
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:32,479
so anyway that's sort of where i am with

4078
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:34,879
it my sense is

4079
02:21:32,478 --> 02:21:36,000
i what i'm really troubled by in this

4080
02:21:34,879 --> 02:21:40,079
story

4081
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:43,200
is the fact that

4082
02:21:40,079 --> 02:21:45,760
as far as i know the flaw with the mice

4083
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:47,760
has not been addressed

4084
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:49,280
and actually eric did some looking into

4085
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:51,359
this he tried to establish

4086
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:52,720
by calling the jacks lab and trying to

4087
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:54,239
ascertain

4088
02:21:52,719 --> 02:21:56,159
what had happened with the colonies

4089
02:21:54,239 --> 02:21:56,959
whether any change in protocol had

4090
02:21:56,159 --> 02:21:58,959
occurred

4091
02:21:56,959 --> 02:22:00,639
and he couldn't get anywhere there was

4092
02:21:58,959 --> 02:22:02,239
seemingly no awareness that it was even

4093
02:22:00,639 --> 02:22:05,439
an issue

4094
02:22:02,239 --> 02:22:07,439
so i'm very troubled by the fact that as

4095
02:22:05,439 --> 02:22:10,398
a father for example

4096
02:22:07,439 --> 02:22:11,920
i'm in no position to protect my family

4097
02:22:10,398 --> 02:22:14,879
from the hazard that i believe

4098
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:16,239
lurks in our medicine cabinets right i'm

4099
02:22:14,879 --> 02:22:17,279
even though i'm aware of where the

4100
02:22:16,239 --> 02:22:19,039
hazard comes from

4101
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:20,640
it doesn't tell me anything useful about

4102
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:23,200
which of these drugs will turn out to do

4103
02:22:20,639 --> 02:22:24,879
damage if that is ultimately tested

4104
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:26,399
and that's a very frustrating position

4105
02:22:24,879 --> 02:22:27,679
to be in

4106
02:22:26,398 --> 02:22:29,439
on the other hand you know there's a

4107
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:30,398
part of me that's even still grateful to

4108
02:22:29,439 --> 02:22:32,159
carol

4109
02:22:30,398 --> 02:22:33,760
for taking my call she didn't have to

4110
02:22:32,159 --> 02:22:35,039
take my call and talk to some young

4111
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:37,040
graduate student who had some

4112
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:40,240
evolutionary idea that wasn't

4113
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:42,479
you know in her wheelhouse specifically

4114
02:22:40,239 --> 02:22:44,478
and yet she did and you know for a while

4115
02:22:42,478 --> 02:22:47,840
she was a good collaborator so

4116
02:22:44,478 --> 02:22:52,159
well can i i have to proceed carefully

4117
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:55,280
here because it's a complicated topic

4118
02:22:52,159 --> 02:22:55,280
so she took the call

4119
02:22:55,600 --> 02:23:03,359
and you kind of you're kind of saying

4120
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:05,439
that she basically

4121
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:07,040
erased credit you know pretending you

4122
02:23:05,439 --> 02:23:10,159
didn't exist in some kind of

4123
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:10,160
in a certain sense

4124
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:19,040
let me phrase it this way i've um as a

4125
02:23:14,879 --> 02:23:22,799
as a research scientist at mit i've had

4126
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:25,680
especially just part of

4127
02:23:22,799 --> 02:23:28,318
a large set of collaborations i've had a

4128
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:31,760
lot of students come to me

4129
02:23:28,318 --> 02:23:33,119
and talk to me about ideas perhaps less

4130
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:33,520
interesting than what we're discussing

4131
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:36,399
here

4132
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:37,760
in the space of ai that i've been

4133
02:23:36,398 --> 02:23:40,239
thinking about anyway

4134
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:43,120
it's in in general with everything i'm

4135
02:23:40,239 --> 02:23:46,719
doing with robotics

4136
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:48,079
people will have told me

4137
02:23:46,719 --> 02:23:50,239
a bunch of ideas that i'm already

4138
02:23:48,079 --> 02:23:53,039
thinking about the point is

4139
02:23:50,239 --> 02:23:53,520
taking that idea see this is different

4140
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:55,120
because

4141
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:56,239
the idea has more power in the space

4142
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:58,479
that we're talking about here and

4143
02:23:56,239 --> 02:24:00,639
robotics is like your idea means [ __ ]

4144
02:23:58,478 --> 02:24:03,199
until you build it like so the

4145
02:24:00,639 --> 02:24:06,799
engineering world is a little different

4146
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:07,920
but it there's a kind of sense that i

4147
02:24:06,799 --> 02:24:09,759
probably forgot

4148
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:11,520
a lot of brilliant ideas have been told

4149
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:14,318
to me

4150
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:14,720
do you think she pretended you don't

4151
02:24:14,318 --> 02:24:17,359
exist

4152
02:24:14,719 --> 02:24:18,398
do you think she was so busy that she

4153
02:24:17,359 --> 02:24:20,960
kind of

4154
02:24:18,398 --> 02:24:22,799
forgot you know that she has like the

4155
02:24:20,959 --> 02:24:23,119
stream of brilliant people around her

4156
02:24:22,799 --> 02:24:24,879
that

4157
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:26,240
there's a bunch of ideas that are

4158
02:24:24,879 --> 02:24:28,318
swimming in the air

4159
02:24:26,239 --> 02:24:30,159
and you just kind of forget people that

4160
02:24:28,318 --> 02:24:32,398
are a little bit on the periphery

4161
02:24:30,159 --> 02:24:34,318
on the idea generation like or is it

4162
02:24:32,398 --> 02:24:37,519
some mix of both

4163
02:24:34,318 --> 02:24:38,239
uh it's not a mix of both um i know that

4164
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:40,640
because

4165
02:24:38,239 --> 02:24:42,719
we corresponded she put a graduate

4166
02:24:40,639 --> 02:24:43,599
student on this work he emailed me

4167
02:24:42,719 --> 02:24:46,639
excitedly

4168
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:49,120
when the results came in

4169
02:24:46,639 --> 02:24:50,079
so there was no ambiguity about what had

4170
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:52,560
happened

4171
02:24:50,079 --> 02:24:54,239
what's more when i went to publish my

4172
02:24:52,559 --> 02:24:57,039
work i actually sent it to carol

4173
02:24:54,239 --> 02:24:59,760
in order to get her feedback because i

4174
02:24:57,040 --> 02:25:03,439
wanted to be a good collaborator to her

4175
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:06,159
and she absolutely panned it made

4176
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:07,840
many critiques that were not valid but

4177
02:25:06,159 --> 02:25:10,159
it was clear at that point that she

4178
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:12,799
became an antagonist

4179
02:25:10,159 --> 02:25:15,600
and none of this adds up she couldn't

4180
02:25:12,799 --> 02:25:19,119
possibly have forgotten the conversation

4181
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:20,239
um i believe i even sent her tissues at

4182
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:22,960
some point

4183
02:25:20,239 --> 02:25:24,559
in in part not related to this project

4184
02:25:22,959 --> 02:25:26,079
but as a favor she was doing another

4185
02:25:24,559 --> 02:25:26,639
project that involved telomeres and she

4186
02:25:26,079 --> 02:25:28,000
needed

4187
02:25:26,639 --> 02:25:29,680
samples that i could get a hold of

4188
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,799
because of the museum of zoology that i

4189
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:34,318
was in

4190
02:25:30,799 --> 02:25:35,438
so this was not a one-off conversation i

4191
02:25:34,318 --> 02:25:36,799
certainly know that those sorts of

4192
02:25:35,439 --> 02:25:37,760
things can happen but that's not what

4193
02:25:36,799 --> 02:25:41,199
happened here

4194
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:43,680
this was a relationship that existed

4195
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:44,800
and then was suddenly cut short at the

4196
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:46,559
point that she

4197
02:25:44,799 --> 02:25:48,079
published her paper by surprise without

4198
02:25:46,559 --> 02:25:48,959
saying where the hypothesis had come

4199
02:25:48,079 --> 02:25:52,159
from

4200
02:25:48,959 --> 02:25:55,679
and uh began to be a

4201
02:25:52,159 --> 02:25:57,039
opposing force to my work is there

4202
02:25:55,680 --> 02:26:00,000
there's a bunch of trajectories you

4203
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:00,000
could have taken through life

4204
02:26:00,318 --> 02:26:05,279
do you think about the trajectory of

4205
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:08,720
being

4206
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:10,079
a researcher of then going to to war in

4207
02:26:08,719 --> 02:26:12,398
the space of ideas

4208
02:26:10,079 --> 02:26:13,439
of publishing further papers along this

4209
02:26:12,398 --> 02:26:17,358
line

4210
02:26:13,439 --> 02:26:19,280
i mean that's often the dynamic of

4211
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:21,840
that fascinating space is you have a

4212
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:23,680
junior researcher with brilliant ideas

4213
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:25,359
and a senior researcher that

4214
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:27,680
that starts out as a mentor that becomes

4215
02:26:25,359 --> 02:26:31,280
a competitor i mean that that happens

4216
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:33,520
but then the way to uh

4217
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:35,359
it's an almost an opportunity to shine

4218
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:36,000
is to publish a bunch more papers in

4219
02:26:35,359 --> 02:26:39,200
this

4220
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:42,478
place like to tear it apart to dig into

4221
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:44,079
like really uh make it a war of ideas

4222
02:26:42,478 --> 02:26:47,119
did you consider that

4223
02:26:44,079 --> 02:26:48,318
possible trajectory i did a couple

4224
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:51,680
things to say about it

4225
02:26:48,318 --> 02:26:54,398
one this work was not central for me

4226
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:55,040
i took a year on the telomere project

4227
02:26:54,398 --> 02:26:57,599
because

4228
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:59,439
something fascinating occurred to me and

4229
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:00,800
i pursued it and the more i pursued it

4230
02:26:59,439 --> 02:27:01,280
the clearer it was there was something

4231
02:27:00,799 --> 02:27:02,879
there

4232
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:04,720
but it wasn't the focus of my graduate

4233
02:27:02,879 --> 02:27:08,000
work and

4234
02:27:04,719 --> 02:27:10,239
i didn't want to become a telomere

4235
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,398
researcher what i want to do

4236
02:27:10,239 --> 02:27:13,680
is to be an evolutionary biologist who

4237
02:27:12,398 --> 02:27:16,398
upgrades the toolkit

4238
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:16,880
of evolutionary concepts so that we can

4239
02:27:16,398 --> 02:27:19,119
see

4240
02:27:16,879 --> 02:27:20,159
more clearly how organisms function and

4241
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:24,479
why

4242
02:27:20,159 --> 02:27:26,239
and telomeres was a proof of concept

4243
02:27:24,478 --> 02:27:30,318
right that paper was a proof of concept

4244
02:27:26,239 --> 02:27:33,600
that the toolkit in question works um

4245
02:27:30,318 --> 02:27:36,478
as for the need

4246
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:37,680
to pursue it further i think it's kind

4247
02:27:36,478 --> 02:27:39,438
of absurd and you're not the first

4248
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:41,359
person to say maybe that was the way to

4249
02:27:39,439 --> 02:27:42,880
go about it but the basic point is look

4250
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:45,680
the work was good

4251
02:27:42,879 --> 02:27:46,959
the it turned out to be highly

4252
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:49,520
predictive

4253
02:27:46,959 --> 02:27:51,919
frankly the model of senescence that i

4254
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:54,960
presented is now widely accepted

4255
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:57,439
and i don't feel any misgivings

4256
02:27:54,959 --> 02:27:58,000
at all about having spent a year on it

4257
02:27:57,439 --> 02:28:00,079
said my

4258
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:02,159
piece and moved on to other things which

4259
02:28:00,079 --> 02:28:03,600
frankly i think are bigger

4260
02:28:02,159 --> 02:28:05,760
i think there's a lot of good to be done

4261
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:06,399
and it would be it would be a waste to

4262
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:09,920
get overly

4263
02:28:06,398 --> 02:28:13,840
narrowly focused there's so many ways

4264
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:16,000
through the space of science and

4265
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:17,920
the the most common ways to just publish

4266
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
a lot let's publish a lot of papers do

4267
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:23,120
these incremental work and

4268
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:25,760
uh exploring the space kind of like ants

4269
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:27,120
looking for food is you're tossing out a

4270
02:28:25,760 --> 02:28:29,040
bunch of different ideas some of them

4271
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:31,040
could be brilliant breakthrough ideas

4272
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:32,560
nature some of the more confidence kind

4273
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:33,200
of publications all those kinds of

4274
02:28:32,559 --> 02:28:36,318
things

4275
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:39,520
did you consider that kind of

4276
02:28:36,318 --> 02:28:41,119
path and science of course i considered

4277
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:43,840
it but i must say

4278
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:45,840
the experience of having my first

4279
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:46,880
encounter with the process of peer

4280
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:49,920
review

4281
02:28:46,879 --> 02:28:52,318
be this story which was frankly a

4282
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:53,760
debacle from one end to the other

4283
02:28:52,318 --> 02:28:55,760
with respect to the process of

4284
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:58,398
publishing

4285
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:58,880
it did not it was not a very good sales

4286
02:28:58,398 --> 02:29:00,799
pitch

4287
02:28:58,879 --> 02:29:02,318
for um trying to make a difference to

4288
02:29:00,799 --> 02:29:04,000
publication and i would point out part

4289
02:29:02,318 --> 02:29:05,439
of what i ran into and i think frankly

4290
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:08,639
part of what explains

4291
02:29:05,439 --> 02:29:11,680
carol's behavior is that in

4292
02:29:08,639 --> 02:29:12,478
some parts of science there is this

4293
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:16,479
dynamic

4294
02:29:12,478 --> 02:29:19,840
where pis parasitize their underlings

4295
02:29:16,478 --> 02:29:21,599
and if you're very very good you rise to

4296
02:29:19,840 --> 02:29:23,520
the level where one day

4297
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:25,200
instead of being parasitized you get to

4298
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:26,800
parasitize others

4299
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:29,200
now i find that scientifically

4300
02:29:26,799 --> 02:29:30,398
despicable and it wasn't the culture of

4301
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:33,840
the lab i grew up in

4302
02:29:30,398 --> 02:29:36,000
at all my lab in fact the pi

4303
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:37,600
dick alexander who's now gone but who

4304
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:40,879
was an incredible

4305
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:42,720
mind and a great human being he didn't

4306
02:29:40,879 --> 02:29:44,879
want his graduate students working on

4307
02:29:42,719 --> 02:29:46,000
the same topics he was on not because it

4308
02:29:44,879 --> 02:29:49,039
wouldn't have been

4309
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:51,200
useful and exciting but because

4310
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:52,479
in effect he did not want any confusion

4311
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:55,120
about

4312
02:29:52,478 --> 02:29:57,760
who had done what because he was a great

4313
02:29:55,120 --> 02:30:00,399
mentor and the idea was actually

4314
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:01,040
a great mentor is not stealing ideas and

4315
02:30:00,398 --> 02:30:02,318
you and

4316
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:04,479
you don't want you don't want people

4317
02:30:02,318 --> 02:30:08,000
thinking that they are so

4318
02:30:04,478 --> 02:30:11,119
anyway my point would be um

4319
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:13,760
i wasn't up for being parasitized

4320
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:14,399
i don't like the idea that if you are

4321
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:16,159
very good

4322
02:30:14,398 --> 02:30:17,599
you get parasitized until it's your turn

4323
02:30:16,159 --> 02:30:20,639
to parasitize others

4324
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:22,399
that doesn't make sense to me a

4325
02:30:20,639 --> 02:30:24,398
you know crossing over from evolution

4326
02:30:22,398 --> 02:30:25,358
into cellular biology may have exposed

4327
02:30:24,398 --> 02:30:26,879
me to that

4328
02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:28,640
that may have been par for the course

4329
02:30:26,879 --> 02:30:31,199
but it doesn't make it

4330
02:30:28,639 --> 02:30:32,398
acceptable and i would also point out

4331
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:36,399
that my work

4332
02:30:32,398 --> 02:30:39,680
falls in the realm of synthesis

4333
02:30:36,398 --> 02:30:43,279
my work generally takes evidence

4334
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:43,920
accumulated by others and places it

4335
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:46,640
together

4336
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:47,600
in order to generate hypotheses that

4337
02:30:46,639 --> 02:30:50,000
explain

4338
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:51,200
sets of phenomena that are otherwise

4339
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:55,200
intractable

4340
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:58,240
and i am not sure that that is best done

4341
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:58,560
with narrow publications that are read

4342
02:30:58,239 --> 02:31:01,439
by

4343
02:30:58,559 --> 02:31:03,279
few and in fact i would point to the

4344
02:31:01,439 --> 02:31:04,000
very conspicuous example of richard

4345
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:05,680
dawkins

4346
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:08,719
who i must say i've learned a tremendous

4347
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:12,159
amount from and i greatly admire

4348
02:31:08,719 --> 02:31:15,039
dawkins has almost no publication record

4349
02:31:12,159 --> 02:31:16,799
in the sense of peer-reviewed papers in

4350
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:18,399
journals what he's done instead

4351
02:31:16,799 --> 02:31:20,559
is done synthetic work and he's

4352
02:31:18,398 --> 02:31:22,959
published it in books which are not

4353
02:31:20,559 --> 02:31:24,959
peer-reviewed in the same sense and

4354
02:31:22,959 --> 02:31:25,919
frankly i think there's no doubting his

4355
02:31:24,959 --> 02:31:29,119
contribution

4356
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:30,879
to the field so my sense is if richard

4357
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:32,880
dawkins

4358
02:31:30,879 --> 02:31:35,279
can illustrate that one can make

4359
02:31:32,879 --> 02:31:37,759
contributions to the field without

4360
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:39,359
uh using journals as the primary

4361
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:40,398
mechanism for distributing what you've

4362
02:31:39,359 --> 02:31:42,318
come to understand

4363
02:31:40,398 --> 02:31:44,318
then it's obviously a valid mechanism

4364
02:31:42,318 --> 02:31:45,760
and it's a far better one from the point

4365
02:31:44,318 --> 02:31:47,760
of view of accomplishing what i want to

4366
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:49,200
accomplish yeah it's really interesting

4367
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:51,040
there is of course several levels you

4368
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:51,920
can do the kind of synthesis and that

4369
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:54,880
does require

4370
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:56,079
a lot of both broad and deep thinking is

4371
02:31:54,879 --> 02:31:58,478
exceptionally valuable

4372
02:31:56,079 --> 02:31:59,920
you could also public i'm working on

4373
02:31:58,478 --> 02:32:01,519
something with andrew huberman now you

4374
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:03,439
can also publish synthesis

4375
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:05,600
sure that's like review papers they're

4376
02:32:03,439 --> 02:32:07,040
exceptionally valuable

4377
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:09,280
for the communities it brings the

4378
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:10,720
community together tells a history

4379
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:12,319
tells a story where the community has

4380
02:32:10,719 --> 02:32:13,279
been it paints a picture of where the

4381
02:32:12,318 --> 02:32:15,039
path

4382
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:16,960
lays for the future i think it's really

4383
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:18,240
valuable and richard dawkins is a good

4384
02:32:16,959 --> 02:32:20,159
example of somebody that does that in

4385
02:32:18,239 --> 02:32:22,079
book form

4386
02:32:20,159 --> 02:32:23,840
that he kind of walks the line really

4387
02:32:22,079 --> 02:32:25,600
interestingly

4388
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:27,520
like somebody who like neil degrasse

4389
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:28,640
tyson who's more like a science

4390
02:32:27,520 --> 02:32:30,319
communicator

4391
02:32:28,639 --> 02:32:31,840
richard dawkins sometimes is a science

4392
02:32:30,318 --> 02:32:34,000
communicator but he gets

4393
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:35,520
he gets like close to the technical to

4394
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:39,040
where it's a little bit

4395
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:41,600
it's not shying away from being

4396
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:43,680
really a contribution to science no he's

4397
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:46,479
made he's made real contributions

4398
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:47,439
um in book form yes he really is

4399
02:32:46,478 --> 02:32:49,920
fascinating

4400
02:32:47,439 --> 02:32:51,200
i mean uh roger penrose i mean some

4401
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:52,559
similar kind of

4402
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:54,000
idea that's interesting that's

4403
02:32:52,559 --> 02:32:56,398
interesting synthesis does not

4404
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:59,680
especially synthesis work

4405
02:32:56,398 --> 02:33:02,079
work that synthesizes ideas does not

4406
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:05,120
necessarily need to be peer reviewed

4407
02:33:02,079 --> 02:33:08,159
it it it's peer reviewed

4408
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:10,640
by peers reading it

4409
02:33:08,159 --> 02:33:12,159
well and reviewing it that's it it is

4410
02:33:10,639 --> 02:33:13,760
reviewed by peers which is not

4411
02:33:12,159 --> 02:33:15,439
synonymous with peer review and that's

4412
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:17,120
the thing is people don't understand

4413
02:33:15,439 --> 02:33:19,520
that the two things aren't the same

4414
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:21,040
right peer review is an anonymous

4415
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:24,479
process that happens

4416
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:26,640
before publication in a place where

4417
02:33:24,478 --> 02:33:28,159
there is a power dynamic right i mean

4418
02:33:26,639 --> 02:33:29,920
the joke of course is that peer review

4419
02:33:28,159 --> 02:33:32,079
is actually peer preview

4420
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:33,680
right your biggest competitors get to

4421
02:33:32,079 --> 02:33:35,680
see your work before it sees the light

4422
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:39,520
of day and decide whether or not

4423
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:41,439
it gets published and you know again

4424
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:43,359
when your formative experience with the

4425
02:33:41,439 --> 02:33:45,840
publication apparatus is the one i had

4426
02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:47,680
with the telomere paper

4427
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:50,000
there's no way that that seems like the

4428
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:53,120
right way to advance important ideas

4429
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:54,559
yeah and you know what's the harm

4430
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:56,160
in publishing them so that your peers

4431
02:33:54,559 --> 02:33:56,799
have to review them in public where they

4432
02:33:56,159 --> 02:33:58,719
actually

4433
02:33:56,799 --> 02:34:00,478
if they're gonna disagree with you they

4434
02:33:58,719 --> 02:34:02,159
actually have to take the risk of saying

4435
02:34:00,478 --> 02:34:04,398
i don't think this is right and here's

4436
02:34:02,159 --> 02:34:06,079
why right with their name on it

4437
02:34:04,398 --> 02:34:07,680
i'd much rather that it's not that i

4438
02:34:06,079 --> 02:34:09,280
don't want my work reviewed by peers but

4439
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:10,880
i want it done

4440
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:12,800
in the open you know for the same reason

4441
02:34:10,879 --> 02:34:14,959
you don't meet with dangerous people

4442
02:34:12,799 --> 02:34:16,159
in private you meet at the cafe i want

4443
02:34:14,959 --> 02:34:19,839
the work reviewed

4444
02:34:16,159 --> 02:34:20,799
out in public can i ask you a difficult

4445
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:25,600
question

4446
02:34:20,799 --> 02:34:29,358
sure there is popularity

4447
02:34:25,600 --> 02:34:31,439
in martyrdom there's popularity

4448
02:34:29,359 --> 02:34:33,680
in pointing out that the emperor has no

4449
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:37,760
clothes

4450
02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:37,760
that that can become a drug in itself

4451
02:34:40,879 --> 02:34:44,478
i've confronted this in scientific work

4452
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:48,478
i've done at

4453
02:34:44,478 --> 02:34:49,760
mit where there are certain things

4454
02:34:48,478 --> 02:34:51,358
they're not done well

4455
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:53,920
people are not being the best version of

4456
02:34:51,359 --> 02:34:53,920
themselves

4457
02:34:54,000 --> 02:35:00,639
and particular aspects

4458
02:34:57,280 --> 02:35:00,640
of a particular field

4459
02:35:00,719 --> 02:35:05,039
are in need of a revolution and part of

4460
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:08,079
me

4461
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:11,200
wanted to point that out versus

4462
02:35:08,079 --> 02:35:12,959
doing the hard work of

4463
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:15,280
publishing papers and doing the

4464
02:35:12,959 --> 02:35:16,799
revolution basically just pointing out

4465
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:18,319
look

4466
02:35:16,799 --> 02:35:20,159
you guys are doing it wrong and then

4467
02:35:18,318 --> 02:35:23,359
just walking away

4468
02:35:20,159 --> 02:35:26,959
are you aware of the drug of martyrdom

4469
02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:30,640
of uh the

4470
02:35:26,959 --> 02:35:32,559
the ego involved in it that it can cloud

4471
02:35:30,639 --> 02:35:33,920
your thinking

4472
02:35:32,559 --> 02:35:35,760
probably one of the best questions i've

4473
02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:39,359
ever been asked um

4474
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:41,840
so let me let me try to sort it out

4475
02:35:39,359 --> 02:35:42,559
first of all we are all mysteries to

4476
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:44,398
ourself

4477
02:35:42,559 --> 02:35:45,760
at some level so it's possible there's

4478
02:35:44,398 --> 02:35:47,358
stuff going on

4479
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:49,359
in me that i'm not aware of that's

4480
02:35:47,359 --> 02:35:50,800
driving but in general i would say one

4481
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:53,680
of my better

4482
02:35:50,799 --> 02:35:55,199
strengths is that i'm not especially ego

4483
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:57,840
driven

4484
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:58,479
i have an ego i clearly think highly of

4485
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:01,439
myself

4486
02:35:58,478 --> 02:36:03,119
but it is not driving me i do not crave

4487
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:06,318
that kind of validation

4488
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:06,640
i do crave certain things i do love a

4489
02:36:06,318 --> 02:36:08,959
good

4490
02:36:06,639 --> 02:36:10,239
eureka moment there is something great

4491
02:36:08,959 --> 02:36:12,079
about it and there's something even

4492
02:36:10,239 --> 02:36:13,280
better about the phone calls you make

4493
02:36:12,079 --> 02:36:15,760
next when you share it

4494
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:17,280
right it's pretty it's pretty fun right

4495
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:20,478
i really like it

4496
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:22,960
i also really like my subject

4497
02:36:20,478 --> 02:36:23,760
right there's something about a walk in

4498
02:36:22,959 --> 02:36:25,679
the forest

4499
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:28,000
when you have a tool kit in which you

4500
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:31,439
can actually look at creatures and see

4501
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:33,920
something deep right i like it

4502
02:36:31,439 --> 02:36:35,520
that drives me and i could entertain

4503
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:38,639
myself for the rest of my life

4504
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:40,159
right if i if i was somehow isolated

4505
02:36:38,639 --> 02:36:41,519
from the rest of the world but i was in

4506
02:36:40,159 --> 02:36:42,398
a place that was biologically

4507
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:44,720
interesting

4508
02:36:42,398 --> 02:36:45,840
you know hopefully i would be with

4509
02:36:44,719 --> 02:36:48,318
people that i love

4510
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:48,960
and pets that i love believe it or not

4511
02:36:48,318 --> 02:36:50,719
but

4512
02:36:48,959 --> 02:36:52,239
you know if i were in that situation and

4513
02:36:50,719 --> 02:36:53,840
i could just go out every day

4514
02:36:52,239 --> 02:36:56,000
and look at cool stuff and figure out

4515
02:36:53,840 --> 02:36:56,559
what it means i could be all right with

4516
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:59,920
that

4517
02:36:56,559 --> 02:37:04,000
so i'm not heavily driven by the

4518
02:36:59,920 --> 02:37:06,799
um the ego thing as you put it so i

4519
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:08,478
i'm completely the same except instead

4520
02:37:06,799 --> 02:37:11,199
of the pets i would put robots

4521
02:37:08,478 --> 02:37:13,119
but so it's not it's the eureka it's the

4522
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:15,359
exploration of

4523
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:17,680
of the subject that brings you joy and

4524
02:37:15,359 --> 02:37:19,040
fulfillment it's not the ego

4525
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:20,800
well there's there's more to say no i

4526
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:23,120
really don't think it's the ego thing

4527
02:37:20,799 --> 02:37:25,199
um i will say i also have kind of a

4528
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:26,800
secondary passion for robot stuff i've

4529
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:29,520
never made anything

4530
02:37:26,799 --> 02:37:30,559
useful but i do believe i believe i

4531
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:32,800
found my calling

4532
02:37:30,559 --> 02:37:33,680
but if this wasn't my calling my calling

4533
02:37:32,799 --> 02:37:35,679
would have been

4534
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:37,280
inventing stuff i really i really enjoy

4535
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:38,398
that too so i get what you're saying

4536
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:42,000
about the analogy

4537
02:37:38,398 --> 02:37:44,799
quite quite well um as far as the

4538
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,799
martyrdom thing

4539
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:49,200
i i understand the drug you're talking

4540
02:37:47,680 --> 02:37:52,398
about and i've seen it

4541
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:53,680
more than i felt it i do if i'm just to

4542
02:37:52,398 --> 02:37:55,358
be completely candid

4543
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:57,600
and that this question is so good it

4544
02:37:55,359 --> 02:38:01,520
deserves a candid answer

4545
02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:03,840
i do like the fight

4546
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:06,319
right i like fighting against people i

4547
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:09,920
don't respect and i like winning

4548
02:38:06,318 --> 02:38:11,519
but i have no interest in martyrdom

4549
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:13,760
one of the reasons i have no interest in

4550
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:14,560
martyrdom is that i'm having too good a

4551
02:38:13,760 --> 02:38:17,359
time

4552
02:38:14,559 --> 02:38:18,719
right i very much enjoy my life and

4553
02:38:17,359 --> 02:38:21,920
that's such a good answer

4554
02:38:18,719 --> 02:38:24,719
i have a wonderful wife i have

4555
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:25,920
amazing children i live in a lovely

4556
02:38:24,719 --> 02:38:28,239
place

4557
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:29,439
i don't want to exit any quicker than i

4558
02:38:28,239 --> 02:38:32,559
have to

4559
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:34,639
that said i also believe in things and a

4560
02:38:32,559 --> 02:38:35,600
willingness to exit if that's the only

4561
02:38:34,639 --> 02:38:38,079
way

4562
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:39,520
is not exactly inviting martyrdom but it

4563
02:38:38,079 --> 02:38:41,840
is an acceptance that

4564
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:43,680
fighting is dangerous and going up

4565
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:45,520
against powerful forces

4566
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:47,680
means who knows what will come of it

4567
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:50,399
right i don't have the sense that

4568
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:51,920
the thing is out there that used to kill

4569
02:38:50,398 --> 02:38:53,519
inconvenient people i don't think that's

4570
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:54,799
how it's done anymore it's primarily

4571
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:57,040
done through

4572
02:38:54,799 --> 02:38:58,398
destroying them reputationally which is

4573
02:38:57,040 --> 02:39:01,439
not something i

4574
02:38:58,398 --> 02:39:05,599
relish the possibility of but

4575
02:39:01,439 --> 02:39:05,600
there's a difference between a

4576
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:10,318
willingness to face the hazard rather

4577
02:39:08,239 --> 02:39:13,520
than a desire

4578
02:39:10,318 --> 02:39:16,959
to face it because of the thrill right

4579
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:19,840
for me the thrill is in um

4580
02:39:16,959 --> 02:39:20,398
fighting when i'm in the right i've i

4581
02:39:19,840 --> 02:39:22,398
think i

4582
02:39:20,398 --> 02:39:26,079
feel that that is a worthwhile way to

4583
02:39:22,398 --> 02:39:28,879
take what i see as the

4584
02:39:26,079 --> 02:39:29,359
the kind of brutality that is built into

4585
02:39:28,879 --> 02:39:33,119
men

4586
02:39:29,359 --> 02:39:34,479
and to channel it to something useful

4587
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:35,760
right if it is not channeled into

4588
02:39:34,478 --> 02:39:37,279
something useful it will be channeled

4589
02:39:35,760 --> 02:39:38,398
into something else so it damn we'll

4590
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:38,880
better be channeled into something

4591
02:39:38,398 --> 02:39:40,398
useful

4592
02:39:38,879 --> 02:39:42,000
it's not motivated by fame and

4593
02:39:40,398 --> 02:39:45,199
popularity those kinds of things

4594
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:46,398
it's there you know you're just making

4595
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:49,520
me realize that

4596
02:39:46,398 --> 02:39:49,519
enjoying the fight

4597
02:39:50,478 --> 02:39:55,039
fighting the powerful an idea that you

4598
02:39:52,239 --> 02:39:55,039
believe is right

4599
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:58,720
is a kind of um

4600
02:39:58,879 --> 02:40:02,799
it's a kind of optimism for the human

4601
02:40:00,959 --> 02:40:06,478
spirit it's like

4602
02:40:02,799 --> 02:40:06,799
we can win this it's almost like you're

4603
02:40:06,478 --> 02:40:09,679
uh

4604
02:40:06,799 --> 02:40:11,199
turning into action into personal action

4605
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:14,559
this hope for

4606
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:15,600
for humanity by saying like we can win

4607
02:40:14,559 --> 02:40:18,959
this

4608
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:18,960
uh and that makes you feel

4609
02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:25,920
good about like the rest of humanity

4610
02:40:22,799 --> 02:40:28,559
that if there's people like me then

4611
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:30,239
we're going to be okay even if you're

4612
02:40:28,559 --> 02:40:32,079
like your ideas

4613
02:40:30,239 --> 02:40:34,879
might be wrong or not but if you believe

4614
02:40:32,079 --> 02:40:36,079
they're right and you're fighting the

4615
02:40:34,879 --> 02:40:38,959
powerful

4616
02:40:36,079 --> 02:40:41,200
against all odds then we're going to be

4617
02:40:38,959 --> 02:40:41,199
okay

4618
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:45,520
that that to me if i were to project i

4619
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:46,239
mean that because i enjoy the fight as

4620
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:48,720
well

4621
02:40:46,239 --> 02:40:50,000
i think that's the way i that's what

4622
02:40:48,719 --> 02:40:53,599
brings me joy

4623
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:56,639
is it's almost like uh it's optimism

4624
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:57,520
um in action well it's a little

4625
02:40:56,639 --> 02:40:59,599
different for me

4626
02:40:57,520 --> 02:41:01,680
and again i think you know i uh i

4627
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:03,359
recognize you you're familiar

4628
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:05,040
your construction is familiar even if it

4629
02:41:03,359 --> 02:41:08,239
isn't mine right

4630
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:11,200
um for me i actually expect

4631
02:41:08,239 --> 02:41:12,239
us not to be okay and i'm not okay with

4632
02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:15,359
that

4633
02:41:12,239 --> 02:41:16,879
but what's really important if i feel

4634
02:41:15,359 --> 02:41:19,200
like what i've said is i don't know of

4635
02:41:16,879 --> 02:41:21,438
any reason that it's too late

4636
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:22,960
as far as i know we could still save

4637
02:41:21,439 --> 02:41:25,600
humanity and we could get to the fourth

4638
02:41:22,959 --> 02:41:27,438
frontier or something akin to it

4639
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:29,359
but i expect us not to i expect us to

4640
02:41:27,439 --> 02:41:30,800
[ __ ] it up right

4641
02:41:29,359 --> 02:41:32,640
i don't like that thought but i've

4642
02:41:30,799 --> 02:41:35,679
looked into the abyss and i've

4643
02:41:32,639 --> 02:41:36,799
done my calculations and the number of

4644
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:39,439
ways we could not

4645
02:41:36,799 --> 02:41:41,039
succeed are many and the number of ways

4646
02:41:39,439 --> 02:41:43,439
that we could manage to get out of this

4647
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:45,920
very dangerous phase of history is small

4648
02:41:43,439 --> 02:41:46,960
but the thing i don't have to worry

4649
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:50,478
about

4650
02:41:46,959 --> 02:41:53,519
is that i didn't do enough right

4651
02:41:50,478 --> 02:41:57,119
that i was a coward that i

4652
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:58,800
you know prioritized other things

4653
02:41:57,120 --> 02:42:00,399
at the end of the day i think i will be

4654
02:41:58,799 --> 02:42:02,079
able to say to myself and in fact the

4655
02:42:00,398 --> 02:42:04,478
thing that allows me to sleep

4656
02:42:02,079 --> 02:42:05,520
is that when i saw clearly what needed

4657
02:42:04,478 --> 02:42:07,199
to be done

4658
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:08,880
i tried to do it to the extent that it

4659
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:12,640
was in my power and

4660
02:42:08,879 --> 02:42:15,759
you know if we fail as i expect us to

4661
02:42:12,639 --> 02:42:17,439
i can't say well jeez that's on me

4662
02:42:15,760 --> 02:42:18,960
you know and you know frankly i regard

4663
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:19,680
what i just said to you as something

4664
02:42:18,959 --> 02:42:22,639
like

4665
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:23,600
a personality defect right i'm trying to

4666
02:42:22,639 --> 02:42:25,760
free myself

4667
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:27,120
from the sense that this is my fault on

4668
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:29,600
the other hand my guess is that

4669
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:31,920
personality defect is probably

4670
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:32,960
good for humanity right it's a good one

4671
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:35,200
for me to have

4672
02:42:32,959 --> 02:42:36,159
it you know the externalities of it are

4673
02:42:35,200 --> 02:42:38,880
positive

4674
02:42:36,159 --> 02:42:40,559
so i don't feel too bad about it yeah

4675
02:42:38,879 --> 02:42:43,119
it's funny so yeah

4676
02:42:40,559 --> 02:42:44,398
our perspective on the world are

4677
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:46,720
different but they rhyme

4678
02:42:44,398 --> 02:42:47,680
like you said because i i've also looked

4679
02:42:46,719 --> 02:42:51,679
into the abyss

4680
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:54,559
and it kind of smiled nervously back

4681
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:55,840
so uh i have a more optimistic sense

4682
02:42:54,559 --> 02:42:59,199
that we're going to win

4683
02:42:55,840 --> 02:43:00,639
more than likely we're going to be okay

4684
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:02,640
right there with you brother i'm hoping

4685
02:43:00,639 --> 02:43:03,760
you're right i'm expecting me to be

4686
02:43:02,639 --> 02:43:06,159
right

4687
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:07,680
but back to eric because you had a

4688
02:43:06,159 --> 02:43:08,719
wonderful conversation in that

4689
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:11,200
conversation

4690
02:43:08,719 --> 02:43:13,278
he played the big brother role and he

4691
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:15,600
was very happy about it

4692
02:43:13,279 --> 02:43:17,040
he was self-congratulatory about it i

4693
02:43:15,600 --> 02:43:20,800
mean

4694
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:22,160
can you talk to the ways in which eric

4695
02:43:20,799 --> 02:43:25,438
made you a better man

4696
02:43:22,159 --> 02:43:28,559
throughout your life yeah hell yeah

4697
02:43:25,439 --> 02:43:30,880
i mean for one thing you know eric and i

4698
02:43:28,559 --> 02:43:32,639
are interestingly similar in some ways

4699
02:43:30,879 --> 02:43:33,759
and radically different in some other

4700
02:43:32,639 --> 02:43:35,760
ways and it you know

4701
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:37,600
it's often a matter of fascination to

4702
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:39,200
people who know us both because almost

4703
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:40,000
always people meet one of us first and

4704
02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:41,200
they sort of

4705
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:43,120
get used to that thing and then they

4706
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:44,319
meet the other and it throws the model

4707
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:46,960
into chaos

4708
02:43:44,318 --> 02:43:48,879
but you know i had a great advantage

4709
02:43:46,959 --> 02:43:51,039
which is i came second

4710
02:43:48,879 --> 02:43:52,959
right so although it was kind of a pain

4711
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:54,640
in the ass to be born into a world that

4712
02:43:52,959 --> 02:43:55,599
had eric in it because he's a force of

4713
02:43:54,639 --> 02:43:57,920
nature

4714
02:43:55,600 --> 02:43:58,880
right it was also terrifically useful

4715
02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:02,639
because

4716
02:43:58,879 --> 02:44:05,199
a he was a very awesome older brother

4717
02:44:02,639 --> 02:44:06,639
who you know made interesting mistakes

4718
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:08,720
learned from them and conveyed the

4719
02:44:06,639 --> 02:44:12,000
wisdom of what he had discovered

4720
02:44:08,719 --> 02:44:12,639
and that was uh you know i i don't know

4721
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:15,680
who else

4722
02:44:12,639 --> 02:44:19,439
ends up so lucky is to have that kind of

4723
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:22,639
person blazing the trail it also

4724
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:22,960
probably you know my my hypothesis for

4725
02:44:22,639 --> 02:44:25,358
what

4726
02:44:22,959 --> 02:44:27,119
birth order effects are is that they're

4727
02:44:25,359 --> 02:44:30,159
actually adaptive

4728
02:44:27,120 --> 02:44:31,760
right that the reason that a second born

4729
02:44:30,159 --> 02:44:33,279
is different than a firstborn

4730
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:35,439
is that they're not born into a world

4731
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:38,159
with the same niches in it right

4732
02:44:35,439 --> 02:44:39,439
and so the thing about eric is he's been

4733
02:44:38,159 --> 02:44:43,439
completely dominant

4734
02:44:39,439 --> 02:44:45,520
in the realm of fundamental

4735
02:44:43,439 --> 02:44:48,239
thinking right like what he's fascinated

4736
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:50,319
by is the fundamental of fundamentals

4737
02:44:48,239 --> 02:44:51,680
and he's excellent at it which meant

4738
02:44:50,318 --> 02:44:53,439
that i was born into a world where

4739
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:54,239
somebody was becoming excellent in that

4740
02:44:53,439 --> 02:44:56,318
and for me

4741
02:44:54,239 --> 02:44:58,398
to be anywhere near the fundamental of

4742
02:44:56,318 --> 02:44:59,600
fundamentals was going to be pointless

4743
02:44:58,398 --> 02:45:01,439
right i was gonna be playing second

4744
02:44:59,600 --> 02:45:03,680
fiddle forever and i think that that

4745
02:45:01,439 --> 02:45:05,680
actually drove me to the other end

4746
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:08,398
of the continuum between fundamental and

4747
02:45:05,680 --> 02:45:11,520
emergent and so i became fascinated with

4748
02:45:08,398 --> 02:45:14,799
biology and have been since i was

4749
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:15,200
three years old right i think eric drove

4750
02:45:14,799 --> 02:45:18,079
that

4751
02:45:15,200 --> 02:45:18,640
and i have to thank him for it because

4752
02:45:18,079 --> 02:45:22,159
you know

4753
02:45:18,639 --> 02:45:24,318
i mean i never thought of you so eric

4754
02:45:22,159 --> 02:45:26,239
drives towards the fundamental and you

4755
02:45:24,318 --> 02:45:28,559
drive towards the emergent

4756
02:45:26,239 --> 02:45:30,559
the physics and the biology right

4757
02:45:28,559 --> 02:45:32,639
opposite ends of the continuum and

4758
02:45:30,559 --> 02:45:34,079
as eric would be quick to point out if

4759
02:45:32,639 --> 02:45:36,639
he was sitting here

4760
02:45:34,079 --> 02:45:38,478
i treat the emergent layer i seek the

4761
02:45:36,639 --> 02:45:39,119
fundamentals in it which is sort of an

4762
02:45:38,478 --> 02:45:40,959
echo of

4763
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:42,640
eric's style of thinking but applied to

4764
02:45:40,959 --> 02:45:47,278
the very far

4765
02:45:42,639 --> 02:45:50,398
complexity he's uh overpoweringly

4766
02:45:47,279 --> 02:45:53,840
argues for the importance of physics the

4767
02:45:50,398 --> 02:45:53,840
fundamental of the fundamental

4768
02:45:55,279 --> 02:45:59,120
he's not here to defend himself is there

4769
02:45:57,600 --> 02:46:02,960
an argument to be made

4770
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:06,800
against that or biology the emergent

4771
02:46:02,959 --> 02:46:08,239
the study of the thing that emerged when

4772
02:46:06,799 --> 02:46:10,879
the fundamental acts

4773
02:46:08,239 --> 02:46:11,439
at the universal at the cosmic scale and

4774
02:46:10,879 --> 02:46:13,438
builds

4775
02:46:11,439 --> 02:46:14,639
the beautiful thing that is us is much

4776
02:46:13,439 --> 02:46:19,120
more important

4777
02:46:14,639 --> 02:46:20,559
like uh uh psychology biology

4778
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:22,479
the systems that we're actually

4779
02:46:20,559 --> 02:46:24,318
interacting with in this

4780
02:46:22,478 --> 02:46:26,639
human world are much more important to

4781
02:46:24,318 --> 02:46:29,760
understand than

4782
02:46:26,639 --> 02:46:32,079
low-level uh theories

4783
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:33,600
of uh quantum mechanics and general

4784
02:46:32,079 --> 02:46:34,959
relativity

4785
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:36,800
now i can't say that one is more

4786
02:46:34,959 --> 02:46:37,358
important i think there's probably a

4787
02:46:36,799 --> 02:46:39,759
different

4788
02:46:37,359 --> 02:46:40,800
time scale i think understanding the

4789
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:44,239
emergent layer

4790
02:46:40,799 --> 02:46:44,799
is more often useful but the bang for

4791
02:46:44,239 --> 02:46:47,840
the buck

4792
02:46:44,799 --> 02:46:48,318
at the far fundamental layer may be much

4793
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:52,000
greater

4794
02:46:48,318 --> 02:46:54,079
so for example the fourth frontier

4795
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:55,520
i'm pretty sure it's going to have to be

4796
02:46:54,079 --> 02:46:57,120
fusion powered

4797
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:58,800
i don't think anything else will do it

4798
02:46:57,120 --> 02:47:00,399
but once you had fusion power

4799
02:46:58,799 --> 02:47:02,079
assuming we didn't just dump fusion

4800
02:47:00,398 --> 02:47:03,760
power on the market the way we would be

4801
02:47:02,079 --> 02:47:07,279
likely to if it was invented

4802
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:08,478
usefully tomorrow but if we had fusion

4803
02:47:07,279 --> 02:47:10,000
power

4804
02:47:08,478 --> 02:47:11,519
and we had a little bit more wisdom than

4805
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:13,200
we have you could do an

4806
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:15,359
awful lot and that's not going to come

4807
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:18,319
from people like me

4808
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:21,200
who you know look at dynamics can i

4809
02:47:18,318 --> 02:47:24,318
argue against that please

4810
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:26,159
i think the way to uh

4811
02:47:24,318 --> 02:47:28,159
unlock fusion power is through

4812
02:47:26,159 --> 02:47:31,760
artificial intelligence

4813
02:47:28,159 --> 02:47:32,478
is so i think most of the breakthrough

4814
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:33,920
ideas

4815
02:47:32,478 --> 02:47:35,920
in the futures of science will be

4816
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:37,120
developed by ai systems

4817
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:39,040
and i think in order to build

4818
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:40,560
intelligent ai systems

4819
02:47:39,040 --> 02:47:42,399
you have to be a scholar of the

4820
02:47:40,559 --> 02:47:45,439
fundamental of the

4821
02:47:42,398 --> 02:47:48,398
emergent of biology

4822
02:47:45,439 --> 02:47:48,880
of the neuroscience of the way the brain

4823
02:47:48,398 --> 02:47:51,199
works

4824
02:47:48,879 --> 02:47:52,799
of intelligence of consciousness and

4825
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:54,399
those things

4826
02:47:52,799 --> 02:47:56,079
at least directly don't have anything to

4827
02:47:54,398 --> 02:47:58,239
do with physics

4828
02:47:56,079 --> 02:47:59,120
well you're making me a little bit sad

4829
02:47:58,239 --> 02:48:02,239
because my

4830
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:03,760
addiction to the aha moment thing is

4831
02:48:02,239 --> 02:48:06,959
incompatible with

4832
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:08,639
you know uh outsourcing that job like

4833
02:48:06,959 --> 02:48:11,119
outsourcing i don't want to outsource

4834
02:48:08,639 --> 02:48:12,318
that thing to you yeah moment

4835
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:14,160
you know and actually i've seen this

4836
02:48:12,318 --> 02:48:14,639
happen before because some of the people

4837
02:48:14,159 --> 02:48:16,639
who

4838
02:48:14,639 --> 02:48:19,278
uh trained heather and me were

4839
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:23,119
phylogenetic systematists

4840
02:48:19,279 --> 02:48:25,279
arnold kluge in particular and

4841
02:48:23,120 --> 02:48:26,319
the problem with systematics is that to

4842
02:48:25,279 --> 02:48:28,880
do it right

4843
02:48:26,318 --> 02:48:29,519
when your technology is primitive you

4844
02:48:28,879 --> 02:48:32,079
have to be

4845
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:33,040
deeply embedded in the philosophical and

4846
02:48:32,079 --> 02:48:37,200
the logical

4847
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:40,560
right your method has to be based in

4848
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:42,319
the highest level of rigor once you can

4849
02:48:40,559 --> 02:48:44,159
sequence genes

4850
02:48:42,318 --> 02:48:45,600
genes can spit so much data at you that

4851
02:48:44,159 --> 02:48:47,680
you can overwhelm

4852
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:49,920
high quality work with just lots and

4853
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:52,000
lots and lots of automated work

4854
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:53,760
and so in any in some sense there's like

4855
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,879
a generation of phylogenetic

4856
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:56,960
systematists

4857
02:48:54,879 --> 02:48:59,199
who are the last of the greats because

4858
02:48:56,959 --> 02:49:02,239
what's replacing them is sequencers

4859
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:03,040
um so anyway i maybe you're right about

4860
02:49:02,239 --> 02:49:06,239
the ai

4861
02:49:03,040 --> 02:49:08,240
and i guess you said

4862
02:49:06,239 --> 02:49:10,239
i like figuring stuff out is there

4863
02:49:08,239 --> 02:49:12,398
something that you disagree with

4864
02:49:10,239 --> 02:49:14,879
ericon they've been trying to convince

4865
02:49:12,398 --> 02:49:18,478
them you've failed so far

4866
02:49:14,879 --> 02:49:20,799
but uh you will eventually succeed

4867
02:49:18,478 --> 02:49:21,840
you know that is a very long list eric

4868
02:49:20,799 --> 02:49:24,079
and i have

4869
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:25,439
have uh tensions over certain things

4870
02:49:24,079 --> 02:49:27,680
that recur

4871
02:49:25,439 --> 02:49:28,559
all the time and i'm trying to think

4872
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:30,239
what would be

4873
02:49:28,559 --> 02:49:32,159
you know the idea in the space of

4874
02:49:30,239 --> 02:49:35,199
science in the space of philosophy

4875
02:49:32,159 --> 02:49:38,478
politics family

4876
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:40,720
love robots

4877
02:49:38,478 --> 02:49:41,760
well all right let me i'm just going to

4878
02:49:40,719 --> 02:49:44,719
use your

4879
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:46,000
podcast to uh make a bit of cryptic war

4880
02:49:44,719 --> 02:49:49,199
and just say that there are

4881
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:49,520
many places in which i believe that i

4882
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:51,359
have

4883
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:53,760
butted heads with eric over the course

4884
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:54,079
of decades and i have seen him move in

4885
02:49:53,760 --> 02:49:56,719
my

4886
02:49:54,079 --> 02:49:57,439
direction substantially over you've been

4887
02:49:56,719 --> 02:49:59,358
winning

4888
02:49:57,439 --> 02:50:00,559
he might he wouldn't battle here there

4889
02:49:59,359 --> 02:50:03,040
but you've been winning the war

4890
02:50:00,559 --> 02:50:04,799
i would not say that it's quite possible

4891
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:06,479
he could say the same thing about me and

4892
02:50:04,799 --> 02:50:08,159
in fact i know that it's true there are

4893
02:50:06,478 --> 02:50:10,799
places where he's absolutely convinced

4894
02:50:08,159 --> 02:50:11,520
me but in any case i do believe it's at

4895
02:50:10,799 --> 02:50:12,879
least

4896
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:14,479
you know it may not be a totally even

4897
02:50:12,879 --> 02:50:16,000
fight but it's it's more even than some

4898
02:50:14,478 --> 02:50:18,959
will imagine

4899
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:20,840
um but yeah we have um you know there

4900
02:50:18,959 --> 02:50:24,559
are things i say that drive him

4901
02:50:20,840 --> 02:50:26,559
nuts right like when something

4902
02:50:24,559 --> 02:50:28,239
you know like you heard me talk about

4903
02:50:26,559 --> 02:50:32,159
the um

4904
02:50:28,239 --> 02:50:34,398
what was it it was the autopilot

4905
02:50:32,159 --> 02:50:35,200
that seems to be putting a great many

4906
02:50:34,398 --> 02:50:38,398
humans in

4907
02:50:35,200 --> 02:50:40,319
needless medical jeopardy over the covet

4908
02:50:38,398 --> 02:50:43,439
19 pandemic

4909
02:50:40,318 --> 02:50:46,398
and my feeling is we can say this

4910
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:48,079
almost for sure anytime you have the

4911
02:50:46,398 --> 02:50:51,278
appearance of some

4912
02:50:48,079 --> 02:50:53,920
captured gigantic entity that is

4913
02:50:51,279 --> 02:50:55,840
censoring you on youtube and you know

4914
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:58,239
handing down dictates from the who and

4915
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:59,120
all of that it is sure that there will

4916
02:50:58,239 --> 02:51:01,199
be

4917
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:02,399
a certain amount of collusion right

4918
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:04,240
there's going to be some embarrassing

4919
02:51:02,398 --> 02:51:05,920
emails in some places that are going to

4920
02:51:04,239 --> 02:51:07,279
reveal some shocking connections

4921
02:51:05,920 --> 02:51:09,359
and then there's going to be an awful

4922
02:51:07,279 --> 02:51:11,359
lot of emergence

4923
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:12,640
that didn't involve collusion right in

4924
02:51:11,359 --> 02:51:14,399
which people were doing their little

4925
02:51:12,639 --> 02:51:16,639
part of a job and something was emerging

4926
02:51:14,398 --> 02:51:18,959
and you never know what the admixture is

4927
02:51:16,639 --> 02:51:20,478
how much are we looking at actual

4928
02:51:18,959 --> 02:51:21,839
collusion and how much are we looking at

4929
02:51:20,478 --> 02:51:22,959
an emergent process but you should

4930
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:24,159
always walk in

4931
02:51:22,959 --> 02:51:25,839
with the sense that it's going to be a

4932
02:51:24,159 --> 02:51:27,520
ratio and the question is what is the

4933
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:30,559
ratio in this case

4934
02:51:27,520 --> 02:51:32,640
i think this drives eric knots because

4935
02:51:30,559 --> 02:51:34,398
he is very focused on the people i think

4936
02:51:32,639 --> 02:51:34,879
he's focused on the people who have a

4937
02:51:34,398 --> 02:51:38,159
choice

4938
02:51:34,879 --> 02:51:39,519
and make the wrong one and anyway

4939
02:51:38,159 --> 02:51:41,279
he makes a question of the ratio is a

4940
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:44,319
distraction to that

4941
02:51:41,279 --> 02:51:44,960
i think i think he takes it almost as an

4942
02:51:44,318 --> 02:51:48,159
offense

4943
02:51:44,959 --> 02:51:51,358
because it grants cover

4944
02:51:48,159 --> 02:51:54,079
to people who are harming others

4945
02:51:51,359 --> 02:51:54,479
and i think i think it offen offends him

4946
02:51:54,079 --> 02:51:58,478
uh

4947
02:51:54,478 --> 02:52:01,920
morally and if i had to say i would say

4948
02:51:58,478 --> 02:52:04,398
it alters his judgment on the matter

4949
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:05,200
but anyway certainly useful just to

4950
02:52:04,398 --> 02:52:06,799
leave open

4951
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:10,079
the two possibilities and say it's a

4952
02:52:06,799 --> 02:52:10,079
ratio but we don't know which one

4953
02:52:10,398 --> 02:52:14,159
brother to brother do you love the guy

4954
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:16,560
um

4955
02:52:14,159 --> 02:52:18,079
hell yeah hell yeah and you know i'd

4956
02:52:16,559 --> 02:52:20,719
love him if he's just my brother

4957
02:52:18,079 --> 02:52:22,959
but he's also awesome so i love him and

4958
02:52:20,719 --> 02:52:25,358
i love him for who he is

4959
02:52:22,959 --> 02:52:27,358
so let me ask you about uh back to your

4960
02:52:25,359 --> 02:52:31,040
book hunter gatherers guide to

4961
02:52:27,359 --> 02:52:32,640
the 21st century i can't wait

4962
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:34,640
both for the book and the videos you do

4963
02:52:32,639 --> 02:52:36,559
on the book that's really exciting that

4964
02:52:34,639 --> 02:52:38,000
there's like a structured organized way

4965
02:52:36,559 --> 02:52:42,559
to present this

4966
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:44,559
um i kind of uh

4967
02:52:42,559 --> 02:52:46,639
from an evolutionary biology perspective

4968
02:52:44,559 --> 02:52:49,920
a guide for the future

4969
02:52:46,639 --> 02:52:51,119
using our past at its the fundamental

4970
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:54,840
the emergent

4971
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:56,000
way uh to uh present a picture of the

4972
02:52:54,840 --> 02:53:00,559
future

4973
02:52:56,000 --> 02:53:01,920
let me ask you about uh something that

4974
02:53:00,559 --> 02:53:05,600
you know i think about a little bit in

4975
02:53:01,920 --> 02:53:05,600
this modern world which is monogamy

4976
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:14,319
so i personally value monogamy one girl

4977
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:15,520
ride or die there you go ryder no that's

4978
02:53:14,318 --> 02:53:18,639
exactly it

4979
02:53:15,520 --> 02:53:21,840
but that said

4980
02:53:18,639 --> 02:53:23,119
i i don't know what's the right way to

4981
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:26,398
approach this

4982
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:28,479
but from an evolutionary biology

4983
02:53:26,398 --> 02:53:31,519
perspective or from just looking at

4984
02:53:28,478 --> 02:53:33,519
modern society that seems to be an idea

4985
02:53:31,520 --> 02:53:34,560
that's not

4986
02:53:33,520 --> 02:53:37,120
what's the right way to put it

4987
02:53:34,559 --> 02:53:37,119
flourishing

4988
02:53:37,359 --> 02:53:44,000
it is waning it's waning um

4989
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:46,000
so i suppose based on your reaction

4990
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,239
you're also a supporter of monogamy or

4991
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:49,359
the

4992
02:53:46,239 --> 02:53:52,559
you value monogamy are you and i just

4993
02:53:49,359 --> 02:53:56,399
um delusional

4994
02:53:52,559 --> 02:53:58,398
um what can you say about monogamy

4995
02:53:56,398 --> 02:54:00,559
from the context of your book from the

4996
02:53:58,398 --> 02:54:03,199
context of evolutionary biology

4997
02:54:00,559 --> 02:54:04,079
from the context of being human yeah i

4998
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:05,279
can say

4999
02:54:04,079 --> 02:54:07,680
that i fully believe that we are

5000
02:54:05,279 --> 02:54:10,319
actually enlightened and that although

5001
02:54:07,680 --> 02:54:12,239
monogamy is waning that it is not waning

5002
02:54:10,318 --> 02:54:14,159
because there is a superior system

5003
02:54:12,239 --> 02:54:15,359
it is waning for predictable other

5004
02:54:14,159 --> 02:54:18,559
reasons

5005
02:54:15,359 --> 02:54:21,920
so let us just say it is

5006
02:54:18,559 --> 02:54:24,879
there is a lot of pre-trans fallacy here

5007
02:54:21,920 --> 02:54:27,200
where people go through a phase where

5008
02:54:24,879 --> 02:54:28,318
they recognize that actually we know a

5009
02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:31,760
lot about

5010
02:54:28,318 --> 02:54:33,519
the evolution of monogamy

5011
02:54:31,760 --> 02:54:36,639
and we can tell from the fact that

5012
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:38,479
humans are somewhat sexually dimorphic

5013
02:54:36,639 --> 02:54:40,478
that there has been a lot of pollution

5014
02:54:38,478 --> 02:54:43,278
in human history

5015
02:54:40,478 --> 02:54:44,959
and in fact most of human history was

5016
02:54:43,279 --> 02:54:48,319
largely polignous

5017
02:54:44,959 --> 02:54:50,318
but it is also the case that most of the

5018
02:54:48,318 --> 02:54:51,680
people on earth today belong to

5019
02:54:50,318 --> 02:54:54,000
civilizations that are at least

5020
02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:55,040
nominally monogamous and have practiced

5021
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:58,799
monogamy and that's

5022
02:54:55,040 --> 02:55:01,439
not anti-evolutionary what that is

5023
02:54:58,799 --> 02:55:02,478
is part of what i mentioned before where

5024
02:55:01,439 --> 02:55:05,439
human beings

5025
02:55:02,478 --> 02:55:06,079
can swap out their software program and

5026
02:55:05,439 --> 02:55:09,760
different

5027
02:55:06,079 --> 02:55:12,159
mating patterns are favored

5028
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:12,960
in different periods of history so i

5029
02:55:12,159 --> 02:55:15,680
would argue

5030
02:55:12,959 --> 02:55:17,358
that the benefit of monogamy the primary

5031
02:55:15,680 --> 02:55:19,520
one that drives the evolution of

5032
02:55:17,359 --> 02:55:22,880
monogamous patterns in humans

5033
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:24,640
is that it brings all adults into child

5034
02:55:22,879 --> 02:55:26,719
rearing

5035
02:55:24,639 --> 02:55:28,719
now the reason that that matters is

5036
02:55:26,719 --> 02:55:31,039
because human babies are very

5037
02:55:28,719 --> 02:55:32,079
labor in order to raise them properly

5038
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:34,960
having two parents

5039
02:55:32,079 --> 02:55:36,879
is a huge asset and having more than two

5040
02:55:34,959 --> 02:55:40,318
parents having an extended family

5041
02:55:36,879 --> 02:55:43,278
also very important but

5042
02:55:40,318 --> 02:55:45,278
what that means is that for a population

5043
02:55:43,279 --> 02:55:47,840
that is expanding

5044
02:55:45,279 --> 02:55:49,680
a monogamous mating system makes sense

5045
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:51,840
it makes sense because it means that the

5046
02:55:49,680 --> 02:55:55,200
number of offspring that can be raised

5047
02:55:51,840 --> 02:55:56,960
is elevated it's elevated because all

5048
02:55:55,200 --> 02:55:59,200
potential parents are involved in

5049
02:55:56,959 --> 02:56:01,039
parenting whereas if you sideline a

5050
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:02,640
bunch of males by having a polygenous

5051
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:04,319
system in which one male has many

5052
02:56:02,639 --> 02:56:05,199
females which is typically the way that

5053
02:56:04,318 --> 02:56:06,639
works

5054
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:08,079
what you do is you sideline all those

5055
02:56:06,639 --> 02:56:09,840
males which means the total amount of

5056
02:56:08,079 --> 02:56:12,478
parental effort is lower

5057
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:14,079
and the population can't grow so what

5058
02:56:12,478 --> 02:56:17,679
what i'm arguing is that

5059
02:56:14,079 --> 02:56:18,478
you should expect to see populations

5060
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:20,960
that face

5061
02:56:18,478 --> 02:56:21,760
the possibility of expansion endorsed

5062
02:56:20,959 --> 02:56:22,959
monogamy

5063
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:24,559
and at the point that they have reached

5064
02:56:22,959 --> 02:56:26,478
carrying capacity you should expect to

5065
02:56:24,559 --> 02:56:28,559
see polygeny break back out

5066
02:56:26,478 --> 02:56:30,000
and what we are seeing is a kind of

5067
02:56:28,559 --> 02:56:32,639
false sophistication

5068
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:33,600
around polyamory which will end up

5069
02:56:32,639 --> 02:56:36,239
breaking down

5070
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:37,439
into polygony which will not be in the

5071
02:56:36,239 --> 02:56:38,879
interests of most people

5072
02:56:37,439 --> 02:56:40,720
really the only people whose interests

5073
02:56:38,879 --> 02:56:43,039
could be argued to be

5074
02:56:40,719 --> 02:56:44,159
in would be the very small number of

5075
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:47,600
males at the top

5076
02:56:44,159 --> 02:56:48,879
who have many partners and everybody

5077
02:56:47,600 --> 02:56:51,200
else suffers

5078
02:56:48,879 --> 02:56:53,039
is it possible to make the argument if

5079
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:55,920
we focus in on those males

5080
02:56:53,040 --> 02:56:57,520
at the quote unquote top with uh many

5081
02:56:55,920 --> 02:56:59,840
female partners

5082
02:56:57,520 --> 02:57:02,159
is it possible to say that that's a

5083
02:56:59,840 --> 02:57:04,639
sub-optimal life

5084
02:57:02,159 --> 02:57:06,559
that a single partner is the optimal

5085
02:57:04,639 --> 02:57:08,079
life well it depends what you mean i

5086
02:57:06,559 --> 02:57:09,199
have a feeling that you and i wouldn't

5087
02:57:08,079 --> 02:57:12,318
have to go very far

5088
02:57:09,200 --> 02:57:15,040
to figure out that um

5089
02:57:12,318 --> 02:57:16,159
what might be evolutionarily optimal

5090
02:57:15,040 --> 02:57:17,680
doesn't match my

5091
02:57:16,159 --> 02:57:19,359
values as a person then i'm sure it

5092
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:20,000
doesn't match yours either you know try

5093
02:57:19,359 --> 02:57:22,318
to

5094
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:24,318
can we try to dig into the that gap

5095
02:57:22,318 --> 02:57:29,039
between those two sure

5096
02:57:24,318 --> 02:57:32,639
um i mean we can do it very simply uh

5097
02:57:29,040 --> 02:57:35,680
selection might favor your engaging in

5098
02:57:32,639 --> 02:57:38,799
war against a defenseless enemy

5099
02:57:35,680 --> 02:57:40,398
or genocide right

5100
02:57:38,799 --> 02:57:43,119
it's not hard to figure out how that

5101
02:57:40,398 --> 02:57:44,959
might put your genes at advantage

5102
02:57:43,120 --> 02:57:46,640
i don't know about you lex i'm not

5103
02:57:44,959 --> 02:57:48,478
getting involved in no genocide

5104
02:57:46,639 --> 02:57:50,639
it's not going to happen i won't do it i

5105
02:57:48,478 --> 02:57:53,358
will do anything to avoid it so

5106
02:57:50,639 --> 02:57:55,519
some part of me has decided that my

5107
02:57:53,359 --> 02:57:56,479
conscious self and the values that i

5108
02:57:55,520 --> 02:58:00,720
hold

5109
02:57:56,478 --> 02:58:02,719
trump my evolutionary self and

5110
02:58:00,719 --> 02:58:04,000
once you figure out that in some extreme

5111
02:58:02,719 --> 02:58:05,519
case that's true

5112
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:07,520
and then you realize that that means it

5113
02:58:05,520 --> 02:58:08,720
must be possible in many other cases and

5114
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:10,159
you start going through all of the

5115
02:58:08,719 --> 02:58:11,679
things that selection would favor and

5116
02:58:10,159 --> 02:58:12,318
you realize that a fair fraction of the

5117
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:14,079
time

5118
02:58:12,318 --> 02:58:15,439
actually you're not up for this you

5119
02:58:14,079 --> 02:58:18,159
don't want to be

5120
02:58:15,439 --> 02:58:19,840
some robot on a mission that involves

5121
02:58:18,159 --> 02:58:21,200
genocide when necessary

5122
02:58:19,840 --> 02:58:23,359
you want to be your own person and

5123
02:58:21,200 --> 02:58:28,079
accomplish things that you think are

5124
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:30,960
valuable and so among those

5125
02:58:28,079 --> 02:58:32,000
are not advocating you know let's

5126
02:58:30,959 --> 02:58:33,599
suppose you're in a position

5127
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:35,760
to be one of those males at the top of a

5128
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:37,200
politicianist system we both know why

5129
02:58:35,760 --> 02:58:40,719
that would be rewarding

5130
02:58:37,200 --> 02:58:43,600
right but we also both recognize we yeah

5131
02:58:40,719 --> 02:58:45,278
sure lots of sex yeah okay what else

5132
02:58:43,600 --> 02:58:50,159
lots of sex and lots of variety

5133
02:58:45,279 --> 02:58:52,560
right so look every red-blooded american

5134
02:58:50,159 --> 02:58:53,359
russian male can understand why that's

5135
02:58:52,559 --> 02:58:56,559
appealing

5136
02:58:53,359 --> 02:58:57,760
right on the other hand it is up against

5137
02:58:56,559 --> 02:59:01,119
an alternative

5138
02:58:57,760 --> 02:59:05,040
which is having a partner with whom

5139
02:59:01,120 --> 02:59:08,160
one is bonded especially closely

5140
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:10,479
right right and so a love

5141
02:59:08,159 --> 02:59:11,439
right well you know i don't wanna i

5142
02:59:10,478 --> 02:59:14,799
don't wanna

5143
02:59:11,439 --> 02:59:16,639
uh strawman the polygamy position

5144
02:59:14,799 --> 02:59:18,159
obviously polygamy is complex and

5145
02:59:16,639 --> 02:59:21,840
there's nothing that stops

5146
02:59:18,159 --> 02:59:24,079
a man presumably from loving multiple

5147
02:59:21,840 --> 02:59:25,760
partners and from them loving him back

5148
02:59:24,079 --> 02:59:27,439
but in terms of you know if love is your

5149
02:59:25,760 --> 02:59:28,239
thing there's a question about okay what

5150
02:59:27,439 --> 02:59:30,398
is the

5151
02:59:28,239 --> 02:59:31,840
quality of love if it is divided over

5152
02:59:30,398 --> 02:59:35,119
multiple partners

5153
02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:35,760
right and what is the net consequence

5154
02:59:35,120 --> 02:59:38,479
for love

5155
02:59:35,760 --> 02:59:40,719
in a society when multiple people will

5156
02:59:38,478 --> 02:59:44,398
be frozen out for every individual

5157
02:59:40,719 --> 02:59:47,840
male in this case who has it and

5158
02:59:44,398 --> 02:59:49,840
what i would argue is and you know

5159
02:59:47,840 --> 02:59:51,600
this is weird to even talk about but

5160
02:59:49,840 --> 02:59:52,880
this is partially me just talking from

5161
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:54,800
personal experience

5162
02:59:52,879 --> 02:59:57,519
i think there actually is a monogamy

5163
02:59:54,799 --> 03:00:01,358
program in us and it's not automatic

5164
02:59:57,520 --> 03:00:04,479
but if you take it seriously

5165
03:00:01,359 --> 03:00:06,000
you can find it and frankly

5166
03:00:04,478 --> 03:00:07,599
marriage and it doesn't have to be

5167
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,799
marriage but whatever it is that results

5168
03:00:07,600 --> 03:00:11,120
in a lifelong

5169
03:00:08,799 --> 03:00:11,840
bond with a partner has gotten a very

5170
03:00:11,120 --> 03:00:14,240
bad rap

5171
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:15,840
you know it's the butt of too many jokes

5172
03:00:14,239 --> 03:00:19,600
but the truth is

5173
03:00:15,840 --> 03:00:21,600
it's hugely rewarding it's not easy

5174
03:00:19,600 --> 03:00:22,800
but if you know that you're looking for

5175
03:00:21,600 --> 03:00:24,079
something right if you know that the

5176
03:00:22,799 --> 03:00:25,840
objective actually exists

5177
03:00:24,079 --> 03:00:27,680
and it's not some utopian fantasy that

5178
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:28,398
can't be found if you know that there's

5179
03:00:27,680 --> 03:00:31,040
some

5180
03:00:28,398 --> 03:00:32,398
real world you know warts and all

5181
03:00:31,040 --> 03:00:34,160
version of it

5182
03:00:32,398 --> 03:00:35,680
then you might actually think hey that

5183
03:00:34,159 --> 03:00:37,119
is something i want and you might pursue

5184
03:00:35,680 --> 03:00:38,000
it and my guess is you'd be very happy

5185
03:00:37,120 --> 03:00:40,160
when you find it

5186
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:41,760
yeah i think there is uh getting to the

5187
03:00:40,159 --> 03:00:43,279
fundamentals of the emergence i feel

5188
03:00:41,760 --> 03:00:44,478
like there is some kind of physics of

5189
03:00:43,279 --> 03:00:46,960
love so one

5190
03:00:44,478 --> 03:00:50,639
when there's a conservation thing going

5191
03:00:46,959 --> 03:00:52,559
on so if you have like many partners

5192
03:00:50,639 --> 03:00:54,000
yeah in theory you should be able to

5193
03:00:52,559 --> 03:00:55,840
love all of them deeply

5194
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:57,680
but it seems like in reality that love

5195
03:00:55,840 --> 03:01:00,398
gets split

5196
03:00:57,680 --> 03:01:02,880
yep now there's another law that's

5197
03:01:00,398 --> 03:01:04,559
interesting in terms of monogamy

5198
03:01:02,879 --> 03:01:06,879
i don't know if it's the physics level

5199
03:01:04,559 --> 03:01:10,159
but if you are

5200
03:01:06,879 --> 03:01:14,079
in a monogamous relationship by choice

5201
03:01:10,159 --> 03:01:17,279
and almost as in slight rebellion

5202
03:01:14,079 --> 03:01:19,279
to social norms that's much more

5203
03:01:17,279 --> 03:01:21,920
powerful like if you choose

5204
03:01:19,279 --> 03:01:22,640
that one partnership that's also more

5205
03:01:21,920 --> 03:01:24,478
powerful

5206
03:01:22,639 --> 03:01:26,239
if if like everybody's in the monogamy

5207
03:01:24,478 --> 03:01:27,760
there's this pressure to be married in

5208
03:01:26,239 --> 03:01:29,520
this pressure of society

5209
03:01:27,760 --> 03:01:32,079
that's different because that's almost

5210
03:01:29,520 --> 03:01:34,319
like a constraint on your freedom

5211
03:01:32,079 --> 03:01:35,760
that is enforced by something other than

5212
03:01:34,318 --> 03:01:39,039
your own ideals it's

5213
03:01:35,760 --> 03:01:41,120
by by somebody else when you yourself

5214
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:42,479
choose to i guess create these

5215
03:01:41,120 --> 03:01:45,520
constraints

5216
03:01:42,478 --> 03:01:47,438
that enriches that love so there's some

5217
03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:50,000
kind of love function

5218
03:01:47,439 --> 03:01:51,200
like e equals mc squared but for love

5219
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:53,680
that i feel like

5220
03:01:51,200 --> 03:01:54,880
if you have less partners and it's done

5221
03:01:53,680 --> 03:01:57,680
by choice

5222
03:01:54,879 --> 03:01:58,559
that can maximize that and that love can

5223
03:01:57,680 --> 03:02:01,920
transcend

5224
03:01:58,559 --> 03:02:03,439
the biology transcend the evolutionary

5225
03:02:01,920 --> 03:02:06,159
biology forces

5226
03:02:03,439 --> 03:02:07,840
that have to do much more with survival

5227
03:02:06,159 --> 03:02:10,398
and all those kinds of things

5228
03:02:07,840 --> 03:02:11,760
it can transcend to take us to to a

5229
03:02:10,398 --> 03:02:13,278
richer experience

5230
03:02:11,760 --> 03:02:15,359
which we have the luxury of having

5231
03:02:13,279 --> 03:02:18,399
exploring of happiness

5232
03:02:15,359 --> 03:02:19,359
of of joy of fulfillment all those kinds

5233
03:02:18,398 --> 03:02:22,478
of things

5234
03:02:19,359 --> 03:02:23,120
totally agree with us and there's no

5235
03:02:22,478 --> 03:02:25,599
question

5236
03:02:23,120 --> 03:02:26,720
that by choice when there are other

5237
03:02:25,600 --> 03:02:28,880
choices

5238
03:02:26,719 --> 03:02:30,639
imbues it with meaning that it might not

5239
03:02:28,879 --> 03:02:33,679
otherwise have

5240
03:02:30,639 --> 03:02:36,559
i would also say you know i'm

5241
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:38,880
i'm really struck by and i have a hard

5242
03:02:36,559 --> 03:02:42,639
time not feeling

5243
03:02:38,879 --> 03:02:45,039
terrible sadness over what

5244
03:02:42,639 --> 03:02:46,799
younger people are coming to think about

5245
03:02:45,040 --> 03:02:48,960
this topic

5246
03:02:46,799 --> 03:02:51,358
i think they're missing something so

5247
03:02:48,959 --> 03:02:52,799
important and so hard to phrase

5248
03:02:51,359 --> 03:02:54,800
that and they don't even know that

5249
03:02:52,799 --> 03:02:55,840
they're missing it they might know that

5250
03:02:54,799 --> 03:02:57,840
they're unhappy

5251
03:02:55,840 --> 03:02:58,880
but they don't understand what it is

5252
03:02:57,840 --> 03:03:00,719
they're even looking for because

5253
03:02:58,879 --> 03:03:02,559
nobody's really been honest with them

5254
03:03:00,719 --> 03:03:03,760
about what their choices are and i have

5255
03:03:02,559 --> 03:03:05,680
to say

5256
03:03:03,760 --> 03:03:07,439
if i was a young person or if i was

5257
03:03:05,680 --> 03:03:07,840
advising a young person which i used to

5258
03:03:07,439 --> 03:03:09,439
do

5259
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:11,840
again a million years ago when i was a

5260
03:03:09,439 --> 03:03:13,680
college professor four years ago

5261
03:03:11,840 --> 03:03:15,120
but i used to you know talk to students

5262
03:03:13,680 --> 03:03:16,720
i knew my students really well and they

5263
03:03:15,120 --> 03:03:18,160
would ask questions about this and they

5264
03:03:16,719 --> 03:03:19,920
were always curious because heather and

5265
03:03:18,159 --> 03:03:21,840
i seemed to have a good relationship and

5266
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:24,799
many of them knew both of us

5267
03:03:21,840 --> 03:03:25,279
so they would talk to us about this if i

5268
03:03:24,799 --> 03:03:29,119
was

5269
03:03:25,279 --> 03:03:31,439
advising somebody i would say do not

5270
03:03:29,120 --> 03:03:32,640
bypass the possibility that what you are

5271
03:03:31,439 --> 03:03:36,318
supposed to do

5272
03:03:32,639 --> 03:03:38,398
is find somebody worthy

5273
03:03:36,318 --> 03:03:39,920
somebody who can handle it somebody who

5274
03:03:38,398 --> 03:03:41,760
you are compatible with and that you

5275
03:03:39,920 --> 03:03:44,478
don't have to be perfectly compatible

5276
03:03:41,760 --> 03:03:46,239
it's not about dating until you find the

5277
03:03:44,478 --> 03:03:49,438
one it's about finding somebody

5278
03:03:46,239 --> 03:03:51,680
whose underlying values and viewpoint

5279
03:03:49,439 --> 03:03:53,840
are complementary to yours sufficient

5280
03:03:51,680 --> 03:03:58,479
that you fall in love

5281
03:03:53,840 --> 03:04:00,559
if you find that person opt out together

5282
03:03:58,478 --> 03:04:02,239
get out of this damn system that's

5283
03:04:00,559 --> 03:04:04,639
telling you what's sophisticated to

5284
03:04:02,239 --> 03:04:07,920
think about love and romance and sex

5285
03:04:04,639 --> 03:04:08,559
ignore it together right that's the key

5286
03:04:07,920 --> 03:04:11,279
and

5287
03:04:08,559 --> 03:04:13,840
i believe you'll end up laughing in the

5288
03:04:11,279 --> 03:04:16,720
end if you do it you'll discover

5289
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:17,359
wow that's a hellscape that i opted out

5290
03:04:16,719 --> 03:04:20,639
of

5291
03:04:17,359 --> 03:04:24,239
and this thing i opted into complicated

5292
03:04:20,639 --> 03:04:24,478
difficult worth it nothing that's worth

5293
03:04:24,239 --> 03:04:26,559
it

5294
03:04:24,478 --> 03:04:28,799
is ever not difficult so we should we

5295
03:04:26,559 --> 03:04:30,879
should even just skip the whole

5296
03:04:28,799 --> 03:04:32,799
statement about difficult yeah all right

5297
03:04:30,879 --> 03:04:33,679
i just i want to be honest it's not like

5298
03:04:32,799 --> 03:04:35,519
oh it's

5299
03:04:33,680 --> 03:04:36,880
you know it's non-stop joy no it's

5300
03:04:35,520 --> 03:04:40,000
freaking complex

5301
03:04:36,879 --> 03:04:40,959
but um but worth it no question in my

5302
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:43,120
mind

5303
03:04:40,959 --> 03:04:45,278
is there advice outside of love that you

5304
03:04:43,120 --> 03:04:49,359
can give to young people

5305
03:04:45,279 --> 03:04:51,120
you were a million years ago a professor

5306
03:04:49,359 --> 03:04:53,600
is there advice you can give to young

5307
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:56,640
people high schoolers college students

5308
03:04:53,600 --> 03:04:58,559
uh about career about life

5309
03:04:56,639 --> 03:04:59,599
yeah but it's not they're not gonna like

5310
03:04:58,559 --> 03:05:00,559
it because it's not easy to

5311
03:04:59,600 --> 03:05:02,159
operationalize

5312
03:05:00,559 --> 03:05:03,680
so and this was a problem when i was a

5313
03:05:02,159 --> 03:05:04,000
college professor too people would ask

5314
03:05:03,680 --> 03:05:05,200
me

5315
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:07,200
what they should do should they go to

5316
03:05:05,200 --> 03:05:08,240
graduate school i had almost nothing

5317
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:12,479
useful to say

5318
03:05:08,239 --> 03:05:14,478
because the job market and the market of

5319
03:05:12,478 --> 03:05:16,840
you know pre-job training and all of

5320
03:05:14,478 --> 03:05:19,119
that these things are all

5321
03:05:16,840 --> 03:05:21,760
so distorted

5322
03:05:19,120 --> 03:05:23,120
and corrupt that i didn't want to point

5323
03:05:21,760 --> 03:05:24,719
anybody to anything

5324
03:05:23,120 --> 03:05:26,479
right because it's all broken and i

5325
03:05:24,719 --> 03:05:28,559
would tell them that

5326
03:05:26,478 --> 03:05:29,760
but i would say that results in a kind

5327
03:05:28,559 --> 03:05:32,000
of uh

5328
03:05:29,760 --> 03:05:33,279
meta-level advice that i do think is

5329
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:36,079
useful

5330
03:05:33,279 --> 03:05:38,560
you don't know what's coming you don't

5331
03:05:36,079 --> 03:05:40,879
know where the opportunities will be

5332
03:05:38,559 --> 03:05:41,680
you should invest in tools rather than

5333
03:05:40,879 --> 03:05:44,000
knowledge

5334
03:05:41,680 --> 03:05:46,079
right to the extent that you can do

5335
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:48,398
things you can repurpose that no matter

5336
03:05:46,079 --> 03:05:50,000
what the future brings to the extent

5337
03:05:48,398 --> 03:05:52,318
that you know if you

5338
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:53,840
as a robot guy right you've got the

5339
03:05:52,318 --> 03:05:57,278
skills of a robot guy

5340
03:05:53,840 --> 03:05:58,398
now if civilization failed and the stuff

5341
03:05:57,279 --> 03:06:01,120
of robot building

5342
03:05:58,398 --> 03:06:03,199
disappeared with it you'd still have the

5343
03:06:01,120 --> 03:06:05,200
mind of a robot guy and the mind of a

5344
03:06:03,200 --> 03:06:06,560
robot guy can re-tool around all kinds

5345
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:09,680
of things whether you're

5346
03:06:06,559 --> 03:06:12,079
you know forced to work with uh you know

5347
03:06:09,680 --> 03:06:13,120
you know fibers that are made into ropes

5348
03:06:12,079 --> 03:06:14,959
right

5349
03:06:13,120 --> 03:06:16,960
your mechanical mind would be useful in

5350
03:06:14,959 --> 03:06:17,599
all kinds of places so invest in tools

5351
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:20,559
like that

5352
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:20,880
that can be easily repurposed and invest

5353
03:06:20,559 --> 03:06:24,239
in

5354
03:06:20,879 --> 03:06:28,879
combinations of tools right if

5355
03:06:24,239 --> 03:06:30,318
civilization keeps limping along

5356
03:06:28,879 --> 03:06:32,079
you're going to be up against all sorts

5357
03:06:30,318 --> 03:06:32,959
of people who have studied the things

5358
03:06:32,079 --> 03:06:34,318
that you studied

5359
03:06:32,959 --> 03:06:36,000
right if you think hey computer

5360
03:06:34,318 --> 03:06:37,680
programming is really really cool

5361
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:39,279
and you pick up computer programming

5362
03:06:37,680 --> 03:06:41,040
guess what you just entered a

5363
03:06:39,279 --> 03:06:42,399
large group of people who have that

5364
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:43,040
skill and many of them will be better

5365
03:06:42,398 --> 03:06:45,920
than you

5366
03:06:43,040 --> 03:06:46,960
almost certainly on the other hand if

5367
03:06:45,920 --> 03:06:49,040
you combine

5368
03:06:46,959 --> 03:06:50,719
that with something else that's very

5369
03:06:49,040 --> 03:06:52,960
rarely combined with it

5370
03:06:50,719 --> 03:06:54,000
if you have i don't know if it's

5371
03:06:52,959 --> 03:06:56,159
carpentry

5372
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:57,760
and computer programming if you take

5373
03:06:56,159 --> 03:07:00,559
combinations of things

5374
03:06:57,760 --> 03:07:02,880
that are even if they're both common but

5375
03:07:00,559 --> 03:07:04,639
they're not commonly found together

5376
03:07:02,879 --> 03:07:06,000
then those combinations create a

5377
03:07:04,639 --> 03:07:07,920
rarefied space

5378
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:10,239
where you inhabit it and even if the

5379
03:07:07,920 --> 03:07:12,239
things don't even really touch

5380
03:07:10,239 --> 03:07:13,840
but nonetheless they create a mind in

5381
03:07:12,239 --> 03:07:15,840
which the two things are live and you

5382
03:07:13,840 --> 03:07:17,680
can move back and forth between them

5383
03:07:15,840 --> 03:07:19,359
and you know step out of your own

5384
03:07:17,680 --> 03:07:20,318
perspective by moving from one to the

5385
03:07:19,359 --> 03:07:22,720
other

5386
03:07:20,318 --> 03:07:24,318
that will increase what you can see and

5387
03:07:22,719 --> 03:07:26,318
the quality of your tools

5388
03:07:24,318 --> 03:07:27,278
and so anyway that isn't useful advice

5389
03:07:26,318 --> 03:07:28,959
it doesn't tell you whether you should

5390
03:07:27,279 --> 03:07:31,520
go to graduate school or not

5391
03:07:28,959 --> 03:07:33,599
but it does tell you the one thing we

5392
03:07:31,520 --> 03:07:35,359
can say for certain about the future is

5393
03:07:33,600 --> 03:07:36,000
that it's uncertain and so prepare for

5394
03:07:35,359 --> 03:07:38,079
it

5395
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:40,239
and like you said there's cool things to

5396
03:07:38,079 --> 03:07:43,439
be discovered in the intersection of

5397
03:07:40,239 --> 03:07:45,359
uh fields and ideas and i would

5398
03:07:43,439 --> 03:07:46,880
look at grad school that way actually if

5399
03:07:45,359 --> 03:07:50,000
you do go

5400
03:07:46,879 --> 03:07:52,639
or i see

5401
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:53,680
i mean this is such a like every course

5402
03:07:52,639 --> 03:07:56,398
in grad school

5403
03:07:53,680 --> 03:07:56,960
undergrad too was like this little

5404
03:07:56,398 --> 03:07:58,398
journey

5405
03:07:56,959 --> 03:08:00,000
that you're on that explores a

5406
03:07:58,398 --> 03:08:02,079
particular field

5407
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:03,920
and it's not immediately obvious how

5408
03:08:02,079 --> 03:08:07,439
useful it is

5409
03:08:03,920 --> 03:08:09,359
but it allows you to to discover

5410
03:08:07,439 --> 03:08:11,920
intersections between that thing

5411
03:08:09,359 --> 03:08:14,479
and some other thing so you you're

5412
03:08:11,920 --> 03:08:17,200
bringing to the table this

5413
03:08:14,478 --> 03:08:18,719
these pieces of knowledge some of which

5414
03:08:17,200 --> 03:08:21,600
when intersected might

5415
03:08:18,719 --> 03:08:23,438
create a niche that's completely novel

5416
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:25,200
unique and will bring you joy

5417
03:08:23,439 --> 03:08:27,120
i have that i mean i took a huge number

5418
03:08:25,200 --> 03:08:28,000
of courses in uh theoretical computer

5419
03:08:27,120 --> 03:08:30,160
science

5420
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:32,559
most of them seem useless but they

5421
03:08:30,159 --> 03:08:35,279
totally changed the way i see the world

5422
03:08:32,559 --> 03:08:37,359
in ways that are i'm not prepared or is

5423
03:08:35,279 --> 03:08:40,720
a little bit difficult to kind of make

5424
03:08:37,359 --> 03:08:40,720
explicit but

5425
03:08:40,879 --> 03:08:47,119
taken together they've allowed me to see

5426
03:08:44,799 --> 03:08:48,239
for example the world of robotics

5427
03:08:47,120 --> 03:08:50,319
totally different

5428
03:08:48,239 --> 03:08:52,879
and different from many of my colleagues

5429
03:08:50,318 --> 03:08:54,639
and friends and so on and i think

5430
03:08:52,879 --> 03:08:57,438
that it's a good way to see if you go to

5431
03:08:54,639 --> 03:08:57,439
grad school was

5432
03:08:57,520 --> 03:09:02,399
as a opportunity to explore

5433
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:04,639
intersections of fields even if the

5434
03:09:02,398 --> 03:09:06,719
individual fields seem useless

5435
03:09:04,639 --> 03:09:07,920
yeah and useless doesn't mean useless

5436
03:09:06,719 --> 03:09:10,000
right useless means

5437
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:12,079
not directly applicable but directly a

5438
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:13,520
good useless course can be the best one

5439
03:09:12,079 --> 03:09:17,120
you ever took

5440
03:09:13,520 --> 03:09:18,079
um yeah i took uh james joyce a course

5441
03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:21,120
on james joyce

5442
03:09:18,079 --> 03:09:24,559
and that was truly useless

5443
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:27,040
well i took uh i took immunobiology

5444
03:09:24,559 --> 03:09:27,760
in the medical school when i was at penn

5445
03:09:27,040 --> 03:09:30,080
as

5446
03:09:27,760 --> 03:09:31,520
uh i guess i would have been a freshman

5447
03:09:30,079 --> 03:09:32,959
or a sophomore i wasn't supposed to be

5448
03:09:31,520 --> 03:09:35,760
in this class

5449
03:09:32,959 --> 03:09:36,318
it blew my goddamn mind and it still

5450
03:09:35,760 --> 03:09:38,800
does

5451
03:09:36,318 --> 03:09:40,079
right i mean we had this i don't even

5452
03:09:38,799 --> 03:09:41,920
know who it was but

5453
03:09:40,079 --> 03:09:43,120
we had this great professor who was like

5454
03:09:41,920 --> 03:09:44,000
highly placed in the world of

5455
03:09:43,120 --> 03:09:45,040
immunobiology

5456
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:47,879
you know the course is called

5457
03:09:45,040 --> 03:09:50,239
immunobiology not immunology

5458
03:09:47,879 --> 03:09:51,679
immunobiology it had the right focus and

5459
03:09:50,238 --> 03:09:54,719
as i recall it

5460
03:09:51,680 --> 03:09:55,359
the professor stood sideways to the

5461
03:09:54,719 --> 03:09:57,760
chalkboard

5462
03:09:55,359 --> 03:10:00,159
staring off into space literally

5463
03:09:57,760 --> 03:10:02,398
stroking his beard with this

5464
03:10:00,159 --> 03:10:04,159
bemused look on his face through the

5465
03:10:02,398 --> 03:10:05,358
entire lecture

5466
03:10:04,159 --> 03:10:06,799
and you know you had all these medical

5467
03:10:05,359 --> 03:10:08,079
students who were so furiously writing

5468
03:10:06,799 --> 03:10:09,599
notes that i don't even think they were

5469
03:10:08,079 --> 03:10:10,639
noticing the person delivering this

5470
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:13,200
thing but

5471
03:10:10,639 --> 03:10:14,159
you know i got what this guy was smiling

5472
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:15,920
about it was like

5473
03:10:14,159 --> 03:10:17,600
so what he was describing you know

5474
03:10:15,920 --> 03:10:19,600
adaptive immunity is so

5475
03:10:17,600 --> 03:10:21,439
marvelous right that it was like almost

5476
03:10:19,600 --> 03:10:22,800
a privilege to even be saying it to a

5477
03:10:21,439 --> 03:10:23,840
room full of people who were listening

5478
03:10:22,799 --> 03:10:25,358
you know

5479
03:10:23,840 --> 03:10:27,359
but anyway yeah i took that course and

5480
03:10:25,359 --> 03:10:30,159
you know lo and behold

5481
03:10:27,359 --> 03:10:31,279
that's gonna be useful well yeah

5482
03:10:30,159 --> 03:10:33,119
suddenly it's

5483
03:10:31,279 --> 03:10:35,040
front and center and wow am i glad i

5484
03:10:33,120 --> 03:10:36,960
took it but um

5485
03:10:35,040 --> 03:10:38,800
anyway yeah useless courses are great

5486
03:10:36,959 --> 03:10:40,238
and actually eric

5487
03:10:38,799 --> 03:10:42,000
gave me one of the greater pieces of

5488
03:10:40,238 --> 03:10:43,279
advice at least for college than

5489
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:46,000
anyone's ever given

5490
03:10:43,279 --> 03:10:47,040
which was don't worry about the prereqs

5491
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:49,520
take it anyway

5492
03:10:47,040 --> 03:10:51,200
right but now i don't even know if kids

5493
03:10:49,520 --> 03:10:53,120
can do this now because the prereqs are

5494
03:10:51,200 --> 03:10:56,239
now enforced by a computer

5495
03:10:53,120 --> 03:10:57,920
but back in the day if you didn't

5496
03:10:56,238 --> 03:10:59,199
mention that you didn't have the prereqs

5497
03:10:57,920 --> 03:11:00,799
nobody stopped you from taking the

5498
03:10:59,200 --> 03:11:02,159
course and what he told me which i

5499
03:11:00,799 --> 03:11:04,879
didn't know was

5500
03:11:02,159 --> 03:11:06,159
that often the advanced courses are

5501
03:11:04,879 --> 03:11:09,199
easier in some way

5502
03:11:06,159 --> 03:11:11,920
the materials complex but you know

5503
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:13,520
you know it's not like intro bio where

5504
03:11:11,920 --> 03:11:14,079
you're learning a thousand things at

5505
03:11:13,520 --> 03:11:16,079
once

5506
03:11:14,079 --> 03:11:17,760
right it's like focused on something so

5507
03:11:16,079 --> 03:11:18,719
if you dedicate yourself you can you can

5508
03:11:17,760 --> 03:11:20,719
pull it off

5509
03:11:18,719 --> 03:11:22,879
yeah stay with an idea for many weeks at

5510
03:11:20,719 --> 03:11:25,599
a time and it's ultimately rewarding and

5511
03:11:22,879 --> 03:11:29,519
not as difficult as it looks

5512
03:11:25,600 --> 03:11:29,520
can ask you a ridiculous question please

5513
03:11:29,840 --> 03:11:33,200
what do you think is the meaning of life

5514
03:11:34,840 --> 03:11:39,840
well i i feel terrible having to give

5515
03:11:38,159 --> 03:11:41,520
you the answer i realize you asked the

5516
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:42,719
question but if i tell you you're gonna

5517
03:11:41,520 --> 03:11:44,800
again

5518
03:11:42,719 --> 03:11:46,000
feel bad i don't want to do that but

5519
03:11:44,799 --> 03:11:47,519
look there's two

5520
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:49,279
there can be a disappointment it's no

5521
03:11:47,520 --> 03:11:51,359
it's gonna be a horror

5522
03:11:49,279 --> 03:11:52,560
right because we actually know the

5523
03:11:51,359 --> 03:11:56,159
answer the question

5524
03:11:52,559 --> 03:11:58,559
oh no it's completely meaningless

5525
03:11:56,159 --> 03:11:59,439
there is nothing that we can do that

5526
03:11:58,559 --> 03:12:00,799
escapes

5527
03:11:59,439 --> 03:12:02,639
the heat death of the universe or

5528
03:12:00,799 --> 03:12:04,318
whatever it is that happens at the end

5529
03:12:02,639 --> 03:12:06,079
and we're not going to make it there

5530
03:12:04,318 --> 03:12:08,079
anyway but even if you

5531
03:12:06,079 --> 03:12:09,279
were optimistic about our ability to

5532
03:12:08,079 --> 03:12:13,279
escape every

5533
03:12:09,279 --> 03:12:14,960
existential hazard indefinitely

5534
03:12:13,279 --> 03:12:17,040
ultimately it's off or not and we know

5535
03:12:14,959 --> 03:12:20,559
it right

5536
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:22,560
that said once you stare into that abyss

5537
03:12:20,559 --> 03:12:23,760
and then it stares back and laughs or

5538
03:12:22,559 --> 03:12:26,639
whatever happens

5539
03:12:23,760 --> 03:12:27,040
right then the question is okay given

5540
03:12:26,639 --> 03:12:30,238
that

5541
03:12:27,040 --> 03:12:31,920
can i relax a little bit right and

5542
03:12:30,238 --> 03:12:33,279
figure out well what would make sense if

5543
03:12:31,920 --> 03:12:35,680
that were true

5544
03:12:33,279 --> 03:12:37,040
right and i think there's something very

5545
03:12:35,680 --> 03:12:38,960
clear to me

5546
03:12:37,040 --> 03:12:40,479
i think if you do all of the you know if

5547
03:12:38,959 --> 03:12:43,839
i just take the values that i'm

5548
03:12:40,478 --> 03:12:45,438
sure we share and extrapolate from them

5549
03:12:43,840 --> 03:12:48,398
i think the following thing is actually

5550
03:12:45,439 --> 03:12:51,520
a moral imperative

5551
03:12:48,398 --> 03:12:54,159
being a human and having opportunity

5552
03:12:51,520 --> 03:12:55,359
is absolutely [ __ ] awesome right a

5553
03:12:54,159 --> 03:12:56,639
lot of people don't make use of the

5554
03:12:55,359 --> 03:12:57,680
opportunity and a lot of people don't

5555
03:12:56,639 --> 03:12:59,278
have opportunity

5556
03:12:57,680 --> 03:13:00,720
right they get to be human but they're

5557
03:12:59,279 --> 03:13:02,399
too constrained by

5558
03:13:00,719 --> 03:13:03,760
keeping a roof over their heads to

5559
03:13:02,398 --> 03:13:07,519
really be free

5560
03:13:03,760 --> 03:13:08,719
but being a free human is fantastic and

5561
03:13:07,520 --> 03:13:10,720
being a free human

5562
03:13:08,719 --> 03:13:11,840
on this beautiful planet crippled as it

5563
03:13:10,719 --> 03:13:14,959
may be

5564
03:13:11,840 --> 03:13:16,960
is unparalleled i mean what could be

5565
03:13:14,959 --> 03:13:20,398
better how lucky are we that we get that

5566
03:13:16,959 --> 03:13:22,879
right so if that's true that it is

5567
03:13:20,398 --> 03:13:25,358
awesome to be human and to be free

5568
03:13:22,879 --> 03:13:26,879
then surely it is our obligation to

5569
03:13:25,359 --> 03:13:29,920
deliver that opportunity to as

5570
03:13:26,879 --> 03:13:30,639
many people as we can and how do you do

5571
03:13:29,920 --> 03:13:33,680
that

5572
03:13:30,639 --> 03:13:34,478
well i think i know what job one is job

5573
03:13:33,680 --> 03:13:37,120
one is

5574
03:13:34,478 --> 03:13:38,959
we have to get sustainable the way to

5575
03:13:37,120 --> 03:13:41,600
get the maximum number of humans

5576
03:13:38,959 --> 03:13:42,639
to have that opportunity to be both here

5577
03:13:41,600 --> 03:13:44,800
and free

5578
03:13:42,639 --> 03:13:46,639
is to make sure that there isn't a limit

5579
03:13:44,799 --> 03:13:48,639
on how long we can keep doing this

5580
03:13:46,639 --> 03:13:50,318
that effectively requires us to reach

5581
03:13:48,639 --> 03:13:52,879
sustainability

5582
03:13:50,318 --> 03:13:53,680
and then at sustainability you could

5583
03:13:52,879 --> 03:13:55,519
have a

5584
03:13:53,680 --> 03:13:58,720
horror show of sustainability right you

5585
03:13:55,520 --> 03:14:00,720
could have a totalitarian sustainability

5586
03:13:58,719 --> 03:14:02,079
that's not the objective the objective

5587
03:14:00,719 --> 03:14:04,000
is to liberate people

5588
03:14:02,079 --> 03:14:05,680
and so the question the whole fourth

5589
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:08,478
frontier question frankly

5590
03:14:05,680 --> 03:14:10,720
is how do you get to a sustainable and

5591
03:14:08,478 --> 03:14:13,278
indefinitely sustainable state

5592
03:14:10,719 --> 03:14:13,920
in which people feel liberated in which

5593
03:14:13,279 --> 03:14:15,439
they are

5594
03:14:13,920 --> 03:14:18,478
liberated to pursue the things that

5595
03:14:15,439 --> 03:14:21,920
actually matter to pursue

5596
03:14:18,478 --> 03:14:24,079
beauty truth compassion

5597
03:14:21,920 --> 03:14:25,200
connection all of those things that we

5598
03:14:24,079 --> 03:14:27,920
could list as

5599
03:14:25,200 --> 03:14:29,439
unalloyed goods those are the things

5600
03:14:27,920 --> 03:14:31,600
that people should be most liberated to

5601
03:14:29,439 --> 03:14:34,880
do in a system that really functions

5602
03:14:31,600 --> 03:14:36,000
and anyway my point is

5603
03:14:34,879 --> 03:14:37,679
i don't know how precise that

5604
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:38,478
calculation is but i'm pretty sure it's

5605
03:14:37,680 --> 03:14:40,960
not wrong

5606
03:14:38,478 --> 03:14:42,318
it's accurate enough and if it is

5607
03:14:40,959 --> 03:14:44,398
accurate enough then

5608
03:14:42,318 --> 03:14:46,159
the point is okay well there's no

5609
03:14:44,398 --> 03:14:48,000
ultimate meaning but the proximate

5610
03:14:46,159 --> 03:14:50,079
meaning is that one how many people can

5611
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:51,600
we get to have this wonderful experience

5612
03:14:50,079 --> 03:14:54,639
that we've gotten to have

5613
03:14:51,600 --> 03:14:56,159
right and there's no way that's so wrong

5614
03:14:54,639 --> 03:14:58,079
that if i invest my life

5615
03:14:56,159 --> 03:15:00,398
in it that i'm making some big error

5616
03:14:58,079 --> 03:15:01,279
yeah sure that life is awesome and we

5617
03:15:00,398 --> 03:15:03,439
want to

5618
03:15:01,279 --> 03:15:05,120
spread the awesome as much as possible

5619
03:15:03,439 --> 03:15:06,559
yeah you sum it up that way spread the

5620
03:15:05,120 --> 03:15:08,160
awesome spread the loss

5621
03:15:06,559 --> 03:15:10,398
so that's the fourth frontier and if

5622
03:15:08,159 --> 03:15:12,238
that fails if the fourth frontier fails

5623
03:15:10,398 --> 03:15:14,079
the fifth frontier will be defined by

5624
03:15:12,238 --> 03:15:15,279
robots and hopefully they'll learn the

5625
03:15:14,079 --> 03:15:17,920
lessons

5626
03:15:15,279 --> 03:15:19,600
that the of the mistakes that the humans

5627
03:15:17,920 --> 03:15:21,520
made and build a better world

5628
03:15:19,600 --> 03:15:23,040
hopefully very happy here and that they

5629
03:15:21,520 --> 03:15:25,120
do a better job with the place than we

5630
03:15:23,040 --> 03:15:27,760
did

5631
03:15:25,120 --> 03:15:28,160
but i can't believe it took us this long

5632
03:15:27,760 --> 03:15:30,639
uh

5633
03:15:28,159 --> 03:15:31,600
to talk as i as i mentioned to you

5634
03:15:30,639 --> 03:15:34,639
before

5635
03:15:31,600 --> 03:15:35,680
that we haven't actually spoken i think

5636
03:15:34,639 --> 03:15:38,159
at all

5637
03:15:35,680 --> 03:15:39,200
and i i've always felt that we're

5638
03:15:38,159 --> 03:15:40,959
already friends

5639
03:15:39,200 --> 03:15:42,800
i don't know how that works because i've

5640
03:15:40,959 --> 03:15:45,919
listened to your podcast a lot

5641
03:15:42,799 --> 03:15:48,559
i've also sort of uh loved your brother

5642
03:15:45,920 --> 03:15:49,920
and so like it it was like we've known

5643
03:15:48,559 --> 03:15:52,639
each other for the longest time

5644
03:15:49,920 --> 03:15:53,279
and i hope we can be friends and talk

5645
03:15:52,639 --> 03:15:55,840
often

5646
03:15:53,279 --> 03:15:57,760
again i hope to that you get a chance to

5647
03:15:55,840 --> 03:15:58,960
meet some of my robot friends as well

5648
03:15:57,760 --> 03:16:02,000
and fall in love

5649
03:15:58,959 --> 03:16:04,000
and i'm so glad that you love robots

5650
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:05,439
as well so we get to share in that love

5651
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:09,279
so i can't wait for us

5652
03:16:05,439 --> 03:16:11,600
uh to interact together so we went from

5653
03:16:09,279 --> 03:16:12,800
talking about some of the worst failures

5654
03:16:11,600 --> 03:16:14,960
of humanity

5655
03:16:12,799 --> 03:16:16,238
to so some of the most beautiful aspects

5656
03:16:14,959 --> 03:16:18,159
of humanity

5657
03:16:16,238 --> 03:16:19,520

and now let me leave you with some words

5672
03:16:41,680 --> 03:16:45,680
from charles darwin

5673
03:16:43,760 --> 03:16:47,760
ignorance more frequently begets

5674
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:50,159
confidence than does knowledge

5675
03:16:47,760 --> 03:16:51,439
it is those who know little not those

5676
03:16:50,159 --> 03:16:54,079
who know much

5677
03:16:51,439 --> 03:16:55,040
who so positively assert that this or

5678
03:16:54,079 --> 03:16:57,840
that problem

5679
03:16:55,040 --> 03:16:58,560
will never be solved by science thank

5680
03:16:57,840 --> 03:17:10,880
you for listening

5681
03:16:58,559 --> 03:17:10,879
and hope to see you next time
