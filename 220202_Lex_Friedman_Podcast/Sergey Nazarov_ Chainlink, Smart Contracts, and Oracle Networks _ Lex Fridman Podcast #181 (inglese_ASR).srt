1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,519
sergey nazarov

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,520
ceo of chain link which is a

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,039
decentralized oracle network that

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,919
provides data to smart

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,759
contracts he and his team have done

7
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,359
seminal research and engineering in the

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,359
space of smart contracts

9
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,439
check out the chain link 2.0 white paper

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,279
that i found to be a great overview of

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,640
their technology and vision

12
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:27,039
it's 136 pages but very accessible

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,760
quick mention of our sponsors wine

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,880
access

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,880
athletic greens magic spoon indeed

16
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,359
and better help check them out in the

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,200
description to support this podcast

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,439
as a side note let me say that

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,239
externally connected smart contracts

20
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,000
that combine the ocean of data out there

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,558
with the security of the blockchain

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,238
are fascinating to me both technically

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,919
and philosophically

24
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,078
data is knowledge and knowledge is power

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,120
i think the more reliable data sources

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,160
we integrate

27
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,000
into our decision making especially

28
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,000
when those decisions are executed by

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,478
programs the more efficient and

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,438
productive our decisions become

31
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:10,079
there are interactions between humans

32
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,199
that should not be formalized digitally

33
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,599
like love for example but for all the

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,759
others

35
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,118
there's no reason for smart contracts

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,439
not to automate away

37
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,799
the menial parts of life making more

38
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,279
room for

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,240
good conversation over brisket and maybe

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,599
some vodka

41
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,959
with old and new friends this is the lex

42
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,839
friedman podcast

43
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:33,519
and here is my conversation with sergey

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,000
nazarov

45
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,200
is that yorzuk there he so i gave away

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,200
everything i own

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
a few times in my life and he

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,880
accidentally survived

49
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,319
and i don't like stuffed animals what i

50
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,078
really liked about i got him in a thrift

51
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,078
store what i liked about him is because

52
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,639
i'd never seen a stuffed animal

53
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,478
that looks pissed off at life like

54
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,280
they're usually smiling in a dumbest of

55
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,399
ways

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,280
and this guy was just pissed yeah i

57
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,000
gotta tell you that's

58
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,040
actually pretty funny i like this guy if

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,438
you had to live

60
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,399
only in the digital world or the

61
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,959
physical world

62
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,560
which would you choose so i i think this

63
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,079
is actually a question

64
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,680
more about what the fidelity of the

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,239
digital world would be

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,520
versus the physical world i i think this

67
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,200
this type of question this whole

68
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,239
simulation thing actually comes

69
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,238
from papers about 20 30 years ago in in

70
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,840
the philosophical world where people

71
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,439
try to make this thought experiment of

72
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,200
of would you be comfortable

73
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,878
if if everything that was happening to

74
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,238
you happened in a simulation

75
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,639
what they were trying to do is they were

76
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,680
intuitively trying to understand

77
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,318
is is there some kind of intuitive um

78
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,760
personal connection we have to something

79
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,518
being the real world

80
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,039
right and then the matrix movie actually

81
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,280
came out of these papers

82
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,239
and then these ideas made its way it

83
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
made their way into the public

84
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,080
consciousness

85
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,840
um i personally think that if i had the

86
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,040
choice to be in the digital world at the

87
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,159
same fidelity

88
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,519
as the real world with immortality i

89
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,959
would absolutely go with the digital

90
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,319
wait wait wait wait wait how'd you add

91
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,878
the immortality part

92
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,079
that's a won't get immortality if you

93
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,840
think about how we would go into the

94
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
digital world right our our our brain

95
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,519
patterns would be mapped

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,800
onto some kind of uh probably virtual

97
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,719
machine right

98
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,400
and that would mean a multi immortality

99
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,039
right because the virtual machine has no

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
limit

101
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,400
to how long it can be don't you think

102
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,680
there will be like a versioning system

103
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,000
like uh there'll be this is a soft

104
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,040
fork versus hard fork question whether

105
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,759
sergey version

106
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,359
2.0 would be different from sergey

107
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,878
version 1.0

108
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,360
there'll be an upgrade so that's

109
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,639
immortality sergey 1.0 would die in the

110
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,200
digital world and you should get

111
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,318
you get like a software update and then

112
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,000
that's it

113
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,598
you know well yeah when people go into

114
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,519
the star trek transporter are they

115
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,598
killed or are they transported

116
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
i i don't really know i haven't read any

117
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,719
papers on this i haven't really thought

118
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,680
about it too much there's no white paper

119
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,759
on the transporter

120
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,280
not not at this point so what what does

121
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,759
fidelity mean exactly

122
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,919
to you is it like strictly so the

123
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,560
fidelity of the physics world

124
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,679
the physical world is maybe now

125
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,080
questions of physics

126
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,120
quantum mechanics what is at the at the

127
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,640
bottom of it all

128
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,319
right or do you mean the fidelity of the

129
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,279
actual experience it's just it's just

130
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:11,679
perception

131
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,158
it's just just the human but that's

132
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,680
limited by human cognitive capabilities

133
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,120
it is but i don't really have anything

134
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,400
else right i think all of these papers

135
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,600
that brought up these questions of a

136
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,519
simulation they were like

137
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,280
in epistemology and metaphysics right

138
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,720
and what they were trying to do

139
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,399
i think was they were trying to put

140
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,880
people through a thought experiment

141
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,959
where

142
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,240
they would come out on the other end and

143
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,000
say the

144
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,240
reality of life is really worth

145
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,079
something and i don't

146
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,759
i don't you know ignorance isn't bliss

147
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,359
which is that's the consistent statement

148
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,720
in the matrix right ignorance is bliss

149
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,160
is that that's what one of the guys says

150
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
when he's like you know doing something

151
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,720
wrong and

152
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,800
trying to get back into the matrix and

153
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,880
and the question is is ignorance bliss

154
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,079
um and it's like a different version of

155
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,399
that i

156
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,000
i think from a perceptual point of view

157
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,399
if my perceptions

158
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,839
aren't in any way different so fidelity

159
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,638
is very good

160
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,679
it doesn't matter now i i don't know

161
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,759
right so if i

162
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
that it's if i don't know something it

163
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,080
doesn't really exist and if it doesn't

164
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,919
exist

165
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,758
in in in my perception or my

166
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,159
consciousness then it doesn't exist

167
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,199
period for me at least and then whether

168
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,600
it exists in some

169
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,240
you know more metaphysical um version of

170
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,840
things

171
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,519
i i personally never really got into the

172
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,839
metaphysics stuff because i i could

173
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,839
never really um

174
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,679
i couldn't understand what the point of

175
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,799
it was right it it

176
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,079
it's one of these things where i

177
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,840
couldn't really get what um

178
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,519
what the what the practical application

179
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,038
of it was and this is this is from those

180
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,879
realm of questions right like

181
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,240
if there was something about the world

182
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,319
but you didn't have a

183
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,360
capacity to perceive it would it matter

184
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,839
to you

185
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,520
uh to me it wouldn't matter right to me

186
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,719
to me by the way the simulation thing is

187
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,680
a really interesting engineering

188
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,840
question

189
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,720
which is how difficult is it to engineer

190
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,239
virtual reality a digital world that is

191
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,240
sufficiently

192
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
of high fidelity where you would want to

193
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,560
live in it i think that's a really

194
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,399
testable and a fascinating engineering

195
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,478
question because my intuition says like

196
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,638
it's not as difficult as we think

197
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,000
it's not nearly as difficult as having

198
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,759
to create

199
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,519
a quantum mechanical simulation that's

200
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,479
large enough to capture the full human

201
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,120
experience like

202
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,599
it might be just as simple as just a

203
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,600
really nice quake game

204
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,759
like with a nice engine with you know

205
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
that just creating all the basic visual

206
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,360
elements

207
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,038
that tricked our cognitive our visual

208
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,520
cortex into believing that we're

209
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,318
actually

210
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,519
in the physical environment and i think

211
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,280
that

212
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,560
if that's true then that's quite you

213
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,559
know that

214
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,319
a high fidelity digital world is

215
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,600
actually achievable within

216
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,800
you know a century and and that changes

217
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,560
things

218
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,840
yeah yeah maybe maybe in my in our

219
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,759
lifetime i'm really hoping for that i'm

220
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,198
hoping somebody can copy my brain waves

221
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,360
onto a virtual machine

222
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,879
yeah and uh you know allow those uh

223
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,680
allow that consciousness to continue to

224
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,199
exist

225
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,959
whether that's that's death or not i

226
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,919
don't i don't know

227
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,680
but i i think it's actually um gonna

228
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,598
require some serious leaps like even

229
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,319
even the vr headsets right

230
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,120
they um don't work if they go below 90

231
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,479
frame rates

232
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
right people people start getting

233
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,000
freaked out so you have to go from one

234
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,639
gaming screen of you know 60 frames per

235
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,199
second to two screens of 90 frames per

236
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,038
second

237
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,280
and so the people's hardware today can't

238
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,360
even handle that and that's for these

239
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,638
for these two little screens by your

240
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,240
eyeballs

241
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,079
what it's going to take to like you know

242
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,000
completely trick my consciousness

243
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,279
into not knowing the difference in terms

244
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,038
of like you know all the

245
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,959
sensory inputs um my i'm keeping my

246
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,918
fingers crossed whoever whoever whoever

247
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,359
does that

248
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,839
and and is close to doing that they

249
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,960
should contact me i i want to have my

250
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,279
brain waves

251
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,239
turned into a virtual machine would you

252
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,719
in that context if morpheus came to you

253
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,439
would you take the blue pill or the red

254
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,440
pill

255
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,240
meaning would you be happy just living

256
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,639
in that world

257
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,639
and not knowing that you're living

258
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,680
inside that virtual world that's running

259
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,598
a computer

260
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,199
or would you want to know the truth of

261
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,478
it well actually

262
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,720
i think that's a very different question

263
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,478
right there's a there's a there's a

264
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,639
actually moral ethical question there

265
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,399
about whether you should allow a bunch

266
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,079
of people to get you know manipulated

267
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,918
and killed and slaved because in the

268
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,560
matrix they're all enslaved and

269
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,198
in as as as as like you know a triple a

270
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
battery

271
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,720
to turn a human being into the battery

272
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,918
right um

273
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,440
so i i think the the moral and ethical

274
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:32,639
question of that

275
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,759
fascinating enough isn't actually

276
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,038
different than the more unethical

277
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,158
questions we face today

278
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,838
in modern daily life but i

279
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,519
probably have given the choice of just

280
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,399
completely going along

281
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,278
or going against it i would probably go

282
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,958
against it

283
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,720
if i had to make this kind of binary

284
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,679
choice because going

285
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,680
going along with it

286
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,800
i think at that scale of scary you know

287
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,719
stuff happening to people

288
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:59,838
is is probably something really um

289
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,440
really really difficult

290
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,120
but for your individual life it's way

291
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,839
more fun to go along with it

292
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,080
so you're saying you value

293
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,600
the opposing a system that includes the

294
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,800
suffering of others

295
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,680
versus just for yourself and enjoying

296
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:17,679
the ride

297
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,359
i mean what what's what's if there is

298
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,079
such a binary choice

299
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,680
why choose the opposite system i think

300
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,120
it's the nature of um kind of the

301
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,919
ethical dilemma that you face in that

302
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,759
situation

303
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,039
there's kind of some you know this is

304
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,838
obviously not something that's happening

305
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,639
now right

306
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,640
we don't know this right

307
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,320
at the end of the day at that scale

308
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,440
of of something like that happening yeah

309
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,000
that scale

310
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,519
of of people being um you know

311
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,440
manipulated and harmed

312
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,039
then i think pretty much almost all

313
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,240
people have an obligation

314
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,838
to go to go against it uh

315
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,600
probably that's what that that looks

316
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,519
like in my opinion

317
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
so you've talked about the concept of

318
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,519
definitive truth

319
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,759
what is it and in general what is the

320
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,120
nature of truth in human civilization

321
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,600
and just talking about the digital age

322
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,200
uh the nature of truth in the digital

323
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,720
age

324
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,399
so the interesting thing about

325
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,519
definitive truth is that it actually

326
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,720
exists on um on this at least in my mind

327
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,519
on this spectrum

328
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,320
between objective truth and just you

329
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,679
know somebody

330
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,440
uh made something up and nobody else

331
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,120
agrees so what i

332
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,040
what i think definitive truth is is it's

333
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,078
somewhere in the middle on that spectrum

334
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,319
where if you and me define

335
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,159
uh what truth is right like if you and

336
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,440
me have an agreement of some kind

337
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:39,838
and we say as long as the weather

338
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
is sunny or the weather isn't there is

339
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,600
no rain on that day

340
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,600
then there will be an insurance policy

341
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,839
that results and you and me both agree

342
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,839
that as long as three sensors

343
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,360
three monitoring weather monitoring

344
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,440
stations all say that

345
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,720
then the definitive truth for us and for

346
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,000
that agreement

347
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,240
is the result of of those systems

348
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,839
coming to consensus about what happened

349
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,200
out in the real world

350
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,000
i i think the objective um truth

351
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,759
definition

352
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,360
from from kind of the philosophical

353
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,078
world is really really

354
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,879
stringent and very very hard to attain

355
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,159
and that's not

356
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,159
that's not what this is and that's

357
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,159
actually not what commerce

358
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,000
or the ability for people to interact

359
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,159
about contracts needs

360
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,919
what i think the world of commerce needs

361
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,120
is an upgrade

362
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,639
from someone can unilaterally decide

363
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,320
what the truth is

364
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:35,199
two there can be a pre-agreed set

365
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,560
of conditions where we define what the

366
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,720
truth is

367
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,479
under those conditions and then you know

368
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
you and me basically say

369
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,519
if these 20 nodes or of these 30 data

370
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,359
sources

371
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,200
come to consensus within you know this

372
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,159
method of consensus with this threshold

373
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,000
of agreement

374
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,559
then definitive truth has been achieved

375
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,839
for you and me in in our relationship

376
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,159
for this specific agreement and the

377
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,440
specificity and

378
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,360
and our shared agreement to that kind of

379
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,320
truth or that definitive truth

380
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,440
being acceptable to both both of us is

381
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,440
is probably what's

382
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,959
what's um kind of necessary and

383
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,480
sufficient for everything to move

384
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,479
forward in a better way

385
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,320
in any case much better than you know

386
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,920
i'm a bank or an insurance company

387
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,079
i'm going to unilaterally decide what

388
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,639
happens it's it's definitely an upgrade

389
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:20,399
from that

390
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,759
do you think it's possible to define

391
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,440
formally in this way

392
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,240
a definitive truth for many things in

393
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,720
this world like you talked about whether

394
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,240
basically defining that if three sensors

395
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,759
of weather agree

396
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
then that we're going to agree that that

397
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,838
is a definitive

398
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,600
useful truth for us to operate under

399
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,680
so how many things in this world can be

400
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,079
formalized in this way do you think

401
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,039
uh a huge a huge amount so so there's

402
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,479
there's actually

403
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:50,319
um two two things going on here

404
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,560
one thing is the amount of data that

405
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,920
already exists right and the pieces of

406
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,759
data coming off of

407
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:59,519
you know markets iot shipment of goods

408
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,278
any any number of other things like even

409
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,399
even your youtube channel has a certain

410
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,159
amount of likes

411
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,679
or a certain amount of clicks or certain

412
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,039
amount of views and even that's

413
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,559
quantifiable right so even

414
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,159
to a certain degree what we do here

415
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,399
today you and me right now

416
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,360
can be quantified as far as the amount

417
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,639
of views the amount of

418
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,039
clicks the amount of any number of

419
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,039
others you the viewer have power

420
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,559
of data in your hands by clicking like

421
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,159
or dislike right now

422
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,078
or the subscribe button or the

423
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,879
unsubscribe button which i encourage you

424
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,439
to do

425
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,919
anyway okay so there's data flowing in

426
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,600
into

427
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,519
all interactions in this world there's

428
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,839
data there's more and more data right

429
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,679
like

430
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,320
more data more and more data that data

431
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,319
is more and more accessible to everybody

432
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,000
and that accessibility and the fact that

433
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
there's more of it means we can form

434
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,320
more definitive truth

435
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,159
proofs we can form more and more proofs

436
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,760
and as we form those proofs

437
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,759
well we can provide them to these

438
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,879
blockchains and smart contract systems

439
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,720
that consume them

440
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,159
and then they're tamper proof right so

441
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,920
they can't be manipulated

442
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,838
and so now we've combined a system that

443
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,000
can prove things with a system that

444
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,399
guarantees us certain outcomes

445
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839
and we have a better system of contracts

446
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,919
which is which is

447
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,399
uh actually an unbelievably powerful

448
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,639
tool that has never existed before

449
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,198
can we talk about the world of commerce

450
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,399
and finance decentralized finance

451
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:19,039
what is it uh what's its promise

452
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,879
from both the philosophical and uh

453
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,480
technical perspective if we just zoom in

454
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,120
on that particular space of the

455
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,320
digital world sure so the the

456
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,360
centralized finance

457
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,839
is the instantiation of a specific type

458
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,079
of

459
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,519
smart contract right or what i call

460
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,120
hybrid smart contracts

461
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,198
which are these contracts that combine

462
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,919
the on-chain code together with the

463
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,078
off-chain

464
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,759
proofs that something happened that's

465
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,519
they're called a hybrid because they

466
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,799
basically use both of these systems

467
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,600
right the blockchain

468
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,399
and the proofs about what happened and

469
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,680
what defy

470
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,720
is is one specific type of hybrid smart

471
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,319
contract that

472
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,839
is taking on the contractual agreements

473
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,040
you traditionally find

474
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,199
in the financial global financial system

475
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,319
right and and that's basically the world

476
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,240
of lending the

477
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,399
the world of yield generation for people

478
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,959
giving me or giving giving whoever their

479
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,278
money and

480
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,198
and somebody giving back them yield back

481
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,399
to them which is what bonds do and what

482
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,479
treasury's doing what a lot of the

483
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,000
global financial markets do as well as

484
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,199
the ability to gain

485
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,879
exposure and protection from different

486
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,479
types of events and risks

487
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,399
that's a lot of what derivatives do

488
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,440
right derivatives allow us to say hey

489
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,360
something's going to happen

490
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,880
and i'm either going to protect myself

491
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,800
by getting paid if it happens

492
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,559
or i'm going to benefit from it

493
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,000
happening by basically saying it's going

494
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,799
to happen putting money down on that

495
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,278
and that prediction will get me a return

496
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,758
now

497
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,120
that's a lot a very large part of the

498
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,959
global financial system

499
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,320
excluding all the stuff for global trade

500
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,359
and letters of credit and all the stuff

501
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,879
that facilitates

502
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,800
international trade so excluding

503
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,320
excluding that at least for now

504
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,000
so if we look at what decentralized

505
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,079
finance does it takes

506
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,360
all of those agreements about generating

507
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:58,799
yield lending

508
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,320
and all of these types of things you

509
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,120
find in global finance and the world of

510
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,040
derivatives

511
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,360
and a few other types of financial

512
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:08,319
products and it basically puts them

513
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,519
into a different format right so the

514
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,920
format you have

515
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,198
for centralized financial agreements is

516
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,479
that you go to a bank

517
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,399
even if you're a hedge fund even if

518
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,199
you're like the richest people you you

519
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,120
go to a bank

520
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,879
they make a product for you and you hope

521
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,679
that they honor the product that they

522
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,360
made for you

523
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,519
or you do a deal with another hedge fund

524
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,320
or or or whoever some counterparty

525
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,120
and you hope that that deal is honored

526
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,440
yep

527
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,039
and then um a number of very freaky

528
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,600
things start to take place

529
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,559
one one of them is people don't have

530
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,040
clarity

531
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,399
about what the agreement is right so a

532
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,439
lot of people don't know

533
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,278
exactly what the agreement is between

534
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,720
um between those parties because they

535
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:48,320
can't actually see it

536
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,759
sometimes agreements are kept very

537
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
private or parts of them are kept

538
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,320
private

539
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,519
and that keeps you know other

540
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,800
counterparties other people in the

541
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,360
system from understanding what's going

542
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,799
on

543
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,560
this is actually partly what happened

544
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,399
with the mortgage crisis the mortgage

545
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,439
crisis in 2008 was basically

546
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,839
there were a lot of agreements there

547
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,360
were a lot of assets but because the

548
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,880
centralized financial system worked in

549
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,639
such an opaque way

550
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,559
it was so unbelievably difficult to

551
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,480
understand what was going on

552
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:13,759
right and so that lack of understanding

553
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,279
for the global financial system

554
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,240
basically led to a big boom

555
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,720
and then correspondingly very very big

556
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,640
bust

557
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,838
which amazingly enough had a huge impact

558
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,600
on everybody even though they didn't

559
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,798
participate in the boom part of the

560
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,959
of the equation um in in any case

561
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,400
what decentralized finance does is it

562
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,840
takes these

563
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,840
financial contracts that power the

564
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,199
global financial system it puts them in

565
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,359
this new blockchain based

566
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,759
format that basically at this point

567
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,959
provides three very powerful things

568
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,119
the first thing that it provides is

569
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,679
complete transparency over what's going

570
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,519
on

571
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,038
with your financial product so this

572
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,480
means when you use a financial product

573
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,160
in the d5 format

574
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,599
you and you as a technical person

575
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,600
actually can drill down

576
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,879
very very very deeply and you can

577
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,159
understand

578
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,600
where the collateral is you can

579
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,200
understand how much collateral there is

580
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,000
you can understand what format it's in

581
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,600
you can understand how

582
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
it's changing you can understand this on

583
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,959
a you know second to second or block to

584
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,679
block basis

585
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,679
right so you have complete transparency

586
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,519
into what's going on

587
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,720
in the financial protocol that you have

588
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,960
your assets in

589
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,400
which is because blockchains and the

590
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,360
infrastructure all of these things

591
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,880
are built on force that transparency

592
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,319
right whereas the centralized financial

593
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,799
system is very very good at

594
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,678
hiding it it's very good at hiding it

595
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:30,160
and packaging things in a glossy wrapper

596
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,919
creating a boom then a bust

597
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,160
decentralized finance is built on

598
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,919
infrastructure that forces transparency

599
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,919
such that everyone can understand what

600
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,480
the financial product does from day one

601
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,080
and in fact escaping that property is

602
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,200
practically impossible or if someone

603
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,720
tries to escape it

604
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,558
it becomes immediately obvious and

605
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,279
people don't use their financial product

606
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,480
so so that's number one number two is

607
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:51,678
control

608
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,240
so if you look at what happened with

609
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,840
robin hood everybody thought the system

610
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,679
worked a certain way right everybody

611
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,079
thought i have a brokerage account

612
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,240
i can trade things under you know a

613
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:05,439
certain set of market conditions

614
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,120
and then the market conditions changed

615
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,798
within the band of what people thought

616
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,000
they could do and everybody was

617
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,558
fascinated to find out

618
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,400
that oh my god i thought my band of

619
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:15,839
market conditions in which i can control

620
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,240
my assets is x

621
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,399
but it's actually y it's actually much

622
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,160
much smaller band

623
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,400
and the the reason it is a much much

624
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,960
smaller group of market conditions

625
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,080
is that the system doesn't work the way

626
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,519
people think it works

627
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,359
the system was wrapped up in a nice

628
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,720
glossy wrapper and given to them to get

629
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,319
them to participate in the system

630
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,759
because their system requires and needs

631
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,599
their participation

632
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,440
but if you actually look at how the

633
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,119
system works underneath

634
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,120
you will see that it does not work the

635
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,479
way people think they that it works

636
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,719
and this is actually another reason that

637
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,640
defy is so powerful because defy

638
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,480
actually and and these blockchain

639
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,799
contracts give people

640
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,000
the version of the world they think they

641
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,400
already have

642
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
which is why they don't beg for it right

643
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,519
so everybody thinks they're in a certain

644
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
version of the world that works in this

645
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,038
reliable way

646
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,840
transparent way they're not they don't

647
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,279
realize it

648
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,720
and so they're confused when you tell

649
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,678
them i'm going to make the world work

650
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,960
this way because they think they're

651
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,120
already in that world

652
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,038
but then things like robin hood make it

653
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,399
immediately painfully clear that that's

654
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,038
not how the world works so that the

655
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,159
second real property of defy is control

656
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,480
which means that you control your assets

657
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,760
not a bank not a broker not a third

658
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,360
party you

659
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,279
you control your bitcoins you control

660
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,879
your tokens in the finance protocol

661
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,119
if you don't like how something's going

662
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,720
in that protocol you can remove it you

663
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,399
can send it to another protocol

664
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,919
or you can use a feature of the protocol

665
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,600
to do something it's supposed to do

666
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,679
and guess what nobody can just say oops

667
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,959
you know that feature that isn't so good

668
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,400
for my friends over here

669
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,360
you know that feature is actually you

670
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,440
know we're just going to pause that

671
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:48,399
feature in the critical moment

672
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,840
when you need it to to to execute your

673
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,159
you know your strategy which is why you

674
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,399
took all the risks to begin with

675
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,480
and then the final reason um you know

676
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,280
the final thing to know about d5

677
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,400
is that d5 is inherently global and

678
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,200
actually right now

679
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,880
provides better yield globally so if you

680
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,600
go to a bank right now with the us

681
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,320
dollar

682
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,918
you get one percent or less if you go to

683
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:13,279
d5 with the us dollar

684
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,240
you get seven or eight percent so

685
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,599
if if we think about that um in in a

686
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,960
world where there's a lot of inflation

687
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,319
coming down the road

688
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,319
and we think about well

689
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,359
you know a lot more systems might be

690
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,200
failing soon

691
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,879
and and and they might be highlighting

692
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,080
these types of problems that were there

693
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,159
for

694
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,199
or as a result of the type of control

695
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,240
that you see in

696
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
in robinhood and people are more and

697
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,919
more concerned

698
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
about both transparency and control and

699
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,640
they're looking for yield to combat

700
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,200
inflation

701
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,720
um i i think that's what defy is about

702
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,120
in a practical sense

703
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,759
it is this clarity about your risk it is

704
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,959
control

705
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,240
over your assets and amazingly at the

706
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,640
same time as having those two

707
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,519
unbelievably useful properties

708
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,240
it is actually superior yield which

709
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,000
which

710
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,359
which which which just leads me to the

711
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,919
very obvious conclusion that

712
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,079
the only reason defy isn't more used is

713
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,559
because more people don't know about it

714
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,279
and by virtue of this long kind of you

715
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:13,519
know

716
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,879
explanation here and here and elsewhere

717
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:16,720
more people will know about it

718
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,120
and it's just such an obviously superior

719
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,558
solution that i i haven't heard a single

720
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:23,279
explanation as to why

721
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,480
um no no don't earn eight percent and

722
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,440
take less risk and have more

723
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,720
transparency

724
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,679
with your assets earn seven percent less

725
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,919
take more risk

726
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,240
and um give people the ability to change

727
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,440
the rules on you at their discretion

728
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,000
go do that who's going to do that and in

729
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,320
general

730
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,200
on the first two of transparency control

731
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,439
first of all i do

732
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,720
think maybe you can correct me but from

733
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,798
my perspective

734
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,120
they're they're like deeply tied

735
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,639
together in the sense that transparency

736
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,038
gives control

737
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,000
transparency creates accountability and

738
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,400
and there's this kind of

739
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,159
game being played game game theoretic

740
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,519
game where if i know

741
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,240
if you know i'm going to discover your

742
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,079
deviation you're not going to deviate

743
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,558
yes this could be a whole other

744
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,399
conversation but just as a small aside

745
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,879
on the social network side of things

746
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,320
which i've been thinking deeply about

747
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,200
in the past year or so of how to do it

748
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,240
right

749
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,600
there how to fix our social media

750
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,400
and i tend to believe that

751
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,319
human beings if they're given clear

752
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,080
transparency about which data is being

753
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,879
stored how it's being used

754
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,359
where it's being moved about just all a

755
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,400
clear

756
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:37,038
simple transparency of

757
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,200
how their data is being used and them

758
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,440
having the control

759
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,400
at the very minimal level of being able

760
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,798
to participate

761
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,559
or to walk away and walk away means

762
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,079
delete everything you've ever known

763
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,558
about me

764
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,918
that that will create a much much better

765
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:53,519
world

766
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,278
that currently there's a complete lack

767
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,558
of transparency on social media how the

768
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,759
data is being used

769
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,200
for your own protection i mean there's a

770
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:00,400
lot of parallels to the central bank

771
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,640
situation

772
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,559
and there's not a control element of

773
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,240
being able to walk away like being able

774
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,240
to delete all your data

775
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,278
delete your account on facebook is very

776
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,759
difficult

777
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,880
it doesn't take a single click which i

778
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,879
think is what it should take there

779
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,559
should be a big red button that says

780
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,200
delete everything you've ever known

781
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:21,278
about me or like forget me

782
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,640
so i think that couple together can

783
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,319
create a very

784
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,880
different kind of world and create a an

785
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,918
incentivization

786
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,760
that will uh lead to like progress and

787
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,720
innovation and just like a much better

788
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,839
social network

789
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,558
and a really good business for

790
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:40,639
the future social networks but so i tend

791
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,918
to see like control

792
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,720
as naturally uh being

793
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,559
a sort of an outgrowth from the

794
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,400
transparency it should all start the

795
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,079
transparency which is why the smart

796
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,640
contract formulation

797
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,798
is fascinating because like you're

798
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,759
you're formalizing

799
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:01,278
in a simple clear way any agreements

800
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,079
that you're participating in

801
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,519
and as a side comment also what's really

802
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,759
inspiring to me

803
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,599
is that i think there's a greater i

804
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,440
don't know if this is always the case

805
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,480
but it seems like from having talked to

806
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,400
people on the psychological element

807
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:22,000
there's a hunger amongst people

808
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,320
to for transparency and

809
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,159
for control like transparency another

810
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,678
word for that is authenticity

811
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,360
if you look at the kind of stuff that

812
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,640
people hunger for now

813
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,399
they want to know the reality of who you

814
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,038
are as an individual so that means you

815
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,080
can create businesses you can create

816
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:41,200
tools that are built on authenticity a

817
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,879
transparency

818
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,278
and then the same i'm inspired by

819
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,000
the intelligence of people if you give

820
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,960
them control if you give them power

821
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,919
that they would make good choices that's

822
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,759
really exciting

823
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,240
of course not everybody but that means

824
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:01,599
that decentralized power

825
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,038
can create effective systems

826
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,199
so couple that there's a hunger for

827
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:08,158
transparency so we can move to a world

828
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,960
where everyone's being just like real

829
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,159
you know

830
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,240
conveying their genuine human nature and

831
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,000
people are sufficiently intelligent that

832
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,960
if you're if they're given power

833
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,720
in a distributed mass scale sense that

834
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,278
we're going to build a better world to

835
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,440
that

836
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,359
as opposed to centralized supervised

837
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,480
control where only a small percent of

838
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,519
the population

839
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,679
know what the hell they're doing

840
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,639
everybody else is clueless sheep

841
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,200
i'm i'm so those two coupled together is

842
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,080
really

843
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,278
to me inspiring just to really quickly

844
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:38,399
comment on the stuff that you just said

845
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,038
which i think is super

846
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,640
super super fascinating um i i think

847
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,319
that's all exactly right

848
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,520
i think everything that you said is is

849
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,200
right and i think it's actually going to

850
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,960
be the same for social media and banking

851
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,840
and every other type of contract

852
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,278
is that all of those systems that house

853
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:55,199
people's value for them

854
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,640
and take control of of either their

855
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,960
social media value

856
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
or their financial value or whatever for

857
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,360
them

858
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,119
all of that is going to be made

859
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,839
available to people in like this

860
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,678
autonomous piece of code that does the

861
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,720
same thing that the centralized entity

862
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,880
used to do

863
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,558
so they get all the features but the

864
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,278
autonomous piece of code

865
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,960
gives them the ability to have control

866
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,839
while getting all the features

867
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,159
right so so banks give you features

868
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,839
social media sites give you features

869
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,440
you know whatever other system that you

870
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,678
use online gives you features

871
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,600
and then it takes your data and it takes

872
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,240
control of your assets from you

873
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,398
in return for those features right i

874
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,599
think the whole big difference here

875
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,278
partly in line with you know the

876
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,158
definition of smart contracts and its

877
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:40,159
evolution

878
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,840
is that there's this uh now this this

879
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,399
autonomous piece of code

880
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,119
that's giving you all those features

881
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,158
without

882
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:51,918
requiring the ownership and lock-in

883
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:55,360
and control and unilateral kind of

884
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,120
ownership of your data or your value

885
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,719
or or whatever it is that that you're

886
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,839
giving it right

887
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,000
and i think what this will lead to

888
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,720
fundamentally

889
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,519
is just more of a free market dynamic

890
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,159
among how

891
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,839
people make i i think with the social

892
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,840
media folks you should you should just

893
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,678
make some kind of law or something where

894
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:14,158
you can just export all your data from

895
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,000
them

896
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,559
everyone should be able to get their

897
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,558
data exported by another application

898
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,240
and then the network effect of all these

899
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:23,359
social media sites will kind of crumble

900
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,038
because people will just

901
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,879
combine your twitter data with your

902
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,038
facebook data with everything else

903
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,240
into an application that you control and

904
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:31,759
there will just be

905
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,278
thousands of different interfaces

906
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:34,640
competing for how to consume all the

907
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,240
social media data

908
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,320
because it isn't locked in in one

909
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,919
centralized actors control

910
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,519
and so this is this is just the

911
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,480
recurring pattern of what i think all of

912
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,720
this will do

913
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,480
is it'll give peach it gives it gives

914
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,440
people a better deal right it gives them

915
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,278
features

916
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,720
without ownership of data without

917
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,519
ownership of value

918
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,120
and and and that's really the difference

919
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,879
so i think this is a good place to talk

920
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,879
about smart contracts then can you tell

921
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,440
me the history of smart contracts

922
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,640
and the basic sort of definitions of

923
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,200
what is it

924
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,720
sure so i think smart contracts as a

925
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,558
definition has actually gone through

926
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,919
some through some kind of changes or

927
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:11,440
small evolution

928
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,440
initially i think it was actually a

929
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,759
conception of a digital agreement

930
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,440
that was tamper-proof and could know

931
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:18,158
things about the world right so it could

932
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,600
get proof

933
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,520
and it could define that something

934
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,599
happened and it could conclude

935
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,720
an outcome and release payment or do

936
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,240
something else that's actually the

937
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,919
definition of smart contracts

938
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,839
that i began working in this industry

939
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,440
with seven or eight years ago when i

940
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,359
started making smart contracts

941
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,960
that is the conception that i had of a

942
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,839
smart contract

943
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,880
then what happened was that was really

944
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,398
hard to do right

945
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,240
building that type of tamper-proof

946
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:43,599
digital agreement that could also know

947
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,159
things about the real world

948
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:48,079
and release payments back to people

949
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,520
about those events that were codified in

950
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,759
this tamper-proof format

951
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,119
was actually a very tall order turns out

952
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,480
it's consistent of three parts it's

953
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,319
consisting of the contract

954
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,319
the proof about what happened and you

955
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,639
know the release of value

956
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,079
the way things have evolved so far is

957
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,000
that

958
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,199
the definition has now come to mean

959
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,200
on-chain code

960
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,399
right so it's come to mean the

961
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,360
codification

962
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,879
of contractual agreement on a blockchain

963
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,000
right so there's some code of somewhere

964
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,520
on some blockchain

965
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,079
that defines what the agreement is

966
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,679
now that eliminates the part of the

967
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:23,038
definition that's related to knowing

968
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,200
things about the world

969
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:26,798
and it partly eliminates the definition

970
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,278
about payments and and stuff like that

971
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:32,879
but basically it's it's on chain code

972
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:34,880
right we in in our recent work on

973
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,000
on the second white paper have actually

974
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,559
put out a different definition

975
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,480
that we call hybrid smart contracts that

976
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,278
actually tries to go back to the initial

977
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,798
definition

978
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,640
that i started with seven or eight years

979
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,278
ago which basically says

980
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,960
that there's some proof somewhere that's

981
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,759
proven to the contract and the contract

982
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,000
can know that

983
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,839
and the contract can gain proof then it

984
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,480
can use that proof to settle

985
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,439
um the agreement that's codified on a

986
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,679
blockchain

987
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,440
so you you both need a mechanism to

988
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,519
provide proof you need a mechanism

989
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,360
to codify the contract in a tamper proof

990
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,038
way on something like a blockchain

991
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,079
and then as with all contracts there's a

992
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:09,440
presumption that there's some kind of

993
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:11,839
release of value

994
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,200
so i think a smart contract in our

995
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,079
industry right now

996
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,000
means on chain code which limits it to

997
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,879
whatever can be done on chain

998
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,159
only and then in in our internal

999
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,399
definition for us

1000
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,559
and for us at chain link and for me um

1001
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,839
it's hybrid smart contracts

1002
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:29,839
which is actually the original

1003
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,639
definition it's the it's the idea that a

1004
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,959
contract

1005
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,159
can both know what happened and

1006
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,960
automatically

1007
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,919
resolve to to the proper outcome based

1008
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,600
on what happened

1009
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,919
so you're referring to the chain link

1010
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:45,439
2.0 white paper which is

1011
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,519
uh paper that i recommend people look

1012
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,600
it's a very easy read and very well

1013
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,399
structured and very thorough so i really

1014
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,119
enjoyed it

1015
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,518
very recently released i guess can you

1016
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:58,239
dig in deeper what is a hybrid

1017
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,640
smart contract you mentioned sort of

1018
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,399
this idea of data

1019
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,880
or knowing about the world and on chain

1020
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:08,639
and off chain so what are the different

1021
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,080
roles in this so hybrid by the way

1022
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,080
refers to

1023
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,720
the fact that it's on chain and off

1024
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:18,079
chain contracts

1025
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,480
so maybe digging deeper of what the heck

1026
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,839
is it

1027
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,599
and what does it mean to know stuff

1028
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,599
about the world from

1029
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:26,000
like how do you actually achieve that

1030
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,959
yeah absolutely

1031
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,480
so the on-chain part is where the

1032
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,038
agreement itself is

1033
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,159
that's the smart contract itself and

1034
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:37,119
that's where you codify

1035
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,480
certain conditions such as the

1036
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,079
conditions under which an interest

1037
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,000
payment is made or the conditions under

1038
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,278
which the the contract pays out the full

1039
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,359
amount that it holds

1040
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,038
to someone based on a derivative outcome

1041
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,798
or something like that

1042
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,200
now what the on chain code is very good

1043
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:53,839
at is creating transparency about what

1044
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,080
the core conditions of the contract are

1045
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,079
it's very good at taking in money from

1046
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,798
other private keys that send it

1047
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,079
tokens and send it value to hold and

1048
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,720
then it's also very good

1049
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:05,759
at returning money or returning value

1050
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,159
back to other

1051
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,679
addresses or other private keys it can

1052
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,080
also be involved in governance it can be

1053
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,679
involved

1054
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:13,119
in a few other private key signature

1055
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,840
based

1056
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:18,000
operations but primarily the on-chain

1057
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,398
part of a hybrid smart contract

1058
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,278
from what i've seen so far defines the

1059
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,678
agreement

1060
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,359
takes in value and returns value uh

1061
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,440
based upon the conditions codified in

1062
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,359
the agreement on a blockchain

1063
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,200
the second and equally important off

1064
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,759
chain part

1065
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,600
is where the term oracle and oracle

1066
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,359
comes in or an oracle mechanism or a

1067
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,759
decentralized oracle network

1068
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,158
as we describe it in the paper and this

1069
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,398
is another

1070
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:46,240
decentralized computational system

1071
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,439
that has a different goal right so

1072
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,599
blockchains

1073
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,558
have the goal of packaging transactions

1074
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,038
into blocks

1075
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,720
and connecting them in a crypto

1076
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:56,398
cryptographically unique way to create

1077
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,440
security and assurance about

1078
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:01,599
that chain of transactions oracles

1079
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,480
and decentralized oracle networks

1080
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,839
achieve

1081
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,240
um consensus and they achieve

1082
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,878
decentralization

1083
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,079
about the topic of what happened right

1084
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:11,918
so blockchains

1085
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,240
structure transactions some of those

1086
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:17,519
transactions might be the state changes

1087
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:21,039
in different pieces of on-chain code and

1088
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:22,239
then those on-chain pieces of code

1089
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,039
require

1090
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,559
input i think the thing that people get

1091
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,759
kind of a little bit thrown by

1092
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:32,639
is despite being called smart contracts

1093
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,200
the on-chain code on a blockchain cannot

1094
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,559
actually

1095
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,719
speak to any other system so blockchains

1096
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,559
are valuable and useful as far as

1097
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,078
they're tamper-proof and secure

1098
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,078
and to be tamper-proof and secure

1099
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,200
they're made this kind of walled garden

1100
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,519
that is able to know and interact only

1101
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,239
with the highly reliable information

1102
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,199
that's within that system which is

1103
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,239
basically

1104
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:58,239
tokens and private key signatures

1105
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,159
all the other world's information is not

1106
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,879
available in a blockchain

1107
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:05,039
inherently and a smart contract or a

1108
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,640
piece of unchained code can't just say

1109
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,960
hey i'm going to go get some data from

1110
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,679
over here because the api they would get

1111
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,199
it from

1112
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,279
creates a whole bunch of security

1113
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,879
concerns for the blockchain itself

1114
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,599
and a whole bunch of consensus issues

1115
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,200
about how to agree on what that api said

1116
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,559
or what the truth of the world is right

1117
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,598
because it's not even agreeing

1118
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,599
on what one api said it's more so

1119
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,280
creating a reliable form of

1120
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,800
decentralized computation

1121
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,440
that can give you a definitive proof of

1122
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,039
what happened and not just what one api

1123
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,320
said so for example some of our most

1124
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,320
widely used networks

1125
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,320
have well over 30 nodes and well over 10

1126
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,480
data sources that are all providing

1127
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,640
information about the same type of data

1128
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,480
and then there's consensus on that one

1129
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,319
piece of data which is then

1130
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,920
written in and essentially given back

1131
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,240
into the on-chain code

1132
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,159
to tell it what happened because you

1133
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,319
can't really make an agreement

1134
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,679
unless you know what happened right if

1135
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,280
you and me were to make an agreement and

1136
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,199
set some contractual conditions

1137
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,440
but our agreement could never know what

1138
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,559
happened it would be completely you know

1139
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,320
useless

1140
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:05,599
however if you and me made an agreement

1141
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,599
and there was another system called an

1142
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,519
oracle mechanism or decentralized oracle

1143
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,920
network that proved what happened

1144
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,838
definitively and you and me pre-agreed

1145
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,039
that whatever this mechanism says is

1146
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,039
what happened

1147
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,400
then we can achieve an entirely new

1148
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,960
level of automation

1149
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,559
right we can suddenly say there's this

1150
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,440
piece of unchained code that's highly

1151
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:25,440
reliable

1152
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,760
we can give it millions billions

1153
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,599
eventually trillions of dollars in value

1154
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,680
and it is controlled by this other

1155
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,480
system over here that's also highly

1156
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,838
reliable

1157
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,920
under this configurable set of

1158
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,679
definitive truth and decentralization

1159
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,920
conditions which we all agree

1160
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:41,199
are sufficiently stringent to control

1161
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,119
that much value

1162
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,118
and therefore the combination of this

1163
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,160
tamper-proof on-chain representation of

1164
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,039
a contract

1165
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,078
and this uh mutually agreed upon

1166
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,759
definition

1167
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:56,640
of a trigger or a proof system

1168
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,760
combined is a hybrid smart contract

1169
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,960
which as you can see

1170
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,920
um probably already does a lot more

1171
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,519
than just a contract on chain right can

1172
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,639
you talk about this consensus mechanism

1173
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,679
which by the way is just

1174
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:12,799
fascinating so there is the on-chain

1175
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,559
consensus mechanism of proof of work and

1176
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,920
proof of stake

1177
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:21,440
and then there is this oracle network

1178
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,960
consensus mechanism of

1179
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,440
what is true so how do you

1180
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,960
can you compare the two like how do you

1181
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,880
achieve that kind of consensus how do

1182
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,440
you achieve security

1183
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:39,200
in integrating data about the world

1184
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,519
in a way that's definitively true

1185
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,439
in a way that is usefully true such that

1186
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,599
we can rely on it in making

1187
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,039
major agreements that as you said

1188
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,640
involve billions of trillions of dollars

1189
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,000
right so this is the challenging this is

1190
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,039
the challenging question right this is

1191
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,400
the challenging

1192
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,800
um problem that oracle networks

1193
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,599
oracles we at chain link that that we

1194
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,680
work on

1195
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,720
in order to create this definitive truth

1196
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,519
to trigger

1197
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,480
and create hyper automation in this more

1198
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,920
advanced form

1199
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,358
more advanced form of hybrid smart

1200
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,760
contracts the the reality i think

1201
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:14,639
of this problem is that it is very

1202
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,000
specific to

1203
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:20,319
each use case and it and this

1204
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,639
is actually how we've architected our

1205
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,920
system is in a very flexible way

1206
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:28,000
so so for example um you need an ability

1207
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,240
for an oracle network to grow in the

1208
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,039
amount of nodes that it has

1209
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,799
relative to the value it secures right

1210
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,119
so if you have an oracle network

1211
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,000
that secures a hundred thousand dollars

1212
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,920
in like a beta of a financial product

1213
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,519
maybe it can be fined with owens only

1214
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,079
seven nodes and only two or three data

1215
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,400
sources

1216
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,920
right because the risk to that to that

1217
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,880
oracle network is relatively low based

1218
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,079
on the value it secures

1219
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,920
so the first question is actually how

1220
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,599
do you scale security relative to value

1221
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,358
secured by that oracle network because

1222
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,519
it wouldn't be very efficient to have

1223
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:04,639
a thousand nodes securing a hundred

1224
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,199
thousand dollars

1225
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,000
worth worth of value so one of the first

1226
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,679
questions is

1227
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,559
how do we properly scale and how do we

1228
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:14,960
compose ensembles of nodes

1229
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,199
in a decentralized way where we can know

1230
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,800
that okay we're going from seven nodes

1231
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:24,000
in a network to 15 to 31 to 57

1232
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,680
to 105 to you know a thousand right

1233
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,358
so that's that's one dimension of the

1234
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:28,000
problem so you have to be scaling the

1235
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:30,559
number of nodes

1236
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,679
relative to the value that's that's

1237
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:34,159
derived

1238
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,879
from the truth integrated into those

1239
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:36,399
nodes

1240
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,920
well that's not the only problem right

1241
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,119
the the other side of this is that

1242
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,760
you're trying to create

1243
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,400
a deterministic result a deterministic

1244
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
output

1245
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,920
from a set of non-deterministic

1246
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,240
disparate systems data sources

1247
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,599
or places that prove things can you also

1248
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,239
just as a decide

1249
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,920
what is an oracle node what is the role

1250
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:57,039
of an oracle node

1251
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,760
sure so an an oracle node essentially

1252
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,480
exists in both places it exists in both

1253
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,440
worlds

1254
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,800
it exists as an on-chain contract that

1255
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,639
represents

1256
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,280
either an oracle network or an oracle

1257
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,960
node so there's an on-chain interface in

1258
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,240
the form of a contract that says

1259
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,960
i i exist to give you this list of

1260
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,959
inputs

1261
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,800
you can request weather data from me you

1262
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,079
can request price data from me

1263
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,480
you can ask me to send the payment

1264
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,680
somewhere like an api so it's a pointer

1265
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,440
to uh

1266
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:29,199
api that uh about that that provides

1267
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,440
truth about this world

1268
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:34,399
it's an interface so just like an api is

1269
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:38,318
an interface for web 2.0 engineers

1270
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,119
um oracle networks and the contracts

1271
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:41,599
that represent

1272
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,400
them or individual nodes are the

1273
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,519
interface

1274
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,720
of web 3.0 use of services

1275
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:52,480
and services includes all services

1276
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:54,799
data payment systems messaging systems

1277
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,559
whatever web 2.0 or any

1278
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,240
kind of computing service that you can

1279
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,880
conceptualize

1280
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:02,399
needs an interface on chain in the form

1281
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,559
of a contract that says

1282
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,160
here are the services i can provide for

1283
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,199
you here are the transactions you need

1284
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,879
to send me

1285
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:11,118
to get back this data or that

1286
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,559
computation or this result

1287
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,160
and then what you actually see is that

1288
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,960
the centralized oracle networks because

1289
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:18,719
they're uniquely capable of generating

1290
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,000
their own computations in a

1291
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,480
decentralized way around

1292
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,280
the data that they have access to you

1293
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,800
actually see

1294
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,400
the centralized oracle networks

1295
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,359
generating a lot of these services so

1296
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,440
for example

1297
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:30,639
we have a randomness service a

1298
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,440
verifiable randomness

1299
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,078
function service that basically provides

1300
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,280
randomness

1301
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,720
on chain and that randomness is then

1302
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,160
used in lotteries and various other

1303
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:41,838
contracts that need randomness

1304
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,598
but that randomness that's not a piece

1305
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:45,199
of data that comes from somewhere else

1306
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,519
we don't go to another

1307
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,879
data source and get it we generate it

1308
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,838
within an oracle node

1309
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,280
that then provides it over into oracle

1310
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:54,400
node or oracle nodes that provide it

1311
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,079
into the contracts

1312
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,720
themselves so why do you say oracle

1313
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,400
nodes are non-deterministic

1314
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,919
well they they are as far as they come

1315
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,160
to consensus but there's

1316
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,000
see there's there's there's this kind of

1317
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,960
different problem here right the

1318
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,960
blockchains are very focused on

1319
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,519
generating blocks of transactions within

1320
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,440
a smaller universe of transaction types

1321
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,800
a certain block size and a certain set

1322
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,200
of conditions

1323
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,079
and and then they have a economic system

1324
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,318
that says

1325
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,119
you i will perpetually generate blocks

1326
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:25,119
of this size

1327
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,400
with these transaction types in in this

1328
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,240
kind of limited set of

1329
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,318
transaction types whether those are utxo

1330
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,519
transactions or scripted

1331
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:35,279
solidity or whatever it is oracles and

1332
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:36,719
oracle networks they're um

1333
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,640
we don't have a blockchain for example

1334
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:41,598
there is no chain-link blockchain our

1335
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,159
our goal is not to generate a certain

1336
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,400
set of

1337
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,279
very clearly predetermined transaction

1338
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,119
types

1339
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,280
into a set of transactions that are put

1340
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,640
into blocks and will infinitely be you

1341
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,599
know done that way

1342
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,719
our goal is actually to create what we

1343
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,400
call a meta layer

1344
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,879
a decentralized made a layer between the

1345
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,240
non-deterministic

1346
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,318
highly um unreliable world and the

1347
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:05,679
highly hyper reliable world of

1348
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,079
blockchains

1349
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:09,598
so that the unreliable world can be

1350
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,000
passed through this decentralized meta

1351
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,000
layer

1352
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,079
and it can co-exist with the with the

1353
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,838
reliable chain uh unchained world

1354
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,680
exactly it can coexist and in some cases

1355
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,358
the meta layer might generate it

1356
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,879
so that the problem in in giving you

1357
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,358
this straight answer is that there's

1358
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,119
just such a wide array of services

1359
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,880
right right if you were to say well

1360
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,720
sergey how how do we

1361
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,000
generate randomness from a data source

1362
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,199
well we don't use a data source to

1363
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,559
generate the randomness

1364
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,118
that's the type of service that can be

1365
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,239
generated in an oracle network itself

1366
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,000
and so there will be certain

1367
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,639
computations that oracle networks

1368
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,199
themselves

1369
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,879
generate themselves to augment and

1370
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:44,559
improve blockchains

1371
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,079
and it is actually the goal of oracle's

1372
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,519
to consistently do that so if you were

1373
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,079
to think about

1374
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:50,800
the stack in a very generic high level

1375
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,400
you would see

1376
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,839
blockchains or databases they're

1377
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,800
basically the data structures that

1378
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:56,400
retain

1379
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,400
a lot of information in this transparent

1380
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,119
highly reliable form

1381
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,760
smart contract code is the application

1382
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,519
logic

1383
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,680
it is it is the logic under which all of

1384
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,440
this kind of activity occurs

1385
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,358
um you know storing data in the in the

1386
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,159
data structure in the in the blockchain

1387
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,598
as a database in in in a certain

1388
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,960
conceptualization of it

1389
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:20,318
and then oracles and oracle networks

1390
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,679
are all the services that are used by

1391
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:24,159
the application code

1392
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:25,519
so you know by analogy let's take uber

1393
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:28,719
uber initially

1394
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:30,079
some core code goes and gets the gps api

1395
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,159
from google maps about the user's

1396
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,119
location sends a message to the user

1397
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:36,159
through twilio

1398
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,079
pays the driver through stripe if those

1399
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:39,039
services weren't available to the people

1400
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,560
who made uber

1401
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,519
they wouldn't have made uber right

1402
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,039
because they would have written their

1403
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,159
core code on some database

1404
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,880
and then they would have had to make a

1405
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,519
geolocation company a telecom messaging

1406
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,440
company

1407
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,639
and the global payments company and they

1408
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,519
wouldn't have done that because it's too

1409
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:53,679
hard

1410
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,280
and that's the weird scenario that a lot

1411
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,279
of people in our industry are in

1412
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,880
and that's the problem that oracle's and

1413
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,720
oracle networks fix

1414
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,559
is they provide these decentralized

1415
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:04,959
services to take

1416
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:05,838
um this developer ecosystem the

1417
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,760
blockchain

1418
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,119
and smart contract developer ecosystem

1419
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,800
from hey

1420
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,119
i can have a database and write some

1421
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,839
application logic about tokenization and

1422
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,358
voting

1423
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:16,960
and private key signing all of which is

1424
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:18,159
super useful and is a critical

1425
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,240
foundation

1426
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,519
but now if you just lay around all the

1427
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,439
world's services

1428
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:25,519
whether that's market data weather data

1429
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,318
randomness suddenly people can build

1430
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:28,559
defy

1431
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:31,039
fraud proof gaming fraud proof global

1432
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:33,358
trade fraud proof ad networks

1433
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:35,119
and and that's why this world of

1434
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,239
decentralized services and decentralized

1435
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,480
oracle networks

1436
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:39,679
is particularly you know in my opinion

1437
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,519
important to our industry

1438
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:42,639
yeah it's funny and you you you talk

1439
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,039
about that the current sort of

1440
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:48,159
decentralized world d5 but decentralized

1441
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:50,159
services world is primarily just tokens

1442
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,838
and it's basically just financial

1443
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,399
transactions

1444
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:55,838
and the kind of thing the reason why

1445
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,119
it's super exciting the kind of thing

1446
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:58,078
you're doing with chain link and oracle

1447
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,160
networks

1448
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,000
is that you can basically open up the

1449
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:05,519
whole world of services

1450
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,280
to into this kind of uh

1451
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:12,639
decentralized smart contract world

1452
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,280
i mean you're talking about

1453
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:17,759
just orders of magnitude greater impact

1454
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,519
financially and just

1455
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,359
socially and philosophically

1456
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,920
are there interesting near-term and

1457
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,440
long-term applications that excite you

1458
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,960
yeah there's there's a lot that excites

1459
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,159
me and that is how i think about it that

1460
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,760
it's not just about we made a

1461
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,440
decentralized oracle network

1462
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,520
it's about we made a decentralized

1463
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,519
service or collection of services that's

1464
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,039
going from hundreds to thousands

1465
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,039
and then people are able to build the

1466
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,119
hybrid smart contracts which i think

1467
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,559
will redefine what our industry is about

1468
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,079
because for example for the people that

1469
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:46,400
only learned about blockchains through

1470
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,039
the

1471
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,318
lens of nfts they understand blockchains

1472
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,759
through nfts

1473
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:53,838
not through speculative tokens or

1474
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,400
bitcoins right and i think that

1475
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,239
that that will continue i i think the

1476
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,240
use cases that excite me

1477
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,559
they vary between the developed uh

1478
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:02,959
market that developed worlds economies

1479
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:05,199
and

1480
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,240
emerging markets i think in the

1481
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,118
developed world

1482
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,159
what you will see is that transparency

1483
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,960
creating

1484
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,440
a level a new level of information for

1485
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,760
how

1486
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,200
markets work and the risk that is in

1487
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,920
markets and

1488
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,879
kind of the dynamics that put the global

1489
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,680
financial system

1490
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:25,200
at systemic financial risk like 2008 and

1491
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:26,159
my hope is that all of this

1492
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:29,838
infrastructure will

1493
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:31,679
will soften the boom and bust cycles

1494
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,838
by making information immediately

1495
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:35,358
available to all market participants

1496
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:37,599
which is by the way what all market

1497
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:38,078
participants want except for the very

1498
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,318
very very

1499
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,680
small minority that are able to game the

1500
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:43,599
system and their benefit

1501
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,598
and benefit from booms but avoid busts

1502
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,800
because of their asymmetric access to

1503
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,559
information which really everybody

1504
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,680
should have and which this technically

1505
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,760
solves

1506
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,358
i think in the process of doing that and

1507
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,240
which is happening i think right about

1508
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:56,558
now

1509
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:58,159
you see a polishing of the technology

1510
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,519
such that it can be made available to

1511
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,558
emerging markets

1512
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:04,480
and on a personal level i feel that um

1513
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,000
the emerging markets will benefit much

1514
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,838
more from this technology

1515
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,440
just like the emerging markets benefit

1516
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:12,318
much more from the internet

1517
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,679
or from those you know 50 android phones

1518
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:15,838
that people can have

1519
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,838
because it's it's such a massive shift

1520
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,759
in how people's lives work right

1521
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:21,759
i have always had access to books and a

1522
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,119
library which has been fantastic and

1523
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,559
very important

1524
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,318
but there are places in the world where

1525
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,319
people don't have libraries

1526
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:29,838
but they now they have the internet and

1527
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:31,440
a 50 android phone

1528
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,599
and they can watch the same stanford

1529
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,800
lecture that i watch i mean that's kind

1530
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,039
of mind-blowing

1531
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,200
realistically right they they just went

1532
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,239
from zero to one in a very very dramatic

1533
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,358
way

1534
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:45,598
i think all of these smart contracts

1535
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,119
and in in my case i think the one that i

1536
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,318
seem to keep coming back to is crop

1537
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,838
insurance

1538
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:51,358
where partly because it doesn't have a

1539
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:53,119
tokenization component partly because

1540
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:56,480
it's actually much more important than

1541
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,838
than it might seem um what is crop

1542
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,679
insurance

1543
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:03,039
right so exactly so so this this this is

1544
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,639
the nature of why it's sometimes

1545
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,000
hard to see the full value of what our

1546
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:07,679
industry does because it solves all

1547
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,880
these kinds of back-end problems that we

1548
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,838
don't have right so

1549
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:14,160
crop insurance is if i own a farm and it

1550
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:16,318
doesn't rain i get an insurance payout

1551
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,440
so i don't need to close down my farm

1552
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:20,318
because if it didn't rain

1553
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,280
i don't have crops right so people in

1554
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,558
the developed world

1555
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,240
can get crop insurance and there's

1556
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,519
all kinds of systems that basically pay

1557
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:28,078
them out and then they can argue with

1558
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:29,759
the legal

1559
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,839
with the insurance company if they don't

1560
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:35,040
get paid out properly and whatever

1561
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:36,000
and this allows people to smooth out

1562
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,838
risk

1563
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,039
in fact a lot of the global options

1564
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:40,639
markets

1565
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,639
were about this right they were

1566
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:44,480
initially about people selling

1567
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:45,679
their produce or their crops ahead of

1568
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,599
time so that

1569
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:49,358
if there was a risk of drought they

1570
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,039
weren't impacted by it

1571
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,039
right and that's where a lot of options

1572
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:53,679
trading and all this kind of stuff came

1573
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:54,960
from

1574
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,039
even though it's now turned into this

1575
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,440
kind of global casino

1576
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:01,279
but in the emerging market there are

1577
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,519
there are literally people that

1578
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,960
if they don't have rain for two seasons

1579
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:07,280
they need to close down their farm and

1580
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,159
become a migrant worker of some kind

1581
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,160
and now they have a 50 android phone

1582
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,558
where they can read wikipedia

1583
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:16,000
but they're still decades away from an

1584
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,240
insurance company coming to their

1585
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,920
geography and offering them insurance

1586
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,358
because their local legal system simply

1587
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,000
doesn't allow that type of thing to

1588
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:23,440
exist

1589
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,599
no insurance companies going to go and

1590
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,000
create insurance entity and offer them

1591
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,760
insurance

1592
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,199
because you know the levels of fraud and

1593
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,280
the ability to resolve that fraud

1594
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,118
through courts would just not exist

1595
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,920
so now these people have to wait for

1596
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,119
decades to have this very basic form of

1597
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,599
financial protection

1598
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,760
or or something like a bank account even

1599
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,519
and with this technology they don't

1600
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,599
right so with this technology if i have

1601
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:48,239
a 50 android phone

1602
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,920
and the smart contract has data from

1603
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:51,199
satellites or weather stations about the

1604
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,680
weather conditions

1605
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:54,799
in the geography that my farm is in i

1606
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:57,519
can i can

1607
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,359
put value into the smart contract and

1608
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,599
the smart contract will automatically

1609
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:02,719
pay me out back pay me back out at my

1610
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,359
android phone

1611
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,558
and and guess what i just leapfrogged

1612
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:08,639
past

1613
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,960
my corrupt government not being able to

1614
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:12,318
to provide um a legal infrastructure to

1615
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,240
create insurance

1616
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:15,599
i just leap frog past dealing with

1617
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:16,799
insurance companies that'll probably

1618
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,838
price gouge me

1619
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,599
and and and and often not pay out and i

1620
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:24,639
leapfrogged into the world

1621
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,039
of hyper reliable

1622
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:28,318
kind of guaranteed smart contract

1623
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:29,759
outcomes that are as good

1624
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,440
or in many cases better than what

1625
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,640
farmers in all parts of other parts of

1626
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,159
the world have

1627
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,078
and this type of dynamic for the

1628
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:38,000
emerging markets of creating a way for

1629
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,200
people to control and manage risk in

1630
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,280
their economic life

1631
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:42,879
i think extends way past insurance it

1632
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,319
extends to them having bank accounts to

1633
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,838
combat local inflation

1634
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:47,838
it extends to them being able to sell

1635
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:49,440
their goods on the global free market of

1636
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,679
global trade without middlemen

1637
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,280
it extends to all these things that we

1638
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,799
don't really care about right because

1639
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,680
we're not farmers

1640
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,440
but are unbelievably impactful for

1641
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,239
people that don't have a bank account

1642
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,679
and their

1643
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:03,279
inflation rate in their country is

1644
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,279
double digits

1645
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,440
or their farm completely depends our

1646
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,079
reign or their livelihood completely

1647
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,519
depends on their ability to sell goods

1648
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,280
and they can't sell those goods because

1649
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:14,639
there's a middleman who

1650
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,280
essentially controls all the trust

1651
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,000
relationships but now now we have the

1652
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,920
internet and smart

1653
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,039
contracts and that might not have to be

1654
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,960
the case in

1655
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,239
in in the next five or ten years yeah so

1656
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,159
that definitely has a

1657
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,679
quality of life impact on the particular

1658
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,960
farmer's life but

1659
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:32,719
i suspect it has a huge

1660
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,400
like down the line ripple effect on the

1661
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:37,439
whole supply chain so if

1662
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:41,119
you think about farmers but any

1663
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,480
other people that produce things

1664
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:47,920
that are part of a large

1665
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,880
like logistics network like supply chain

1666
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,880
network

1667
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:56,400
that means when you increase reliability

1668
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,519
you sort of increase uh transparency and

1669
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,760
control

1670
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:01,838
but like where any one node in that

1671
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:06,240
supply chain network

1672
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:08,719
can formalize the way it operates

1673
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:09,439
in in its agreements with others then

1674
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:14,719
you could just

1675
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:17,280
have a very like at scale transformative

1676
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:19,679
effect on how

1677
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,359
people that down the line use the

1678
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:22,558
services that you provide the products

1679
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:25,920
that you create

1680
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:29,040
operate so like it's almost hard to

1681
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,480
imagine the the possible ways it might

1682
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,639
transform the world

1683
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,920
i i wonder how much friction there is in

1684
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:36,400
the system i guess

1685
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,440
currently that uh smart contracts might

1686
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,639
remove

1687
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,559
that's so that's a that's almost unknown

1688
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,318
you can sort of hypothesize and stuff

1689
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,640
but i wonder

1690
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,759
i've seen enough bureaucracy in my world

1691
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,000
in my life

1692
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,559
to know that smart contracts in many

1693
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,760
cases would remove bureaucracy

1694
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,000
and i wonder how the world will be once

1695
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,559
you

1696
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,079
remove much of the bureaucracy coming

1697
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,359
from the soviet union

1698
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:06,400
where i just have seen the

1699
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:09,440
life sucked out of

1700
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,480
the innovative spirit of human nature

1701
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,159
by bureaucracy i wonder

1702
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,838
you know the kind of amazing world that

1703
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:17,838
could be created once bureaucracy is

1704
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:19,599
removed

1705
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:21,279
yeah i i i think it's i think it's

1706
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,160
fascinating how the world can

1707
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:26,079
can evolve i i think this extends a lot

1708
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:28,000
further than people think into many many

1709
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:31,119
different parts of the global economy

1710
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,960
it might start with nfts for art or it

1711
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,880
might start with defy

1712
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,480
right or it might start with fraud proof

1713
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,160
ad networks next

1714
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,719
we we don't know what it's going to go

1715
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:44,318
to next but i think the implication

1716
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:46,558
of people being in a system of contracts

1717
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:48,880
that holds them accountable and

1718
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:51,280
guarantees contractual outcomes

1719
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,720
regardless of a local legal system is

1720
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,240
something that i think extends

1721
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,159
you know to the supply chain you can

1722
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:58,479
prove that goods were sourced

1723
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:00,078
in an ethical way and you can prove that

1724
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,039
in a way that can't be gamed

1725
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,760
that'll change buying power and supplier

1726
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:05,599
power and

1727
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,119
and how people produce goods that we all

1728
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,519
consume and then

1729
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,039
on the political level i personally

1730
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:13,519
think that in a number of

1731
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,079
decades we could literally be in a place

1732
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,639
where

1733
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,240
politicians can commit to a certain set

1734
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:21,440
of smart contract

1735
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:23,358
um kind of budget definitional

1736
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,480
kind of results for example you know we

1737
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:26,159
discovered oil

1738
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,119
i promise as a politician i'm going to

1739
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:29,118
take the oil and i'm going to

1740
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,960
redistribute it to all of you

1741
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,798
well that's wonderful that's a great

1742
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,159
idea sounds very nice when you when

1743
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:35,759
you're running for office

1744
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:37,920
why don't we codify that in a smart

1745
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,720
contract and why don't we put those

1746
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,760
conditions

1747
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:43,919
very solidly on a blockchain and then

1748
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,599
once once you you you've been elected

1749
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,200
we'll just turn that one on

1750
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,798
and it'll it'll it'll distribute the

1751
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,798
money just like you said

1752
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:52,079
and everything will be fine i i

1753
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:54,639
personally think that this

1754
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,240
new level of systems that allows

1755
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:58,078
trustworthy collaboration

1756
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:00,239
between everybody between supply chain

1757
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,440
partners ad network users the financial

1758
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:04,399
system

1759
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,880
insurance companies and farmers all of

1760
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,358
these

1761
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,720
are just interactions that require a

1762
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:10,960
trusted

1763
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:12,078
entity or in this case a trusted piece

1764
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,720
of code

1765
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,280
to orchestrate the interaction in the

1766
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:18,318
way

1767
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,280
that everyone agrees yeah one of the

1768
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:21,039
things that makes

1769
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,960
the united states fascinating is the

1770
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:24,960
founding documents

1771
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,199
and it's fascinating to think of us

1772
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,480
moving into the new in the 21st century

1773
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:31,358
to a a digital version of that so the

1774
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,400
constitution

1775
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:36,318
a smart constitution no offense to the

1776
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,639
uh paper constitution

1777
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:40,639
but and i would change that would have

1778
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:41,199
transformative effects on politicians

1779
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:45,519
and

1780
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:49,519
governments holding people accountable

1781
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:53,759
oh man i that's so that's so exciting

1782
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:58,239
to think that um we might

1783
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:00,960
enforce uh accountability

1784
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:02,479
through the smart contract process

1785
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,400
exactly why can't that happen

1786
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,599
anything that we could codify into a

1787
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,440
smart contract

1788
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,039
and anything that we all agree is the

1789
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,960
way the world should work

1790
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:12,239
and then anything that we can get proof

1791
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,400
about right

1792
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:15,838
anything that a system somewhere could

1793
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,960
tell us happened

1794
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:21,599
those are the pieces of the puzzle right

1795
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,880
we need a trusted piece of code we need

1796
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,480
to have agreement

1797
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,079
that that's how the world should work

1798
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,318
and we need a system that will tell that

1799
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:30,720
trusted piece of code what happened

1800
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,318
as as long as we have those three things

1801
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:35,199
we can theoretically codify

1802
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:36,318
any set of agreements about uh about

1803
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:38,558
about anything

1804
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:39,679
where those three properties uh take

1805
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,280
hold

1806
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:43,279
i wonder if you can apply that to like

1807
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:47,200
military conflict and so on

1808
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:49,119
uh recently uh the biden announced that

1809
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:50,000
we're going to pull off from afghanistan

1810
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,599
after 20

1811
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:57,519
20 years in the war i wonder

1812
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:59,838
there's a lot of tobacco debacles around

1813
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:00,880
war in afghanistan and invasion of iraq

1814
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:03,358
all those kinds of things

1815
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:06,240
i wonder if that was instead formulated

1816
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:10,000
as a smart contract

1817
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:13,118
like uh that might have actually huge

1818
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,400
impact on the way we do conflict so you

1819
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,280
think of uh

1820
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,639
smart contract as a as a kind of win-win

1821
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,319
situation where you're doing

1822
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:22,558
like financial transactions or something

1823
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:24,079
like that but you could see that also

1824
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,559
about

1825
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,200
military conflict or like whenever two

1826
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,400
nations

1827
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:31,838
are attention with each other different

1828
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:36,720
scales of conflict

1829
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:38,880
that you can have conflict codified

1830
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,879
and that would potentially resolve

1831
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,798
conflict much faster

1832
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,240
because there's honesty transparency and

1833
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:46,079
control within that conflict because

1834
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:49,519
there's conflict in this world

1835
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,720
and i i again very very inspiring to

1836
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:52,880
think about

1837
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:54,480
the the kind of effects it might have on

1838
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,400
the on

1839
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,599
on the negative kinds of contracts and

1840
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,079
the tense

1841
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,519
painful kinds of contracts i i haven't

1842
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,039
thought about that as much it's actually

1843
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:04,159
kind of scary the stuff you're

1844
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,159
you're thinking through now with like

1845
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:07,519
the war contract or something you know

1846
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:07,838
that's not in the white paper we don't

1847
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:09,519
have

1848
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:11,599
anything about war contracts or anything

1849
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:13,358
again this is the the russian uh

1850
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,200
we're both russian but i'm a little more

1851
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:17,199
russian uh in the suffering side

1852
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:20,558
maybe i read way too much dostoyevsky

1853
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:23,598
and military kind of ideas but

1854
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:26,079
anyway holding politicians accountable

1855
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,440
in all forms i think is really powerful

1856
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,119
is there something you could say

1857
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,880
as a small side on how

1858
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,559
smart contracts actually work if you

1859
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,000
look at the code is there some nice way

1860
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,880
to say

1861
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,318
technically what is a smart contract

1862
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,559
what does it mean to codify

1863
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:46,318
these agreements the actual process for

1864
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:48,559
people who might not at all be familiar

1865
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,838
i i think you just write it into code

1866
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,359
that operates

1867
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:53,759
in this kind of decentralized

1868
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,279
infrastructure you you usually write

1869
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,079
code that runs in a central server

1870
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,559
somewhere

1871
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:59,760
now you write code that runs um across a

1872
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,359
lot of different machines in this

1873
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,440
decentralized way

1874
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:05,358
and then after you write it you need

1875
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,119
services and that's where oracle's come

1876
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:09,199
in they provide all the services

1877
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,119
so just like you would be writing code

1878
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,719
in web 2.0 land running it on a server

1879
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,358
somewhere and using an api

1880
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:16,798
here you'd be writing code putting it on

1881
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:17,598
a decentralized infrastructure like a

1882
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:19,039
blockchain

1883
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,119
or a smart contract platform like

1884
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:22,558
ethereum and then you would be using

1885
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,160
various services

1886
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,920
in the form of oracle so they'll just be

1887
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:27,358
called oracles or decentralized services

1888
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,200
instead of apis

1889
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,039
and you're you're basically composing

1890
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,519
the same type of architecture

1891
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:35,039
except it's hyper reliable at the moment

1892
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:35,599
it's a little bit less efficient because

1893
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:37,920
you know the

1894
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,119
state there's an early stage to to our

1895
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,240
industry

1896
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,119
but it provides this extreme level of

1897
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:45,439
reliability

1898
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,160
and transparency which for certain use

1899
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,200
cases

1900
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:50,798
is an absolute critical component and

1901
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:52,639
is completely reinventing how they work

1902
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:53,838
so i i think people should look at what

1903
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:55,358
are the use cases

1904
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:57,358
where that trust dynamic can be so

1905
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:58,239
heavily improved and that's probably the

1906
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:00,880
ones where this is

1907
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:02,318
maybe initially useful but i mean just

1908
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,400
to emphasize i don't think

1909
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:05,798
people realize when you say code that

1910
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:09,039
we're talking about

1911
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:11,119
non-obfuscated actual program

1912
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:12,558
like you can read it you can understand

1913
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,680
it yeah and it's

1914
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:17,519
there's something about uh maybe this is

1915
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:19,440
my computer science perspective of

1916
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:20,559
like software engineering perspective

1917
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,358
but there's something about the

1918
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:26,960
formalism of programming languages

1919
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:30,318
which enforces simplicity and clarity

1920
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:33,039
and transparency and because it's

1921
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:34,000
seen to everybody i mean simplicity is

1922
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:35,519
enforced

1923
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,679
there's no there's something about

1924
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:39,599
natural language like language

1925
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:40,719
as written in the constitution for

1926
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:44,318
example

1927
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:47,519
where there's so many interpretations

1928
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:49,759
with the the nice thing about programs

1929
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:51,519
there's no there's not going to be a

1930
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,000
huge number of books written about

1931
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:56,318
what was meant by this particular line

1932
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,838
because it's pretty clear

1933
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:00,318
like programming languages have a

1934
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:04,318
clarity to them that natural language

1935
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:06,639
does not and they don't have ambiguity

1936
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:09,038
which i think it's important to pause on

1937
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,318
because it's really powerful it's really

1938
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,240
difficult to think about i think we live

1939
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:13,759
in a world where all the philosophers

1940
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,959
and legal minds

1941
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,520
don't know how to program so i think not

1942
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,880
all

1943
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:23,280
most don't and so we don't often see

1944
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,160
the philosophical impact of this kind of

1945
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,640
idea

1946
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:28,000
that the agreements between humans can

1947
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:30,400
be written

1948
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,960
in a programming language that's a

1949
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:36,240
really transformative idea

1950
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,440
that i mean yeah it's it's uh it's an

1951
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:39,679
idea that's not just

1952
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,880
technical it's not just financial it's

1953
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:43,118
philosophical

1954
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,280
it's rethinking human nature from a

1955
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:48,160
digital perspective

1956
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:51,039
the like what is human civilization it's

1957
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:54,239
interaction between humans

1958
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:55,760
and rethinking that interaction as a

1959
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:58,000
digital interaction

1960
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,039
that is managed by programming languages

1961
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,199
by programs

1962
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,880
by code i mean that's that's fascinating

1963
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:06,719
that we'll look back at this time

1964
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,760
potentially

1965
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:12,480
as one where us little descendants of

1966
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,480
apes did not realize how

1967
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,000
how trans how important this moment in

1968
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,920
history is

1969
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,760
like human beings might be totally

1970
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:23,599
different

1971
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:25,920
a century from now because we codified

1972
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,519
the interaction between humans that

1973
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,639
might have more of an impact than

1974
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:31,119
anything else

1975
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:32,719
we do today you think about the impact

1976
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,519
of the internet one of the cool things

1977
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:37,038
is the digitization of data but we have

1978
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:40,960
not yet integrated

1979
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:42,960
the the tools the mechanisms fully

1980
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,480
that use that data and interact with

1981
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,679
humans yet and that's what smart

1982
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,599
contracts do

1983
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:50,159
i wonder if you think about the role of

1984
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:54,880
artificial intelligence in all of this

1985
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:57,519
because your smart contracts are kind of

1986
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,480
agreements maybe you disagree with this

1987
01:03:57,519 --> 01:03:59,838
but

1988
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,599
at least the way i'm thinking about it

1989
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:05,599
is agreements between humans

1990
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:07,359
or groups of humans but it seems like

1991
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:10,640
because everything is operating in the

1992
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:14,078
digital space that you can integrate

1993
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:16,719
non-humans into this or ai

1994
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,440
systems that help out humans managed by

1995
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:20,959
humans

1996
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:24,639
like what do you think about a world

1997
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,639
of hybrid smart contracts

1998
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:31,760
codifying agreements

1999
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:32,879
between uh hybrid intelligent being

2000
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,319
networks

2001
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,119
of humans and ai systems yeah yeah i

2002
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:39,358
think that makes

2003
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,400
i think that makes perfect sense in in

2004
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:43,038
terms of ai

2005
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,680
um i'm not an expert right so it might

2006
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,799
be a bit

2007
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:49,279
simplistic or naive my my ideas in

2008
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:51,358
in this field i i think you know

2009
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,720
everyone saw the terminator movie

2010
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:54,880
right everybody kind of saw the

2011
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:57,358
terminator movie in the 90s

2012
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,960
and it was like this is really scary um

2013
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:00,960
i personally think ai is

2014
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,000
is is amazing it makes makes perfect

2015
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,480
sense

2016
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,358
i think it will evolve to a place where

2017
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,760
people

2018
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:09,440
have you know just to understand i work

2019
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,640
in the world of trust issues right i

2020
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,039
work in the world of

2021
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:14,000
how can technology solve trust and

2022
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,240
collaboration

2023
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,159
issues using encryption using

2024
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:19,919
cryptographically guaranteed systems

2025
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:21,199
using decentralized infrastructure right

2026
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,240
so that's the world that i've been

2027
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:24,639
inhabiting

2028
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:26,239
for um you know many many years now

2029
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:27,440
building smart contracts for seven or

2030
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:29,118
eight doing stuff before that

2031
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,119
it's it's it's kind of what i'm focused

2032
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:33,519
on so i view ai

2033
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:35,119
through that same lens and my brain

2034
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:35,759
naturally asks well what is the trust

2035
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,079
issue

2036
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,200
that people might have with ai and my

2037
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,079
natural

2038
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:43,679
kind of response is well let's say ai

2039
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:46,960
continues to be built

2040
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:48,798
and improve at some point i have no clue

2041
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,440
where we are on this now i've i've seen

2042
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:51,038
different

2043
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,720
ideas that were very far from this i've

2044
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,240
seen other ideas very close to this

2045
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:56,558
at a certain point we'd arrive at a

2046
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:58,639
place with ai where we would be

2047
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,400
a little bit worried about just how much

2048
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:02,159
it could do right we might be worried

2049
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,119
that ai could do things

2050
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,519
we don't want it to do but we still want

2051
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:08,240
to give

2052
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:09,119
ai a level of control over our lives

2053
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:11,838
right so

2054
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:13,358
in my world that's a trust issue and the

2055
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:14,960
way that that trust issue would be

2056
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:16,960
solved with blockchains

2057
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:20,400
is is actually very straightforward and

2058
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,559
i think in its simplicity quite powerful

2059
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,880
you could have an ai that has an ability

2060
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:28,559
to do and control

2061
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:31,039
key parts of your and our lives right

2062
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,440
but then you could limit it with private

2063
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,960
keys and blockchains

2064
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:39,440
and create certain guard rails and firm

2065
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,440
kind of

2066
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:44,239
walls and limits to what the ai could

2067
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:47,038
never go past

2068
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:47,679
assuming that encryption right that

2069
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,839
encryption

2070
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,679
continues to work right and assuming

2071
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:54,558
that if it's not that ai's

2072
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:56,159
specialization to break encryption that

2073
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,359
it wouldn't be able to do that right so

2074
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:59,759
if you have an ai

2075
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:01,519
that controls um something very

2076
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,599
important whatever it is

2077
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:04,880
shipping or something in defense or

2078
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,480
something in um

2079
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,240
you know the financial system whatever

2080
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,440
it is but you're sitting there and

2081
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:11,838
you're kind of worried hey

2082
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,119
you know this thing is unbelievable it's

2083
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:14,798
coming up with things i you know we

2084
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,200
wouldn't have thought of in 100 years

2085
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:17,838
but maybe it's a little too unbelievable

2086
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,358
um

2087
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:23,679
how do you limit it well if you bake

2088
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:25,038
in private keys and you bake in these

2089
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:28,078
kind of blockchain

2090
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,880
based limitations you can create the

2091
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,760
conditions

2092
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:33,519
beyond which an ai could never act and

2093
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,200
those could once again be codified in

2094
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:37,038
the very specific

2095
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:38,639
um unambiguous terms in which you

2096
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:40,880
described which

2097
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,239
once again in my trust issue focused

2098
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,358
world would

2099
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:46,879
solve the trust issue for users and make

2100
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:49,519
them comfortable with

2101
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,640
using the ai or seeding control to the

2102
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:53,119
ai

2103
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:53,759
which i think in more advanced versions

2104
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:55,920
of ai

2105
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,039
will continue to be a concern right this

2106
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,639
is fascinating

2107
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,799
so smart contracts actually provide a

2108
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:02,480
mechanism for human supervision of ai

2109
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:04,480
systems

2110
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,920
for the encryption very encryption heavy

2111
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,400
so it's not about like

2112
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,720
is it smarter than us it's about will

2113
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,880
the encryption hold up yep

2114
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,959
so we that's based on the assumption

2115
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,480
that the encryption holds up

2116
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,000
i think that's a safe assumption we can

2117
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:20,559
get into that whole discussion

2118
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,158
but from quantum computing but cracking

2119
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,600
encryption is very difficult that's a

2120
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:25,439
whole another discussion right

2121
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,520
i think we're safe on the safe ground

2122
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:32,479
for quite a long time

2123
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,480
assuming encryption holds i um

2124
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:39,359
there's a space that uh is at the

2125
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:41,600
cutting edge of general intelligence

2126
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,880
research in the ai community which is

2127
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,319
the space of

2128
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,279
program synthesis or ai generating

2129
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,480
programs

2130
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,560
that's different than what you're

2131
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:53,759
referring to is

2132
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:56,080
ai being able to generate smart

2133
01:08:53,759 --> 01:09:00,319
contracts

2134
01:08:56,079 --> 01:09:03,519
and that to me is kind of fascinating

2135
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:06,960
to think of especially two ai systems

2136
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:10,640
between each other generating contracts

2137
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:13,119
sort of almost creating a world

2138
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,279
where most of the contracts are between

2139
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:17,358
non-human beings

2140
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:19,199
i i think an ai system as i think about

2141
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,480
it and once again this is not my field

2142
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:22,079
this is something i might watch a

2143
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,919
youtube video on or just see something

2144
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:26,798
interesting about at some point

2145
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:29,199
um i think if i were to just reason

2146
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:31,119
through it even even now

2147
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:34,399
i think the highly deterministic and

2148
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:37,920
guaranteed nature of smart contracts

2149
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:40,798
would probably be preferable to an ai

2150
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,560
because i'm guessing an ai would have a

2151
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:43,679
lot of problems with dealing with the

2152
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,839
human element

2153
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,279
of how contracts work today right so an

2154
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:49,519
ai for example

2155
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,880
couldn't pick up the phone and call you

2156
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,839
know dave

2157
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,440
at a bank to do a derivative and kind of

2158
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:57,359
discuss with dave and have a call with

2159
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:58,799
him and kind of have a conversation and

2160
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,639
make him comfortable

2161
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,560
and tell him it's going to be fine and

2162
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,159
kind of smooth out all the weird

2163
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,080
you know social cues that have to do

2164
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:08,879
with making certain derivatives

2165
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:10,079
i'm assuming that that's a pretty

2166
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,440
complicated

2167
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:17,198
neural map ai kind of problem

2168
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:19,039
um yeah so if i think about it

2169
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:21,119
the deterministic guaranteed nature of

2170
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:23,039
smart contracts

2171
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:25,039
probably would and and if assuming

2172
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:26,960
they're accessible to ais

2173
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:28,479
could actually interestingly enough be

2174
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,719
the format

2175
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,399
that they prefer to codify their

2176
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:35,439
relationship

2177
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:37,599
with non-ai systems

2178
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:38,799
and very possibly other ai systems right

2179
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,079
because

2180
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:44,079
it is very um i mean

2181
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:46,319
it's pretty it's pretty guaranteed right

2182
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:48,238
all the other types of contracts that an

2183
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:52,639
ai could go out there

2184
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:54,559
and seek to do would require

2185
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,159
you know some language processing around

2186
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,719
the law

2187
01:10:56,158 --> 01:10:59,359
and i think um uh i don't know if this

2188
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,600
is a term

2189
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:02,799
but probably not a smart ai or a good ai

2190
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,039
or whatever the term is for a high

2191
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,199
quality ai

2192
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:09,198
would probably realize some of the

2193
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:11,359
limitations and the risks

2194
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:13,039
yeah yeah ai definitely dislikes

2195
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:14,399
ambiguity and would prefer the the

2196
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:16,000
determinism

2197
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:17,439
the deterministic nature of smart

2198
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,119
contracts

2199
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:21,759
i i do wonder about this particular

2200
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:24,960
problem and maybe you can speak to it of

2201
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:27,920
how smart contracts can

2202
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,480
take over certain industries in a sense

2203
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,039
or how

2204
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:32,158
certain industries can convert their

2205
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:35,039
sets of agreements

2206
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:36,479
into smart contracts which is uh you

2207
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,560
mentioned sort of talking to dave from

2208
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:40,399
the bank

2209
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,080
you know many of our laws many of our

2210
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:45,198
agreements are

2211
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:48,158
currently through natural language

2212
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:48,479
through words and so there is a process

2213
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:51,119
of

2214
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,319
mapping that has to occur in order to

2215
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:55,119
convert

2216
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,238
the legal agreements legal contracts of

2217
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:59,279
today

2218
01:11:56,238 --> 01:12:00,959
to smart contracts that by the way ai

2219
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:04,158
may be able to help with

2220
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,079
but as a by way of question how do you

2221
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:09,119
think would convert

2222
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:12,319
the legal contracts on which many

2223
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:14,319
industries currently function today or

2224
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:15,920
not even legal contracts but ambiguous

2225
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:18,799
kind of agreements

2226
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,440
maybe they're loose sometimes into more

2227
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,239
formal

2228
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:24,960
deterministic agreements that are

2229
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:28,238
represented by smart contracts

2230
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,198
so i i think there's two um maybe two

2231
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:32,079
sides to this

2232
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:33,678
um i think the first one is actually not

2233
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:35,359
a huge problem where you have things

2234
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,520
like the is the master agreement for

2235
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:39,439
derivatives or you have these agreements

2236
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,800
that basically already reference a

2237
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:42,799
system somewhere

2238
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,960
right like for example many legal

2239
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,239
agreements already accept e-signature

2240
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,000
and so they're saying hey i'm going to

2241
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:49,198
use this computing system over here

2242
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,399
around signatures

2243
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,238
and i'm going to consider and there's

2244
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:52,719
laws around that and there's clauses

2245
01:12:52,238 --> 01:12:53,919
that say

2246
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,239
signatures good enough for this

2247
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,279
agreement i i actually don't think this

2248
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:59,119
is a big problem

2249
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:00,559
for the vast majority of legal

2250
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:02,640
agreements that use

2251
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,400
systems already right so what you'll do

2252
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,280
is you'll swap out one

2253
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:08,158
uh repository or one or one set of contr

2254
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:10,079
system of contract

2255
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:11,439
settlement and you'll just say hey this

2256
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,439
blockchain system over here

2257
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:14,479
is my new system of contract settlement

2258
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:17,279
whatever it says

2259
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:18,559
is the state of the agreement instead of

2260
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:20,960
you know the centralized

2261
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,159
system over there right and so there's

2262
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,279
actually a huge amount of agreements

2263
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:25,359
that are already

2264
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:26,559
um able to to do that and i think we'll

2265
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,399
we'll do that

2266
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,719
i think there's another side to your

2267
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:33,039
question which is the

2268
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:35,198
amount of agreements that are very

2269
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,000
ambiguous that can be turned into smart

2270
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:38,238
contracts

2271
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,198
and i think the limitation there is is

2272
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:41,678
twofold

2273
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:44,158
first of all like like you said earlier

2274
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:44,399
the highly reliable smart contract and

2275
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:46,000
the

2276
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:48,238
and the lack of opaqueness and the

2277
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,000
clarity of smart contracts

2278
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:53,599
is is is very um high and very powerful

2279
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,520
and very clear

2280
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,800
and it's in my opinion going to be much

2281
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,199
much easier to take

2282
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,400
a smart contract and turn it into a set

2283
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:03,279
of natural language

2284
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:03,519
explanations and just say hey um you

2285
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:06,639
know

2286
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,960
this is what this does right so i think

2287
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,800
that many contracts are and even now in

2288
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,079
decentralized finance and d5

2289
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,800
and decentralized insurance they're

2290
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:16,559
basically being rebuilt in this format

2291
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,079
and and and that rebuilding will make

2292
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,840
them clearer like you said

2293
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:21,198
and then restating those in natural

2294
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,719
language and explaining to people well

2295
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,238
you know if the weather does this it'll

2296
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:25,600
i think it'll actually be a lot simpler

2297
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:27,599
to explain to people what the contract

2298
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,120
is about

2299
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,640
smart contracts it's a natural language

2300
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:31,439
i didn't even think about that so that's

2301
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,719
that's

2302
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:36,000
you're saying that's doable and natural

2303
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:37,279
and easy to do

2304
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,800
because there's so much clear right

2305
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:39,920
there's there's that forced clarity that

2306
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,320
you talked about

2307
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,640
i think the second um aspect of this

2308
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:47,519
problem is the nuance around

2309
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:49,360
what contracts can be made unambiguous

2310
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,040
and i think that comes down to

2311
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:53,119
often comes down to proving what

2312
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:54,560
happened which is where oracle networks

2313
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:56,079
and decentralized oracle networks and

2314
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,920
chain link would come in

2315
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:59,519
and our experience there is you know

2316
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,119
quite extensive over the many years that

2317
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,239
we've worked on many different contract

2318
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:04,800
types

2319
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:05,519
i think what it fundamentally comes down

2320
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,719
to

2321
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:10,480
is whether there is data so we're not

2322
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:11,359
going to be able to make a hybrid smart

2323
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:12,799
contract

2324
01:15:11,359 --> 01:15:14,960
about whether somebody painted your

2325
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,320
house the right color blue

2326
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,239
we're just not going to be doing that

2327
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:19,759
because there's no data feed that tells

2328
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:22,079
us that your house was painted blue or

2329
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:24,079
that it was the right color of blue

2330
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:25,679
you know unless somebody sets up a drone

2331
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:28,319
with a color analysis

2332
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:29,920
tool and they generate that data which

2333
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:31,279
by the way could be possible right

2334
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,279
they could there could be if there's

2335
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:35,439
enough demand then the service would be

2336
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:37,599
created that has drones flying around

2337
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:39,119
that's telling you about the colors of

2338
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,600
you know all this kind of stuff so if

2339
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:41,439
there's

2340
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,600
actual demand that that would be created

2341
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,039
and because because there'd be value to

2342
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,239
connect that data feed to the smart

2343
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:47,760
contracts and so on

2344
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:49,439
i i think i think you have it

2345
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,360
unbelievably right because there there

2346
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:53,279
are already insurance companies that use

2347
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:54,319
drones to monitor construction sites

2348
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:56,238
from overhead

2349
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:58,000
and see how many people are wearing hard

2350
01:15:56,238 --> 01:15:59,198
hats yeah and if the percentage of

2351
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,560
people wearing hard hats isn't

2352
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:02,799
sufficiently high

2353
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,000
then you know the policy is voided and

2354
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,760
so in that case

2355
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,359
there is a data source and that data

2356
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,159
source can be put into a hybrid smart

2357
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:09,759
contract

2358
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:12,719
so the limitation of hybrid smart

2359
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,719
contracts is is there a data source or a

2360
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,520
set of data sources to create definitive

2361
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,359
truth

2362
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,880
to settle the contract and eliminate

2363
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:22,000
ambiguity

2364
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:24,159
and then as you said i think as people

2365
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,479
realize that smart contracts are a

2366
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:28,719
format in which they can form agreement

2367
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:29,919
about things like that insurance product

2368
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:31,119
around you know how many people are

2369
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,440
wearing hard hats

2370
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:35,519
if i'm the construction site owner well

2371
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:37,198
you know i would really like a guarantee

2372
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,800
that your insurance policy is going to

2373
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:42,238
pay me out

2374
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,920
if everyone is wearing hard hats and

2375
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:46,399
in that case there is demand for the

2376
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,000
data and people will generate the data

2377
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:49,759
and i actually think the insurance

2378
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,520
industry is interestingly a precursor of

2379
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:54,079
this because they're so data driven

2380
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,880
you already see insurance companies

2381
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:57,279
paying

2382
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,039
iot companies to put data into their

2383
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,439
customers infrastructure

2384
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:02,960
at the cost of the insurance company to

2385
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:04,719
generate the data that the insurance

2386
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,679
company uses to make a policy for the

2387
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,480
customer

2388
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,119
so you basically already have people who

2389
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,079
really

2390
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:14,158
want to price data into their agreements

2391
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:17,840
when they're sufficiently high value

2392
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:20,479
paying for their own customers to get

2393
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,279
data sensors into their infrastructure

2394
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:23,519
and i think

2395
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,559
as smart contracts become more of a

2396
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,960
requested

2397
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,159
format or data-driven contracts become

2398
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,520
more of a format

2399
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:32,799
there will be a growing demand about

2400
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,560
proving what happened

2401
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,719
through data so it'll be motivating

2402
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,960
totally new data fees being created

2403
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,158
by the way the the insurance industry

2404
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,960
broadly

2405
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:44,158
the revolutions there will be huge i've

2406
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,840
worked quite a bit with autonomous

2407
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:47,839
vehicles semi-autonomous

2408
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,600
and just vehicles in general the

2409
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:52,079
insurance industry that by the way

2410
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,960
makes a huge amount of money but is

2411
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:58,399
using very crappy data fees

2412
01:17:54,960 --> 01:18:01,439
uh revolutionizing

2413
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:04,479
how like not by crappy i mean very crude

2414
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:07,839
like literally the insurance is based on

2415
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:10,399
things like age gen like basic

2416
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:13,440
demographic information as opposed to

2417
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:15,198
really high resolution information about

2418
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:18,079
you as an individual

2419
01:18:15,198 --> 01:18:18,399
which you may or may not want to provide

2420
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:19,760
so

2421
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:21,759
you can choose from an individual

2422
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,600
perspective to provide a data feed and

2423
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:27,760
there

2424
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:31,199
like the the um

2425
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:34,400
the power of insurance to the indiv

2426
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:35,279
to enable the individual to empower the

2427
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:37,759
individual

2428
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:38,880
could be huge because ultimately smart

2429
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,440
contracts motivate

2430
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,079
the use of data the creation of new data

2431
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:46,079
feeds

2432
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:47,039
but leveraging the the whatever service

2433
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:51,039
it provides

2434
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:54,399
in truth as opposed to some kind of very

2435
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:56,238
loose notion of who you are so that

2436
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:57,839
i'm not again not sure how that would

2437
01:18:56,238 --> 01:19:01,119
change things but

2438
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,159
in terms of um the fundamental

2439
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,920
experience of life

2440
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:06,158
because i think we all rely on insurance

2441
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:09,520
not just in business but in life

2442
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:10,559
and grounding that insurance and more

2443
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:13,360
and more

2444
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,880
accurate representation of reality might

2445
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:15,920
just have transformative effects on

2446
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,600
society

2447
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,520
well just to mention one quick thing

2448
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,640
that you said where i noticed another

2449
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,239
trust issue

2450
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,320
you said the user might not want to

2451
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:25,039
share their data yes so what you could

2452
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:27,039
actually do

2453
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:28,800
and what we've already worked on is you

2454
01:19:27,039 --> 01:19:31,359
can have a smart contract

2455
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,800
that holds the data and evaluates the

2456
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:34,479
data of the user

2457
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,560
without sharing it with the insurance

2458
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,158
companies and the insurance company

2459
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:40,400
knows that the smart contract will

2460
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:42,799
evaluate it according to the policy

2461
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:45,198
they don't need the data and the and and

2462
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,719
the user can provide the data

2463
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:48,238
knowing it'll never touch the insurance

2464
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:49,760
company because it's only provided to

2465
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:51,759
the smart contract

2466
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,760
and suddenly you've solved another trust

2467
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,400
issue because an autonomous piece of

2468
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:57,280
code

2469
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:58,158
can evaluate information separately from

2470
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:00,559
the interests

2471
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:02,158
of both of the counterparties and so

2472
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,920
this is the recurring theme i think

2473
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:05,198
you're seeing this recurring theme where

2474
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:06,800
there's a trust issue

2475
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:09,198
people can't use the system they can't

2476
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,639
collaborate they can't share information

2477
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:12,000
that would make a better agreement for

2478
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,239
both of them they can't

2479
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,158
you know solve a risk in their daily

2480
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:17,519
life they can't participate in a market

2481
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:18,960
they can't have a bank account because

2482
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,159
nobody will give it to them because

2483
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,639
you know they can't give it to them in

2484
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:24,559
that legal system and

2485
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:26,239
once you have an autonomous piece of

2486
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,480
code that can also

2487
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:30,079
know what's going on thanks to oracle

2488
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:30,559
networks and that combination of the

2489
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:32,158
code

2490
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,560
and the oracle network for the hybrid

2491
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:36,879
smart contract

2492
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,560
the same pattern just recurs it's it's

2493
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,319
really the same pattern and

2494
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,679
and this is why i keep saying trust

2495
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:44,158
issues it's because

2496
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:45,679
i basically almost every contractual

2497
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:47,519
trust issue that i see

2498
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:49,600
where there is a piece of data to prove

2499
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:53,199
and settle the trust issue

2500
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,960
in a way that works for both parties

2501
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:57,119
there is no reason not to use an

2502
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:00,319
autonomous highly reliable

2503
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:02,719
contract and piece of code and

2504
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:04,000
i have to tell you i've seen this in in

2505
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,960
a lot of different industries

2506
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,119
i've seen it insurance ad networks

2507
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,719
global finance global trade

2508
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:12,639
those are all multi-trillion dollar

2509
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:14,560
industries and then there are there are

2510
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:15,359
other smaller industries like even even

2511
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,120
one of the first

2512
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:19,439
smart contracts we worked on many years

2513
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:20,559
ago was for search engine optimization

2514
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:22,079
firms

2515
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,080
where they would tell you hey i'm going

2516
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:26,000
to raise your search engine ranking

2517
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:27,439
give me the money and people wouldn't

2518
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,158
want to give them the money because they

2519
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:29,678
they never

2520
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:31,039
knew if they were going to do it and

2521
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:32,239
then the search engine firm doesn't want

2522
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:33,519
to do any work thinking they'll never

2523
01:21:32,238 --> 01:21:35,759
get any money

2524
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,280
so we just initially even came up with a

2525
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,360
system where you could put bitcoin

2526
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:40,399
into a smart contract and it would be

2527
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:42,639
released

2528
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:43,439
based on whether the search rank of a

2529
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:45,119
website

2530
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:46,960
got to a certain level on google for a

2531
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:49,198
certain keyword right

2532
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,960
and so the trust problem was solved but

2533
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:52,799
it's just the same story right it's kind

2534
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,399
of like trust issues around ai trust

2535
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,440
issues around financial products trust

2536
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:57,679
issues around insurance

2537
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:58,879
trust issues around social media

2538
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:02,639
whatever it is

2539
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:04,800
i i think that's what um

2540
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,639
people looking at this industry really

2541
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,480
need to understand and once they do

2542
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:09,359
understand they realize what this is all

2543
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:12,959
about

2544
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:14,238
this is about redefining how everyone

2545
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,279
collaborates

2546
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:18,718
with everyone about everything

2547
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:22,000
where we can prove something through

2548
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:24,960
data you've mentioned confidentiality

2549
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,560
and privacy that you don't the parties

2550
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,439
don't need to necessarily know private

2551
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,920
data

2552
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:30,719
in this interaction you talk about

2553
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:33,840
confidentiality in the

2554
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:36,840
in the white paper for chain link 2.0

2555
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,000
can you talk more about how to achieve

2556
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:41,840
confidentiality

2557
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:44,399
in this process sure sure absolutely

2558
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:46,319
um so i think you once again need to

2559
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:48,238
think of the contract as existing in two

2560
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:49,840
parts right you have the on-chain code

2561
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:50,238
and then you have this off-chain system

2562
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,960
called

2563
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:54,718
the centralized oracle network so the

2564
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:57,279
question is really

2565
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:58,158
what portion of the contract should live

2566
01:22:57,279 --> 01:23:01,279
in what part

2567
01:22:58,158 --> 01:23:03,920
of these two systems right so

2568
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:04,639
if you want to create transparency you

2569
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,440
should put

2570
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:09,199
more information on chain because that's

2571
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:12,559
what blockchains are very good at

2572
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:14,879
they're public transparent but they

2573
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,400
don't necessarily have privacy

2574
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,480
well those you can see how those two

2575
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:20,479
things are a little bit kind of

2576
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:22,479
completely uh diametrically opposed

2577
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:24,238
right yes so i i do

2578
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:25,519
i do think and i do see blockchains

2579
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:28,718
working on

2580
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:30,639
on-chain encrypted smart contracts

2581
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:32,960
that's very inefficient it has a lot of

2582
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:35,119
um nuances around it

2583
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,279
that i think will appear at some point i

2584
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:40,238
think until it appears

2585
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:41,519
you have an option of taking a part of

2586
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:43,839
the computation

2587
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,880
and putting it into the centralized

2588
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,800
oracle network

2589
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:49,119
we actually did an entire paper about

2590
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:52,320
this that we presented at stanford

2591
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:53,359
in february of last year uh something

2592
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:55,279
called mixicles

2593
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:56,799
which basically talks about how you can

2594
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:58,479
take an oracle network

2595
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,960
and you can put a portion of the

2596
01:23:58,479 --> 01:24:02,959
computation into the oracle network

2597
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,079
assuming that you're comfortable with

2598
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,960
that limited set

2599
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:07,359
of nodes knowing what the computation is

2600
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,800
and

2601
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:10,880
you can actually provide additional

2602
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,719
confidentiality through special hardware

2603
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,480
called trusted execution environments

2604
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,158
that you that all those nodes are forced

2605
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:17,759
to run so they won't even know what

2606
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:20,079
they're operating

2607
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:22,000
and so at the end of the day if you look

2608
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:23,920
at a hybrid smart contract

2609
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,439
as gaining functionality from its own

2610
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,279
chain code and gaining other

2611
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:30,399
functionality from its off-chain

2612
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:32,000
the centralized oracle network component

2613
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:33,679
you can place the part of the

2614
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,479
computation that you would like to be

2615
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:37,199
private

2616
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:37,678
in the decentralized oracle network

2617
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:40,879
because

2618
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:42,719
you can control the set of nodes you can

2619
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,800
control the committee of nodes

2620
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:45,920
and you can require that they run

2621
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,320
certain hardware

2622
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,840
to keep the information private right so

2623
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:50,399
you could basically make a derivative

2624
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,159
that

2625
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:54,000
um or a binary option is the example

2626
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:57,119
used in in the mix paper

2627
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,600
where the payout happened on chain

2628
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:02,319
but it was actually impossible to tell

2629
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:04,239
what the outcome of the contract was

2630
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:05,759
so the the outcome of the contract was

2631
01:25:04,238 --> 01:25:06,479
computed in the centralized oracle

2632
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,159
network

2633
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:10,319
and then there was a switch that that

2634
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:12,960
triggered who received the payment

2635
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:15,840
but from who from from the point of view

2636
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:18,960
of analyzing the on-chain transactions

2637
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,560
and seeing um who received

2638
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,158
the payment or or what the outcome of

2639
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,000
the contract was you couldn't

2640
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:26,319
you you couldn't derive that you

2641
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,119
couldn't backward engineer what that was

2642
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:30,158
but the users of that hybrid smart

2643
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:32,800
contract

2644
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:33,359
still had on-chain code that guaranteed

2645
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,279
them

2646
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:36,399
that as long as the decentralized oracle

2647
01:25:35,279 --> 01:25:38,319
network found

2648
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:39,439
a certain outcome right determined a

2649
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:42,000
certain outcome

2650
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:42,479
that the relevant user would get paid

2651
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,800
and

2652
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:45,519
there was still a place to put value

2653
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,760
right

2654
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:49,199
so there there is this kind of

2655
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,480
fundamental tension

2656
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:54,000
between confidentiality privacy which is

2657
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:56,319
very important for many contracts

2658
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,079
which is critical to many contracts and

2659
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:59,439
the public and transparent nature of

2660
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:01,760
blockchains

2661
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:03,279
which i think eventually will be solved

2662
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,560
through encrypted on-chain smart

2663
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:06,238
contracts

2664
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,080
that'll take some time i think that'll

2665
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:11,119
take years in my opinion

2666
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:12,079
and before we arrive there i think

2667
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:13,760
people will put

2668
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:15,119
the private portion into the centralized

2669
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,719
oracle network

2670
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:19,039
once again going back to what the

2671
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:21,279
decentralized oracle networks do

2672
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:23,039
they seek to provide these services

2673
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:25,359
right so the ability to do

2674
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:26,960
a privacy preserving computation is

2675
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:29,359
perhaps a service

2676
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,359
without which a certain type of contract

2677
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:33,279
might never come into existence

2678
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:34,399
in the form of an on-chain hybrid smart

2679
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:36,719
contract

2680
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:38,158
and so this is once again what we see

2681
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:39,920
the centralized oracle networks and

2682
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:41,679
decentralized services doing

2683
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:43,039
is providing people these tools and

2684
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:46,158
building blocks

2685
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:47,840
to compose you know like i'm i'm great

2686
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:49,920
at making these derivatives contracts

2687
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:52,079
but i can't make them until unless i can

2688
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:54,880
retain the privacy of them

2689
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:56,000
and our goal is to provide the

2690
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,840
infrastructure

2691
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,279
that gives you as a developer and as a

2692
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,800
creator of smart contracts that

2693
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:02,399
capability

2694
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,159
and what we've seen is that as we

2695
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:04,960
provide that capability people create

2696
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:06,479
more

2697
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,000
which is also really the story of the

2698
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:08,559
internet right the story of the internet

2699
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,960
is

2700
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:13,039
it was really tough to do e-commerce

2701
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,639
while everything was in http

2702
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:16,800
and credit cards were transmitted

2703
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:18,000
publicly and so e-commerce was kind of

2704
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,719
tough because how am i going to send my

2705
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,198
credit card

2706
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:23,119
over public unencrypted channels right

2707
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:25,119
but the second https appears

2708
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:26,880
e-commerce becomes a lot easier because

2709
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:29,039
i can put in my credit card number and

2710
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,719
it can be sent over an encrypted channel

2711
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:32,158
and you know it's not at risk and so i

2712
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,520
can participate in e-commerce as long as

2713
01:27:32,158 --> 01:27:35,920
i have a credit card

2714
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,520
i i think those types and i'm sure that

2715
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,800
was unexpected right i'm sure at the

2716
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,719
time that was an

2717
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,840
unexpected outcome from from that

2718
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:44,560
technology

2719
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:46,319
and so i think this is why we sometimes

2720
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,560
have this focus on privacy

2721
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:50,158
because in our work with contracts and

2722
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,600
their transition into this hybrid smart

2723
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:54,559
contract form

2724
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,679
we see a substantial amount of need for

2725
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,239
privacy

2726
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:59,679
as an inherent property of of these

2727
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:01,359
contracts

2728
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:02,639
and it'll take a while before that's

2729
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:04,559
possible to create the kind of

2730
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:05,440
technology innovation required to do

2731
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,880
that on chain

2732
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:08,479
i know there's a few ideas that are

2733
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,400
being floating about but

2734
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:11,919
so the currently distributed oracle

2735
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:14,479
networks provide that feature

2736
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,920
the which is essential to many contracts

2737
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:17,519
what brings to mind

2738
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,119
in this whole space again it might be

2739
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:22,800
outside of your

2740
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:24,000
expertise but within the world which i'm

2741
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,960
passionate about which is machine

2742
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,198
learning

2743
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:31,279
and it seems like very naturally because

2744
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:33,279
current machine learning systems are

2745
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:37,840
very data hungry

2746
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:40,559
and much of the value mined by companies

2747
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:41,360
in the digital space or from data they

2748
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,800
often

2749
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:46,639
want their data to maintain privacy

2750
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,800
so you think about an autonomous vehicle

2751
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,440
space tesla's collecting huge amount of

2752
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,119
data

2753
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:54,079
waymo is collecting huge amount of data

2754
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:56,158
it seems like it would be very

2755
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:57,679
beneficial to form contracts where one

2756
01:28:56,158 --> 01:28:59,839
could use the data from

2757
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:02,079
the other in some kind of privacy

2758
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:05,840
preserving way but also where

2759
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:08,319
all the uses of data are codified

2760
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,279
and you can exchange value cleanly you

2761
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:13,119
know basically

2762
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:14,960
contracts over data over um

2763
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:17,519
machine learning systems use of

2764
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,119
different data i don't know do you um

2765
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,440
do you talk to machine learning folks

2766
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:23,198
that you use ideas of smart contracts or

2767
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:25,439
is that from outside your interest

2768
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:26,399
because it seems like exceptionally

2769
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:28,479
applicable

2770
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:30,479
set of when we talk about different

2771
01:29:28,479 --> 01:29:33,678
services that might be created

2772
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:36,079
and revolutionized by smart especially

2773
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:38,319
hybrid smart contracts

2774
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:40,000
i think machine learning systems comes

2775
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:42,719
to mind to me

2776
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,920
in all industries i i don't know if

2777
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:44,880
you've gotten a chance to interact with

2778
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,719
those folks

2779
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,239
with those services i i think i think

2780
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:50,560
what you're talking about is more data

2781
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:52,718
marketplaces in in the data marketplace

2782
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,800
side of things um

2783
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:57,520
well this is actually once again very

2784
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,800
applicable because there's a trust issue

2785
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,560
at the end of the day let's say i'm

2786
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,880
trying to sell you some data

2787
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,080
you don't know the quality of the data

2788
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,639
so you don't know what you want to pay

2789
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:06,559
for it

2790
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:07,920
and i can't give you the data for you to

2791
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,880
determine the quality because i've given

2792
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,920
you the data

2793
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:14,480
right guess what we need an autonomous

2794
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,520
impartial agent we need an apart

2795
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,238
impartial uh

2796
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:19,440
computational kind of agent an on-chain

2797
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:22,879
smart contract

2798
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:23,759
with an oracle network to assess my data

2799
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:26,719
to write to

2800
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:28,239
to basically take random cross-section

2801
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,480
samples of the data

2802
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:31,839
assess it for quality assess it for

2803
01:30:30,479 --> 01:30:33,759
signal

2804
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,039
from the algorithm you have which you

2805
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,920
don't want to share with me

2806
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:38,079
because you don't want to know the

2807
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,880
algorithm you're working on right you

2808
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:41,439
don't want me to know

2809
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,639
what you want the data for so now the

2810
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:44,719
autonomous agent

2811
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,400
takes your algorithm keeping it private

2812
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:47,600
from me and takes my data keeping it

2813
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:50,158
private from you

2814
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:52,239
assesses it on a random cross-section

2815
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:54,960
sampling for quality of data

2816
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:57,359
returns the scoring back to you allows

2817
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,600
you to determine a price

2818
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:01,599
and now you and now both you and me know

2819
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,560
that we've arrived at a fair price

2820
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,800
for the quality of my data for what you

2821
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:09,760
want to do with it

2822
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:10,480
and that's once again from what i've

2823
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,360
seen in the

2824
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:15,039
in the data marketplaces which are full

2825
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:16,479
of people who want that data for these

2826
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:17,279
learning models often for financial

2827
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:20,319
markets

2828
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:21,519
often for for for for other reasons this

2829
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:24,719
is their fundamental

2830
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,920
problem which amazingly enough there's a

2831
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:28,960
trust issue

2832
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,158
that is is is getting solved and i think

2833
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,760
you can see

2834
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:33,198
even on the face of it once that trust

2835
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,760
issue is solved

2836
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:36,559
uh those markets can work a lot better

2837
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,159
right

2838
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,400
i don't need to know your algorithm you

2839
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:42,638
don't need to know my data we both know

2840
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:44,319
that the autonomous agent is not under

2841
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:46,319
either of our control and gave us a fair

2842
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:48,559
assessment than a fair price

2843
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:49,920
and uh and that's it and we're all very

2844
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,520
comfortable with um

2845
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:53,920
with that we i could even make

2846
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,840
conditions that your algorithm

2847
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,520
isn't analyzing the data for something i

2848
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,600
don't want you to analyze it for or

2849
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:01,360
you could make conditions that the data

2850
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,320
has to have you know any number of

2851
01:32:01,359 --> 01:32:04,079
properties

2852
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:05,759
and and once again you haven't leaked

2853
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:06,158
any signal to me and i haven't leaked

2854
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,440
any

2855
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:11,679
any data to you which is once again just

2856
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:12,559
another type of trust issue that did all

2857
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:14,719
of this solve so

2858
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:16,080
it's it's the same pattern if you work

2859
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:16,880
in this industry long enough or if you

2860
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:18,559
really look at

2861
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:20,000
these use cases long enough you'll

2862
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,480
simply come to the question

2863
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,719
and this is the useful question um what

2864
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:26,399
is the trust issue this is solving

2865
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:28,960
and then if you can get an answer to

2866
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:31,039
that question on a case-by-case basis

2867
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,480
that's when you'll understand why

2868
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:33,840
blockchains are relevant

2869
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:36,079
and then once you do that with enough

2870
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,039
use cases it becomes

2871
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:39,279
you know it becomes a little bit

2872
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:42,319
mind-blowing you've mentioned

2873
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:42,319
trust quite a bit

2874
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:49,439
uh you also mentioned trust minimization

2875
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:52,000
in the chain link white paper can we dig

2876
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:54,000
into trust a little bit more

2877
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,079
what is the nature of trust that you

2878
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,479
think about any smart contracts

2879
01:32:56,079 --> 01:32:59,359
what is trust minimization how do we

2880
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:02,799
accomplish

2881
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:05,039
achieve trust minimization sure sure

2882
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,840
i i think it's important maybe to have a

2883
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:08,880
conception of

2884
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:11,199
of what the alternative is right what is

2885
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,800
highly reliable trust minimized off

2886
01:33:11,198 --> 01:33:14,000
chain and on-chain computation and

2887
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,000
alternative to

2888
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,520
so this is this is just kind of how i

2889
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,880
how i see the world in these two in

2890
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,600
these two camps

2891
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:22,000
one camp is the traditional what i call

2892
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,120
brand

2893
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:27,039
based or paper guarantee camp

2894
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:28,960
and this is the world as as pretty much

2895
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:30,880
most or all people know it today

2896
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,719
this is the world where there's a bank

2897
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:34,000
logo or an insurance company logo or

2898
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:35,840
some kind of logo

2899
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,079
there's a very big building with marble

2900
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:39,679
arches and and columns you know it's the

2901
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:40,880
biggest building in the town it's bigger

2902
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:42,239
than the church

2903
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,760
and everybody feels very good

2904
01:33:42,238 --> 01:33:45,198
everybody's got such a nice logo it's

2905
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,760
such a big building

2906
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:49,279
why don't i give them my my money why

2907
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,679
don't i i interact with them on the

2908
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:53,679
basis of any kind of agreement

2909
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:55,520
and that's good and that that is

2910
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:56,000
definitely better than that not being

2911
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,440
there

2912
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,119
and that is definitely a huge

2913
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:00,719
improvement for how people you know

2914
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:01,599
conduct commerce you know letters of

2915
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:04,399
credit

2916
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:06,639
from from branded um entities are very

2917
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:09,279
important for global trade to take place

2918
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:09,920
in in the early stages of global trade

2919
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:13,599
so

2920
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,639
that's good but it is fundamentally just

2921
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,840
a paper agreement

2922
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:18,400
with a legal framework behind it and if

2923
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:20,000
the

2924
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:22,158
paper agreement you have would say

2925
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,840
robinhood or somebody else suddenly has

2926
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:25,679
to change

2927
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,360
well it changes and you can't really do

2928
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,960
anything about it you won't be able

2929
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:30,719
to change anything about what happened

2930
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,960
there there's some long term

2931
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:34,719
service there's some other agreements

2932
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,880
around all this stuff

2933
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:40,239
at the end of the day um that's the

2934
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:42,159
brand based and paper guarantee world

2935
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:43,919
where it's all very vague and opaque and

2936
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:45,759
you're kind of hoping for the best

2937
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:47,039
because there's a nice logo it's been

2938
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:48,719
around a hundred years

2939
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:50,719
there's a lot of marble but a lot of

2940
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,960
marbles big buildings lots of marbles

2941
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:54,319
this is this is why banks have such nice

2942
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,920
buildings right it's not because they

2943
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:59,039
want to spend money on buildings

2944
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:00,800
it's to create confidence in in them as

2945
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:02,000
an entity in order for people to

2946
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,560
transact

2947
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,439
through them right this is why all these

2948
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,840
kind of

2949
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:08,719
go to cities that had gold rushes go to

2950
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:11,199
cities

2951
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:12,480
that needed banking as as a service in

2952
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:14,079
certain time periods

2953
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:15,839
they're the most beautiful buildings at

2954
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:17,519
least in the united states

2955
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,960
so this is the brand based paper

2956
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,960
guarantee model

2957
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,639
for which up until now there has never

2958
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,279
been an alternative right so up until

2959
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,960
now

2960
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:26,639
if you had a bad experience with a bank

2961
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:29,760
or insurance company or some

2962
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:31,279
some logo somewhere you would only have

2963
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,360
one option your option would be

2964
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:34,639
to go across the road and down the block

2965
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:37,599
to another

2966
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:38,000
building with another color of marble

2967
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,440
and

2968
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,118
another set of agreements that are

2969
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:43,919
fundamentally still paper

2970
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:44,719
brand agreements right now for the first

2971
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,600
time

2972
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:48,158
you have mathematical agreements you

2973
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,440
have

2974
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:53,920
mathematically guaranteed encryption um

2975
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:54,638
secured decentralized infrastructure

2976
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,158
powered

2977
01:35:54,639 --> 01:36:01,520
agreements right this is um really

2978
01:35:58,158 --> 01:36:03,279
the shift this is really the comparison

2979
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,639
and the alternative

2980
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:06,639
through which people should view all of

2981
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:07,840
this in my opinion because there's once

2982
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:09,920
again this conception

2983
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,960
that everything is fine everything works

2984
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:13,359
very well

2985
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,039
well it does it works fine and very well

2986
01:36:13,359 --> 01:36:16,960
as long as nothing goes wrong

2987
01:36:15,039 --> 01:36:18,960
and then in the cases when things go

2988
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:20,239
wrong which they pretty much invariably

2989
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:22,000
at some point do

2990
01:36:20,238 --> 01:36:23,839
then you find out that well you know

2991
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,000
turns out they don't have to pay me or

2992
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:28,239
it turns out i can't trade or turns out

2993
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,000
the atms can be locked up and only give

2994
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:31,678
me 66 euros per day

2995
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,359
whether i'm a business or an individual

2996
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:33,840
like what happened in greece a few years

2997
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:37,279
ago

2998
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:40,319
right and the

2999
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:41,279
the reality is that once that becomes a

3000
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:43,920
strong enough

3001
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:45,279
uh kind of realization for people i

3002
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:47,359
think they will all just migrate to

3003
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:50,639
mathematically guaranteed contracts

3004
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:51,839
because why why wouldn't you so in

3005
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:54,159
in the world of mathematically

3006
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:56,400
guaranteed contracts kind of how do we

3007
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:58,000
and cryptographically secured and

3008
01:36:56,399 --> 01:36:58,879
decentralized infrastructure powered how

3009
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,760
do we how do we

3010
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,480
evolve into that world well at the end

3011
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,440
of the day

3012
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:06,559
um it comes down to consensus right it

3013
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:09,439
comes down to

3014
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,400
an in a collection of independent nodes

3015
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:13,198
a collection of

3016
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:15,439
provably independent computing systems

3017
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:18,879
arriving at the same conclusion

3018
01:37:15,439 --> 01:37:22,559
impartially that conclusion might be

3019
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:25,840
the transaction is valid between

3020
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:26,560
address a and address b address a has

3021
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,400
one bitcoin

3022
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,840
wants to send it to address b now just b

3023
01:37:28,399 --> 01:37:32,000
has one bitcoin right

3024
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,760
so that's one degree of validation it

3025
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,439
has certain cryptographic primitives

3026
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,119
that are used certain levels of

3027
01:37:35,439 --> 01:37:38,960
cryptography encryption and other and

3028
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:42,399
other methods that basically provide

3029
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:44,000
um clarity and and those guarantees

3030
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:45,439
but fundamentally it's this level of

3031
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,479
consensus that multiple

3032
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:49,919
independent computing systems came to

3033
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:51,839
the same conclusion

3034
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,359
verified that conclusion and created a

3035
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:56,319
sense of finality

3036
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:57,279
created a final state that is globally

3037
01:37:56,319 --> 01:38:00,799
considered to be

3038
01:37:57,279 --> 01:38:03,920
the state of a transaction

3039
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:05,279
and that is how it's achieved right so

3040
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:08,560
it's achieved by

3041
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:10,079
users looking at these mathematical

3042
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,560
contract systems

3043
01:38:10,079 --> 01:38:13,600
and saying you know if i have money in a

3044
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:15,840
bank

3045
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,199
there's one single person who controls

3046
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,639
that money that's the bank

3047
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:20,719
they could choose to give me my money or

3048
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:22,480
choose not to give me my money

3049
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:24,399
and that's great but maybe there's a

3050
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:26,079
percentage of what i own that i want to

3051
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:27,759
put into another system

3052
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:30,000
where there's thousands of independent

3053
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:31,600
computing systems that are promising

3054
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,118
me you know with the help of

3055
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:35,360
cryptographic primitives

3056
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:37,279
that i will be able to always have

3057
01:38:35,359 --> 01:38:40,960
access to this whatever this

3058
01:38:37,279 --> 01:38:43,519
is whatever this um you know token is

3059
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:45,198
i will at least oh at the very least i

3060
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:47,199
will always have

3061
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:48,799
unfettered complete control and access

3062
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:50,559
to it so

3063
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,320
you know that's one example another

3064
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,280
example is hey we have a hybrid smart

3065
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:55,599
contract for

3066
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:56,639
something like crop insurance i as the

3067
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,039
user

3068
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:00,719
evaluate where this smart contract runs

3069
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:01,439
oh wow the smart contract runs on

3070
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,920
ethereum

3071
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:05,039
great thousands of nodes lots of

3072
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:08,480
computational

3073
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:10,319
uh security hash power so on and so on

3074
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:12,319
then i look at oh well what triggers the

3075
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:15,039
contract oh there's this oracle network

3076
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:16,639
okay it's composed of 25 nodes or 15

3077
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:17,920
nodes gets data from five different

3078
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:19,920
weather stations

3079
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:21,359
you know i'm comfortable with that i

3080
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:23,359
have a certain level of comfort

3081
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:24,960
with that hybrid smart contract and its

3082
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:27,118
ability to

3083
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,239
provide me consensus about the

3084
01:39:27,118 --> 01:39:30,559
transaction

3085
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:33,039
once the contract knows what's happened

3086
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:35,280
and i'm comfortable with the consensus

3087
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:37,519
around the event that controls the

3088
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:39,920
contract right because once again

3089
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,280
that event is what determines what

3090
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,039
happens with the contract

3091
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:45,198
and if the contract is super well

3092
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:46,158
written it doesn't matter if the event

3093
01:39:45,198 --> 01:39:47,839
isn't reliable

3094
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:49,679
right so now i've made this

3095
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:52,639
determination i've gotten all this clear

3096
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:53,600
clear transparent information about this

3097
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:56,000
system

3098
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:57,440
that combines the contract code with a

3099
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,520
decentralized oracle network

3100
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:01,839
and i've made my decision to participate

3101
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:04,719
in this decentralized insurance

3102
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,560
kind of crop insurance policy i've sent

3103
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:07,600
the bitcoin or the stablecoin or

3104
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:10,639
whatever i have on my

3105
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:12,239
on my android phone and then time goes

3106
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:14,639
by and let's say it doesn't rain

3107
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:15,439
low and behold the smart contract uh

3108
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:17,920
returns

3109
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:18,799
the the relevant amount from the policy

3110
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:22,000
back to me

3111
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:24,159
i continue my life as as as a farmer

3112
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,560
and by the way the fact that that

3113
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:29,198
happened contributes reputation

3114
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,239
and contributes proof back to both the

3115
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:32,158
contract

3116
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:34,158
as something that can prove to other

3117
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:36,238
people that it has settled

3118
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:37,679
and the oracle network as something that

3119
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:40,079
can prove that it has

3120
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:41,520
properly assessed reality or properly

3121
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:43,118
triggered a contract

3122
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:45,600
and this is where there's you know one

3123
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:47,920
of many network effects where

3124
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:49,199
the more that smart contracts and oracle

3125
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:51,279
networks are used

3126
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:54,238
they they themselves generate this

3127
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:57,759
immutable unchained data

3128
01:40:54,238 --> 01:41:00,718
that proves their value and reliability

3129
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:02,239
and improving more and more of that in

3130
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:04,800
more and more

3131
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:06,718
kind of use cases and more and more

3132
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:09,679
variants of the same contract

3133
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:10,480
they arrive at a greater body of proof

3134
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:12,880
that they

3135
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:14,158
like i am the decentralized crop the

3136
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:17,920
decentralized insurance

3137
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:22,638
contract for crop insurance used by

3138
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:24,880
a million users and my failure rate is

3139
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:26,400
non-existent or really low and here's my

3140
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,880
oracle network and by the way

3141
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:29,599
it's also settled a million of these and

3142
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,560
so

3143
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:33,199
it's not the logo right it's not hey

3144
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,159
what nice

3145
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:37,678
what a nice logo you have um on top of a

3146
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:39,359
building

3147
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:41,199
above above a train terminal or

3148
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:44,158
something it's much more

3149
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:45,759
hey there's a million people there's a

3150
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:47,118
million separate contracts that got

3151
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,960
settled correctly i have

3152
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:50,319
all the proof that i could ever need

3153
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,319
about that

3154
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:54,158
and it's it's not something that's very

3155
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:55,599
easy to gain right because real value

3156
01:41:54,158 --> 01:41:58,319
was at stake real value was

3157
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:59,039
was moved around and so i i think once

3158
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:00,880
again

3159
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:02,560
the transparency aspect comes in where

3160
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:06,400
you're able to prove

3161
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,199
that the cryptographically enforced

3162
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:10,238
contracts

3163
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:12,319
are better that said you can still

3164
01:42:10,238 --> 01:42:14,000
integrate the traditional banks as long

3165
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:15,039
as you create a data feed on the amount

3166
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,359
of marble that's

3167
01:42:15,039 --> 01:42:19,198
in it that's included so if that's

3168
01:42:17,359 --> 01:42:20,639
valuable to you in terms of reputation

3169
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:24,319
you could still integrate the marble

3170
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:26,639
the amount of marble that uh and the uh

3171
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:28,158
the size of the logo we could still keep

3172
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:29,920
the banks around

3173
01:42:28,158 --> 01:42:31,039
like i think we will i think what will

3174
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,399
happen with the banks and all the

3175
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:34,079
insurance companies by the way

3176
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:35,679
is not that they'll just die or

3177
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:36,399
something i think it'll be just like the

3178
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:38,239
internet

3179
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:40,000
there'll be some of them that adopt this

3180
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:41,439
yeah and some of them that don't

3181
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,439
and some of them to do it faster some of

3182
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:45,279
them to do it slower and and that's an

3183
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:47,198
economic decision that they'll make

3184
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:48,800
i think their whole question is is this

3185
01:42:47,198 --> 01:42:50,319
a foregone conclusion

3186
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,760
i mean i think you know my answer my

3187
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:52,799
answer is yes this is definitely going

3188
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:54,719
to be happening

3189
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:56,159
i think they still have a question of

3190
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:59,359
you know is this gonna change

3191
01:42:56,158 --> 01:43:02,079
my uh industry uh but i'm seeing

3192
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:03,279
a definite shift in in people's

3193
01:43:02,079 --> 01:43:04,559
understanding

3194
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:07,198
and i think that shift is gonna

3195
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:09,760
accelerate rapidly as one or two of them

3196
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:10,960
their competitors throw their hat in the

3197
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,520
smart contract

3198
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:14,399
ring and say well i have i have smart

3199
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,440
contracts

3200
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:18,960
i guarantee my outcomes to you what do

3201
01:43:17,439 --> 01:43:22,319
they do for you

3202
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:23,760
you know it's risky just use mine and

3203
01:43:22,319 --> 01:43:26,238
the second some of them start losing

3204
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:27,840
business because of that they're gonna

3205
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:29,439
they're gonna move very quickly because

3206
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,719
that's what all of their compensation

3207
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:32,238
structures and their all their

3208
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:34,000
goal planning structures are based

3209
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:35,678
around they're based around

3210
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,760
what is losing us business or getting us

3211
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:39,520
business yeah it's fascinating

3212
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,119
organizationally though to think about

3213
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:43,199
banks they're very

3214
01:43:41,118 --> 01:43:44,799
old school and their ability to move

3215
01:43:43,198 --> 01:43:47,039
quickly

3216
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:48,800
is questionable to me i just look at

3217
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:52,000
basic uh

3218
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:54,480
online banking like how good banks are

3219
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,760
creating a frictionless online

3220
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:59,359
experience and not

3221
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:01,280
and i think they're not very good and so

3222
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:03,839
that speaks to the kind of people who

3223
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:06,000
are in leadership positions at banks

3224
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,520
the kind of people they hire the kind of

3225
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,279
culture there is

3226
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:13,679
so i do wonder if banks will

3227
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:15,359
from inside revolutionize themselves to

3228
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:17,440
include smart contracts

3229
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:18,719
or whether totally new competitors will

3230
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:21,359
have to emerge

3231
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:22,239
that basically create uh new kinds of

3232
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:26,158
banks

3233
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:28,158
whether what is the uh company square

3234
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:29,519
i think that's a it comes up out of

3235
01:44:28,158 --> 01:44:31,279
nowhere really

3236
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,800
with cash app and they have bitcoin on

3237
01:44:31,279 --> 01:44:34,639
cash app whether they will start

3238
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:37,279
incorporating smart contracts and they

3239
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:40,400
will revolutionize

3240
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:41,920
uh the the whole banking industry or

3241
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:45,039
whether bank of america

3242
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:48,158
will revolutionize themselves from

3243
01:44:45,039 --> 01:44:50,880
within i'm skeptical on bank of america

3244
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:53,519
but uh you never know it's in general

3245
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:55,199
i'm fascinated by how big organizations

3246
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,719
whether it's google and microsoft or

3247
01:44:55,198 --> 01:44:59,759
bank of america

3248
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:00,639
pivot hard in a world that's quickly

3249
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:04,000
changing

3250
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:04,480
i think that takes bold leadership and a

3251
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,600
lot of

3252
01:45:04,479 --> 01:45:10,238
firing and a lot of pain and a lot of

3253
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:12,880
meetings where the one brings up

3254
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:14,319
the from first principles idea that you

3255
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:15,600
know what the ways we've been doing

3256
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:17,679
stuff in the past

3257
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:20,320
required you know we need to throw that

3258
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:23,118
out and do stuff totally differently

3259
01:45:20,319 --> 01:45:24,799
i i i know a lot of those in in

3260
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:26,238
in a lot of these different industries

3261
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,920
um first of all i think they're getting

3262
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:30,319
listened to more and second of all i

3263
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:32,880
think all of these places

3264
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:35,279
as as i look at it more and more i think

3265
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:37,359
they have a fundamental line of business

3266
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:39,439
that they try to protect and then

3267
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:41,198
everybody's compensation and everybody's

3268
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:43,039
metrics and goals is focused around that

3269
01:45:41,198 --> 01:45:46,319
line of business

3270
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:49,039
so the second that

3271
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:50,479
things begin to impact that then

3272
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:53,519
everybody will be

3273
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:55,118
in a senior meeting and and that

3274
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,960
will be quite listened to

3275
01:45:55,118 --> 01:46:00,079
because he will have the only thoughtful

3276
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:01,760
explanation as to why this is happening

3277
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:03,439
how how things will evolve from there i

3278
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,239
actually don't know because i you know

3279
01:46:03,439 --> 01:46:07,519
that hasn't

3280
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:09,759
been the case yet but my my thinking is

3281
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:11,360
that there will be people who

3282
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,480
don't want to cannibalize certain parts

3283
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:13,279
of their business or don't want to

3284
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:15,279
change certain

3285
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:16,399
parts of their business and then there

3286
01:46:15,279 --> 01:46:17,920
will be people who say

3287
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:19,679
look i think this is how the world's

3288
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,639
going to work we're going to make a very

3289
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:23,679
very heavy

3290
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:26,239
um kind of set

3291
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:27,118
of commitments to to put resources

3292
01:46:26,238 --> 01:46:28,879
towards this

3293
01:46:27,118 --> 01:46:31,118
um i already see that with with a few

3294
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,960
banks working working on various

3295
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:34,079
blockchain based systems

3296
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:36,639
but granted they've been working on

3297
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:38,479
those for years so i i i think all of

3298
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:39,760
this comes down to these these kind of

3299
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:42,399
quarterly earnings calls

3300
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:43,920
where somebody asks them hey you know i

3301
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:46,238
saw that bank over there

3302
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:47,760
launched a blockchain bond or or a smart

3303
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:49,439
contract derivative platform

3304
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:50,800
and i also saw that they made you know

3305
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:52,879
10 billion dollars

3306
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:54,880
in revenues or or 10 billion dollars in

3307
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:57,118
volume or whatever it is from from that

3308
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:58,000
what's your plan right on the earnings

3309
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:00,079
call

3310
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,920
and i i promise you by the next earnings

3311
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:03,279
call there's a plan

3312
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,639
and then the question on the next one is

3313
01:47:03,279 --> 01:47:06,800
well when's the plan gonna happen and

3314
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:09,039
then by the next earnings call it's

3315
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,480
uh plan is happening and and that's

3316
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:12,079
that's that's what these people

3317
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:13,678
are sensitive to that's what these

3318
01:47:12,079 --> 01:47:16,238
organizations are structured around

3319
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:17,920
it's not completely economically like

3320
01:47:16,238 --> 01:47:19,919
disconnected right they have this core

3321
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:22,960
business they want to protect it

3322
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:25,920
um i understand that that idea

3323
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:29,279
but um i think the the problem with that

3324
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,279
is sometimes it requires

3325
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:34,079
it requires this myopic focus right and

3326
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,679
and that's what all the innovation stuff

3327
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:37,679
is about every time somebody at a

3328
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:40,158
corporate entity is about innovation

3329
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:41,840
they're trying to sidestep this

3330
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:43,679
but but once again the incentives to

3331
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:47,039
maintain whatever the core business is

3332
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:50,800
is so strong that the innovation people

3333
01:47:47,039 --> 01:47:52,800
even even though they they are there um

3334
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,239
you know they get i think they get a

3335
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,520
phone call and go like what are we doing

3336
01:47:54,238 --> 01:47:58,000
for this

3337
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,600
and and and the ones that actually did

3338
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,560
good work and got ready to do something

3339
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,560
for this

3340
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:04,239
have have done their you know their

3341
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:05,679
employer and their organization a very

3342
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:07,919
positive service

3343
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:09,840
whereas the ones that aren't ready i

3344
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,079
mean you know they'll make up something

3345
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,199
and

3346
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:12,399
you know maybe they're really smart and

3347
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:14,158
they'll get it together i don't i don't

3348
01:48:12,399 --> 01:48:15,679
know can we talk about tokens a little

3349
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:18,559
bit

3350
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:20,399
generally speaking there's been a

3351
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:22,080
meteoric rise of a bunch of different

3352
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:24,158
tokens we could just talk about bitcoin

3353
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:28,079
and ethereum as examples

3354
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:30,000
bitcoin i think cost 60 000 in value

3355
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:32,399
what are your thoughts in general on

3356
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,960
this rise what's the future of bitcoin

3357
01:48:32,399 --> 01:48:37,439
what's the future of ethereum

3358
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,719
uh there's there's the uh total value

3359
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:40,799
locked metric

3360
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:43,279
that i think generalizes the different

3361
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:47,039
kind of value of these

3362
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:50,238
uh of these tokens

3363
01:48:47,039 --> 01:48:52,319
what does the future value

3364
01:48:50,238 --> 01:48:54,158
and impact of cryptocurrency look like

3365
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:55,920
if we look through the lens of these

3366
01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:58,559
tokens

3367
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:00,000
i think valuing all these tokens and

3368
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,199
determining that isn't something i'm

3369
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,880
particularly great at

3370
01:49:01,198 --> 01:49:04,719
i haven't spent a lot of time on that

3371
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,719
i've spent the majority vast majority of

3372
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:08,239
my time on building these systems

3373
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:09,840
and architecting them and getting them

3374
01:49:08,238 --> 01:49:11,359
to fruition and getting them to a place

3375
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,800
where they operate properly

3376
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:14,238
on both the technical and the crypto

3377
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:15,440
economic and in every other and in every

3378
01:49:14,238 --> 01:49:20,158
other sense

3379
01:49:15,439 --> 01:49:20,158
i i think with bitcoin there is um

3380
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:24,399
a certain conception of non-governmental

3381
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:27,439
fiat money

3382
01:49:24,399 --> 01:49:29,439
that bitcoin is really the first

3383
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:31,919
creator of right so there's this very

3384
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:35,359
powerful idea called fiat money

3385
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:36,719
it's basically um more or less a kind of

3386
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:38,719
40-year experiment

3387
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:40,960
i think on august 15th of this year is

3388
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:42,399
maybe i think even the 40th anniversary

3389
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:44,158
you know government can say hey i have a

3390
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:48,638
currency and it's worth something

3391
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:48,638
and and here it is in terms of

3392
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:52,239
the way that governments have stopped

3393
01:49:50,479 --> 01:49:53,678
that in the past is if anyone tries to

3394
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:54,319
make another fiat currency in their

3395
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:56,480
country

3396
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:57,679
they immediately shut it down right they

3397
01:49:56,479 --> 01:49:59,439
immediately say hey

3398
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:01,520
this is really bad you've done something

3399
01:49:59,439 --> 01:50:04,079
really bad it's time for you to stop

3400
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:05,440
don't do it anymore and it stops right

3401
01:50:04,079 --> 01:50:08,960
that's been the history of

3402
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:10,960
non-governmental fiat currency bitcoin

3403
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:12,079
is really due to its decentralized

3404
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:15,118
nature

3405
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:17,439
the first um and possibly in some cases

3406
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:20,639
in many people's minds is still the only

3407
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:22,719
true non-governmental fiat currency

3408
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:24,319
now how powerful is non-governmental

3409
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:28,319
fiat currency

3410
01:50:24,319 --> 01:50:31,359
i have no idea right this is why so

3411
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:32,960
it's really as powerful as the ideas

3412
01:50:31,359 --> 01:50:35,759
that people ascribe to it

3413
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,800
are right so let's say people start

3414
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,159
saying

3415
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,920
like right now people are saying hey

3416
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:41,679
it's internet money it's the money of

3417
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:43,599
the internet

3418
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:45,199
okay great what's that worth i don't

3419
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:46,400
know it's probably worth a lot i have no

3420
01:50:45,198 --> 01:50:49,678
idea what it's worth but it's

3421
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:53,439
as an idea as a concept to underpin

3422
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:56,800
the fiat money the let there be aspect

3423
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:58,479
of of of a fiat and of bitcoin

3424
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:00,079
you basically look at it and you say

3425
01:50:58,479 --> 01:51:02,079
yeah internet money

3426
01:51:00,079 --> 01:51:04,880
okay that could be worth whatever you

3427
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:07,599
know sixty thousand six hundred thousand

3428
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:09,199
great question right there are other

3429
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:09,920
versions of the world right where people

3430
01:51:09,198 --> 01:51:13,039
say

3431
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:14,560
you know um there are countries that

3432
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:16,960
don't have a good fiat currency

3433
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:17,920
and i see a lot of people using bitcoin

3434
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:22,079
so bitcoin

3435
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:24,079
isn't internet money it's um

3436
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:25,279
countries without a good currency money

3437
01:51:24,079 --> 01:51:27,439
so all the countries without a good

3438
01:51:25,279 --> 01:51:30,880
currency not now use uh bitcoin

3439
01:51:27,439 --> 01:51:33,198
and you know let there be bitcoin as

3440
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:34,639
this right as this conception of bitcoin

3441
01:51:33,198 --> 01:51:36,000
what's the value of that

3442
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:38,159
i don't know that's a great question

3443
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,880
probably probably a huge amount of value

3444
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:42,158
um then there's then there's a further

3445
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:44,960
conception of

3446
01:51:42,158 --> 01:51:46,559
bitcoin has some you know digital gold

3447
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:48,319
there's a scarcity dynamic

3448
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:49,599
there's there's all these other kinds of

3449
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:51,920
dynamics

3450
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:52,639
what is a portable version of digital

3451
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:56,158
gold

3452
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:59,359
with some kind of built-in um

3453
01:51:56,158 --> 01:52:00,638
built-in scarcity worth you know kind of

3454
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:03,759
artificially created

3455
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:05,599
scarcity um what's that worth

3456
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:07,840
i don't know that's that's a great

3457
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:08,800
question i haven't done the analysis on

3458
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:11,679
that is the point

3459
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:14,159
might be worth a lot what is it all

3460
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:17,359
worth if all three of these things

3461
01:52:14,158 --> 01:52:17,759
you know flow into the same fiat um kind

3462
01:52:17,359 --> 01:52:19,679
of

3463
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:22,719
let there be bitcoin as these three

3464
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:23,760
things conception of bitcoin

3465
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:25,279
i don't know what that's worth i also

3466
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:26,719
don't know what that's worth but could

3467
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:29,198
be worth a huge amount

3468
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:30,560
so i i think it's it's not i don't think

3469
01:52:29,198 --> 01:52:32,238
it's i personally don't think it's super

3470
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:34,080
important what i think it's worth

3471
01:52:32,238 --> 01:52:35,439
or what many other people think it's

3472
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:36,399
worth i don't think that's that's really

3473
01:52:35,439 --> 01:52:38,399
that important

3474
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:40,158
i think what's probably important is

3475
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:44,399
understanding

3476
01:52:40,158 --> 01:52:45,598
what the societal conception of bitcoin

3477
01:52:44,399 --> 01:52:47,839
is

3478
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:50,480
and how does that societal conception

3479
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:52,319
evolve over time

3480
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:54,000
and that interestingly enough doesn't

3481
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:56,639
just depend on

3482
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,000
um you know you or me or the people who

3483
01:52:56,639 --> 01:53:00,800
made bitcoin or anything else

3484
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,719
it actually depends on current events so

3485
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,960
for example if people suddenly say

3486
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:05,920
i i'm more and more worried about fiat

3487
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,679
currency

3488
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:09,359
i'm more and more worried that

3489
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:11,840
governmental fiat

3490
01:53:09,359 --> 01:53:12,479
even if it's the most reliable version

3491
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:15,520
of that

3492
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:18,158
is not as good as i thought it was maybe

3493
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:19,440
i should go on the paypal app and maybe

3494
01:53:18,158 --> 01:53:23,039
i should get some bitcoin

3495
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:25,839
just in case what's the world

3496
01:53:23,039 --> 01:53:26,960
where bitcoin is a certain percentage of

3497
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:30,000
everyone's ownership

3498
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:30,880
as a hedge against governmental fiat

3499
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,279
money

3500
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,079
not being so good haven't done the

3501
01:53:33,279 --> 01:53:35,599
analysis but

3502
01:53:34,079 --> 01:53:37,359
another example right here's this

3503
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,199
conception that's

3504
01:53:37,359 --> 01:53:41,598
that's the conception so when i look at

3505
01:53:39,198 --> 01:53:44,559
bitcoin what i see is a lot of these

3506
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:45,199
fascinating conceptions of of what the

3507
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:47,840
fiat

3508
01:53:45,198 --> 01:53:50,158
let there be value of bitcoin is by the

3509
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:52,000
way all of them could be true

3510
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:53,279
um maybe some of them are true maybe

3511
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,880
some of them aren't true

3512
01:53:53,279 --> 01:53:56,800
and and the fascinating thing is is that

3513
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:58,000
i've seen this conception change right

3514
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,320
so when i started

3515
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,840
in the bitcoin space the conception was

3516
01:54:00,319 --> 01:54:04,000
micro payments

3517
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,279
the the the cost of bitcoin is low we'll

3518
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,198
have micro payments

3519
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:08,639
micro payments are wonderful for uh

3520
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:10,319
machine to machine

3521
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:12,319
uh transactions micro payments are

3522
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:14,158
wonderful in the emerging market

3523
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:16,000
and that's fine right and and that was

3524
01:54:14,158 --> 01:54:18,079
one conception of bitcoin as

3525
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,520
let there be bitcoin as micro payments

3526
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:21,359
platform right

3527
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,960
but then the value rose and things

3528
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:23,920
changed there was enough expansion in

3529
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:26,560
certain ways

3530
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:28,399
and and now the conception has evolved

3531
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:31,039
into this other conception

3532
01:54:28,399 --> 01:54:31,759
but but at the end of the day um i think

3533
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:34,719
governments

3534
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:35,679
have a very clear set of steps for

3535
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:38,880
directing

3536
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:41,359
the public's conception of

3537
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:42,000
their fiat right they say our fiat is

3538
01:54:41,359 --> 01:54:45,039
worth this

3539
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:47,039
for these these reasons bitcoin doesn't

3540
01:54:45,039 --> 01:54:49,279
have that bitcoin doesn't have

3541
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:50,719
an official bitcoin spokesperson that

3542
01:54:49,279 --> 01:54:52,479
goes out and says

3543
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:54,319
the non-governmental money called

3544
01:54:52,479 --> 01:54:55,279
bitcoin the non-governmental fiat money

3545
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:57,198
called bitcoin

3546
01:54:55,279 --> 01:54:59,118
has value on the basis of this this this

3547
01:54:57,198 --> 01:55:00,399
and this here's our fiscal budget here's

3548
01:54:59,118 --> 01:55:02,079
our future plans

3549
01:55:00,399 --> 01:55:04,000
you know our money will continue to be

3550
01:55:02,079 --> 01:55:07,279
safe and secure and reliable

3551
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:09,198
and so it's what what that hole creates

3552
01:55:07,279 --> 01:55:11,439
is a is a hole that we all fill right we

3553
01:55:09,198 --> 01:55:14,079
all basically come to some vague

3554
01:55:11,439 --> 01:55:15,039
kind of group understanding that you

3555
01:55:14,079 --> 01:55:17,760
know bitcoin

3556
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:18,960
is worth is worth this because it is

3557
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:22,639
tied let

3558
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:25,439
is it is tied to um

3559
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:25,440
you know let's say

3560
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:30,000
all non-governmental fiat money comes

3561
01:55:27,439 --> 01:55:32,719
into question everybody doubts it

3562
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,319
uh possibly due to inflation and

3563
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:37,920
everybody says you know

3564
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:40,880
this is nice but i'd like to keep 10 20

3565
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:41,679
of my of my wealth in non-governmental

3566
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:44,719
fiat

3567
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:47,520
just in case um you know

3568
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:48,639
what what are those numbers i mean if

3569
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:50,480
that happens

3570
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:52,719
you know i'm guessing you can add a few

3571
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:54,319
zeros

3572
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:56,399
i like how you say i haven't done the

3573
01:55:54,319 --> 01:55:56,880
analysis as if i'm sure a lot of people

3574
01:55:56,399 --> 01:55:59,439
have done

3575
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:01,039
quote-unquote analysis but it's not it's

3576
01:55:59,439 --> 01:56:03,439
still speculation nobody

3577
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:05,359
can predict the future especially when

3578
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:08,479
so much of it has to do with

3579
01:56:05,359 --> 01:56:09,279
a large number of people holding an idea

3580
01:56:08,479 --> 01:56:11,359
in their mind

3581
01:56:09,279 --> 01:56:13,198
as to the importance of a particular

3582
01:56:11,359 --> 01:56:14,639
technology like bitcoin

3583
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:16,719
there's a lot of excitement by its

3584
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:17,760
possibilities but the number of zeros

3585
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:20,000
you add

3586
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:22,000
is uh is an open question and nobody can

3587
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:26,079
do a perfect analysis

3588
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,079
except whoever created this simulation

3589
01:56:27,039 --> 01:56:33,760
let me ask you this question

3590
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:35,359
who is satoshi nakamoto there's quite a

3591
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:39,440
few people

3592
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:39,439
who suggest that person is you

3593
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:47,599
so is it you

3594
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:49,440
no who do you think it could be

3595
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:50,880
i don't know who it is i i think if i

3596
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:52,638
had to guess it's probably

3597
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:54,480
a group of people some of which might

3598
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:56,719
not even be around anymore

3599
01:56:54,479 --> 01:56:58,799
um you know obviously i'm very grateful

3600
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:00,158
to if this is a singular or a group of

3601
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:01,760
people for kicking off this entire

3602
01:57:00,158 --> 01:57:02,638
industry and making this amazing change

3603
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:04,880
in the world

3604
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:05,679
that you know i have the the privilege

3605
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:07,359
and luxury of

3606
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:08,719
of being part of in in some small way in

3607
01:57:07,359 --> 01:57:12,238
the work that i do

3608
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:12,800
um i think also this kind of focus on

3609
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:15,279
who is

3610
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:16,560
satoshi or who is in satoshi shouldn't

3611
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:20,000
in my opinion matter

3612
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:23,360
so much because regardless of who it is

3613
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:25,279
that in my opinion should have no

3614
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:26,880
substantial significant effect or

3615
01:57:25,279 --> 01:57:29,519
bearing on

3616
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:30,400
the functioning or the value or the use

3617
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:32,320
or the

3618
01:57:30,399 --> 01:57:34,399
or the security of of of the bitcoin

3619
01:57:32,319 --> 01:57:36,559
system right so i think

3620
01:57:34,399 --> 01:57:38,719
whoever it is they're probably better

3621
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:41,920
off not not not making that public

3622
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:42,719
and i think beyond that um whoever it

3623
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:44,800
turned out to be

3624
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:46,239
shouldn't matter because it has nothing

3625
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:48,719
to do

3626
01:57:46,238 --> 01:57:50,638
with how the system is made useful or

3627
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:52,319
secure or anything else

3628
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:54,400
and so i think that's the um you know

3629
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:57,359
that's the point of view that i have

3630
01:57:54,399 --> 01:57:59,359
now if you were satoshi nakamoto would

3631
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:02,559
you tell me

3632
01:57:59,359 --> 01:58:03,439
because you said they shouldn't whoever

3633
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:05,679
satoshi is

3634
01:58:03,439 --> 01:58:06,960
you should keep that private so would

3635
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:10,319
you tell it to me

3636
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:13,439
or no we're in some kind of weird like

3637
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:14,238
thought experiment here if if i was this

3638
01:58:13,439 --> 01:58:17,598
guy

3639
01:58:14,238 --> 01:58:18,718
um let me think about this which i'm not

3640
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:21,039
by the way i am not

3641
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:23,359
this person but if you were would you

3642
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:23,359
say it

3643
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:30,719
um i think

3644
01:58:27,439 --> 01:58:32,158
uh probably not i don't see the i i

3645
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:34,880
i think that they would cause a lot of

3646
01:58:32,158 --> 01:58:36,799
distraction and a lot of weird stuff

3647
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:38,159
and so realistically i don't think it

3648
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:40,560
would help

3649
01:58:38,158 --> 01:58:42,399
anybody or even the person who discloses

3650
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:44,400
it but just to be clear i am not

3651
01:58:42,399 --> 01:58:45,759
and whoever it is i think they haven't

3652
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:47,198
said anything because they don't want

3653
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:48,560
the attention and they don't want the

3654
01:58:47,198 --> 01:58:49,759
distraction and they don't want all the

3655
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:51,520
problems from this

3656
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:52,960
and that's that makes sense to me

3657
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,239
conceptually

3658
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,719
it's fascinating to think if they're

3659
01:58:54,238 --> 01:59:00,479
still out there and part of the

3660
01:58:56,719 --> 01:59:00,480
the bitcoin the cryptocurrency community

3661
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:07,360
and um it is inspiring to think that

3662
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:09,359
if they're out there that they're not

3663
01:59:07,359 --> 01:59:11,198
revealing their identity because it

3664
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:12,639
would be a distraction

3665
01:59:11,198 --> 01:59:15,678
that's kind of inspiring that people are

3666
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:18,079
like that just like george washington

3667
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:19,520
relinquishing power is inspiring because

3668
01:59:18,079 --> 01:59:20,479
it's ultimately about the progress of

3669
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:23,360
the community

3670
01:59:20,479 --> 01:59:24,959
not some kind of ego driven attention

3671
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:27,679
scheme

3672
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:29,599
again very inspiring the humans at their

3673
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:31,679
best are inspiring

3674
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:33,760
what do you think about the certainty

3675
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:34,719
that people in the bitcoin maximalist

3676
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:36,400
community

3677
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:38,560
have about this particular piece of

3678
01:59:36,399 --> 01:59:40,960
technology bitcoin

3679
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:43,039
is there something interesting they you

3680
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:45,679
think that you might want to say

3681
01:59:43,039 --> 01:59:48,238
about this community or is it just is

3682
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:48,239
what it is

3683
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:52,639
i think at the end of the day results

3684
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:55,118
speak for themselves and bitcoin

3685
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:55,840
has had an amazing impact on our

3686
01:59:55,118 --> 01:59:58,000
industry

3687
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,880
and had has had an amazing impact on the

3688
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,039
world

3689
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:03,359
and i think you know the result is still

3690
02:00:01,039 --> 02:00:05,679
that bitcoin is very widely adopted

3691
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:07,118
and driving um the adoption of our

3692
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:08,319
industry in many ways

3693
02:00:07,118 --> 02:00:10,079
so i think it's very difficult for

3694
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:12,639
people to say that you know bitcoin

3695
02:00:10,079 --> 02:00:14,238
maximalists don't have something

3696
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:16,239
that they can latch on to and say hey

3697
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:18,959
there's something very real here

3698
02:00:16,238 --> 02:00:20,399
i i think there's been decisions made by

3699
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,840
the bitcoin community and the people who

3700
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:25,279
made the bitcoin protocol

3701
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:26,480
to focus it on bitcoin and to focus in

3702
02:00:25,279 --> 02:00:29,118
on

3703
02:00:26,479 --> 02:00:30,799
the kind of storing of the ledger of

3704
02:00:29,118 --> 02:00:32,399
bitcoin and the information about

3705
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:34,800
bitcoin and the transaction of bitcoin

3706
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:36,559
and to focus on securing that

3707
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:38,239
and i and you know i understand why that

3708
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:40,239
decision was made to a certain degree

3709
02:00:38,238 --> 02:00:41,519
right it was about focus it is

3710
02:00:40,238 --> 02:00:44,079
it was about getting something

3711
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:46,719
worthwhile right without adding

3712
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:48,479
additional features and additional risk

3713
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:51,520
and you know that decision is

3714
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:51,919
is a decision that was made and has kind

3715
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:54,560
of

3716
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:55,440
the benefits of focus and the benefits

3717
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:57,520
of

3718
02:00:55,439 --> 02:00:58,559
um a certain amount of security and a

3719
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:01,599
certain amount of

3720
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:02,560
guarantees around uh bitcoin and and

3721
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:04,800
what that is and

3722
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:05,599
and the the value of that and then it

3723
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:08,560
has certain

3724
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:08,800
um limitations you know as a consequence

3725
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:11,840
of

3726
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:13,599
of of of doing less or having the system

3727
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:14,880
hold data that isn't related to bitcoin

3728
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:17,840
or not having the system

3729
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:19,840
hold contracts uh contractual outcomes

3730
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:21,279
or smart contract code

3731
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:23,760
so i i think it's just kind of a

3732
02:01:21,279 --> 02:01:25,519
decision right and and i i understand

3733
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:26,960
why they're excited and i'm very excited

3734
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:28,239
i started in this industry going to

3735
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:30,239
bitcoin meetups

3736
02:01:28,238 --> 02:01:31,519
and i met a lot of fantastic people

3737
02:01:30,238 --> 02:01:33,919
libertarian

3738
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:35,280
people that wanted to see the world work

3739
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:37,599
differently and shared a lot of my

3740
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:39,599
beliefs and a lot of my points of view

3741
02:01:37,599 --> 02:01:41,679
and so you know anyone who's been in the

3742
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:44,800
industry as long as i have

3743
02:01:41,679 --> 02:01:46,319
um has had to come from the bitcoin

3744
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:48,560
ecosystem by virtue of

3745
02:01:46,319 --> 02:01:50,719
kind of starting out that early so i

3746
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:54,320
have an unbelievable amount of respect

3747
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:55,840
and um admiration and gratitude for

3748
02:01:54,319 --> 02:01:57,198
for bitcoin and that it exists and

3749
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:58,880
everything that it's done and that it

3750
02:01:57,198 --> 02:02:00,879
birthed this industry there's absolutely

3751
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:02,560
no doubt about that

3752
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:04,480
you know at the same time whatever

3753
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:07,039
design decisions people make

3754
02:02:04,479 --> 02:02:07,678
are the design decisions they make right

3755
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:09,198
and so they

3756
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:11,118
if you've made a design decision that

3757
02:02:09,198 --> 02:02:12,000
this ledger and this thing will be about

3758
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:14,319
bitcoin

3759
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,560
it won't be about colored coins it won't

3760
02:02:14,319 --> 02:02:19,359
be about op return at 80 bytes

3761
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:20,639
it won't be about these other kind of

3762
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:22,880
nuances

3763
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:23,760
that you don't want this to be about

3764
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:25,279
then that's fine

3765
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:26,880
that's that's fine and that's that's

3766
02:02:25,279 --> 02:02:29,118
that's a logical decision that's

3767
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:30,159
that's called focus and focus has a lot

3768
02:02:29,118 --> 02:02:32,399
of value

3769
02:02:30,158 --> 02:02:34,000
um and a lot of great um technology

3770
02:02:32,399 --> 02:02:36,559
products have

3771
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,920
focused on something and and done that

3772
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:39,199
and then there's a lot of smart people

3773
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:41,840
around bitcoin

3774
02:02:39,198 --> 02:02:43,279
building um kind of additional systems

3775
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:44,239
that anchor their security within

3776
02:02:43,279 --> 02:02:45,439
bitcoin

3777
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:47,118
and i think that's an interesting

3778
02:02:45,439 --> 02:02:48,399
approach that could that could bear

3779
02:02:47,118 --> 02:02:50,238
fruit

3780
02:02:48,399 --> 02:02:52,479
i think it'll eventually require an

3781
02:02:50,238 --> 02:02:54,638
interaction with the bitcoin protocol

3782
02:02:52,479 --> 02:02:56,000
in more advanced ways and then there

3783
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:57,920
will be another question of

3784
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,039
you know what is the design decision for

3785
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:00,800
bitcoin

3786
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:02,560
is it that bitcoin will be just about

3787
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:06,159
the bitcoin ledger

3788
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:08,719
or does bitcoin want to evolve into

3789
02:03:06,158 --> 02:03:09,279
um you know an anchor for all these

3790
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:11,599
other

3791
02:03:09,279 --> 02:03:12,479
other systems and and maybe create

3792
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:15,440
additional

3793
02:03:12,479 --> 02:03:16,959
data you know kind of more data on chain

3794
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:18,238
on the bitcoin blockchain related to

3795
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:20,560
that

3796
02:03:18,238 --> 02:03:21,839
so i i'm excited to see how that evolves

3797
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:24,000
but until then

3798
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:25,760
kind of results speak for themselves and

3799
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,599
the results that bitcoin has achieved

3800
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:29,360
for our industry and for itself as

3801
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:31,440
you know kind of the dominant

3802
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:32,880
cryptocurrency and and the conception of

3803
02:03:31,439 --> 02:03:33,839
our industry that people interact with

3804
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:35,440
first

3805
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:37,360
is obviously very important and

3806
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:39,118
something that um

3807
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:40,719
i think really everybody in our industry

3808
02:03:39,118 --> 02:03:41,598
is grateful for right because without

3809
02:03:40,719 --> 02:03:43,920
bitcoin

3810
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:45,520
where where where would our industry be

3811
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:47,840
and that's obviously something that we

3812
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:49,520
we can't forget what are your thoughts

3813
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:52,960
about ethereum

3814
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:55,360
in this in the chain link distributed

3815
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:59,520
oracle network world

3816
02:03:55,359 --> 02:04:02,319
is it competition is it collaboration

3817
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:03,440
is it complementary technology what do

3818
02:04:02,319 --> 02:04:05,198
you think about ethereum

3819
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:07,118
how much do you think about ethereum

3820
02:04:05,198 --> 02:04:08,960
what role does it have

3821
02:04:07,118 --> 02:04:11,039
yeah i think about a lot i think it's

3822
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:13,198
complete we're completely complimentary

3823
02:04:11,039 --> 02:04:14,238
so there's no competitive dynamics in my

3824
02:04:13,198 --> 02:04:15,678
opinion we

3825
02:04:14,238 --> 02:04:17,439
are completely collaborative and

3826
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:19,440
complementary with ethereum

3827
02:04:17,439 --> 02:04:20,559
and all other blockchains and all other

3828
02:04:19,439 --> 02:04:23,759
layer twos

3829
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:24,079
that operate a contract right so we do

3830
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:26,719
not

3831
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:28,078
seek to operate a smart contract we seek

3832
02:04:26,719 --> 02:04:31,039
to augment

3833
02:04:28,078 --> 02:04:32,960
and enable smart contracts to go further

3834
02:04:31,039 --> 02:04:36,000
in what they're able to do

3835
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:37,520
in fact oracle networks have some value

3836
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,399
but they don't have nearly as much value

3837
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:40,560
in what they do

3838
02:04:38,399 --> 02:04:41,920
if there isn't a mission critical system

3839
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,840
like a smart contract

3840
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:46,000
that needs their data right so we've

3841
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:46,639
made our own explicit design decisions

3842
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,599
in our own

3843
02:04:46,639 --> 02:04:51,118
and created our own focus around

3844
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:54,000
guaranteeing that

3845
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:55,519
smart contracts can go further we've

3846
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,319
already done that right decentralized

3847
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:58,079
finance

3848
02:04:56,319 --> 02:04:59,279
the the rate at which we put data is to

3849
02:04:58,078 --> 02:05:01,359
a degree the rate at which certain

3850
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:03,198
decentralized financial markets grow

3851
02:05:01,359 --> 02:05:04,799
and as we put more data we see more

3852
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:06,719
financial products go live

3853
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:08,560
gaming we provide vrf so we have this

3854
02:05:06,719 --> 02:05:11,920
kind of focus and it's a very useful

3855
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:13,679
useful and valuable kind of valuable for

3856
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:17,279
our industry focus

3857
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:19,599
at at the end of the day i think that

3858
02:05:17,279 --> 02:05:22,399
smart contract platforms like ethereum

3859
02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:24,560
made a different set of design decisions

3860
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:26,078
from bitcoin and others and they focused

3861
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:27,599
on creating the smart contract

3862
02:05:26,078 --> 02:05:31,039
capability

3863
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:33,279
and and and they kind of wanted that

3864
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:34,319
functionality to exist and i think since

3865
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:36,158
then there's been a number of people

3866
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:38,399
that try to improve on that or try to

3867
02:05:36,158 --> 02:05:39,598
you know make variance of that from our

3868
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:42,158
point of view

3869
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:43,920
we want to support smart contracts in

3870
02:05:42,158 --> 02:05:46,799
all of their variations

3871
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:48,000
and in all of their use cases so one of

3872
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:51,279
the things that i i personally

3873
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:52,719
like about chain link is their ability

3874
02:05:51,279 --> 02:05:54,479
uh or chain links ability and the chain

3875
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:55,760
link network's ability to be useful to

3876
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:58,799
many different chains

3877
02:05:55,760 --> 02:06:00,400
and across many different use cases i'm

3878
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:02,000
personally you know a fan of ethereum

3879
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:03,198
ethereum's done a huge amount for our

3880
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,439
industry as well

3881
02:06:03,198 --> 02:06:06,879
ethereum took us from a world where it

3882
02:06:05,439 --> 02:06:07,919
literally took months to make a new

3883
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:09,760
smart contract

3884
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:12,078
by being forced to code it into a

3885
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:13,920
protocol you had to go to the protocol

3886
02:06:12,078 --> 02:06:16,319
developers and you had to say hey

3887
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:17,359
i need a dex or i need some kind of

3888
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:19,679
smart contract

3889
02:06:17,359 --> 02:06:21,359
put it in the protocol itself put it in

3890
02:06:19,679 --> 02:06:23,440
the actual blockchain

3891
02:06:21,359 --> 02:06:25,359
mining and kind of block generation

3892
02:06:23,439 --> 02:06:27,039
transaction generation protocol

3893
02:06:25,359 --> 02:06:28,319
that would take months or sometimes even

3894
02:06:27,039 --> 02:06:29,039
over a year that was a horrible

3895
02:06:28,319 --> 02:06:30,880
experience

3896
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:32,238
and and obviously very few people wanted

3897
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:33,760
to participate in that and so very few

3898
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:36,158
people made smart contracts

3899
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:37,280
which i was not a fan of right and then

3900
02:06:36,158 --> 02:06:39,359
ethereum came along

3901
02:06:37,279 --> 02:06:40,880
and um really did a lot of innovative

3902
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:42,479
things and introduced

3903
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:44,719
this approach to scriptable smart

3904
02:06:42,479 --> 02:06:47,359
contracts where you could script

3905
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:49,279
all of these different conditions and i

3906
02:06:47,359 --> 02:06:50,960
i i found that fascinating before

3907
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:51,679
ethereum i found that fascinating once

3908
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:53,359
ethereum

3909
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:55,199
arrived i found it fascinating after

3910
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:56,238
ethereum launched and i still find it

3911
02:06:55,198 --> 02:06:58,719
fascinating and i'm

3912
02:06:56,238 --> 02:07:00,399
i'm also very grateful to vitalik and

3913
02:06:58,719 --> 02:07:01,359
the ethereum community and all the core

3914
02:07:00,399 --> 02:07:03,920
developers there

3915
02:07:01,359 --> 02:07:05,598
for taking our industry a step further

3916
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:06,639
so i think they absolutely deserve a

3917
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:09,679
huge amount of credit

3918
02:07:06,639 --> 02:07:11,279
for taking our industry from it takes

3919
02:07:09,679 --> 02:07:12,158
months to make a really small smart

3920
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:14,719
contract

3921
02:07:12,158 --> 02:07:15,920
to it takes you know weeks to make a

3922
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:17,599
relatively secure

3923
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:20,319
relatively advanced piece of on-chain

3924
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:21,599
code that anybody can script and people

3925
02:07:20,319 --> 02:07:23,439
can do audits on

3926
02:07:21,599 --> 02:07:24,800
and you know that's that's an

3927
02:07:23,439 --> 02:07:25,598
unbelievable leap forward for our

3928
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:27,760
industry

3929
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:29,199
and i'm i'm genuinely grateful to them

3930
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:31,360
for that

3931
02:07:29,198 --> 02:07:32,319
i think the next step um in line with

3932
02:07:31,359 --> 02:07:35,118
our body of work

3933
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:36,479
is how does that scriptable on-chain

3934
02:07:35,118 --> 02:07:40,078
code

3935
02:07:36,479 --> 02:07:42,879
become more advanced in its interaction

3936
02:07:40,078 --> 02:07:44,399
with all of the systems and events in

3937
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:46,880
the real world

3938
02:07:44,399 --> 02:07:47,839
which is in my opinion the final missing

3939
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:50,000
piece of the puzzle

3940
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:51,199
right so my body of work the body of

3941
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,479
work that i'm involved in

3942
02:07:51,198 --> 02:07:54,559
would not be where it is right now

3943
02:07:52,479 --> 02:07:56,158
without bitcoin by any measure

3944
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:57,599
it wouldn't even be where it is now

3945
02:07:56,158 --> 02:07:59,679
without ethereum and

3946
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:01,360
the growth in smart contract development

3947
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:04,158
that they've created

3948
02:08:01,359 --> 02:08:05,598
and now what what i think is going to

3949
02:08:04,158 --> 02:08:07,519
happen next is there will be a lot of

3950
02:08:05,599 --> 02:08:09,520
different smart contract platforms

3951
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:11,119
a lot of different layer twos some of

3952
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:12,400
them will be private for enterprise some

3953
02:08:11,118 --> 02:08:14,078
of them are the republic

3954
02:08:12,399 --> 02:08:15,598
there will be some public winners in

3955
02:08:14,078 --> 02:08:17,359
certain geographies for

3956
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:18,960
maybe regulation reasons maybe other

3957
02:08:17,359 --> 02:08:19,759
reasons there will be other public

3958
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:22,158
winners

3959
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:23,199
um you know the larger internet and and

3960
02:08:22,158 --> 02:08:24,638
there will be a number of different

3961
02:08:23,198 --> 02:08:26,559
people building smart contracts in

3962
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:29,199
different languages

3963
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:30,880
we are excited and you know i am excited

3964
02:08:29,198 --> 02:08:31,359
and the chain-link community is excited

3965
02:08:30,880 --> 02:08:34,880
and

3966
02:08:31,359 --> 02:08:36,000
and basically there's a lot of um

3967
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:38,960
i mean for lack of a better word

3968
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:42,158
excitement in seeing our industry

3969
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:45,760
graduate to providing more

3970
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:46,559
um use cases more usable hybrid smart

3971
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:48,719
contracts

3972
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:50,159
right because once again it's absolutely

3973
02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:51,679
amazing that bitcoin created

3974
02:08:50,158 --> 02:08:53,679
non-governmental fiat money

3975
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:55,760
it's an unbelievable innovation and an

3976
02:08:53,679 --> 02:08:57,840
invented decentralized infrastructure

3977
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:58,960
and and and birthed our industry it's an

3978
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:00,800
unbelievably

3979
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:02,399
um great achievement an amazing

3980
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:03,840
achievement that we now have scriptable

3981
02:09:02,399 --> 02:09:04,638
smart contracts through something like

3982
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:07,119
ethereum

3983
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:08,639
once again monumental achievement in my

3984
02:09:07,118 --> 02:09:10,238
opinion

3985
02:09:08,639 --> 02:09:12,078
once again we still need to look to the

3986
02:09:10,238 --> 02:09:14,238
future we need to look to

3987
02:09:12,078 --> 02:09:15,519
how do we take the decentralized

3988
02:09:14,238 --> 02:09:17,198
infrastructure

3989
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:18,880
concepts that bitcoin initially put

3990
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:21,198
forward that ethereum then

3991
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:23,279
improved upon and created into these

3992
02:09:21,198 --> 02:09:26,000
scriptable smart contract formats

3993
02:09:23,279 --> 02:09:26,559
and how do we expand that into the world

3994
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,039
of

3995
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:30,480
real world outcomes to change the global

3996
02:09:29,039 --> 02:09:31,279
financial industry the global trade

3997
02:09:30,479 --> 02:09:33,759
industry

3998
02:09:31,279 --> 02:09:34,319
the global data marketplace industry you

3999
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:36,320
know the

4000
02:09:34,319 --> 02:09:38,238
and and many other global industries you

4001
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:39,439
mentioned results speak for themselves

4002
02:09:38,238 --> 02:09:42,959
and how design

4003
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:44,879
decisions have consequences you've

4004
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:46,158
the chain-link community have come up

4005
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:49,279
with a lot of

4006
02:09:46,158 --> 02:09:52,078
brilliant designs so how do you think

4007
02:09:49,279 --> 02:09:53,198
through the design choices that you're

4008
02:09:52,078 --> 02:09:55,679
facing

4009
02:09:53,198 --> 02:09:57,118
where you can't predict the future but

4010
02:09:55,679 --> 02:10:00,319
you're trying to create

4011
02:09:57,118 --> 02:10:03,679
a better future is there

4012
02:10:00,319 --> 02:10:05,920
something low-level

4013
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:07,920
introspective advice that you can give

4014
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:09,118
or describe as to how you think through

4015
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:11,359
those decisions

4016
02:10:09,118 --> 02:10:13,039
or high-level how you think about those

4017
02:10:11,359 --> 02:10:16,238
decisions

4018
02:10:13,039 --> 02:10:17,679
sure absolutely um i think i think

4019
02:10:16,238 --> 02:10:18,319
that's a great question and i think that

4020
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:20,239
actually gets

4021
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:23,198
to the core of what the chain link

4022
02:10:20,238 --> 02:10:26,319
network is uh supposed to achieve

4023
02:10:23,198 --> 02:10:28,319
we are supposed to achieve a maximally

4024
02:10:26,319 --> 02:10:29,920
flexible system

4025
02:10:28,319 --> 02:10:31,759
so once again this is the big difference

4026
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:32,480
between chain link and oracle networks

4027
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:34,480
in general

4028
02:10:32,479 --> 02:10:36,718
and blockchains in my opinion

4029
02:10:34,479 --> 02:10:38,000
blockchains do not seek to be maximally

4030
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:40,480
flexible right they say

4031
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,078
here's my block size here's the

4032
02:10:40,479 --> 02:10:44,559
transaction types you can you

4033
02:10:42,078 --> 02:10:46,158
you can put in those blocks here's the

4034
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:47,840
contract language i have

4035
02:10:46,158 --> 02:10:49,759
here's here's kind of my blockchain

4036
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:51,119
system right

4037
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:52,079
here's the here's the fee structure for

4038
02:10:51,118 --> 02:10:53,920
those blocks they're going to keep

4039
02:10:52,078 --> 02:10:55,759
getting you know kind of

4040
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:56,880
composed transactions are going to get

4041
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:58,400
put into blocks blocks they'll get

4042
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:00,319
connected and it'll continue right and

4043
02:10:58,399 --> 02:11:01,679
that's a very focused type of system

4044
02:11:00,319 --> 02:11:03,519
and that's great and that makes sense

4045
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:04,319
because it's focused on creating

4046
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:07,199
security

4047
02:11:04,319 --> 02:11:08,238
for that category of on-chain activity

4048
02:11:07,198 --> 02:11:10,238
which is once again

4049
02:11:08,238 --> 02:11:11,678
a critical critical part of building a

4050
02:11:10,238 --> 02:11:13,759
highly transparent system

4051
02:11:11,679 --> 02:11:14,960
and something that chain link enables

4052
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:17,280
and you know doesn't compete with and

4053
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:20,639
just enables to do more

4054
02:11:17,279 --> 02:11:23,599
oracle networks conversely have to

4055
02:11:20,639 --> 02:11:24,239
interact with all the world's data and

4056
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:26,400
provide

4057
02:11:24,238 --> 02:11:27,759
all the services that blockchains don't

4058
02:11:26,399 --> 02:11:28,479
provide right so there's kind of a

4059
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:29,920
spectrum

4060
02:11:28,479 --> 02:11:32,319
on one end of the spectrum you have

4061
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:34,800
blockchains that are highly secure

4062
02:11:32,319 --> 02:11:36,559
highly reliable highly tamper proof

4063
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:38,560
highly transparent

4064
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:40,960
but are not very feature-rich for

4065
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:42,480
example they cannot talk to an api

4066
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:44,719
many of them can't generate randomness

4067
02:11:42,479 --> 02:11:46,638
they cannot do some kind of privacy

4068
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:49,198
preserving computation so they're very

4069
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:50,960
secure and they're these kind of

4070
02:11:49,198 --> 02:11:52,799
data structures and smart contract

4071
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:54,800
platforms to hold

4072
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:56,400
unchained code that can define

4073
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:58,719
conditions receive

4074
02:11:56,399 --> 02:12:00,158
value pay value back out under

4075
02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:00,880
conditions and create transparency

4076
02:12:00,158 --> 02:12:03,279
around all that

4077
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:06,800
which makes perfect sense and then

4078
02:12:03,279 --> 02:12:08,719
there's oracles and oracle networks

4079
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:10,000
that is all the world's data right we're

4080
02:12:08,719 --> 02:12:11,840
talking about taking

4081
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,198
all the world's data and making it

4082
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:15,199
consumable for

4083
02:12:13,198 --> 02:12:16,479
all the world's use cases that have

4084
02:12:15,198 --> 02:12:18,158
trust issues

4085
02:12:16,479 --> 02:12:20,000
so the amount of variability there is

4086
02:12:18,158 --> 02:12:22,078
absolutely massive right

4087
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,760
it's like the the decentralized oracle

4088
02:12:22,078 --> 02:12:25,679
network and the conditions that that

4089
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:28,719
decentralized oracle network needs to

4090
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:30,399
meet is going to vary very widely from

4091
02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:33,359
an insurance contract

4092
02:12:30,399 --> 02:12:34,399
to a lending contract to an ad network

4093
02:12:33,359 --> 02:12:37,359
contract

4094
02:12:34,399 --> 02:12:38,158
to the data sales contract that that we

4095
02:12:37,359 --> 02:12:40,639
discussed

4096
02:12:38,158 --> 02:12:41,679
to any number of other smart contracts

4097
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:43,760
so really

4098
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:46,000
the ability of a decentralized oracle

4099
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:48,239
network to flexibly address

4100
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,760
all of those requirements is what's

4101
02:12:48,238 --> 02:12:52,238
necessary

4102
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:52,960
so flexibility is the goal whereas with

4103
02:12:52,238 --> 02:12:56,319
uh

4104
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:57,599
on chain like bitcoin flexibility is the

4105
02:12:56,319 --> 02:13:00,399
enemy

4106
02:12:57,599 --> 02:13:00,880
in the sense that uh you want security

4107
02:13:00,399 --> 02:13:03,920
the

4108
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:06,400
you want the focus there and

4109
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:08,158
in that kind of world design decisions

4110
02:13:06,399 --> 02:13:09,598
have huge consequences

4111
02:13:08,158 --> 02:13:12,158
and then if you look at the distributed

4112
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:15,119
oracle network side

4113
02:13:12,158 --> 02:13:16,078
you want to remove the restrictions of

4114
02:13:15,118 --> 02:13:18,319
design choices

4115
02:13:16,078 --> 02:13:19,279
you want to provide maximal flexibility

4116
02:13:18,319 --> 02:13:22,479
then so

4117
02:13:19,279 --> 02:13:24,399
it's a completely separate kind of uh

4118
02:13:22,479 --> 02:13:25,678
design framework it's a slightly

4119
02:13:24,399 --> 02:13:27,839
different problem right because i

4120
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:29,359
we're not trying to define transaction

4121
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:30,960
types fitting into blocks

4122
02:13:29,359 --> 02:13:33,359
on a certain timeline of those blocks

4123
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:35,359
being generated we're trying to say hey

4124
02:13:33,359 --> 02:13:36,639
there's this world of services or this

4125
02:13:35,359 --> 02:13:37,519
world of data that's not very

4126
02:13:36,639 --> 02:13:39,359
deterministic

4127
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:40,800
but it's unbelievably useful to these

4128
02:13:39,359 --> 02:13:42,880
smart contracts over here

4129
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,000
and actually they need it to even exist

4130
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:45,599
and we really want them to

4131
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,039
exist because once they exist it's going

4132
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:48,239
to completely redefine what our whole

4133
02:13:47,039 --> 02:13:50,719
industry is known for

4134
02:13:48,238 --> 02:13:52,078
right and define nfts are not even the

4135
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:53,520
tip of the iceberg they're like

4136
02:13:52,078 --> 02:13:55,439
like the snow coming off the top of the

4137
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:58,320
iceberg

4138
02:13:55,439 --> 02:13:59,839
and so our goal is to create a framework

4139
02:13:58,319 --> 02:14:03,118
and an infrastructure

4140
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:05,840
and a software that allows people to

4141
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:06,559
compose decentralized oracle networks

4142
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:08,239
right so

4143
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:09,920
initially you can compose a

4144
02:14:08,238 --> 02:14:12,000
decentralized oracle network

4145
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:14,000
of seven nodes that goes to three data

4146
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,198
sources to trigger your contract worth a

4147
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,560
million dollars

4148
02:14:15,198 --> 02:14:18,000
and that's where you could start and

4149
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:19,679
then let's say your smart contract your

4150
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,479
d5 smart contract goes to a billion

4151
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:22,239
dollars

4152
02:14:20,479 --> 02:14:24,000
well then you need to make some changes

4153
02:14:22,238 --> 02:14:27,198
right you need to go from seven nodes

4154
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:28,639
to 15 or maybe 31 nodes and you need to

4155
02:14:27,198 --> 02:14:30,960
go from three data sources

4156
02:14:28,639 --> 02:14:31,760
to five or seven and you maybe need to

4157
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:34,560
create some

4158
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:35,119
some kind of what we call circuit

4159
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:37,199
breakers

4160
02:14:35,118 --> 02:14:38,880
and and some other checks and you need

4161
02:14:37,198 --> 02:14:41,118
to make sure that the centralized oracle

4162
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:42,319
network comes to consensus around those

4163
02:14:41,118 --> 02:14:43,679
checks because now

4164
02:14:42,319 --> 02:14:44,639
the decentralized oracle network isn't

4165
02:14:43,679 --> 02:14:46,000
controlling a million dollars it's

4166
02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:47,440
controlling a billion dollars

4167
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,880
and we have decentralized oracle

4168
02:14:47,439 --> 02:14:50,319
networks that control well over a

4169
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:51,118
billion dollars multiple billions of

4170
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:52,799
dollars

4171
02:14:51,118 --> 02:14:54,399
and we see them growing and getting more

4172
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:55,840
advanced data sources and more advanced

4173
02:14:54,399 --> 02:14:57,598
features

4174
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:58,719
and then if somebody else comes and says

4175
02:14:57,599 --> 02:15:00,480
well you know i don't really want to

4176
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:01,359
make a d5 product i want to make crop

4177
02:15:00,479 --> 02:15:02,959
insurance

4178
02:15:01,359 --> 02:15:04,479
and i have a completely different set of

4179
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:05,279
conditions i want this method of

4180
02:15:04,479 --> 02:15:07,439
consensus

4181
02:15:05,279 --> 02:15:08,880
and i want data to be aggregated in this

4182
02:15:07,439 --> 02:15:10,638
way but not the way that you do for

4183
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:11,840
decentralized financial products

4184
02:15:10,639 --> 02:15:13,760
i mean what are we supposed to tell them

4185
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:15,360
we're supposed to tell them no you know

4186
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:16,480
our decentralized oracle network can't

4187
02:15:15,359 --> 02:15:18,399
let you do that

4188
02:15:16,479 --> 02:15:20,238
and yours you know you can go and and

4189
02:15:18,399 --> 02:15:23,198
wait another five years until

4190
02:15:20,238 --> 02:15:24,718
until somebody builds it for you that's

4191
02:15:23,198 --> 02:15:26,319
not what we want to do right what we

4192
02:15:24,719 --> 02:15:29,359
want to do is be able to say

4193
02:15:26,319 --> 02:15:30,559
absolutely here's an example

4194
02:15:29,359 --> 02:15:32,479
of how somebody else made a

4195
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:36,079
decentralized oracle network for

4196
02:15:32,479 --> 02:15:38,799
for weather weather insurance right um

4197
02:15:36,078 --> 02:15:41,198
here's a template change that template

4198
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:42,960
evolve it to meet your needs

4199
02:15:41,198 --> 02:15:45,279
and then someone else comes and says hey

4200
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:45,920
i have some some other use case in

4201
02:15:45,279 --> 02:15:48,319
gaming

4202
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:50,000
right i want to make nfts related to

4203
02:15:48,319 --> 02:15:51,759
real world sports events or i want to do

4204
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:54,078
whatever i want to do with with some

4205
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:56,480
kind of sports related data

4206
02:15:54,078 --> 02:15:57,118
wonderful here's the framework here are

4207
02:15:56,479 --> 02:15:59,678
your risk

4208
02:15:57,118 --> 02:16:00,399
dynamics here's a collection of node

4209
02:15:59,679 --> 02:16:02,840
operators

4210
02:16:00,399 --> 02:16:05,759
here's a set of pre pre-integrated data

4211
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:06,880
sources here's a reputation system to

4212
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:09,840
assess

4213
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:11,599
the quality of your ensemble of nodes

4214
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:14,480
here's a way to scale that up as the

4215
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:16,480
as the value in your contract scales

4216
02:16:14,479 --> 02:16:19,359
here's all the tools that you need

4217
02:16:16,479 --> 02:16:21,279
to build this contract and and what we

4218
02:16:19,359 --> 02:16:23,679
actually see now as we as there are

4219
02:16:21,279 --> 02:16:25,198
multiple types of computations and data

4220
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:27,279
data sources that are provided by

4221
02:16:25,198 --> 02:16:29,919
different decentralized oracle networks

4222
02:16:27,279 --> 02:16:30,399
of which there are now hundreds we now

4223
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:33,120
see

4224
02:16:30,399 --> 02:16:34,959
that a single hybrid smart contract

4225
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:35,840
might use multiple decentralized oracle

4226
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:37,598
networks

4227
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:39,120
so there might be a hybrid smart

4228
02:16:37,599 --> 02:16:41,200
contract that uses a

4229
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,399
price data decentralized oracle network

4230
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:44,079
a proof of reserve

4231
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:45,439
oracle network a random historical

4232
02:16:44,079 --> 02:16:47,359
network

4233
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:48,719
and i think we're going to continue to

4234
02:16:47,359 --> 02:16:51,120
see this dynamic

4235
02:16:48,718 --> 02:16:52,558
that more and more advanced contracts

4236
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:55,040
compose

4237
02:16:52,558 --> 02:16:57,279
various decentralized oracle networks

4238
02:16:55,040 --> 02:17:01,200
into more advanced use cases

4239
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:03,280
and this is this is the dynamic that um

4240
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:04,639
you know we're focused on enabling and i

4241
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:06,479
think it's actually a very virtuous

4242
02:17:04,638 --> 02:17:08,558
cycle for everybody because

4243
02:17:06,478 --> 02:17:10,318
the more of these hybrid smart contracts

4244
02:17:08,558 --> 02:17:12,799
we enable on ethereum

4245
02:17:10,318 --> 02:17:14,000
and other blockchains the more our

4246
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:17,119
industry provides

4247
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,638
real world outcomes to the larger world

4248
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:21,120
which is at the end of the day what i

4249
02:17:18,638 --> 02:17:23,119
think everybody in our industry wants

4250
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:24,719
everybody in our industry wants hybrid

4251
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:27,760
smart contracts

4252
02:17:24,718 --> 02:17:29,518
to become the way that global finance

4253
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:31,280
works global trade works global

4254
02:17:29,519 --> 02:17:33,519
insurance products work

4255
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:34,319
because they will inherently need both a

4256
02:17:33,519 --> 02:17:36,318
blockchain

4257
02:17:34,318 --> 02:17:38,558
on which on which the contract itself

4258
02:17:36,318 --> 02:17:40,079
lives and an oracle network

4259
02:17:38,558 --> 02:17:43,119
that powers all of the other

4260
02:17:40,079 --> 02:17:45,039
interactions right as a developer

4261
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:47,040
how would you recommend somebody

4262
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:50,160
listening to this

4263
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:50,160
but also me

4264
02:17:50,239 --> 02:17:54,959
to get started with smart contracts and

4265
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:58,160
to get started with hybrid

4266
02:17:54,959 --> 02:18:00,000
smart contracts well well for hybrid

4267
02:17:58,159 --> 02:18:01,840
smart contracts i'm going to have to do

4268
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:05,200
some kind of shameless promotion

4269
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:08,000
please where let me twist your arm

4270
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:08,639
thank you um i i think you can go to our

4271
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,478
youtube

4272
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:12,239
we we have a lot a number of developer

4273
02:18:10,478 --> 02:18:13,840
tutorials chain link youtube

4274
02:18:12,239 --> 02:18:15,039
yeah chain link you i think you could

4275
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:16,398
just search shane link on youtube you

4276
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:18,880
should you should find it

4277
02:18:16,398 --> 02:18:19,760
um beyond that we recently had a

4278
02:18:18,879 --> 02:18:22,079
hackathon we

4279
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:24,000
where we had a huge amount of very very

4280
02:18:22,079 --> 02:18:27,039
kind of advanced hybrid smart contracts

4281
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,879
getting built to elaborate on that

4282
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:30,639
you had a hackathon is that something

4283
02:18:28,879 --> 02:18:33,759
that people can follow along

4284
02:18:30,638 --> 02:18:36,159
like a video or there's web page

4285
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:38,159
traces of what happened or is there

4286
02:18:36,159 --> 02:18:38,478
future actual hackathons that people

4287
02:18:38,159 --> 02:18:40,079
could

4288
02:18:38,478 --> 02:18:41,920
literally participate in there's plenty

4289
02:18:40,079 --> 02:18:44,000
of more hackathons coming up we want to

4290
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:46,239
enable as many developers in web 3 and

4291
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:48,159
web 2 to build hybrid smart contracts as

4292
02:18:46,239 --> 02:18:50,239
a way to redefine our industry and

4293
02:18:48,159 --> 02:18:52,318
and kind of make all of these smart

4294
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:53,519
contracts come to life

4295
02:18:52,318 --> 02:18:55,599
there are definitely going to be more

4296
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:57,359
hackathons so people should go and

4297
02:18:55,599 --> 02:18:59,120
pre-register register on a list to get

4298
02:18:57,359 --> 02:19:00,399
involved in that that's a great resource

4299
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:01,840
where we have a lot of speakers and a

4300
02:19:00,398 --> 02:19:02,718
lot of educational tools they happen

4301
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:05,439
over a course of

4302
02:19:02,718 --> 02:19:06,239
weeks not days so there's a long time

4303
02:19:05,439 --> 02:19:07,519
for people

4304
02:19:06,239 --> 02:19:09,840
to work on these things at the speed

4305
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:11,920
that they that they find comfortable

4306
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:12,880
two questions one is there kind of a

4307
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:16,079
hello world

4308
02:19:12,879 --> 02:19:18,478
entry point for uh

4309
02:19:16,079 --> 02:19:20,398
hybrid smart contracts and two on the

4310
02:19:18,478 --> 02:19:22,318
hackathon side like what kind of stuff

4311
02:19:20,398 --> 02:19:25,039
do you see people building at first

4312
02:19:22,318 --> 02:19:27,199
just kind of getting their feet wet like

4313
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:28,800
why in terms of the kind of applications

4314
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:30,159
that could be enabled

4315
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:32,000
i mean there's there's unbelievable

4316
02:19:30,159 --> 02:19:34,159
things that that that we see people

4317
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,439
building i i think

4318
02:19:34,159 --> 02:19:37,200
how to get your feed with i think the

4319
02:19:35,439 --> 02:19:38,479
hello world is probably define because

4320
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:39,760
it's pretty straightforward

4321
02:19:38,478 --> 02:19:41,119
and there's a large amount of data

4322
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:42,719
sources that we already have putting

4323
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:44,240
data on chain on testnet

4324
02:19:42,718 --> 02:19:46,398
which is the test environment in which

4325
02:19:44,239 --> 02:19:47,039
people would build so i think d5 is

4326
02:19:46,398 --> 02:19:48,398
probably

4327
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:51,840
to a certain degree the most exciting

4328
02:19:48,398 --> 02:19:54,159
for certain people and pretty pretty

4329
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:55,840
expansive in terms of the tutorials and

4330
02:19:54,159 --> 02:19:57,680
the amount of contracts to see how

4331
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:59,040
people have already built it

4332
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:00,398
i think beyond that we see people

4333
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:02,319
building amazing things at these

4334
02:20:00,398 --> 02:20:04,639
hackathons in the previous hackathon

4335
02:20:02,318 --> 02:20:06,000
we saw somebody build a smart contract

4336
02:20:04,639 --> 02:20:08,239
that allows

4337
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,120
the rental out someone to rent out their

4338
02:20:08,239 --> 02:20:12,478
tesla

4339
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:15,680
right so it allows the tesla api

4340
02:20:12,478 --> 02:20:17,438
to give someone else access and rent out

4341
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:19,680
someone's tesla on the basis of a smart

4342
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:21,439
contract kind of coordinating payment

4343
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:23,920
which was you know which was kind of

4344
02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:24,800
amazing the the more recent hackathon we

4345
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:26,318
saw something

4346
02:20:24,799 --> 02:20:27,840
called d-bridge which uh is a

4347
02:20:26,318 --> 02:20:29,439
cross-chain solution that uses oracle

4348
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:30,478
networks to confirm data on different

4349
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:33,840
chains

4350
02:20:30,478 --> 02:20:36,318
so i think the things that people build

4351
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:37,760
will will just become expansive and

4352
02:20:36,318 --> 02:20:41,119
varied in ways that i can't

4353
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:42,800
can't even imagine um but i i think this

4354
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:45,439
recent hackathon saw

4355
02:20:42,799 --> 02:20:46,639
a huge huge list of different um

4356
02:20:45,439 --> 02:20:47,840
different kind of winners in different

4357
02:20:46,639 --> 02:20:49,199
categories

4358
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:51,520
and there's so many different categories

4359
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:53,200
we even have a gov tech category and

4360
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:54,640
a whole a whole bunch of things if

4361
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:55,840
people want to see what's possible they

4362
02:20:54,639 --> 02:20:57,279
can go look at the winners

4363
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:59,359
i think that's that's probably a good

4364
02:20:57,280 --> 02:21:00,720
idea at

4365
02:20:59,359 --> 02:21:02,880
yeah that's that'll be on the side of

4366
02:21:00,719 --> 02:21:03,679
the hackathon there's a blog related to

4367
02:21:02,879 --> 02:21:05,279
that

4368
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:08,398
and we're going to have more of these

4369
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:11,359
and once again our our explicit goal

4370
02:21:08,398 --> 02:21:13,039
is to take our industry into this world

4371
02:21:11,359 --> 02:21:14,800
of hybrid smart contracts

4372
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:16,800
which which just benefits everybody it

4373
02:21:14,799 --> 02:21:20,000
makes more on chain activity

4374
02:21:16,799 --> 02:21:21,599
it it helps provide real world value to

4375
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,439
the average person from all of this

4376
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:26,000
infrastructure period

4377
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:28,159
and at the end of the day i think that

4378
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:30,478
it just redefines what our industry is

4379
02:21:28,159 --> 02:21:32,959
about through use cases right because

4380
02:21:30,478 --> 02:21:34,398
if you only learn through our industry

4381
02:21:32,959 --> 02:21:34,879
from the point of view of a single use

4382
02:21:34,398 --> 02:21:36,879
case

4383
02:21:34,879 --> 02:21:39,599
like the nft use case or some other use

4384
02:21:36,879 --> 02:21:41,679
case that's what our industry is about

4385
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:43,040
and the more of these use cases that

4386
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:45,200
people can make available

4387
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:46,720
to the average person or to the fintech

4388
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:47,520
world or to the insurance world or

4389
02:21:46,719 --> 02:21:50,639
wherever

4390
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:53,040
the faster our industry will not just be

4391
02:21:50,639 --> 02:21:55,119
about bitcoins or tokens it will be

4392
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:56,800
about changing global finance

4393
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:58,240
changing global insurance changing

4394
02:21:56,799 --> 02:22:00,559
global trade and

4395
02:21:58,239 --> 02:22:02,159
and that's the change in the world that

4396
02:22:00,559 --> 02:22:03,359
i and a lot of other people in this

4397
02:22:02,159 --> 02:22:05,359
industry i think

4398
02:22:03,359 --> 02:22:06,880
got into this for now it's funny you've

4399
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:08,479
mentioned about

4400
02:22:06,879 --> 02:22:10,318
you've had a lot of kind words to say

4401
02:22:08,478 --> 02:22:12,478
about bitcoin and um

4402
02:22:10,318 --> 02:22:14,398
ethereum as important technology that

4403
02:22:12,478 --> 02:22:17,039
paved the way for the future

4404
02:22:14,398 --> 02:22:18,639
and you somehow did not mention one of

4405
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:20,479
the most profound pieces of technology

4406
02:22:18,639 --> 02:22:21,920
which is dogecoin

4407
02:22:20,478 --> 02:22:24,398
what are your thoughts about this

4408
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:26,559
particular uh

4409
02:22:24,398 --> 02:22:28,159
uh revolutionary technology and what are

4410
02:22:26,559 --> 02:22:28,879
your thoughts about deutsche coin going

4411
02:22:28,159 --> 02:22:32,398
to the moon

4412
02:22:28,879 --> 02:22:34,478
to mars and outside of the solar system

4413
02:22:32,398 --> 02:22:36,559
i think dogecoin is um is a very

4414
02:22:34,478 --> 02:22:38,639
interesting kind of uh

4415
02:22:36,559 --> 02:22:40,000
probably closer to a social experiment

4416
02:22:38,639 --> 02:22:42,719
than than anything else

4417
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:44,478
isn't everything a social experiment

4418
02:22:42,719 --> 02:22:45,039
yeah i i guess that's fair to to a

4419
02:22:44,478 --> 02:22:47,840
degree

4420
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:48,720
yeah um i think it's fascinating how

4421
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:51,120
that's evolved

4422
02:22:48,719 --> 02:22:52,239
um i think the people that made it made

4423
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:53,760
it with certain you know

4424
02:22:52,239 --> 02:22:55,920
goals in mind and then it's kind of

4425
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:57,920
taken on a life of its own

4426
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:59,200
i don't fully understand exactly why

4427
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:01,359
it's taking on a life of

4428
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:03,280
of its own at this point um i once again

4429
02:23:01,359 --> 02:23:05,280
i don't spend too much time thinking

4430
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:07,280
about you know different tokens and

4431
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:09,200
and and how they're evolving i'm much

4432
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:12,960
more focused on on the launching

4433
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:15,439
and um the technology around trust

4434
02:23:12,959 --> 02:23:16,159
and all those kinds of ideas but you

4435
02:23:15,439 --> 02:23:17,520
know i think

4436
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:20,239
one of the fascinating things about

4437
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:23,439
doshcoin is

4438
02:23:20,239 --> 02:23:26,559
how technology that is

4439
02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:27,920
that leverages social dynamics that

4440
02:23:26,559 --> 02:23:31,119
technology's ability

4441
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:33,680
to utilize fun and memes

4442
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:34,319
to spread i think it's really

4443
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:36,479
interesting

4444
02:23:34,318 --> 02:23:37,760
i i don't think it should be discounted

4445
02:23:36,478 --> 02:23:39,599
as a

4446
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:41,760
as if i think i tweeted today something

4447
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:44,880
about like the fundamental force

4448
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:47,840
field of fun uh that fun

4449
02:23:44,879 --> 02:23:49,599
has an effect on the space time so

4450
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:53,200
general relativity

4451
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:56,000
describes how mass and energy

4452
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:58,399
can curve space time and i was just

4453
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:00,318
giving an example that when life is fun

4454
02:23:58,398 --> 02:24:01,439
it seems short when life is not fun it

4455
02:24:00,318 --> 02:24:03,439
seems very long

4456
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:05,680
so fun has a very similar effect on

4457
02:24:03,439 --> 02:24:08,159
space time like in current space time

4458
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:10,000
in that same sense there there is a

4459
02:24:08,159 --> 02:24:12,478
power to the meme

4460
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:14,239
and i think dogecoin illustrates that i

4461
02:24:12,478 --> 02:24:16,318
think elon is an example of somebody

4462
02:24:14,239 --> 02:24:17,359
that uses dogecoin i don't know his

4463
02:24:16,318 --> 02:24:20,000
philosophy but

4464
02:24:17,359 --> 02:24:21,520
in particular in this aspect but he does

4465
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:25,200
use it effectively

4466
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:26,800
to excite the world in a fun way

4467
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:28,960
about the possibilities of future

4468
02:24:26,799 --> 02:24:30,879
technologies like cryptocurrency

4469
02:24:28,959 --> 02:24:32,559
i think the bitcoin world is very

4470
02:24:30,879 --> 02:24:35,519
serious right now

4471
02:24:32,559 --> 02:24:36,639
and we've spoken to about bitcoin

4472
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:40,079
maximalists

4473
02:24:36,639 --> 02:24:40,719
there is very little space for fun and

4474
02:24:40,079 --> 02:24:44,079
joking

4475
02:24:40,719 --> 02:24:47,279
in the bitcoin world but there's still

4476
02:24:44,079 --> 02:24:48,559
a little bit of fun and uh humor left in

4477
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:50,800
the dochcoin world

4478
02:24:48,559 --> 02:24:54,719
in that sense i think it's exceptionally

4479
02:24:50,799 --> 02:24:57,279
powerful to inspire to excite

4480
02:24:54,719 --> 02:25:00,239
to uh to be able to talk about stuff

4481
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:03,600
without um

4482
02:25:00,239 --> 02:25:06,559
without the seriousness of

4483
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:08,880
financial impact that uh now certain

4484
02:25:06,559 --> 02:25:12,079
cryptocurrencies have like bitcoin

4485
02:25:08,879 --> 02:25:13,759
so i i keep an eye on i i've previously

4486
02:25:12,079 --> 02:25:16,079
mentioned that dogecoin i think

4487
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:17,040
is a fascinating piece of technology

4488
02:25:16,079 --> 02:25:20,398
because i do

4489
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:22,720
think cryptocurrency is much bigger than

4490
02:25:20,398 --> 02:25:23,760
uh the the technology like that you

4491
02:25:22,719 --> 02:25:26,239
focus on

4492
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:27,680
there is also social element that you

4493
02:25:26,239 --> 02:25:29,600
also spoke to

4494
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:31,120
that's uh i think not quite yet

4495
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:34,000
understood

4496
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:35,359
and it's fascinating to watch especially

4497
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,439
as it covals

4498
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:39,600
with the different tools on the internet

4499
02:25:37,439 --> 02:25:41,120
different social networks

4500
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:43,920
social network mechanisms on the

4501
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:46,399
internet so

4502
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:49,680
i'm a huge supporter of dogecoin because

4503
02:25:46,398 --> 02:25:49,680
i'm a huge supporter of fun

4504
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:53,840
i'm fascinated to see how it'll work out

4505
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:57,680
you think i'll go to the moon you think

4506
02:25:56,159 --> 02:25:59,200
it'll be the first cryptocurrency to

4507
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:01,040
land on the moon

4508
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:02,640
i i couldn't say i i haven't i haven't

4509
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:04,960
done the analysis as

4510
02:26:02,639 --> 02:26:07,840
i've said before i haven't done the

4511
02:26:04,959 --> 02:26:07,839
analysis well yeah

4512
02:26:08,879 --> 02:26:12,478
no matter what i do hope we uh we'll get

4513
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:16,640
humans back on the moon

4514
02:26:12,478 --> 02:26:20,239
and uh hopefully get humans on mars soon

4515
02:26:16,639 --> 02:26:24,398
coin bitcoin

4516
02:26:20,239 --> 02:26:27,439
or not let me ask you about books

4517
02:26:24,398 --> 02:26:29,119
and movies what books and movies in your

4518
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:32,479
life

4519
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:33,760
long ago when you were a baby sergey or

4520
02:26:32,478 --> 02:26:37,358
today

4521
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:39,040
had an impact on you maybe you would

4522
02:26:37,359 --> 02:26:42,318
recommend to others

4523
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:43,200
and and maybe what ideas um you took

4524
02:26:42,318 --> 02:26:46,000
away from those

4525
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:46,880
books movies coloring books children's

4526
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:50,318
books

4527
02:26:46,879 --> 02:26:53,039
blogs whatever yeah yeah sure

4528
02:26:50,318 --> 02:26:54,398
um so i think one of the things that had

4529
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:56,800
a very big impact on me

4530
02:26:54,398 --> 02:26:58,559
were plato's dialogues and particularly

4531
02:26:56,799 --> 02:27:02,639
protagoras and gorgeous as

4532
02:26:58,559 --> 02:27:05,279
as as some of the two initial ones

4533
02:27:02,639 --> 02:27:06,000
i i think what plato's dialogues do very

4534
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:08,800
well is they

4535
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:09,920
give people a clear picture of what

4536
02:27:08,799 --> 02:27:12,799
dialogue looks like

4537
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:13,600
and what the assessment of information

4538
02:27:12,799 --> 02:27:15,599
um

4539
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:17,600
probably should look like right and how

4540
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:19,520
the dissection

4541
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:21,280
and analysis of an idea is very

4542
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:22,239
important and how it can actually be

4543
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:25,120
taken in either

4544
02:27:22,239 --> 02:27:26,879
direction but at the end of the day that

4545
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:30,000
the process of eliminating

4546
02:27:26,879 --> 02:27:32,719
um kind of this fuzzy thinking

4547
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,959
and arriving at whether it's an external

4548
02:27:32,719 --> 02:27:37,119
dialogue or an internal dialogue

4549
02:27:34,959 --> 02:27:38,799
about an accurate picture of reality is

4550
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:40,560
actually very important

4551
02:27:38,799 --> 02:27:42,398
and so i think i'm very lucky to have

4552
02:27:40,559 --> 02:27:44,719
read the dialogues

4553
02:27:42,398 --> 02:27:46,398
when i was uh in my early teenage years

4554
02:27:44,719 --> 02:27:47,679
and it had a very large impact on me

4555
02:27:46,398 --> 02:27:49,358
because it kind of

4556
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:50,880
showed me that you know nobody knows

4557
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:53,520
what they're talking about

4558
02:27:50,879 --> 02:27:55,039
i would i would play out dialogues in my

4559
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:56,720
mind

4560
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:58,800
and i would engage in certain dialogues

4561
02:27:56,719 --> 02:28:00,879
with with um with different people

4562
02:27:58,799 --> 02:28:02,000
and what you know the platonic dialogue

4563
02:28:00,879 --> 02:28:04,719
showed me was

4564
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:05,920
kind of how to tell when someone has no

4565
02:28:04,719 --> 02:28:08,799
clue

4566
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:11,200
and a lot of people are very good at um

4567
02:28:08,799 --> 02:28:13,119
kind of

4568
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:14,560
say they have a clue right saying like

4569
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:15,760
here is how the world works here's what

4570
02:28:14,559 --> 02:28:17,039
you should do with your life here's what

4571
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:18,159
you should do with your time here's what

4572
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:19,680
you should do with your money here's

4573
02:28:18,159 --> 02:28:21,039
what you should do with your attention

4574
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:22,800
here's what you should do with all these

4575
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:24,840
things and

4576
02:28:22,799 --> 02:28:26,318
i think the ability to evaluate

4577
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:28,719
information

4578
02:28:26,318 --> 02:28:30,398
generally is something that is

4579
02:28:28,719 --> 02:28:32,478
surprisingly under

4580
02:28:30,398 --> 02:28:33,760
taught i i don't actually understand why

4581
02:28:32,478 --> 02:28:35,760
there isn't a course

4582
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:36,800
in like high schools or universities

4583
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:39,280
that's just like

4584
02:28:36,799 --> 02:28:41,039
here is how you evaluate information

4585
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:43,040
here's how you engage in external

4586
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:44,640
dialogue and internal dialogue

4587
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:46,640
to arrive at an accurate picture of

4588
02:28:44,639 --> 02:28:48,000
reality rather than the picture of

4589
02:28:46,639 --> 02:28:48,478
reality that other people want you to

4590
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,120
have

4591
02:28:48,478 --> 02:28:52,639
for their benefit most often right and

4592
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:54,880
at the end of the day

4593
02:28:52,639 --> 02:28:57,039
i think that put me down a path to

4594
02:28:54,879 --> 02:29:00,239
really try and understand

4595
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:03,600
beyond that um i think biographies

4596
02:29:00,239 --> 02:29:05,280
have had a very large impact on me um

4597
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:06,960
you know plutarch's greek and roman

4598
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:08,640
lives after i read plato

4599
02:29:06,959 --> 02:29:10,239
i started reading a bunch of stuff greek

4600
02:29:08,639 --> 02:29:12,000
stuff i was just like these greek guys

4601
02:29:10,239 --> 02:29:13,840
they really know how it is

4602
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:15,280
you know they did this 2000 years ago

4603
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:17,120
and they still got it right

4604
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:18,800
there's something here it's kind of this

4605
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:20,479
like theory of time

4606
02:29:18,799 --> 02:29:22,799
around um the value of intellectual

4607
02:29:20,478 --> 02:29:25,119
ideas right if an intellectual idea

4608
02:29:22,799 --> 02:29:27,039
has survived the test of time it's much

4609
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:28,640
more valuable than the intellectual idea

4610
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:30,640
that i just came up with 10 minutes ago

4611
02:29:28,639 --> 02:29:31,199
haven't told anybody and hasn't gone up

4612
02:29:30,639 --> 02:29:34,840
against

4613
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:37,840
you know the all of the kind of

4614
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:40,000
rebuttals so so what's your favorite

4615
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:41,760
what would you say would be a most

4616
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:43,200
impactful biography that you've come

4617
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:44,960
across

4618
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:46,479
i don't think it was those greek roman

4619
02:29:44,959 --> 02:29:52,000
biographies because they were very

4620
02:29:46,478 --> 02:29:52,000
uh far away i think that um

4621
02:29:52,079 --> 02:29:55,120
probably one of the most impactful ones

4622
02:29:54,398 --> 02:29:57,519
that i can

4623
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:59,200
remember recently is around uh

4624
02:29:57,520 --> 02:30:01,600
vanderbilt

4625
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:03,520
and so vanderbilt was these uh was this

4626
02:30:01,600 --> 02:30:05,359
guy who basically

4627
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:07,200
without that much of an education he

4628
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:09,200
would

4629
02:30:07,200 --> 02:30:11,439
invent or work with people to make these

4630
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:12,079
steamboats and then he had a lot of

4631
02:30:11,439 --> 02:30:15,439
acumen

4632
02:30:12,079 --> 02:30:18,639
around creating certain monopolies

4633
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:21,920
regardless of you know what

4634
02:30:18,639 --> 02:30:23,279
was um right or wasn't right

4635
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:25,359
and then fascinatingly enough it all

4636
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:27,359
hinged on like a supreme court case

4637
02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:28,720
that decided if monopolies were

4638
02:30:27,359 --> 02:30:30,640
acceptable

4639
02:30:28,719 --> 02:30:32,799
um in in the form of state created

4640
02:30:30,639 --> 02:30:35,119
monopolies or not

4641
02:30:32,799 --> 02:30:36,879
and if they were you know if it was

4642
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:38,000
deemed that the greater monopolies were

4643
02:30:36,879 --> 02:30:39,358
acceptable he would have had a huge

4644
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,959
problem this guy

4645
02:30:39,359 --> 02:30:42,960
but it was deemed that state created

4646
02:30:40,959 --> 02:30:46,000
monopolies through these um

4647
02:30:42,959 --> 02:30:49,279
licenses for steamboat uh routes

4648
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:50,719
was not acceptable and that did two

4649
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:54,479
interesting things that unseated

4650
02:30:50,719 --> 02:30:57,039
um some kind of old-time landed gentry

4651
02:30:54,478 --> 02:30:57,920
in the americas in like the 1830s and

4652
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,479
40s

4653
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:03,040
and it um you know basically made him

4654
02:31:00,478 --> 02:31:05,438
right and he saw it before other people

4655
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:06,960
so i i think this i think vanderbilt was

4656
02:31:05,439 --> 02:31:09,359
a very interesting

4657
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:11,438
um personality first of all of all the

4658
02:31:09,359 --> 02:31:16,159
of all the biographies that i read

4659
02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:16,159
is um is somebody who really took um

4660
02:31:16,478 --> 02:31:21,199
took the situation in hand and kind of

4661
02:31:18,159 --> 02:31:23,359
took action to achieve an outcome

4662
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:24,240
which i i think was uh was an amazing uh

4663
02:31:23,359 --> 02:31:27,120
amazing um

4664
02:31:24,239 --> 02:31:27,600
result the fascinating thing by the way

4665
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:29,520
is

4666
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:30,800
or amazing way of looking at things the

4667
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:31,920
fascinating thing by the way is that the

4668
02:31:30,799 --> 02:31:35,199
ferries now

4669
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:37,600
in new york harbor are all um run

4670
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:39,040
as a public good so the fascinating

4671
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:40,800
thing is that the guy he

4672
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:43,120
he focused on an industry and he worked

4673
02:31:40,799 --> 02:31:45,759
on something that was so important

4674
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:46,160
that it ended up becoming a public good

4675
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:48,079
and i

4676
02:31:46,159 --> 02:31:49,920
i think that that that's an interesting

4677
02:31:48,079 --> 02:31:53,039
conception of of how to look at

4678
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:54,799
this industry um i think there's um

4679
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:56,560
a lot of economics dynamics around this

4680
02:31:54,799 --> 02:31:57,840
industry but i think i might have sent

4681
02:31:56,559 --> 02:31:58,879
this i might have said this somewhere

4682
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:01,359
else before

4683
02:31:58,879 --> 02:32:03,199
but really the success of someone in

4684
02:32:01,359 --> 02:32:05,600
this industry

4685
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:09,439
is whether they're able to make a linux

4686
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:14,000
or http or an https like system

4687
02:32:09,439 --> 02:32:16,318
that lives on for a very long time

4688
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:18,000
and is essentially a kind of public good

4689
02:32:16,318 --> 02:32:20,000
it's a success

4690
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:21,600
of an idea even if that idea is

4691
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:24,079
originally sort of a capitalist

4692
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:25,200
idea about that's grounded in financial

4693
02:32:24,079 --> 02:32:27,200
benefit

4694
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:29,600
success of it is if it becomes a public

4695
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:32,159
good it is so universal

4696
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:34,239
it is it is so fundamental to the

4697
02:32:32,159 --> 02:32:37,359
quality of life that it's a public good

4698
02:32:34,239 --> 02:32:39,680
it's deemed to be so valuable that it

4699
02:32:37,359 --> 02:32:41,439
should be a public good

4700
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:43,280
yeah i think so i think that's a pretty

4701
02:32:41,439 --> 02:32:43,760
uh a pretty good definition of success

4702
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:46,159
that you

4703
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:47,359
you work on a body of work and that body

4704
02:32:46,159 --> 02:32:50,318
of work isn't just

4705
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:52,159
some commercial enterprise it's um it's

4706
02:32:50,318 --> 02:32:54,478
a body of work that

4707
02:32:52,159 --> 02:32:56,559
whatever commercial aspects or economic

4708
02:32:54,478 --> 02:32:58,959
incentive aspects it might have

4709
02:32:56,559 --> 02:32:59,680
it eventually is so important that it

4710
02:32:58,959 --> 02:33:02,719
becomes

4711
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:04,000
um critical to how society functions uh

4712
02:33:02,719 --> 02:33:06,879
i'm personally quite

4713
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:07,840
um you know lucky and grateful to be in

4714
02:33:06,879 --> 02:33:10,079
my opinion

4715
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:10,960
working on something like that with an

4716
02:33:10,079 --> 02:33:13,840
amazing

4717
02:33:10,959 --> 02:33:15,599
team and an amazing community that uh

4718
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:17,760
seems to really very much care about

4719
02:33:15,600 --> 02:33:21,439
this hybrid smart contract

4720
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:22,639
transparent uh world that uh you know

4721
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:24,239
a lot of people on our industry

4722
02:33:22,639 --> 02:33:25,358
realistically i think this is why a lot

4723
02:33:24,239 --> 02:33:26,799
of them signed up

4724
02:33:25,359 --> 02:33:28,880
you know this is why i came into our

4725
02:33:26,799 --> 02:33:32,079
industry it wasn't because

4726
02:33:28,879 --> 02:33:34,799
bitcoin it was it was because

4727
02:33:32,079 --> 02:33:37,439
bitcoin was a picture of how the world

4728
02:33:34,799 --> 02:33:38,959
could work in so many other ways

4729
02:33:37,439 --> 02:33:40,800
and that picture of how the world could

4730
02:33:38,959 --> 02:33:44,719
work in so many other ways

4731
02:33:40,799 --> 02:33:48,398
um attracted me a very long time ago

4732
02:33:44,719 --> 02:33:50,318
and i think that

4733
02:33:48,398 --> 02:33:52,239
all of this stuff will eventually become

4734
02:33:50,318 --> 02:33:53,199
a public good i think it'll become so

4735
02:33:52,239 --> 02:33:55,199
critical to how

4736
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:56,240
societies function internally and

4737
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:58,000
internationally

4738
02:33:56,239 --> 02:34:00,000
that just like there are systems you

4739
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:01,439
know like the federal reserve like

4740
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,559
global payment systems like all these

4741
02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:04,159
types of things

4742
02:34:02,559 --> 02:34:07,359
i think eventually all of the all of

4743
02:34:04,159 --> 02:34:10,398
this technology will be baked into these

4744
02:34:07,359 --> 02:34:12,640
society societally critical systems

4745
02:34:10,398 --> 02:34:14,079
and if i in our community and the people

4746
02:34:12,639 --> 02:34:15,599
i work with in the body of work that

4747
02:34:14,079 --> 02:34:17,760
we're working on

4748
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:19,280
can make some kind of contribution to

4749
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:22,800
that shift

4750
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:23,760
um towards a fair economically fair

4751
02:34:22,799 --> 02:34:26,719
transparent

4752
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:28,960
society from my point of view it's a

4753
02:34:26,719 --> 02:34:31,119
very very worthwhile body of work

4754
02:34:28,959 --> 02:34:32,959
in in terms of the show you you also

4755
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:35,040
mentioned the show

4756
02:34:32,959 --> 02:34:36,719
you know one of the shows that i really

4757
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:37,200
um seem to like more and more for some

4758
02:34:36,719 --> 02:34:40,159
reason

4759
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:41,760
is uh star trek not the old star trek i

4760
02:34:40,159 --> 02:34:44,478
don't really get the old star trek the

4761
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:46,239
special effects aren't good enough star

4762
02:34:44,478 --> 02:34:47,039
trek like the next generation and

4763
02:34:46,239 --> 02:34:50,239
voyager

4764
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:52,880
yes and um deep space nine and all those

4765
02:34:50,239 --> 02:34:53,760
i i think whenever i happen to watch a

4766
02:34:52,879 --> 02:34:56,318
star trek

4767
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:57,760
show again i have a very simple

4768
02:34:56,318 --> 02:34:58,000
conception in my mind that i really

4769
02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:00,318
didn't

4770
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,200
have whenever i saw it way back when

4771
02:35:00,318 --> 02:35:03,680
it's that

4772
02:35:01,200 --> 02:35:04,800
this is what the world looks like if

4773
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:07,280
technology

4774
02:35:04,799 --> 02:35:08,239
takes us towards a utopia right so i

4775
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:10,239
think there's this

4776
02:35:08,239 --> 02:35:12,239
fascinating thing where technology can

4777
02:35:10,239 --> 02:35:13,840
take us towards the utopia or towards

4778
02:35:12,239 --> 02:35:16,879
the dystopia

4779
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:18,159
and in my mind those kind of three star

4780
02:35:16,879 --> 02:35:21,519
trek shows

4781
02:35:18,159 --> 02:35:23,760
are a picture of what

4782
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:26,319
human civilization looks like if

4783
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:28,318
everybody's technological ambitions

4784
02:35:26,318 --> 02:35:30,959
successfully take us towards a utopia

4785
02:35:28,318 --> 02:35:33,279
right because in the star trek universe

4786
02:35:30,959 --> 02:35:36,398
you're not seeking money or you're not

4787
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:37,680
seeking safety or you're not seeking

4788
02:35:36,398 --> 02:35:39,840
you're not really seeking anything for

4789
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:40,559
yourself everybody you know within

4790
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:43,040
maslow's

4791
02:35:40,559 --> 02:35:44,478
hierarchy of needs has has gotten so

4792
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:45,680
many things for themselves that their

4793
02:35:44,478 --> 02:35:48,799
that their goal

4794
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:49,680
is learning and discovering and or

4795
02:35:48,799 --> 02:35:52,478
helping

4796
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:53,359
and i i think there is this conception

4797
02:35:52,478 --> 02:35:56,639
of human life

4798
02:35:53,359 --> 02:35:59,439
once the baser needs are satisfied and

4799
02:35:56,639 --> 02:36:00,799
at the at the end of the day i think

4800
02:35:59,439 --> 02:36:03,520
that's what technology

4801
02:36:00,799 --> 02:36:05,119
generally can elevate um all of human

4802
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:08,479
civilization to right it can

4803
02:36:05,120 --> 02:36:10,960
elevate us to star trek world where

4804
02:36:08,478 --> 02:36:12,879
if people want to invent they can do

4805
02:36:10,959 --> 02:36:14,239
that all day and nothing else if people

4806
02:36:12,879 --> 02:36:15,759
want to explore the stars they can

4807
02:36:14,239 --> 02:36:17,039
explore the stars and and they don't

4808
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:19,680
have to worry about

4809
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:21,200
economic scarcity or any number of these

4810
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:22,559
other conceptions

4811
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:24,800
so i i don't know what the most

4812
02:36:22,559 --> 02:36:27,279
impactful on me shows have been

4813
02:36:24,799 --> 02:36:29,599
but for some reason recently star trek

4814
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:32,079
um in this in the newer variant

4815
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:33,840
um not the most new new star trek shows

4816
02:36:32,079 --> 02:36:36,000
those shows are a little strange the

4817
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:37,200
the kind of middle star trek universe

4818
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:39,040
where where everybody

4819
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:40,560
is doing something with like a very uh

4820
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:42,160
important purpose

4821
02:36:40,559 --> 02:36:44,239
and and nobody's thinking about like

4822
02:36:42,159 --> 02:36:46,639
where's my paycheck or where's my

4823
02:36:44,239 --> 02:36:48,799
you know where's my whatever they're all

4824
02:36:46,639 --> 02:36:52,000
kind of like we have to discover

4825
02:36:48,799 --> 02:36:53,599
the formula to this to save the planet

4826
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,799
over there and literally every episode

4827
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:56,720
you're discovering a formula to save a

4828
02:36:54,799 --> 02:36:57,199
planet right of some kind or a universe

4829
02:36:56,719 --> 02:36:59,039
or

4830
02:36:57,200 --> 02:37:00,399
ecosystem or whatever and it's and

4831
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:02,240
you're looking at you're like

4832
02:37:00,398 --> 02:37:03,680
you know this this this is this is like

4833
02:37:02,239 --> 02:37:05,359
this is a pretty good place to end up

4834
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:07,200
this is where we might want to end up

4835
02:37:05,359 --> 02:37:08,960
so it gives you hope i mean it's funny

4836
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:13,359
that we don't generating

4837
02:37:08,959 --> 02:37:15,919
we don't often think about the

4838
02:37:13,359 --> 02:37:18,559
i think it's very useful to think about

4839
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:21,120
positive visions of the future

4840
02:37:18,559 --> 02:37:21,680
when we're trying to design technology

4841
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:25,280
there's

4842
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:27,439
a lot of sort of in public discourse

4843
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:29,520
a lot of people are thinking about kind

4844
02:37:27,439 --> 02:37:30,880
of how everything goes wrong

4845
02:37:29,520 --> 02:37:33,120
it's important to think about that

4846
02:37:30,879 --> 02:37:33,839
sometimes but in moderation i think

4847
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:36,880
because you

4848
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:39,120
there's not enough in my little

4849
02:37:36,879 --> 02:37:41,920
corner of artificial intelligence world

4850
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:44,319
people are very kind of fear monger

4851
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:46,318
centered there's a lot of discussions

4852
02:37:44,318 --> 02:37:48,639
about how everything goes wrong

4853
02:37:46,318 --> 02:37:50,159
important to do but it's also really

4854
02:37:48,639 --> 02:37:53,519
important to talk about

4855
02:37:50,159 --> 02:37:55,680
how things can go right

4856
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:57,760
because we ultimately want to guide the

4857
02:37:55,680 --> 02:38:00,239
design of the systems we create

4858
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:00,800
to make things right and i think with

4859
02:38:00,239 --> 02:38:04,719
hope and

4860
02:38:00,799 --> 02:38:07,438
optimism not naiveness but

4861
02:38:04,719 --> 02:38:08,318
optimism you can actually create a

4862
02:38:07,439 --> 02:38:11,680
better world

4863
02:38:08,318 --> 02:38:14,478
like you have to think about a positive

4864
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:17,040
a better world as you create because

4865
02:38:14,478 --> 02:38:19,599
then you can actually create it

4866
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:22,080
um yeah i'm i'm one of the people who

4867
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:24,720
thinks that

4868
02:38:22,079 --> 02:38:26,719
having an optimistic view of the world

4869
02:38:24,719 --> 02:38:29,199
is better for design and creativity

4870
02:38:26,719 --> 02:38:32,639
than having a pessimistic one it's hard

4871
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:32,640
to design when you're in fear

4872
02:38:32,719 --> 02:38:38,398
uh do you have advice for

4873
02:38:36,159 --> 02:38:40,719
young people speaking of being excited

4874
02:38:38,398 --> 02:38:42,719
about and hopeful about the future world

4875
02:38:40,719 --> 02:38:43,840
do you have uh advice for young people

4876
02:38:42,719 --> 02:38:46,719
today

4877
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:48,478
in uh computer science world and

4878
02:38:46,719 --> 02:38:49,199
software engineering world and crypto

4879
02:38:48,478 --> 02:38:52,239
world but

4880
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:55,600
maybe in any world whatsoever

4881
02:38:52,239 --> 02:38:58,000
for life how to pick a career or how to

4882
02:38:55,600 --> 02:39:00,720
live life in general

4883
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,159
i think the thing that that young people

4884
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:04,639
should do

4885
02:39:02,159 --> 02:39:06,079
is is not any one specific thing for any

4886
02:39:04,639 --> 02:39:09,119
any one specific young

4887
02:39:06,079 --> 02:39:12,079
person i think what they should do is

4888
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:14,079
what they won't be able to do in the

4889
02:39:12,079 --> 02:39:16,478
later stages of their life

4890
02:39:14,079 --> 02:39:17,920
yeah and the way in my opinion from a

4891
02:39:16,478 --> 02:39:19,519
framework point of view to think about

4892
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:23,280
that

4893
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:27,680
is that the amount of obligations

4894
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:30,399
and the amount of time that a person has

4895
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:31,760
seems to just diminish over time right

4896
02:39:30,398 --> 02:39:32,398
so the amount of free time they have

4897
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:34,000
right

4898
02:39:32,398 --> 02:39:35,920
so you start your job you get a bunch of

4899
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:37,120
responsibilities some something with

4900
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:39,439
your partner's spouse

4901
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:40,720
more responsibilities kids probably even

4902
02:39:39,439 --> 02:39:43,760
more responsibilities

4903
02:39:40,719 --> 02:39:46,879
and soon enough the time that you have

4904
02:39:43,760 --> 02:39:50,079
to educate yourself to travel

4905
02:39:46,879 --> 02:39:52,000
to you know experience the world however

4906
02:39:50,079 --> 02:39:53,200
create whatever creative endeavor you're

4907
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:56,559
interested in um

4908
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:58,640
slowly but surely disappears i think

4909
02:39:56,559 --> 02:40:00,478
this is something that you know young

4910
02:39:58,639 --> 02:40:02,559
people don't fully

4911
02:40:00,478 --> 02:40:04,239
realize they they assume that the world

4912
02:40:02,559 --> 02:40:06,559
as it is now

4913
02:40:04,239 --> 02:40:07,359
and the amount of free time that they

4914
02:40:06,559 --> 02:40:10,079
have

4915
02:40:07,359 --> 02:40:11,280
to travel to educate themselves to make

4916
02:40:10,079 --> 02:40:14,079
new friends

4917
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:16,640
to do all these things will somehow

4918
02:40:14,079 --> 02:40:18,719
maybe diminish by ten percent

4919
02:40:16,639 --> 02:40:20,318
it won't diminish by ten percent it'll

4920
02:40:18,719 --> 02:40:22,879
diminish by 90

4921
02:40:20,318 --> 02:40:24,000
yeah and the 10 that you have you'll be

4922
02:40:22,879 --> 02:40:27,039
resting

4923
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:29,920
to get back to work and get things done

4924
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:31,279
so yeah what i think young people should

4925
02:40:29,920 --> 02:40:32,559
do and this is why it's very different

4926
02:40:31,279 --> 02:40:34,399
for each of them right

4927
02:40:32,559 --> 02:40:35,680
i can't tell young people hey you should

4928
02:40:34,398 --> 02:40:38,159
study philosophy

4929
02:40:35,680 --> 02:40:39,359
travel and start um your own enterprise

4930
02:40:38,159 --> 02:40:40,559
to achieve something worthwhile in the

4931
02:40:39,359 --> 02:40:42,159
world right that might be

4932
02:40:40,559 --> 02:40:44,000
something that's good for me with my

4933
02:40:42,159 --> 02:40:46,318
values and my um

4934
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:47,760
kind of worldview but for other people

4935
02:40:46,318 --> 02:40:50,000
might be something else

4936
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:51,200
i i think the way that they should

4937
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:54,799
conceptualize it

4938
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:58,159
is imagine if

4939
02:40:54,799 --> 02:41:00,639
over the next um 10 12 years

4940
02:40:58,159 --> 02:41:02,239
the amount of choice that you had about

4941
02:41:00,639 --> 02:41:05,358
what you could do

4942
02:41:02,239 --> 02:41:06,879
was cut down by 90 percent

4943
02:41:05,359 --> 02:41:08,399
what would you and this is you know

4944
02:41:06,879 --> 02:41:11,519
copying from this kind of just

4945
02:41:08,398 --> 02:41:13,439
jeff bezos regret minimization framework

4946
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:16,079
in that framework it's like what would i

4947
02:41:13,439 --> 02:41:18,079
regret not doing at 80.

4948
02:41:16,079 --> 02:41:19,439
and that's kind of meant to create this

4949
02:41:18,079 --> 02:41:21,920
long-term view

4950
02:41:19,439 --> 02:41:22,559
and make these decisions now that'll get

4951
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:24,398
you to

4952
02:41:22,559 --> 02:41:26,959
a long-term future that you can look

4953
02:41:24,398 --> 02:41:28,959
back on and be proud of your life right

4954
02:41:26,959 --> 02:41:30,159
what i think young people should do is

4955
02:41:28,959 --> 02:41:31,358
they is they they should say to

4956
02:41:30,159 --> 02:41:34,079
themselves look

4957
02:41:31,359 --> 02:41:36,000
if i never get the chance to travel for

4958
02:41:34,079 --> 02:41:39,600
as long as i live

4959
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:42,318
assuming that after 25 after 27

4960
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:43,359
after 29 that's the case how will i feel

4961
02:41:42,318 --> 02:41:46,398
about that

4962
02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:46,960
if i never get to start a company after

4963
02:41:46,398 --> 02:41:49,039
25

4964
02:41:46,959 --> 02:41:50,959
after i get married after i have kids

4965
02:41:49,040 --> 02:41:53,279
how will i feel about that

4966
02:41:50,959 --> 02:41:54,879
and whatever they feel the worst about

4967
02:41:53,279 --> 02:41:56,479
is what they should do

4968
02:41:54,879 --> 02:41:58,079
whatever they feel like when they say to

4969
02:41:56,478 --> 02:42:01,278
themselves you know if

4970
02:41:58,079 --> 02:42:03,039
i don't travel now i will never travel

4971
02:42:01,279 --> 02:42:05,040
and they feel horrible about that they

4972
02:42:03,040 --> 02:42:08,479
just have an overwhelming

4973
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:12,000
fear and disgust at themselves

4974
02:42:08,478 --> 02:42:14,879
in that type of state at 25 27

4975
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:16,959
29 that's what they should do and they

4976
02:42:14,879 --> 02:42:20,959
shouldn't listen to anybody else

4977
02:42:16,959 --> 02:42:23,278
um i i i let me put it through this way

4978
02:42:20,959 --> 02:42:24,478
if you're really smart you're gonna make

4979
02:42:23,279 --> 02:42:25,840
it anyway

4980
02:42:24,478 --> 02:42:27,599
there's a lot of people putting a lot of

4981
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:28,719
pressure on you because they're afraid

4982
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:30,318
whether you're going to make it if

4983
02:42:28,719 --> 02:42:31,278
you're really smart you're going to make

4984
02:42:30,318 --> 02:42:32,799
it anyway

4985
02:42:31,279 --> 02:42:34,640
if you're not really smart you're

4986
02:42:32,799 --> 02:42:38,239
screwed anyway

4987
02:42:34,639 --> 02:42:40,799
so either way just relax with it and use

4988
02:42:38,239 --> 02:42:41,359
your time well to do the the the things

4989
02:42:40,799 --> 02:42:43,679
you would

4990
02:42:41,359 --> 02:42:44,640
most regret not doing that's really

4991
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:46,239
fascinating

4992
02:42:44,639 --> 02:42:48,079
i i wouldn't i wouldn't say relax i

4993
02:42:46,239 --> 02:42:50,559
would say very much

4994
02:42:48,079 --> 02:42:52,639
cherish the free time yeah the

4995
02:42:50,559 --> 02:42:56,079
discretionary time that you have

4996
02:42:52,639 --> 02:42:58,559
from the age of 18 to maybe 25.

4997
02:42:56,079 --> 02:42:59,760
yeah because at 25 everyone's going to

4998
02:42:58,559 --> 02:43:01,760
start looking at each other

4999
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:03,439
and asking what have what have i

5000
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:04,478
achieved like my friends have achieved i

5001
02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:06,079
haven't achieved

5002
02:43:04,478 --> 02:43:07,278
and then by the time you get to 30

5003
02:43:06,079 --> 02:43:08,000
you're going to look at each other again

5004
02:43:07,279 --> 02:43:10,640
and go

5005
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:11,359
well my friends have a family or a

5006
02:43:10,639 --> 02:43:14,478
company

5007
02:43:11,359 --> 02:43:16,159
or a phd or whatever what do i have

5008
02:43:14,478 --> 02:43:17,679
and the pressure will just increase and

5009
02:43:16,159 --> 02:43:20,478
it'll increase so much

5010
02:43:17,680 --> 02:43:21,359
that even if you want to go and do the

5011
02:43:20,478 --> 02:43:24,079
fun thing

5012
02:43:21,359 --> 02:43:24,479
it will not be fun because the pressure

5013
02:43:24,079 --> 02:43:26,719
yeah

5014
02:43:24,478 --> 02:43:28,239
of comparing yourself to your friends at

5015
02:43:26,719 --> 02:43:31,278
25 or your peers at

5016
02:43:28,239 --> 02:43:33,600
30 will be so great that you will

5017
02:43:31,279 --> 02:43:36,079
no longer it will no longer be normal

5018
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:39,279
for you to be in a hostel at 30

5019
02:43:36,079 --> 02:43:42,079
you know kind of like living it up right

5020
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:44,000
if if and and this is why i also can't

5021
02:43:42,079 --> 02:43:45,359
tell you specifically what it is for me

5022
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,959
it was getting an education in

5023
02:43:45,359 --> 02:43:47,680
philosophy that was rigorous and in

5024
02:43:46,959 --> 02:43:49,599
depth

5025
02:43:47,680 --> 02:43:51,359
it was traveling and it was starting an

5026
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:53,040
enterprise that i thought were that was

5027
02:43:51,359 --> 02:43:54,239
worthwhile that i directed that i could

5028
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:56,000
make into something great

5029
02:43:54,239 --> 02:43:58,000
that's what it was for me for other

5030
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:00,000
people it might be something with a band

5031
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:02,318
it might be something with painting it

5032
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:03,920
might be an education

5033
02:44:02,318 --> 02:44:06,000
you you by the way should also should

5034
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:07,200
not assume that your ability to get an

5035
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:10,680
education

5036
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:12,319
will um improve all of those

5037
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:14,239
responsibilities

5038
02:44:12,318 --> 02:44:15,519
will take away your ability to get an

5039
02:44:14,239 --> 02:44:17,680
education

5040
02:44:15,520 --> 02:44:18,880
so if you value having an education if

5041
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:22,000
you value being

5042
02:44:18,879 --> 02:44:24,159
a deeply educated well-rounded person

5043
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:26,318
with a wide array of knowledge on a wide

5044
02:44:24,159 --> 02:44:28,879
array of topics

5045
02:44:26,318 --> 02:44:29,920
capitalism will force you to specialize

5046
02:44:28,879 --> 02:44:31,039
that's what it's good at

5047
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:33,840
it's going to take you it's going to

5048
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:35,920
fashion you into a very specific tool

5049
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:37,840
for a very most people into a very

5050
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:39,760
specific set of tasks

5051
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:41,439
if you want to have an education in

5052
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:43,200
something get it now

5053
02:44:41,439 --> 02:44:45,200
if you want to travel somewhere travel

5054
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:46,880
there now if you want to you know do

5055
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:48,720
some kind of creative endeavor that you

5056
02:44:46,879 --> 02:44:50,398
doubt whether you'll have time for in

5057
02:44:48,719 --> 02:44:52,239
the future do it now

5058
02:44:50,398 --> 02:44:53,840
you won't have time for it in the future

5059
02:44:52,239 --> 02:44:55,359
you won't have time to

5060
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:57,520
read philosophy books all day

5061
02:44:55,359 --> 02:45:00,640
unfortunately you won't have time

5062
02:44:57,520 --> 02:45:03,120
to fly to you know italy and

5063
02:45:00,639 --> 02:45:04,639
kind of hang out with people if you're

5064
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:05,279
serious about your life

5065
02:45:04,639 --> 02:45:06,478
you're going to get more

5066
02:45:05,279 --> 02:45:07,920
responsibilities you're going to get

5067
02:45:06,478 --> 02:45:10,719
more stuff to do

5068
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:11,520
and so my advice to you is do not piss

5069
02:45:10,719 --> 02:45:15,039
away

5070
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:18,640
this rare unique discretionary time

5071
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:21,680
and if your friends are get new friends

5072
02:45:18,639 --> 02:45:23,840
get smarter friends get people who are

5073
02:45:21,680 --> 02:45:27,040
using the limited time they have better

5074
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:29,279
yeah um that's my advice so it's just a

5075
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:32,000
quickly comment it's brilliant

5076
02:45:29,279 --> 02:45:34,000
you know to reframe high school and

5077
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:36,398
undergraduate college education

5078
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:37,439
sometimes people want to quickly get it

5079
02:45:36,398 --> 02:45:40,639
over with

5080
02:45:37,439 --> 02:45:44,000
but one thing

5081
02:45:40,639 --> 02:45:46,318
i remember thinking and it's very true

5082
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:47,359
about high school it's one of the only

5083
02:45:46,318 --> 02:45:49,039
times in

5084
02:45:47,359 --> 02:45:51,120
in your life you'll get a chance to

5085
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:54,000
truly get a broad education

5086
02:45:51,120 --> 02:45:55,600
you don't often think of it that way but

5087
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:57,840
it's a chance to really

5088
02:45:55,600 --> 02:45:59,520
enjoy learning things that are outside

5089
02:45:57,840 --> 02:46:00,318
of the specialty that you'll eventually

5090
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:02,479
end up with

5091
02:46:00,318 --> 02:46:04,159
and that's how college education is and

5092
02:46:02,478 --> 02:46:07,840
a more fun side

5093
02:46:04,159 --> 02:46:09,920
i played music i i did martial arts

5094
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:12,398
and we offline mentioned played video

5095
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:14,639
games i find it fascinating

5096
02:46:12,398 --> 02:46:16,000
and brilliant what you said which is the

5097
02:46:14,639 --> 02:46:18,000
world will

5098
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:19,680
will not give you a chance to truly

5099
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:22,079
enjoy many of these things

5100
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:23,200
and truly get value from many of those

5101
02:46:22,079 --> 02:46:26,159
things

5102
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:27,840
uh once you get older i find it

5103
02:46:26,159 --> 02:46:29,200
exceptionally difficult to enjoy video

5104
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:30,559
games now

5105
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:32,960
there's so much stuff to do so

5106
02:46:30,559 --> 02:46:36,559
responsibility

5107
02:46:32,959 --> 02:46:37,278
and i at the time when i played elder

5108
02:46:36,559 --> 02:46:41,519
scrolls

5109
02:46:37,279 --> 02:46:43,279
and baldr's gate and diablo ii and

5110
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:45,920
at the time i thought maybe that was a

5111
02:46:43,279 --> 02:46:48,960
waste of time

5112
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:50,719
but now looking back i realize

5113
02:46:48,959 --> 02:46:52,079
because i always thought you know let me

5114
02:46:50,719 --> 02:46:53,438
get the career first

5115
02:46:52,079 --> 02:46:54,799
and then i'll have a chance to play

5116
02:46:53,439 --> 02:46:55,520
video games that's the way i was

5117
02:46:54,799 --> 02:46:57,920
thinking

5118
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:58,880
you know it was a waste of time because

5119
02:46:57,920 --> 02:47:01,600
i should really

5120
02:46:58,879 --> 02:47:03,438
progress on the career and then i'll

5121
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:04,640
have time to play video games no the

5122
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:06,398
reality is

5123
02:47:04,639 --> 02:47:08,559
that was really fulfilling those are

5124
02:47:06,398 --> 02:47:11,439
some of the happiest

5125
02:47:08,559 --> 02:47:12,799
travel experiences of my life as me

5126
02:47:11,439 --> 02:47:15,600
traveling to those

5127
02:47:12,799 --> 02:47:17,039
virtual worlds and spending time in them

5128
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:19,120
and it was really fulfilling and they

5129
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:21,680
stayed with me for the rest of my life

5130
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:23,439
and i get to experience echoes of that

5131
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:25,120
when i play video games these days for

5132
02:47:23,439 --> 02:47:26,960
an hour here an hour there

5133
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:28,319
like one hour a month or something like

5134
02:47:26,959 --> 02:47:30,639
that but

5135
02:47:28,318 --> 02:47:32,239
even those experiences as silly as they

5136
02:47:30,639 --> 02:47:33,358
are they seem like a waste of time at

5137
02:47:32,239 --> 02:47:36,959
the time

5138
02:47:33,359 --> 02:47:40,559
enjoying them fully unapologetically

5139
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:42,559
and you know in a framework exactly as

5140
02:47:40,559 --> 02:47:44,318
you said would i regret

5141
02:47:42,559 --> 02:47:46,478
being the kind of person who've never

5142
02:47:44,318 --> 02:47:49,039
played those video games

5143
02:47:46,478 --> 02:47:50,000
and i can for myself honestly say that

5144
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:53,359
yes

5145
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:55,840
uh look when i'm on my deathbed

5146
02:47:53,359 --> 02:47:56,479
i'm i'm glad at boulder's gate yeah we

5147
02:47:55,840 --> 02:47:59,040
built

5148
02:47:56,478 --> 02:48:00,959
ballers gate 2 and and all those uh

5149
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:04,000
arena daggerfall morrowind

5150
02:48:00,959 --> 02:48:07,278
and all the elder scrolls games and

5151
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:07,279
um yeah

5152
02:48:07,520 --> 02:48:12,560
the things that don't necessarily fit

5153
02:48:10,398 --> 02:48:14,398
into this kind of storyline of what a

5154
02:48:12,559 --> 02:48:15,920
career is supposed to be

5155
02:48:14,398 --> 02:48:17,680
travel and all those experiences that

5156
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:21,439
you might i think i just like to say one

5157
02:48:17,680 --> 02:48:23,279
one one final quick thing on on this um

5158
02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:24,880
i i think this extends to really hard

5159
02:48:23,279 --> 02:48:25,680
things as well it extends to the things

5160
02:48:24,879 --> 02:48:27,438
you want to do

5161
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:28,720
but one of the best pieces of advice one

5162
02:48:27,439 --> 02:48:31,680
of my mentors um

5163
02:48:28,719 --> 02:48:32,639
gave me early on in in my career at

5164
02:48:31,680 --> 02:48:35,279
around this time

5165
02:48:32,639 --> 02:48:36,959
is that it will actually become harder

5166
02:48:35,279 --> 02:48:39,840
to start a company

5167
02:48:36,959 --> 02:48:41,438
as you get older yes once again because

5168
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:42,398
you have more responsibilities you're

5169
02:48:41,439 --> 02:48:44,159
responsible

5170
02:48:42,398 --> 02:48:45,599
to your partner for some kind of income

5171
02:48:44,159 --> 02:48:47,039
to create a life together

5172
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:49,040
once you have kids you're responsible

5173
02:48:47,040 --> 02:48:50,240
for an even greater income to create a

5174
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:52,800
life for kids

5175
02:48:50,239 --> 02:48:53,840
and startups do not generate income

5176
02:48:52,799 --> 02:48:56,000
right they take

5177
02:48:53,840 --> 02:48:58,000
many many years before anything happens

5178
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:59,680
people are getting evicted people are

5179
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:02,159
eating ramen noodles that is a thing

5180
02:48:59,680 --> 02:49:05,200
that happens that that that will happen

5181
02:49:02,159 --> 02:49:07,279
so i'm not saying that you should do the

5182
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:10,079
fun things or the enjoyable things

5183
02:49:07,279 --> 02:49:10,800
i'm saying the things that you would

5184
02:49:10,079 --> 02:49:14,079
regret

5185
02:49:10,799 --> 02:49:18,079
not doing that you can uniquely do

5186
02:49:14,079 --> 02:49:21,200
in the time span from 18 to 25

5187
02:49:18,079 --> 02:49:22,239
which one of which is if you plan to

5188
02:49:21,200 --> 02:49:24,800
have a family

5189
02:49:22,239 --> 02:49:26,799
and start a family when you're 25 you

5190
02:49:24,799 --> 02:49:28,318
should start a company now

5191
02:49:26,799 --> 02:49:30,799
you should not wait until a bunch of

5192
02:49:28,318 --> 02:49:32,559
people depend on you for income to eat

5193
02:49:30,799 --> 02:49:34,079
to start a company the amount of

5194
02:49:32,559 --> 02:49:34,639
pressure that will be on you at that

5195
02:49:34,079 --> 02:49:37,120
point

5196
02:49:34,639 --> 02:49:39,119
will be monumental you should start a

5197
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:41,439
company when nobody depends on you

5198
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:42,560
and you can sleep on the floor eating

5199
02:49:41,439 --> 02:49:44,960
ramen noodles

5200
02:49:42,559 --> 02:49:46,398
and still have a great time and show up

5201
02:49:44,959 --> 02:49:49,679
with a lot of enthusiasm

5202
02:49:46,398 --> 02:49:51,358
and be excited so um i i just mean

5203
02:49:49,680 --> 02:49:53,840
whatever you want

5204
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:54,880
to really devote yourself to and and and

5205
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:57,200
really do

5206
02:49:54,879 --> 02:49:59,278
don't put it off don't go to consulting

5207
02:49:57,200 --> 02:50:00,560
or banking or any other industry and say

5208
02:49:59,279 --> 02:50:01,920
i'm going to do this for three years and

5209
02:50:00,559 --> 02:50:03,600
i'll get experience

5210
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:05,120
the only way you get experience is by

5211
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:07,040
doing something you go

5212
02:50:05,120 --> 02:50:08,560
you do it you fail you do it again and

5213
02:50:07,040 --> 02:50:09,840
again and again and again and again

5214
02:50:08,559 --> 02:50:11,600
and then you have experience and then

5215
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:13,600
you can do it right that's the only way

5216
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:15,200
experience happens there is no other way

5217
02:50:13,600 --> 02:50:17,840
short of mentorship if you're lucky to

5218
02:50:15,200 --> 02:50:18,720
get mentorship 99 of people don't get

5219
02:50:17,840 --> 02:50:20,000
mentorship

5220
02:50:18,719 --> 02:50:21,438
and even though we're talking about

5221
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,559
young people i feel like you're speaking

5222
02:50:21,439 --> 02:50:25,200
to me as somebody who's

5223
02:50:22,559 --> 02:50:27,039
who spent the last two weeks sleeping on

5224
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:28,800
the floor because there's no mattress

5225
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:30,720
and somebody who is single and somebody

5226
02:50:28,799 --> 02:50:33,199
who's thinking about it doing a startup

5227
02:50:30,719 --> 02:50:35,599
i felt like you were speaking to me as a

5228
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:38,880
yeah as a fellow young person

5229
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:38,880
let me ask you about this whole

5230
02:50:39,680 --> 02:50:43,760
life of ours to zoom out on the big

5231
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:44,398
philosophical question the ridiculous

5232
02:50:43,760 --> 02:50:45,840
question

5233
02:50:44,398 --> 02:50:47,840
what do you think is the meaning of it

5234
02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:49,359
all

5235
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:51,520
do you think about this kind of stuff as

5236
02:50:49,359 --> 02:50:54,318
you're creating all the technology

5237
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:57,040
uh as you're thinking about this future

5238
02:50:54,318 --> 02:51:00,239
you ever zoom out and think like why

5239
02:50:57,040 --> 02:51:00,960
why why are you sergey striving why are

5240
02:51:00,239 --> 02:51:04,959
we

5241
02:51:00,959 --> 02:51:07,679
the human species striving for the stars

5242
02:51:04,959 --> 02:51:08,478
so i think it comes down to um you know

5243
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:11,760
whether

5244
02:51:08,478 --> 02:51:14,879
people want to live in society so if

5245
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:18,719
if people decide to be part of society

5246
02:51:14,879 --> 02:51:21,199
they have a certain um

5247
02:51:18,719 --> 02:51:22,159
set of conditions that they decide to

5248
02:51:21,200 --> 02:51:24,880
take part in

5249
02:51:22,159 --> 02:51:25,760
right so i i think what this what this

5250
02:51:24,879 --> 02:51:29,119
comes down to

5251
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:30,159
is a lot of really involved

5252
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:31,760
conversations

5253
02:51:30,159 --> 02:51:33,920
but if we assume people have free will

5254
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:36,079
and choice we just kind of make that

5255
02:51:33,920 --> 02:51:37,680
blanket assumption

5256
02:51:36,079 --> 02:51:39,120
then the question starts to become well

5257
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:41,920
what choices do we make

5258
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:42,319
and how do we live with those choices

5259
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:44,159
and

5260
02:51:42,318 --> 02:51:46,478
i think probably the most fundamental

5261
02:51:44,159 --> 02:51:48,799
choice is whether we exist

5262
02:51:46,478 --> 02:51:49,760
in a society or we choose to leave

5263
02:51:48,799 --> 02:51:50,879
society

5264
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:52,079
and there are people that do this there

5265
02:51:50,879 --> 02:51:53,519
are people who live in the woods there

5266
02:51:52,079 --> 02:51:55,039
are people that immigrate to other

5267
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:57,439
societies

5268
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:58,960
and they make a choice right and as they

5269
02:51:57,439 --> 02:51:59,920
enter those other societies or they

5270
02:51:58,959 --> 02:52:01,919
choose to leave

5271
02:51:59,920 --> 02:52:03,680
leave society and go live in the woods

5272
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:06,000
they um

5273
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:08,318
adopt a certain set of values right they

5274
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:09,760
adopt values that the society prescribes

5275
02:52:08,318 --> 02:52:11,439
they compromise their own values they

5276
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:13,279
define their own values and they create

5277
02:52:11,439 --> 02:52:16,639
a set of values for themselves

5278
02:52:13,279 --> 02:52:19,279
right i think um

5279
02:52:16,639 --> 02:52:22,000
at the end of the day if you're going to

5280
02:52:19,279 --> 02:52:24,479
choose to live in society

5281
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:26,239
in addition to all the minimums of you

5282
02:52:24,478 --> 02:52:26,719
know not throwing garbage on the floor

5283
02:52:26,239 --> 02:52:28,478
and

5284
02:52:26,719 --> 02:52:30,079
you know doing doing nice things for

5285
02:52:28,478 --> 02:52:31,599
people that need help and

5286
02:52:30,079 --> 02:52:33,120
and and doing any number of things to

5287
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:34,559
just be a normal human being within

5288
02:52:33,120 --> 02:52:37,840
society

5289
02:52:34,559 --> 02:52:39,519
you you have to ask yourself what am i

5290
02:52:37,840 --> 02:52:42,000
doing as part of society

5291
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:43,120
right you can always say hey i'm gonna

5292
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:43,680
leave society i'm gonna live in the

5293
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:45,680
woods

5294
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:46,960
i did that right i went and i lived in

5295
02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:48,559
the woods and i gave it a shot

5296
02:52:46,959 --> 02:52:50,478
realizes a ton of stuff huge amount of

5297
02:52:48,559 --> 02:52:53,119
clarity from that but

5298
02:52:50,478 --> 02:52:55,519
when you decide to live in society you

5299
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:57,439
you take on

5300
02:52:55,520 --> 02:52:59,040
first of all certain minimal agreements

5301
02:52:57,439 --> 02:53:00,559
you you

5302
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:02,000
mold your values a little bit to that

5303
02:53:00,559 --> 02:53:02,478
society that's another choice that

5304
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:05,840
people

5305
02:53:02,478 --> 02:53:08,318
inherently make and then there's

5306
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:10,719
uh a question of well what am i doing

5307
02:53:08,318 --> 02:53:12,159
here right what am i doing in society

5308
02:53:10,719 --> 02:53:14,000
right so when people say the meaning of

5309
02:53:12,159 --> 02:53:16,398
life i don't know what the meaning of

5310
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:17,760
life is the meaning of life in society

5311
02:53:16,398 --> 02:53:19,680
right what what's the meaning of life

5312
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:21,120
for the choice that you've made within

5313
02:53:19,680 --> 02:53:22,720
society right because that's

5314
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:24,479
maybe the first fundamental choice you

5315
02:53:22,719 --> 02:53:25,438
made you made a choice and you continue

5316
02:53:24,478 --> 02:53:28,639
to make a choice

5317
02:53:25,439 --> 02:53:29,520
to be part of society and a specific

5318
02:53:28,639 --> 02:53:32,398
society

5319
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:34,079
right so you've made this choice you're

5320
02:53:32,398 --> 02:53:38,398
part of a society

5321
02:53:34,079 --> 02:53:41,840
and now you kind of have

5322
02:53:38,398 --> 02:53:43,840
a life and you have people around you

5323
02:53:41,840 --> 02:53:45,840
and then the question is in my in my

5324
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:46,719
opinion the question is what is the body

5325
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:50,079
of work

5326
02:53:46,719 --> 02:53:53,278
that you want to make right

5327
02:53:50,079 --> 02:53:55,039
i think personally that life is kind of

5328
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:56,800
so short

5329
02:53:55,040 --> 02:53:58,160
and the ability to get enough resources

5330
02:53:56,799 --> 02:53:59,519
for yourself in

5331
02:53:58,159 --> 02:54:01,359
at least the developed markets where

5332
02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:04,880
we're like lucky to be in

5333
02:54:01,359 --> 02:54:08,000
is so relatively abundant that

5334
02:54:04,879 --> 02:54:09,438
we you and me have the luxury you know

5335
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:11,040
by your pursuit of a phd

5336
02:54:09,439 --> 02:54:12,800
you you know you've had this luxury i've

5337
02:54:11,040 --> 02:54:15,279
had this luxury um

5338
02:54:12,799 --> 02:54:16,000
through the work that i've been doing to

5339
02:54:15,279 --> 02:54:19,600
pursue

5340
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:23,279
something that makes society better

5341
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:23,279
so this is kind of the um

5342
02:54:23,760 --> 02:54:28,559
question i would say the question is am

5343
02:54:26,879 --> 02:54:30,079
i going to live in society yes or no yes

5344
02:54:28,559 --> 02:54:31,600
okay most people choose yes

5345
02:54:30,079 --> 02:54:33,439
i understand why to a degree i

5346
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:35,840
understand why some people choose now

5347
02:54:33,439 --> 02:54:36,960
and then um what is the but i'm going to

5348
02:54:35,840 --> 02:54:38,398
be in society i'm going to

5349
02:54:36,959 --> 02:54:40,159
if you choose to be in society you're

5350
02:54:38,398 --> 02:54:42,239
just choosing to abide by the rules

5351
02:54:40,159 --> 02:54:43,920
you're choosing to just do the minimum

5352
02:54:42,239 --> 02:54:44,318
right that's what being part of society

5353
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:45,760
means

5354
02:54:44,318 --> 02:54:47,119
people that choose to be part of society

5355
02:54:45,760 --> 02:54:48,880
but don't want to do this it's very

5356
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:50,000
confusing they should just leave they

5357
02:54:48,879 --> 02:54:51,519
should just go look

5358
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,879
i don't like this deal i'm going to go

5359
02:54:51,520 --> 02:54:53,920
somewhere else i'm going to live in

5360
02:54:52,879 --> 02:54:55,599
tibet i'm going to

5361
02:54:53,920 --> 02:54:57,200
live in the woods i'm going to live

5362
02:54:55,600 --> 02:54:57,840
wherever where the rules are to my

5363
02:54:57,200 --> 02:55:00,960
liking

5364
02:54:57,840 --> 02:55:02,159
right um you you've chosen to be in

5365
02:55:00,959 --> 02:55:04,239
society

5366
02:55:02,159 --> 02:55:05,760
next question kind of final question is

5367
02:55:04,239 --> 02:55:07,520
what is the body of work

5368
02:55:05,760 --> 02:55:09,760
that i'm going to be involved in because

5369
02:55:07,520 --> 02:55:12,079
in in looking at that jeff bezos kind of

5370
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:13,279
regret minimization framework thing i

5371
02:55:12,079 --> 02:55:14,159
think that's what a lot of it really

5372
02:55:13,279 --> 02:55:16,560
comes down to

5373
02:55:14,159 --> 02:55:17,840
is you kind of the framework is at eight

5374
02:55:16,559 --> 02:55:19,359
years old you look back over your life

5375
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:22,960
what would you regret not doing

5376
02:55:19,359 --> 02:55:24,399
what would you regret not not pursuing

5377
02:55:22,959 --> 02:55:26,159
i think there there are a number of

5378
02:55:24,398 --> 02:55:26,719
things on a personal level each person

5379
02:55:26,159 --> 02:55:30,000
has

5380
02:55:26,719 --> 02:55:31,599
but i think at least for me and and

5381
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:33,760
probably for many of the other people i

5382
02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:36,159
know there's a question of

5383
02:55:33,760 --> 02:55:36,880
what is the body of work that i was

5384
02:55:36,159 --> 02:55:39,760
involved in

5385
02:55:36,879 --> 02:55:42,799
what did i do what what happened right

5386
02:55:39,760 --> 02:55:42,800
what was i involved in

5387
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:47,439
and in my opinion you you should have a

5388
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:49,600
good answer to that

5389
02:55:47,439 --> 02:55:51,920
and you mentioned the body work in

5390
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:54,640
relation to

5391
02:55:51,920 --> 02:55:55,680
whether it helped make a better world

5392
02:55:54,639 --> 02:55:58,398
and

5393
02:55:55,680 --> 02:56:00,079
the fundamental question there is what

5394
02:55:58,398 --> 02:56:03,278
does better mean

5395
02:56:00,079 --> 02:56:03,840
so it's our striving to understand what

5396
02:56:03,279 --> 02:56:06,720
is better

5397
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:07,520
what kind of world would we love to

5398
02:56:06,719 --> 02:56:10,478
exist

5399
02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:11,520
after we're gone and i think that's

5400
02:56:10,478 --> 02:56:13,679
another

5401
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:15,120
thing almost unanswerable question but

5402
02:56:13,680 --> 02:56:17,600
it's one we can strive

5403
02:56:15,120 --> 02:56:19,920
towards is what is what is a better

5404
02:56:17,600 --> 02:56:21,600
world

5405
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:23,359
right i i think that's all that's that's

5406
02:56:21,600 --> 02:56:24,640
once again a very that's a very personal

5407
02:56:23,359 --> 02:56:26,159
question i'm not sure if there's an

5408
02:56:24,639 --> 02:56:27,760
objective moral truth

5409
02:56:26,159 --> 02:56:29,680
that's going to suddenly give us all an

5410
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:31,120
answer i think it's actually quite

5411
02:56:29,680 --> 02:56:32,720
fascinating to me when people feel they

5412
02:56:31,120 --> 02:56:34,479
have this objective moral truth they're

5413
02:56:32,719 --> 02:56:36,478
so sure in their opinions you know

5414
02:56:34,478 --> 02:56:38,159
this is what we do we should go you know

5415
02:56:36,478 --> 02:56:40,398
hurt them or help them or

5416
02:56:38,159 --> 02:56:41,680
kill them or or or rescue them or

5417
02:56:40,398 --> 02:56:42,478
whatever right there's this there's all

5418
02:56:41,680 --> 02:56:45,279
these kind of

5419
02:56:42,478 --> 02:56:46,639
very situational specific kind of like

5420
02:56:45,279 --> 02:56:48,399
this is the right thing to do the

5421
02:56:46,639 --> 02:56:50,639
objective moral truth told me

5422
02:56:48,398 --> 02:56:51,840
that this is it but maybe there's a

5423
02:56:50,639 --> 02:56:54,959
definitive truth

5424
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:55,920
that we can uh arrive towards uh sort of

5425
02:56:54,959 --> 02:56:58,799
a consensus

5426
02:56:55,920 --> 02:56:59,600
of what that is within the little local

5427
02:56:58,799 --> 02:57:01,759
pocket

5428
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:03,040
of society that you're in yeah that's

5429
02:57:01,760 --> 02:57:04,639
the point that that's what happens

5430
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:06,160
people just then mislabel it and they go

5431
02:57:04,639 --> 02:57:08,079
like objective moral truth

5432
02:57:06,159 --> 02:57:09,840
yeah this is this is not my this is not

5433
02:57:08,079 --> 02:57:11,279
our idea yeah you know this is coming up

5434
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:12,960
from on high here this is

5435
02:57:11,279 --> 02:57:14,399
this is the this is the the objective

5436
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:16,639
moral truth that

5437
02:57:14,398 --> 02:57:17,840
you know i i think exists in some

5438
02:57:16,639 --> 02:57:19,760
metaphysical form

5439
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:21,600
somewhere and then you build a building

5440
02:57:19,760 --> 02:57:23,120
with marble and it's big and

5441
02:57:21,600 --> 02:57:24,399
usually what happens and then you

5442
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:25,840
convince yourself that that building

5443
02:57:24,398 --> 02:57:26,318
represents i think those people actually

5444
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:27,520
under

5445
02:57:26,318 --> 02:57:28,959
the people who build those buildings

5446
02:57:27,520 --> 02:57:30,960
under probably understand that there is

5447
02:57:28,959 --> 02:57:32,639
no musical object they're just like

5448
02:57:30,959 --> 02:57:33,679
we're all just coming to consensus i'm

5449
02:57:32,639 --> 02:57:34,639
going to build the biggest building and

5450
02:57:33,680 --> 02:57:35,920
you're like me and that's what we're

5451
02:57:34,639 --> 02:57:37,278
going to do right like

5452
02:57:35,920 --> 02:57:38,960
they just they just look at it that way

5453
02:57:37,279 --> 02:57:41,760
probably i

5454
02:57:38,959 --> 02:57:43,358
i i think i think what ends up happening

5455
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:44,478
with with all these values is yeah

5456
02:57:43,359 --> 02:57:46,079
people should determine that for

5457
02:57:44,478 --> 02:57:47,599
themselves i i agree that there's a

5458
02:57:46,079 --> 02:57:48,478
second order question here of what is

5459
02:57:47,600 --> 02:57:51,439
the best the

5460
02:57:48,478 --> 02:57:53,519
the best body of work to work on um

5461
02:57:51,439 --> 02:57:54,159
personally i think that's probably a mix

5462
02:57:53,520 --> 02:57:56,880
of

5463
02:57:54,159 --> 02:57:57,279
what could you realistically achieve you

5464
02:57:56,879 --> 02:57:58,559
know

5465
02:57:57,279 --> 02:58:00,479
is that going to have an impact on

5466
02:57:58,559 --> 02:58:03,039
society that you feel good about yeah

5467
02:58:00,478 --> 02:58:05,039
right so these these are probably the

5468
02:58:03,040 --> 02:58:06,720
two aspects of this question and

5469
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:08,080
is this going to have a good impact on

5470
02:58:06,719 --> 02:58:09,840
society that you feel good about

5471
02:58:08,079 --> 02:58:11,680
obviously very subjective right some

5472
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:15,120
people save animals some people say

5473
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:15,520
forests um we and and i are creating

5474
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:17,760
this

5475
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:19,040
uh system of economic fairness and

5476
02:58:17,760 --> 02:58:21,200
transparency

5477
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:22,880
i feel that i'm in a good position to

5478
02:58:21,200 --> 02:58:24,479
enable that

5479
02:58:22,879 --> 02:58:26,478
i feel that i have a good chance of

5480
02:58:24,478 --> 02:58:27,599
succeeding at that and i think that the

5481
02:58:26,478 --> 02:58:29,599
impact will be

5482
02:58:27,600 --> 02:58:30,640
quite um quite meaningful for a large

5483
02:58:29,600 --> 02:58:34,000
number of people

5484
02:58:30,639 --> 02:58:36,318
and so i'm completely happy to look back

5485
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:37,200
once i made ian see a body of work that

5486
02:58:36,318 --> 02:58:38,719
achieved that

5487
02:58:37,200 --> 02:58:40,399
and be very proud of that right because

5488
02:58:38,719 --> 02:58:42,559
i think that's what i'll be doing

5489
02:58:40,398 --> 02:58:45,519
when i'm looking back so well i agree

5490
02:58:42,559 --> 02:58:48,318
with you the the scale of impact

5491
02:58:45,520 --> 02:58:51,040
as about smart hybrid smart contracts

5492
02:58:48,318 --> 02:58:54,398
this whole idea that you're working on

5493
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:55,359
has the potential to transform the world

5494
02:58:54,398 --> 02:58:59,119
for the better

5495
02:58:55,359 --> 02:58:59,120
at a scale that

5496
02:58:59,200 --> 02:59:02,800
that i can't even imagine so speaking of

5497
02:59:02,079 --> 02:59:05,120
which

5498
02:59:02,799 --> 02:59:07,438
means even more that you would waste so

5499
02:59:05,120 --> 02:59:08,720
many hours of that exciting life with me
