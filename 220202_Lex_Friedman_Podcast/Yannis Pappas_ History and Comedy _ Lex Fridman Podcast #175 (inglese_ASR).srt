1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,560
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,839
giannis pappas a comedian who co-hosted

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:08,399
the podcast

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,559
history hyenas that i came across when i

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,120
was researching the battle of crete from

6
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,959
world war

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:17,839
ii he and his co-host were hilarious

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,640
in their rants about history and about

9
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,480
life

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,800
the chemistry they have is probably the

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,118
best of any co-hosted comedy podcast

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
or even podcasts in general that i've

13
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,198
ever heard

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,599
as of a few weeks ago unfortunately

15
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,320
history hyenas is no more at least for

16
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,558
now

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,320
because all good things must come to an

18
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,799
end but giannis

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,238
hosts a new podcast called long days

20
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,519
with giannis papas

21
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:46,640
plus he has a comedy special on youtube

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,680

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,159
wine access blinkist magic spoon

24
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,558
and indeed check them out in the

25
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,718
description to support this podcast

26
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,238
as a side note let me say that some of

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,920
you have noticed

28
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,599
that i have not spoken with too many

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,760
computer scientists physicists

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,840
biologists or engineers recently

31
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,000
the reason has to do mostly with the

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,320
risk aversion of many of these folks

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,478
in the time of covid especially as they

34
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,639
get closer to taking the vaccine

35
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,719
i'm tested several times a week and

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,079
still some people are just more willing

37
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,879
than others to have

38
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,798
an in-person conversation in these times

39
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,199
i only do these podcasts in person

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,799
because i look for the possibility of a

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,000
genuine human connection

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,240
i'm willing to sacrifice a lot for that

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,519
maybe it's silly but i look for the

44
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,280
magic that

45
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,640
charles bukowski writes about in his

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,040
poem nirvana

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,320
the magic that is somehow in the air on

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,439
those rare occasions

49
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,839
when two people meet talk and you notice

50
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,039
that while on the surface you may be

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,759
worlds apart

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,720
you're still somehow woven from the same

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,640
fabric

54
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,239
i've had that with many guests jim

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,359
keller comes to mind but

56
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,280
many others as well i'm an ai person

57
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,118
machine learning robotics computer

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,040
science is my passion

59
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,799
trust me i can't wait to be having more

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,719
technical conversations again

61
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,118
but i will also continue to mix in

62
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:12,479
comedians musicians historians

63
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:15,280
and of course wise all-seeing sages like

64
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,079
giannis pappas and tim dillon just to

65
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,360
keep it

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,239
as tim likes to say fun

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
this is the lex friedman podcast and

68
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,920
here

69
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:28,400
is my conversation with giannis pappas

70
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,199
you've co-hosted until recently an

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,000
amazing

72
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,598
history comedy podcast called the

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,239
history hyenas

74
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,878
so you're a bit of a student of history

75
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,959
yeah uh

76
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,159
an f student of history f student yeah

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,719
okay i thought it was more like a d

78
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,799
minus

79
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,639
d minus yeah okay still got to repeat

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,480
the grade if you get all d minuses i

81
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,318
actually had a point 67 gpa

82
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,399
average my freshman year and i had to do

83
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,719
it again this is this podcast is going

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,120
to be the spectrum of human intelligence

85
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,359
this

86
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,400
it runs from there to here so this is

87
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,120
going to set the low

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
bar i'm barely sliding into human i'm

89
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,680
closer to chimp

90
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,200
and i uh bring that up that you're also

91
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,400
friends with uh

92
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:11,439
the great the powerful tim dillon

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,239
so let's talk about power and the

94
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,079
corrupting effects of power

95
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,080
sometimes i look at tim dillon as he

96
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,200
grows in power i thought you meant it

97
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,319
in size well size i think they're

98
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,238
correlated yeah

99
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,158
i saw him i've been in austin a couple

100
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,878
days i saw him once we had eight meals

101
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,878
in one day

102
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,000
eight meals yeah so i feel like i've

103
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,079
been here longer than i have just

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,120
because of the meals with dylan

105
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,040
kid likes biscuits and barbecue okay so

106
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,319
he's more like see i was i was imagining

107
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,519
putin or something like that he's more

108
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:43,199
like the north korean

109
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,920
dictator they'd get along great those

110
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,598
two

111
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,199
yeah they would get i mean tim dillon

112
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,639
and king john um would be like they

113
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,318
could make like a buddy cop movie they

114
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,158
would get along like lethal weapon

115
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,518
that would be a good pitch movie great

116
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,079
podcast yeah that would be a great

117
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,280
podcast

118
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,200
yeah so much to talk about so many

119
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,438
similar ideas about the world

120
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,719
so what do you think the world would

121
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,120
look like

122
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,359
if tim dillon was given absolute power

123
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
he seems like a person

124
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,959
that's an interesting study of the

125
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,799
corrupting effects of power

126
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,920
yeah you don't want to give him power

127
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,280
you don't want i don't even want him

128
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,358
wearing a suit

129
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,279
like i want a guy who's as thoughtful

130
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,039
and educated as you wearing a suit

131
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,319
like because you know suits corrupt you

132
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,600
you put that suit on you start feeling

133
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,959
that power you see definitely

134
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,040
it's like you know yeah i don't even

135
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,638
want tim dylan to suit power would

136
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,800
he would kill people he'd get rid of

137
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,560
anything that he deemed

138
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,079
i mean if you made a lobster roll and it

139
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
wasn't up to tim dillon's standard he

140
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,319
would have you executed

141
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,478
the restaurant staff is just gone

142
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,560
he would have people below his food

143
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,758
standard execute there'd be programs

144
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,240
not of people who are political

145
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,160
dissidents but of people who don't meet

146
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,879
his food standard his cuisine standard

147
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
is high

148
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,478
and he's usually right do you think

149
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,320
power does corrupt people

150
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,599
yes like one of the reasons we mentioned

151
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,040
offline joe rogan

152
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,199
he's been an inspiration to me because

153
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,520
he gets he gets

154
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,439
forget power just more famous and famous

155
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,399
and yes probably a bit of power in terms

156
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,279
of influence

157
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,799
and he's still pretty much the same guy

158
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,359
i'm not sure that's going to be true for

159
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,879
everybody

160
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,038
do you ever think ask yourself with that

161
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,600
question yeah he's a rare breed

162
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,279
he's like a benign king i've most people

163
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
i meet who are like really powerful are

164
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,599
like

165
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,199
douchebags and that's how they got there

166
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,320
i think that's psychopaths have the

167
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,280
advantage because they don't have

168
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,120
feelings

169
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,799
and joe's a rare example he's just a

170
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,918
powerhouse of will

171
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,639
and uh he uh i do think about that yeah

172
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,319
i think i should be stopped right now

173
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,600
just stop me right now because yeah

174
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,680
power for me i would

175
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,120
when people get power they indulge i

176
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,639
don't think it changes anyone it just

177
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,079
reveals your darkest

178
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,400
yeah you know people aren't supposed to

179
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,599
have anything they want you got to be

180
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,038
able to struggle for everything so i

181
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,960
would have a harem

182
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,240
i'd be like a roman dictator yeah i'd be

183
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,519
like a roman emperor i mean people call

184
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,280
them emperors they were dictators the

185
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,198
most effective leaders are dictators

186
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,279
i hope we get back to that democracy

187
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,079
hasn't worked i'm ready for a secession

188
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:01,359
of caesar's

189
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,359
and i want to start with aoc

190
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,280
that's true dictators get the job done

191
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,639
they do they do at certain point you go

192
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,758
that's why social workers can only get

193
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
you so far you need

194
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,240
action i was a social worker for five

195
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,839
years and all you do is ask about

196
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,319
medications and

197
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,198
you don't solve anything i do ask myself

198
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,439
of that like

199
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
because i'm more in the tech space of

200
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,199
constructing

201
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,318
systems that prevent me from being

202
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,000
corrupt because

203
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,600
right now i'm all about love and all

204
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
about those kinds of things

205
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,280
but i wonder you said like it just

206
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,918
reveals the darkness

207
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,439
the the problem is we might not be aware

208
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,120
of our own darkness

209
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,759
i have the same feeling about money

210
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,879
actually i've been avoiding

211
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,800
thinking about money like basically

212
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,159
constructing my moral system my moral

213
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,280
compass around money

214
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
it's like the moment i feel a little too

215
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,799
happy

216
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,560
but about the idea of owning some cool

217
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
shiny thing

218
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,598
i started to think okay i'm not gonna

219
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,598
own that shiny thing

220
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,120
because i'm afraid of the slippery slope

221
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:01,759
of it yeah you ever think about that

222
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,918
kind of stuff

223
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,400
yeah the the funny thing about our the

224
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:09,198
capitalist system is it's uh

225
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:10,318
it's um it puts sort of uh profit motive

226
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,560
above

227
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,840
beauty and you notice when you see

228
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,439
certain cities

229
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,198
especially in the old days where like

230
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,360
buildings used to be beautiful

231
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,879
yeah and uh now they're just like boxes

232
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,479
they throw a kid up and it's just for

233
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,360
all profit margin

234
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,478
it's um it's the illusion of permanence

235
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,598
that uh

236
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,598
you know it's like oh let me get as much

237
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,959
money as i can you're like yeah you know

238
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,560
my dad used to say you know everyone

239
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,719
it's a cliche but you can't take it with

240
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,360
you so it's kind of it's it's comical to

241
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
me

242
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
that we're here trying to get this

243
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,800
infinite amount like that we're climbing

244
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
it's like

245
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,240
sisyphus we're all trying to climb this

246
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,840
hill but i mean the rock's gonna fall on

247
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,319
us so i think that's a healthy outlook

248
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,758
yeah

249
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,919
my dad always used to say before he

250
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,598
passed you know he would say you can't

251
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,198
you have to survive not only

252
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,560
physically but you have to survive

253
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,800
emotionally i think a lot of people

254
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,639
forget about the emotional part

255
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,240
of uh survival you have to survive

256
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,759
emotionally and humor

257
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,519
and and and understanding reality in its

258
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,280
objective context helps with that

259
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,719
accepting reality as this

260
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:11,359
ephemeral uh thing that

261
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,199
you're in really just a part of but not

262
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,759
as significant as your ego wants you to

263
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,240
believe

264
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,680
is a start that's a good foundation for

265
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,199
surviving emotionally

266
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,199
what what's that mean surviving

267
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
emotionally like what what's an ideal

268
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,400
life look like for you yeah you can't

269
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,319
driving you can't take things too

270
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,679
seriously you can't um because

271
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,360
they're ephemeral they're they're not

272
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,560
permanent nothing's permanent your bank

273
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,680
account's not permanent your problems

274
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,839
aren't permanent

275
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,680
uh nothing's permanent your abilities

276
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,719
aren't permanent um your memory is not

277
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,679
permanent your

278
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,959
your dick getting hard it's not

279
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,120
permanent can i curse on this or is this

280
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,639
go out

281
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,720
yeah you can curse to your heart's

282
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,919
content okay yeah i mean gender is not

283
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,600
even permanent anymore i think i'm gonna

284
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,039
i'm gonna change maybe and live my

285
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,519
second half as another gender just to

286
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,599
have

287
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,200
i'm bored with this gender so it's like

288
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,560
nothing is permanent

289
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,959
and so accepting that emotionally

290
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,479
uh is a good start to being more

291
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,239
flexible you got to be flexible

292
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,000
like my dad used to say anything too

293
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,919
stiff snaps you gotta

294
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,958
you know it's a cliche and people have

295
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,000
said it a bunch of different ways but

296
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,199
bruce lee's right man be

297
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,799
water be water

298
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,200
yeah bukowski has this quote about

299
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,039
love that love is a fog that phase with

300
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,920
the first light of reality

301
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,599
so he's a romantic that guy yeah but

302
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,039
that even love is a thing that just

303
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,159
doesn't last very long

304
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,599
no um you know some people disagree with

305
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,240
that maybe it morphs it

306
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,200
like like like water it changes right it

307
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,799
might not be

308
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,000
it might not be this because he's mostly

309
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,958
just uh loved like prostitutes i think

310
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,799
so that's kind of love yeah no demand no

311
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,079
uh responsibilities yeah it's a

312
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,759
financial transaction

313
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,278
yeah uh ephemeral as ever

314
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:54,480
you mentioned your dad he passed away

315
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:57,120
uh two a year and a half ago yeah

316
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,600
what did you learn from him i love my

317
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,560
dad

318
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,600
my dad i would say my dad was my my hero

319
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,838
he was just uh

320
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,879
my dad really embodied those values and

321
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,399
i think um

322
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,159
for better or worse it's made me who i

323
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,799
am he's he uh

324
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,399
my dad was was a painter he was a lawyer

325
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,319
he was uh

326
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,240
he was a you know a lieutenant in the

327
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,079
military new yorker

328
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,399
new yorker born and bred brooklyn his

329
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,838
doubt his dad you know uh surprise owned

330
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,240
a diner so that's

331
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,680
that's sort of the greek passport that's

332
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,039
the immigration passport for greeks in

333
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,519
new america

334
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,759
and um yeah my dad played football he

335
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,519
just my dad did what he wanted he lived

336
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,480
as he wanted at all costs and i think i

337
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,480
got that from him

338
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
for better or worse i think it's hurt me

339
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,759
in my pursuits

340
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:44,639
uh if if you consider money and fame

341
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,399
uh to be paramount you know i've always

342
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,919
done what i wanted if i stopped wanting

343
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,360
to do it i just stopped doing it i think

344
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,479
i got that for my dad so maybe

345
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,480
for better or worse that's what i

346
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,519
learned from them but that's a real

347
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,519
currency you know

348
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,360
feeling like you're in love with what

349
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,039
you're doing when you're doing it

350
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,879
maybe perhaps that's worth more than

351
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,679
money i don't know

352
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,720
you miss him yeah every day every day

353
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,639
but i'm happy that

354
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,879
uh he he got 91 years

355
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,919
it's very rare i mean he smoked for 60

356
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,000
years

357
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,599
talk about like a guy who was an outlier

358
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,919
and he smoked like six years like

359
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,440
packs i mean yeah and he didn't die from

360
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,958
that he died he had a

361
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,640
prostate cancer which is the way men

362
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,000
should go your dick should give out it

363
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,759
should start from the dick

364
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,440
i mean we focus so much of our life on

365
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,679
the dick that

366
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,040
that's the way that's a successful life

367
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,719
and that's why every man eventually gets

368
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,559
prostate cancer because that is the

369
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,720
universe's way of saying like

370
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,319
the thing you focused on the most is you

371
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,600
put the most energy into is the thing

372
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,360
that's spent

373
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
and it's gonna your your rotting is

374
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,278
gonna start there so that's a successful

375
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,639
life

376
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,078
and it just spread all over his body and

377
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,600
he slowly died i was with him when he

378
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:50,719
died and that meant a lot to me

379
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,560
because me and my brother weren't

380
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,040
talking at the time because we're greeks

381
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,719
uh

382
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,639
we're we're talking again but that's how

383
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
it is you got a few brothers right i got

384
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,519
two brothers

385
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,440
but i wanted to make sure i was with him

386
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,759
uh when he died and i got lucky and i

387
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,519
was in the room with him when he died

388
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,200
you were in the room with your brother

389
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,879
and you weren't no my brother wasn't

390
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,000
there we were kind of doing shifts i was

391
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,320
i was there i spent

392
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
the night the dad my the night my dad

393
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,720
died he died in the early in the morning

394
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
and i heard

395
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,079
the death rattle last breath and it was

396
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,120
just i think it was

397
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,879
uh i he knew i was there and i think

398
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,480
that just probably

399
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,559
meant something to him and i'm just glad

400
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,879
i was there does that make you sad

401
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:29,919
that uh life is ephemeral like you said

402
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,519
yeah that

403
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,838
you die yeah what do you think about

404
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,000
your own death you meditate on that

405
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,600
i think it i think the actual if there

406
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,639
is a point to life it's to

407
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,839
hopefully not fear death to accept

408
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,759
reality

409
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,079
i think that's important i think so much

410
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:51,519
goes awry in the human condition when we

411
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,519
lose touch with reality every political

412
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,720
system that's led to mass murder and

413
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,560
everything i think

414
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,278
because it's because the the tenets

415
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,278
of those political philosophies ended up

416
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,000
being utopian they were detached from

417
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,039
reality

418
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,600
detached from nature and so i think it's

419
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,519
it's very important to accept and

420
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,959
acknowledge your own mortality i think

421
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,879
it's the foundation for what makes a

422
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,879
good person a moral person

423
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,240
um a contributing member of society

424
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,399
because it's true

425
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,600
true things should be the foundation of

426
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,360
all things

427
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,879
if if if what you believe is based on

428
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,919
illusion you're gonna end up doing

429
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,360
destruction

430
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,759
whether that destruction is on a scale

431
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,519
of one to ten you are going to be

432
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,360
destructive because it's not real

433
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,278
it's a fantasy it doesn't exist see the

434
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,639
thing is the truth is about

435
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,039
i don't think you can ever reach truth

436
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,560
truth is about like constantly digging

437
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,639
and to push back in your idea that you

438
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,319
should accept death i think the more

439
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,639
honest response to death

440
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,240
so the least honest is to run away from

441
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,120
it create illusions

442
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,799
that help you imagine that there's not a

443
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,198
death

444
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:57,278
the next is to accept it but the real

445
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,479
honest one is to fear it

446
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:02,958
because i i i mean i'm with

447
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,800
ernest becker as a philosopher uh he

448
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,759
wrote a book called denial of death

449
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,278
he says that the like much of the human

450
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,399
condition is based in the fear of

451
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,439
mortality

452
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,440
that we like that's that's the creative

453
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,120
force of the human energy like freud

454
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,000
said you want to sleep with your mother

455
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,440
he said no that's not what motivates you

456
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
maybe his mom wasn't hot though

457
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,680
i mean or he wasn't greek because

458
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,278
apparently edible we we found

459
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,399
we found that all things good and bad

460
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,679
yeah thanks thanks for that thanks

461
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,519
i just don't know if his mom was look or

462
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,039
not i mean i have to google it all right

463
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,759
yeah i'll look up on google images

464
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,958
yeah no but i think that honest as he

465
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,360
says

466
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,278
the thing that we run away from is that

467
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,519
there's a terror he calls it like

468
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,120
terror there's something called terror

469
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,159
management theory that's

470
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,078
some philosophers after him followed on

471
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,679
that were basically trying to run away

472
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,719
from this fear

473
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,838
and acceptance is actually creating an

474
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,079
illusion for yourself

475
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,440
like you can actually accept something

476
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,759
as terrifying as this

477
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,440
so he's more with the stoics the stoic

478
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,480
constantly meditate on their death i

479
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,000
mean they

480
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,079
what does that mean that means kind of

481
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,039
you know acceptance of death isn't a

482
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,278
thing you do like

483
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:20,078
on a monday and then you're done it's a

484
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:23,198
thing you constantly have to meditate on

485
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,759
like reminding yourself like this ride

486
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,359
is over

487
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,278
it could be over today and that's

488
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,240
something you're if you think about

489
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:29,679
every single day

490
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,000
it gives you an appreciation of woody

491
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,439
allen movies at least

492
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,759
it gives you appreciation for basically

493
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,959
everything including woody allen movies

494
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,879
which shows you

495
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:40,000
how deep your appreciation for life

496
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,360
could be

497
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,120
i've actually haven't been following

498
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,360
much about what woody allen's

499
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,639
but apparently he's been a troublemaker

500
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,560
throughout most of his life

501
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,159
he's yeah i mean you know he's caused a

502
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,559
little bit of strife he's left a little

503
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,240
uh

504
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,078
yeah he's left a little confusion in his

505
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,560
wake for sure

506
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,399
but i mean you know that's another one

507
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,399
separate the art from the artist

508
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,759
he's got i mean the guys will go down in

509
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,679
history as the greatest

510
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,759
he's i mean a movie a year and they're

511
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,519
all you can always find something good

512
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,480
about each movie like the dialogue or

513
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,000
whatever

514
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,039
um i love what you're saying it's

515
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,320
interesting but the only thing i would

516
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,759
say to push back a little bit since

517
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,240
we're playing a little table tennis here

518
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,959
yeah

519
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,079
is um i don't know if it's a choice to

520
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,159
fear death that's more of an

521
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,359
it seems more instinctual it seems like

522
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,679
something that

523
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,120
nature wants you to do because i've been

524
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,559
in positions where i thought i was gonna

525
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,720
die like i've been shot and

526
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:32,879
i had those moments and then nature also

527
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,240
uh you know kicks in an instinct which

528
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,838
is acceptance

529
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
where you kind of i don't know it's a

530
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
chemical release or whatever i don't

531
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,320
know you know

532
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,679
we're all we're robots basically so some

533
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,720
sort of chemical is released that

534
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,719
protects you but

535
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
there is an acceptance i don't know how

536
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,600
much uh

537
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,360
of it was a conscious choice probably

538
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,800
very little um

539
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,079
and that's the point i'm making is it's

540
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,719
instinctual we don't really have a

541
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,479
choice

542
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,399
in fearing death otherwise there would

543
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,519
be no progression we wouldn't

544
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,720
all life seems to want to survive

545
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,199
uh not by choice but by instinct

546
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,880
so he he argues that the fear is not the

547
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,160
instinctual of it's not the animalistic

548
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,199
stuff that's the thing that makes us

549
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,759
special

550
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,038
is the what humans are able to do is

551
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,879
they have a knowledge that we're going

552
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:17,519
to die one day animals don't have that

553
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,439
animals fear is instinctual it's like

554
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,519
holy [ __ ] what's that sound over there

555
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,000
he says we're actually able to

556
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,798
contemplate the fact that this ride ends

557
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,759
and that that kind of cognitive

558
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,679
construct

559
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,279
is difficult for us to deal with like

560
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,320
what the hell does that mean

561
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:37,678
like just just to think about

562
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,798
it's going to be over at a certain point

563
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,960
like it's just over lights out like

564
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,240
it's very difficult to kind of load that

565
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
into

566
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,880
whatever this like little brain we got

567
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,798
like what does that actually mean

568
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,919
maybe that's what gives everything

569
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,319
meaning yeah

570
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,759
because if everything lasted forever if

571
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,439
uh if this went on an

572
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,400
infinite there would be no meaning to it

573
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,080
i'd be like hey if i don't see you

574
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,440
tomorrow i'll see in a million years

575
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,359
there would be no meaning there'll be no

576
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,798
urgency there would be no feelings

577
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,038
there'd be no uh nothing of magnitude or

578
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:09,839
superficiality it would all just be this

579
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,359
kind of

580
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,119
it would be torture it would actually

581
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,199
that would actually be torture

582
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,479
to be here forever i mean i'm already

583
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,360
sick of this place and i'm

584
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,440
just in my 40s like i'm done i'm sick of

585
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,839
me i'm sick of everything

586
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,798
you know a lot of people when they talk

587
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,399
about immortality they consider

588
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,160
they consider mortality appealing

589
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,440
because you get a chance to do

590
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,798
basically all these things

591
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,120
you might not get a chance to do

592
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,839
otherwise like all the kinds of travel

593
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,639
broadly explore read every book explore

594
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,879
every idea

595
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,320
do every hobby all those kinds of things

596
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:50,080
somebody else i was talking to mentioned

597
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:52,399
the reality of being immortal would be

598
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,199
more likely i like this idea more likely

599
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
would be

600
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,600
you just sitting there doing nothing

601
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,440
because and putting off all that

602
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,038
travel and exploration till later

603
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,720
because you'll always have time

604
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:06,558
and so what you're going to have what

605
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,798
actual immortality would look like

606
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,319
for a bunch of humans is people sitting

607
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,319
there doing nothing it'll be like a

608
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,599
greek cafe just sitting around drinking

609
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:17,038
coffee watching it i love it

610
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:18,558
yeah it's a lazy man's paradise yeah

611
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,640
but it's so interesting because that

612
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,879
that's that rings true to me for

613
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,000
what humans are like is we'll basically

614
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,080
just put off

615
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,919
all those exciting adventures and just

616
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,399
be lazy become lazier and lazier and

617
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,679
lazier

618
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,600
because you'll always have a chance to

619
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,160
do all the exciting things and we'll

620
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,240
just get

621
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,840
we'll basically become tim dill just sit

622
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,400
there and have a podcast

623
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,079
and that's it he works hard um yeah i

624
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,600
mean that sounds actually like heaven

625
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,240
dude that's speaking of my heart really

626
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,798
i mean

627
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,839
i'm at heart i'm a very lazy person i

628
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,918
always

629
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,439
try to find ways to lie down like if i'm

630
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,120
sitting i'll figure out a way to kind of

631
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,519
contort myself to later

632
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,399
that's an interesting thing to like in

633
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,519
yeah if you can

634
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,240
always push something off

635
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,038
yeah that i like that i i think that's

636
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,599
heaven

637
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,960
and um see we just changed your mind you

638
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,639
kind of like del mortality

639
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,079
yeah i kind of like it no so there'll be

640
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,440
no thirsts no

641
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,279
you can always put it off hey i wanna i

642
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,720
wanna i wanna have i wanna

643
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,879
bang this girl you're like i'll put it

644
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,240
off but now i'm thinking about muslim

645
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,400
heaven and they may be offering the best

646
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,120
deal i mean if it was an expo

647
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,960
and they had a booth i may go with them

648
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,599
because they offer

649
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,440
they offer 62 or 72 but then i'd get

650
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,038
sick of them i'd want to

651
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,038
i don't know i always wondered like are

652
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,119
you given the 62

653
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,079
virgins or do you choose can you create

654
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,479
them like an avatar

655
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,439
like a video game or are you just giving

656
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,720
i don't know what the num

657
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,558
why it's important to have that high

658
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,480
number first of all i think it's a

659
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,839
mistranslation about the virgins but

660
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,360
outside of that outside of that

661
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,879
i feel like the conversation is really

662
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,719
important i i don't think they ever

663
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,159
specify like what kind of books these

664
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,640
girls read

665
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,760
like what are they what are they into

666
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,280
like

667
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,720
the quality of the conversation i think

668
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:59,918
if you're talking about eternity the

669
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,000
quality of the intellect and the

670
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,120
conversation and the personalities is

671
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,038
way more important

672
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,719
and the greeks have an ancient ancient

673
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:07,759
expression pan metro narestone which my

674
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,440
mother always used to say which is

675
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,599
everything in moderation nothing in

676
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,798
excess so trying to always get the

677
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,000
status quo

678
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,839
and uh yeah that many women

679
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,359
eventually it's like the magic johnson

680
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,119
effect isaiah thomas effect

681
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:22,558
it's just too much and you're gonna end

682
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,918
up you're gonna end up banging a dude is

683
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,279
what i'm saying you're gonna get sick of

684
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,919
it because it's too much

685
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,519
and there's going to be a eunuch that

686
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,280
finds its way into your harem

687
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,720
that's been proven throughout history

688
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,000
every empire

689
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,839
when you have all that power and again

690
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,839
this goes back to power corrupting

691
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,279
if you have if there's no struggle

692
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,759
there's no meaning there's

693
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,200
the value is from the journey the the

694
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,720
working hard the struggle and if it's

695
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,679
just given to you because you're a

696
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
sultan

697
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,360
or you're alexander the great or

698
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,640
whatever you're going to get bored and

699
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,719
you're going to bang a dude

700
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,320
that's it's i think that's a scientific

701
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,679
axiom actually eventually you'll get

702
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,359
bored and banger dude

703
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,720
yeah but i think it won't stop there i

704
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,519
think you'll go to animals you'll go to

705
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,200
robot i mean

706
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,558
eventually it all ends up in robots and

707
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,640
then the robots rebel and then the

708
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,879
humans will be destroyed yeah

709
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,919
i'm sorry if if uh yeah we're speaking

710
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,360
truth you said

711
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,600
the value of life one of the

712
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,959
highest ideals is to seek truth i think

713
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,199
if we're gonna ask you a quick question

714
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,038
if

715
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,400
you uh if you live in a small i come

716
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,839
from small islands right and so there's

717
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,720
a stereotype that that's where they bang

718
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,798
animals but

719
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,240
if you come from a very small community

720
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:25,599
yes you know an island or something you

721
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,519
have the choice of banging a family

722
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,359
member or an animal which one is worse

723
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,639
on the moral scale

724
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,399
because you're technically not related

725
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,759
to the animal right

726
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,600
this is interesting i mean all of these

727
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,599
are human constructs these ideas but yet

728
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,879
for me personally taboo would be more

729
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,279
taboo to uh

730
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,799
to to have sex with a family member yeah

731
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,079
i mean animal i mean okay it's good to

732
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,359
know where you stand on that i think

733
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,879
your viewers you know that

734
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,558
if they didn't have they didn't know

735
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,159
they had that question i they just

736
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:50,480
learned a little bit about you and now i

737
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,080
know

738
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,839
i look forward to the internet clipping

739
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,839
that out

740
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,360
yeah i mean there there is listen uh in

741
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,599
some outside

742
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,359
outside of that i do think about that a

743
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,399
lot it sounds ridiculous

744
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:08,879
uh about morality connected to animals

745
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,840
in terms of all the the factory farming

746
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,120
and so on

747
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,678
it seems like that's one of the things

748
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:17,599
we'll look because i love me

749
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:20,080
but i kind of feel bad about it and and

750
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,599
bad in a way where i think if we look

751
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,319
like a hundred years from now

752
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,599
we'll look back at this time as like one

753
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,639
of the great

754
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,240
like tortures and injustices that we

755
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,159
humans have committed

756
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,240
and i mean all that has to do with the

757
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,080
sex with the animal has to do with

758
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,519
consent and about the experience of

759
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,279
suffering of animals

760
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,720
the reason i think about that personally

761
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,119
a lot because i think about

762
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,038
robotics i think about creating

763
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,798
artificial

764
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:51,200
consciousnesses uh artificial

765
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,720
like beings that have some elements of

766
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,400
the human nature and then

767
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,960
you start to think like well what does

768
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,120
it mean to suffer what does it mean

769
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,640
for entity to exist such that it

770
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:01,839
deserves rights

771
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,400
this is something that the founding

772
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,158
fathers were thinking about like

773
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,759
you know all men are created equal what

774
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,760
is it which

775
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:11,599
who's included in the men who who's not

776
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:13,519
in that in that sentence

777
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,599
and our animals included in that are

778
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,599
robots i honestly think that there will

779
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,879
be a civil rights movement for robots in

780
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,879
the future

781
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,480
i don't know is that the turing test the

782
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,120
way you try to is that they call it

783
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,120
where you're trying to

784
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,720
see if a ai can think like a human or

785
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,359
whatever or feel like a human

786
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,000
well it's uh the touring test closely

787
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,439
defined as more

788
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,240
about talk like a human so

789
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,759
you can you can imagine systems they're

790
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,759
able to you can have a conversation like

791
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:45,359
this and i would be a robot for example

792
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:47,278
but that doesn't mean i would in the

793
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,278
in society that doesn't mean i deserve

794
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,798
rights or

795
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:52,640
that doesn't mean i would be conscious

796
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:53,440
it doesn't mean that i would be able to

797
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,759
suffer

798
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,679
and to experience pleasure and dream and

799
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,119
all those kind of human things

800
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,200
the question isn't whether you're able

801
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,439
to talk which is passing the turing test

802
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,558
the question is whether you're able to

803
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,640
feel

804
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:10,879
to be uh i mean i go back to suffering

805
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,559
the thing that that our documents

806
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,200
protect us against

807
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,879
is uh suffering like we don't want

808
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,038
humans to suffer

809
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,480
and if a robot can suffer

810
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:27,519
that discussion starts being about like

811
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,880
well shouldn't we protect them currently

812
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,119
we don't protect animals

813
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,960
we protect dogs there's laws there's

814
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:33,278
actually legislation that protects dogs

815
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,360
for

816
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,278
certain places yeah and you know what

817
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:38,719
dogs is something i don't think people

818
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,480
really understand enough about

819
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,240
it's one of my obsessions so um they

820
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,919
they my dad always used to say though he

821
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,480
go those things those things are

822
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,080
basically human and i mean they dream

823
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,960
they have anxiety

824
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:55,038
uh and what people often overlook about

825
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,480
dogs is without dogs we wouldn't be here

826
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:01,599
we would not have ever evolved

827
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,720
from hunter-gatherer to agrarian to

828
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:06,639
you know civilization we wouldn't have

829
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,240
cities we wouldn't have anything i mean

830
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,480
they are our partner in

831
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,599
survival and they are a magical animal

832
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,278
there's no

833
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,599
there's no animal that was it was like

834
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,440
destiny almost i mean a malleable animal

835
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,000
there's no animal that's that malleable

836
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,880
that in a few generations you can tailor

837
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,519
to

838
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,278
a specific job that you need and without

839
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,278
that animal without dogs doing that

840
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:30,000
animal protecting our crops from

841
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:30,798
from uh you know uh scavengers and stuff

842
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,440
like that

843
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,918
you know the list goes on we wouldn't be

844
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,360
here

845
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,759
so we that's an often overlooked fact

846
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,119
that

847
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,798
human evolution was not uh done in a

848
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,319
vacuum just with humans i mean without

849
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,918
dogs we would have never evolved i mean

850
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:47,200
we weren't the apex predator for most of

851
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,759
our existence we weren't even the apex

852
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,278
predator

853
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:51,200
i mean we're getting eaten by hyenas

854
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:52,558
which is my favorite animal um and you

855
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,400
know it's kind of an injustice to

856
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,079
i mean i'm kind of mad at dogs die we

857
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,320
deserve to get eaten by hyenas but

858
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,119
without dogs we wouldn't be here and

859
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,439
dogs

860
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,119
dogs deserve the protection so do horses

861
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,640
they [ __ ] lugged us around

862
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,639
for thousands of years and now these

863
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,759
[ __ ] german psychopaths are eating

864
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,840
them or whatever

865
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:12,079
we should not eat horse meat just on

866
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,599
like be a good dude man these things

867
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,399
lugged us around for generations they're

868
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,480
beautiful

869
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,759
you know ride them or i don't know i

870
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,120
don't know but

871
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,440
it rubs me the wrong way that we eat

872
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,239
horses yeah the horse's one is

873
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,840
interesting

874
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,759
and one of my favorite books is animal

875
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,959
farm by orwell and the horses

876
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:31,440
don't get a good ending in that uh

877
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,120
i kind of uh my spirit animal i suppose

878
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,840
is the horse from animal farm

879
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,519
boxer where he says uh i will work

880
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,959
harder that's his motto

881
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,879
i i work really hard uh at stupid things

882
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,399
that's that's basically what i just hit

883
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,080
my head against the wall for no reason

884
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,278
whatsoever but that probably fulfills

885
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,240
you have a big brain you're probably

886
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:49,038
born with a big brain that kind of

887
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,519
fulfills

888
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,640
killing neurons it's exercise for you

889
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,000
yes yes

890
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,679
don't you think some animals deserve to

891
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,880
be eaten though kind of like

892
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,640
hyenas come on dude i mean they

893
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,320
gotta respect the hyena okay so let's

894
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,000
look first of all let me just comment on

895
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,839
the dog thing there is like conferences

896
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,159
on dog cognition

897
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,678
from a perspective of people that study

898
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,159
psychology cognitive science

899
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,919
neuroscience dogs are fascinating

900
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,520
the way they move their eyes they're

901
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,080
able to they're the only other animal

902
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,000
besides

903
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,000
humans they're able to communicate with

904
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,759
their eyes they can look at a thing

905
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,839
and look back at you and look back at

906
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,640
the thing to communicate that we're all

907
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,319
like

908
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,759
through our eyes communicate that we're

909
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,599
collaborating so

910
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,440
every other animal uses their eyes to

911
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,918
actually look at things

912
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,200
the dogs use it to like communicate with

913
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,640
you with us humans

914
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,640
it's fascinating there's a lot of other

915
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,720
elements of dogs that are amazing

916
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,159
yeah i mean if it wasn't for them

917
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,839
they're the ones they were our first

918
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,399
alarm system for predators they would

919
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,678
defend us

920
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:47,278
i mean the basenji is one of the most

921
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,080
ancient dogs i mean they're tiny but

922
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:49,759
they're fearless

923
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:50,879
yeah and they would chase off lions like

924
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,079
you know there'd be packs of them and

925
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,960
they'd chase off lions and

926
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,720
protect the tribes it's it's it's i even

927
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,240
get tingles like thinking about dogs

928
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,798
because i have a dog i love my dog it's

929
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,079
just

930
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,519
and there's something about when you're

931
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:02,558
walking with your dog off leash in the

932
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,480
woods it like

933
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:05,678
there's something about it that's like

934
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,079
that that

935
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,120
tugs at that uh millions of years of

936
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,519
evolution like

937
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,119
that gut you know it's like i had a

938
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,359

that's

946
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,079
the survival instinct of all your

947
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,278
ancestors at the beginning of time

948
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:32,558

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,960
right again we're kind of missing

970
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,398
the most destructive thing is us because

971
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,079

981
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,399
yeah tanks and autonomous weapon systems

982
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,120

983
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:41,839
yeah that's yeah yeah the nra's about to

984
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:41,839
collect that for you

985
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,639
a lot of love for dogs i appreciate it

986
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,079
very much and at the same time

987
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,240
you have the other thing that people

988
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,240
seem to have love for which is cats

989
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,919
and on the flip side of everything

990
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,079
you've said

991
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,840
i'm trying to understand what have cats

992
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,000
ever done for human civilization

993
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,038
they keep rodents away the domesticated

994
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,558
cat is very important

995
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,240
keeps rodents away yeah that's what they

996
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,240
were domesticated for i mean they're

997
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,278
psychopathic killers who end up

998
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,839
killing uh innocent um

999
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,480
neighborhood chipmunks and yeah and

1000
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,158
birds

1001
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,798
uh they really affect the uh the balance

1002
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,080
of the local ecosystem but if you look

1003
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:22,319
for cats too

1004
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,079
not as much as dogs i mean dogs are like

1005
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,359
you said they look at humans i actually

1006
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:27,038
read an article there some people were

1007
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,519
theorizing they're smarter than chimps

1008
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:29,038
because

1009
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,480
of the way they can work with humans and

1010
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,200
there was one border collie that spoke

1011
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,839
like

1012
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,480
300 words like a quarter like a lang

1013
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:36,240
almost

1014
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,240
part of the language and their nose is

1015
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,159
like a ma i mean that's like magic dude

1016
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,679
if you can smell in my ass to what i had

1017
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,440
for breakfast from

1018
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,919
miles away that's intelligent that's

1019
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,519
intelligence i mean in some ways that

1020
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,120
their nose if you were to put it on a

1021
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,480
scale maybe their nose is more

1022
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,038
intelligent than our brain

1023
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,640
for what it does you know it's like i

1024
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,839
mean dude they can smell you from miles

1025
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,200
away you ever see a dog just like

1026
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,359
sniffing catching

1027
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,360
i mean it's smelling like i don't

1028
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,719
remember the the date on it but it's

1029
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,798
like they have like millions of

1030
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,720
receptors or something where we only

1031
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,839
you know thank god we don't have their

1032
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,960
nose that would be

1033
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,959
that would make sex weird

1034
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,200
be a little too intense i think you

1035
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,519
mentioned when you were talking about

1036
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,840
woody allen separating the

1037
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,819
the art from the artist so that brings

1038
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,558
to mind vladimir putin

1039
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:26,960
[Laughter]

1040
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,879
how about that transition i don't know

1041
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,640
i'm so sorry

1042
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,799
but if you look at just powerful leaders

1043
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,360
throughout history stalin hitler

1044
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:40,398
but yeah even moderate ones like putin

1045
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:43,119
and we were talking about power

1046
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:43,599
how do you explain them you said uh that

1047
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,119
power

1048
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:50,158
reveals not corrupts

1049
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:52,398
but do you think there's some element

1050
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,840
to which power corrupted hitler power

1051
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:55,839
corrupted stalin

1052
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,558
after he gained power and the same with

1053
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,759
putin when putin gained power in 2000 do

1054
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:01,278
you think

1055
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,038
the amount of power that he was in

1056
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,880
possession was for many years

1057
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,640
do you think that corrupted him i mean

1058
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,679
we're joking about dictators get the job

1059
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,960
done

1060
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:14,080
there is some sense in certain countries

1061
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,079
where dictator is

1062
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,960
the only thing that can stabilize a

1063
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:21,200
nation

1064
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,000
the the counter argument to that for

1065
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,240
democracies

1066
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,240
is like yeah but that's a short-term

1067
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,759
solution for a long-term problem

1068
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,319
so you want to embrace chaos of

1069
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:33,519
democracy that might be violent

1070
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:35,439
there might be a lot of uh just

1071
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,558
constant changing of leadership there

1072
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,519
might be a lot of corruption in the

1073
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:41,678
short term but

1074
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,519
if you stay strong with um

1075
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,640
with the ideals of democracy then you'll

1076
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,319
be uh ultimately create something that

1077
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,640
as beautiful and stable as the united

1078
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:50,639
states

1079
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,079
the the sad thing is is i don't know if

1080
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,240
that

1081
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,759
if history tells that story it's like i

1082
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,519
said you look at greece you look at rome

1083
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,599
democracy kind of failed

1084
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,519
the majority of rome the the most

1085
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:07,439
successful empire

1086
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,398
uh that we've had um was a dictatorship

1087
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,559
for most of its

1088
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:14,480
run so um but i do believe in a republic

1089
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,599
which is sort of a limited democracy i

1090
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,440
do believe

1091
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,039
in in what we have here i believe in

1092
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,440
common law i believe

1093
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:26,079
um you know in individual rights um

1094
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,119
but yeah i think you said it i think i

1095
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,760
couldn't nobody could have said it

1096
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,000
better yeah it's

1097
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,679
it's a short-term solution you look at

1098
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
saddam hussein

1099
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,358
he kind of you know when we took took

1100
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,320
him out then there was a lot of

1101
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:37,838
infighting that

1102
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,760
that happened that he was kind of

1103
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:43,119
keeping at bay um

1104
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,720
because uh he was a strong man dictator

1105
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,280
well he's an interesting one inside to

1106
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,759
interrupt

1107
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,800
no from my understanding i'm sure people

1108
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,679
correct me but

1109
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,560
when saddam hussein first came to power

1110
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,000
he was uh he's quite progressive

1111
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,799
so like the dick the as far as i

1112
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,358
understand

1113
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,039
the signs of an evil dictator weren't

1114
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,119
exactly there

1115
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:07,199
so again there's i don't know if power

1116
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,400
revealed the power corrupted

1117
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,639
or that could have been the initial

1118
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,240
subterfuge to kind of get everybody

1119
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:13,598
you know hitler also is a you know

1120
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,319
champion of the people let's build some

1121
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,160
new roads

1122
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,160
it's what psychopaths do and that's why

1123
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,239
it's interesting to me i'm not sure if

1124
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,440
power corrupts psychopaths

1125
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,279
and now that we know that we can do

1126
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,519
these cat scans and brain stands again

1127
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,079
we know that they're born that way

1128
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:28,960
power definitely corrupts people who

1129
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,359
have

1130
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,599
the capacity uh to feel and for empathy

1131
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,920
power i'm not sure i don't think power

1132
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,559
corrupts people who were born

1133
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,079
uh psychopathic with that condition or

1134
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:43,838
sociopaths who had

1135
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,519
who you know who were closer to

1136
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:48,078
psychopath and then had some traumatic

1137
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:51,440
life you know i just think um you know

1138
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,280
the best way to get away with whatever

1139
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,559
nefarious thing you want to do to feel i

1140
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,160
guess the only thing psychopaths can

1141
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,838
feel is that excitement

1142
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,838
is to pretend to be the opposite of what

1143
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:01,440
you are yeah that's what that's what

1144
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,759
killers do that's what the worst people

1145
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,200
look at bill cosby i mean he was

1146
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,880
what better way to hide you know

1147
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,239
it's like what wokeness is now it's like

1148
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,960
i'm such a great person and

1149
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,159
you're like arya it's a great the best

1150
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,599
way to hide

1151
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,279
is to pretend to be the opposite of what

1152
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,079
you are just like ted bundy i'm i'm just

1153
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,440
an innocent

1154
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,280
helpful guy and then boom next thing you

1155
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,800
know you're getting your titbit off

1156
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,480
that's really well said it's actually

1157
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,599
kind of funny because i talk about love

1158
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,480
a lot

1159
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,240
and i think the people that kind of look

1160
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,199
at me with squinty eyes

1161
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,399
they wonder like how many bodies are in

1162
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,919
that closet

1163
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,559
you know what i mean like there's

1164
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,480
something about the duality of like

1165
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,759
we're so skeptical as a culture like if

1166
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,000
somebody's just like

1167
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,480
seems to be kind of sort of uh

1168
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,920
i don't know positive and all that kind

1169
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,719
of you know

1170
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,200
how do i put it just simple uh simple

1171
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:55,358
minded

1172
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:56,239
in the positivity they express they

1173
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:58,159
think like

1174
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,358
okay there's some demons in there yeah

1175
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,879
especially if you're a new yorker we

1176
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,078
don't trust any the nicer you are the

1177
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,440
more skeptical we are yeah

1178
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,640
i've struggled with that down here i've

1179
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,760
been like what's your angle and they're

1180
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,519
like nah dude just

1181
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,880
i wanted to show you the best tacos man

1182
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,759
and i'm like did you really what do you

1183
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
want

1184
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,640
because in new york it's like if

1185
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,039
anyone's nice to you they want something

1186
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,159
yeah

1187
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,838
and that's uh that's the the pro side to

1188
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,159
that is it makes you very street smart

1189
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:19,920
the

1190
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,598
downside to that is it makes you way too

1191
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,800
cynical yeah i

1192
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,800
definitely experienced that here in

1193
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,960
texas but people are super

1194
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,000
super nice and they're like do all this

1195
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,119
cool [ __ ] for you and

1196
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,880
you wonder what what

1197
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,160
what's the angle yeah what are we doing

1198
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,240
here you mentioned

1199
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,920
hyenas is your favorite animal i forgot

1200
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,078
to ask you

1201
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,519
what the hell were you thinking why is

1202
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,039
hyena is your favorite animal

1203
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,358
yeah it's um it's a fascinating animal

1204
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:46,880
and

1205
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:49,119
let's look at the whole animal kingdom

1206
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,599
like why is that where do you put

1207
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,720
so you like dogs love my favorite your

1208
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,160
favorite is dogs

1209
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:55,439
but they're kind of outside the animal

1210
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:56,480
kingdom because you're thinking about

1211
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,838
wolves

1212
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,800
so the animal kingdom was in nature dogs

1213
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,920
escaped nature they kind of did yeah

1214
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,880
together with humans like in a

1215
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,599
collaborative way

1216
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,039
exactly so within nature within the

1217
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,920
animal kingdom

1218
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,838
what who's uh why not lions because

1219
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,838
their lions are predictable

1220
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,279
lions are just you know they're regal

1221
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:18,000
and kind of like boring it's like the

1222
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,119
hot chick

1223
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
it's like we get it you were born the

1224
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,119
best

1225
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,480
yeah you know i like a scrappy by any

1226
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,440
means necessary

1227
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,838
intelligent and cunning uh but aren't

1228
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,679
they dishonest

1229
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:37,199
yeah and that's why i like them yes

1230
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:39,598
they're dishonest they employ chicanery

1231
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,519
they uh they're and that's just a sign

1232
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,960
of how intelligent they are and how

1233
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,358
self-reliant they are

1234
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,559
and how brutal they are um they're

1235
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:48,960
brutally honest

1236
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,920
in how much they lie yeah you know

1237
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,838
because it's just

1238
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,519
they're trying to get the job done yeah

1239
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,679
you know lions are just like

1240
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,119
they're they're too gifted everyone

1241
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:58,480
hates the [ __ ]

1242
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,160
you know if i went to school with you

1243
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,159
i'd like of course lex knows the [ __ ]

1244
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,319
answer yeah lex was born smarter than me

1245
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,920
yeah you know and you'd probably hate me

1246
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,359
because i was the kid always seeking

1247
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,519
attention and making people

1248
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:11,358
it's like that's not interesting the guy

1249
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:12,320
that claws his way to the top and those

1250
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:15,358
are hyenas

1251
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,720
they're also fascinating just by uh

1252
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,838
merely who they are i mean they're not

1253
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,078
related to any other animal they're

1254
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:23,440
more closely related to cats than they

1255
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,400
are dogs even though they look like this

1256
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,639
dog yeah

1257
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,639
they're but they're very like very

1258
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,960
tangentially related even to cats

1259
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,239
so they're their own kind of thing which

1260
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,599
is kind of mysterious i don't think they

1261
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,679
fully figured out

1262
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,880
and uh they this pseudo penis thing is

1263
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:39,679
the is the i mean

1264
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,079
it is explain the pseudo penis yeah so

1265
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,159
the

1266
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,680
it's a matriarchal society by the way so

1267
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:45,279
that's unique in and of itself

1268
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:47,118
this we're talking about an apex

1269
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,119
predator that is uh

1270
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,200
matriarchal much like uh you know the

1271
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,358
praying mantis it's very rare though

1272
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:54,719
and they are [ __ ] brutal and vicious

1273
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,559
and the women are bigger

1274
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,319
and they let their cubs fight a lot of

1275
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:59,838
fracture side and they do that because

1276
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,920
they're like hey you're weaker they

1277
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:03,440
let your brother kill you and uh the

1278
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,200
women have penises

1279
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,800
the women have pseudo penises that they

1280
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,358
give birth out of and the birth is

1281
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,079
violent

1282
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,759
but they they roll around with just huge

1283
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,640
pieces their glue guns are just [ __ ]

1284
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,640
swinging

1285
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,920
you know and the women are just run the

1286
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:18,000
show and

1287
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,840
uh it's just cool that they have these

1288
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,199
pseudo penises

1289
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,440
[Laughter]

1290
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:25,279
uh it's almost romantic to eat this they

1291
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,200
have the strongest bite force

1292
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,280
they they pulverize bone like when they

1293
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:31,679
eat an animal the animal's gone

1294
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,960
there's no bones they eat everything

1295
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,199
they can pulverize

1296
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,000
their bite is so powerful they pulverize

1297
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,239
bone and

1298
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,519
eat it so if they consume an animal it

1299
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:40,959
the animal was there and then the

1300
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,920
animal's gone there's no

1301
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,639
nothing for the vultures there to uh to

1302
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,838
to grab

1303
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,318
yeah i'm gonna have to revisit the

1304
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:49,199
hyenas because my experience with the

1305
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,679
heinous was

1306
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,799
from uh first of all history hanging as

1307
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,000
your show

1308
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,359
uh has rebranded them for me but uh the

1309
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,679
lion king

1310
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:04,078
which is uh a cartoon i guess

1311
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,919
that uh i get emotional at every time i

1312
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,318
have a i hope i probably have father

1313
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,559
issues

1314
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,079
everyone every guy probably just you

1315
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:10,400
just have feelings you're a good guy i

1316
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,240
mean

1317
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,760
everyone has that yeah yeah that one

1318
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,399
gets everybody i don't know

1319
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,640
i get i get every father-son movie like

1320
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,519
blow with johnny depp

1321
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,078
and uh ray liotta damn that's a good

1322
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,358
movie

1323
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,039
and whenever there's like um like the

1324
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,279
disappointment in the father that his

1325
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:32,159
son has become like

1326
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,079
this incredibly successful drug lord

1327
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,519
that then ends up with nothing

1328
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,119
in in in prison uh just the sadness of

1329
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,358
them communicating through letters man

1330
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,800
that gets me every time

1331
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:46,960
but but you know uh they're the hyenas

1332
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,839
are not presented that well in that um

1333
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,358
no they're usually portrayed as like uh

1334
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,799
it's really

1335
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,799
sad that they're portrayed that way and

1336
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,240
lions like lions aren't dicks

1337
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,240
lions are dicks they the the the

1338
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,000
the alpha lions will kill the cubs of

1339
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,039
another rival they do all types of dick

1340
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,400
[ __ ] yeah and um yeah it's the

1341
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,239
hyenas are more interesting like they'll

1342
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,240
just roll in like a hyena will like

1343
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:12,000
like you said the lie you know because

1344
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:13,519
when you watch the serengeti

1345
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,119
you know animals will hang out with each

1346
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,960
other they're like by water

1347
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,880
so one hyena will just kind of roll in

1348
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,679
and pretend like it's not hungry and

1349
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,640
then

1350
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,679
bang they'll use any means necessarily

1351
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,159
take an animal down

1352
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,039
like lions will just use brute strength

1353
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,039
hyenas

1354
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:30,400
use cunning and you can even go on the

1355
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,079
internet and find uh

1356
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,079
memes of this where hyenas will grab the

1357
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,680
big animal by the balls

1358
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,680
and just like we'll sneak up behind it

1359
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,838
and bite its balls and you'll watch an

1360
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,440
animal ten size ten times the size of

1361
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,838
the hyena just slowly

1362
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,920
go down it's brutal but it's [ __ ]

1363
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:48,480
hilarious

1364
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,760
so i i think that's uh i don't know if

1365
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,880
you uh followed the

1366
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:56,720
the the channel um nature's medal

1367
00:42:52,880 --> 00:43:00,559
that that one weighs heavy on me um

1368
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:03,679
with the hyenas on the balls i

1369
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,838
it's tough to to intellectualize it it's

1370
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,000
tough to think that

1371
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:09,759
the entirety of life on earth has this

1372
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,800
history of

1373
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,839
predators being violent

1374
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,318
just like just the murder that we come

1375
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,759
from

1376
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:22,318
yeah it's crazy it uh just like

1377
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,440
we're talking about meditating on death

1378
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,599
i actually i keep

1379
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,880
following and unfollowing that instagram

1380
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,440
channel because like sometimes

1381
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,440
it's too much like i can't i can't

1382
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,679
continue with the day after like seeing

1383
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,800
the brutality the honest brutality of

1384
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:36,318
that

1385
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,680
i don't know how to make sense of it

1386
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:39,039
it's important to acknowledge i think

1387
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,759
because that it's real

1388
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,559
we do come from that we are we evolve

1389
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,000
from that

1390
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:45,679
it's important we still do that we're

1391
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,199
just hidden from it you know when you go

1392
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:47,598
to the supermarket and get your slab of

1393
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,239
meat

1394
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,599
you know you're so disconnected from

1395
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:53,838
where that meat came from

1396
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,200
it came from that and often that's

1397
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,440
uglier to watch

1398
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,919
than because there's some honesty you

1399
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,960
know the the the nature channels only

1400
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,400
show

1401
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,240
uh that's why we have so much sympathy

1402
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,599
with the prey and this is where i think

1403
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:06,799
the same thing with mafia movies they

1404
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,160
don't show what the mafia really does

1405
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,440
they glorify the good parts

1406
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,279
that's why i like state of grace because

1407
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,720
it's really just shaking down old people

1408
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,240
and [ __ ] being dicks

1409
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,399
it's not driving nice cars and being

1410
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:17,759
like you know so and animal channels do

1411
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,358
the same thing they only show when the

1412
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,280
cheetah

1413
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:22,960
gets it because that's that's the

1414
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
exciting part but what most people don't

1415
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,079
know

1416
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,040
is that those predators strike out

1417
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,000
almost always

1418
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,400
a majority of the time the prey wins and

1419
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,239
so

1420
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,400
if you saw that and put in context you

1421
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,318
might not hate it as much

1422
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,599
when the predator actually gets the

1423
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,599
little fawn or whatever

1424
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,640
because it's so many fawns got away it's

1425
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,640
so hard

1426
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:43,838
to capture your prey and you know we we

1427
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:46,639
don't have the the

1428
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:48,239
they no no documentary is going to sit

1429
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:51,519
around and show you

1430
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,959
the 99 times the cheetah uh didn't catch

1431
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,559
thank you for this perspective this

1432
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,880
murder is difficult so like

1433
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,639
this is the they never talk about for

1434
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,519
people who murder

1435
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:03,199
how difficult it is like it's tough to

1436
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,000
trap somebody to convince them to come

1437
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:05,598
back to your place

1438
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,440
give it some respect put some respect on

1439
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,318
ted bundy's name yeah it's not easy to

1440
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,440
convince somebody to get in your

1441
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:12,400
volkswagen beagle

1442
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,760
and clean up and then you have to kind

1443
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,440
of plan ahead because you want to keep

1444
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,480
doing the murder mass murder you got to

1445
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,480
learn how to saw them up

1446
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,079
put them in duffel bags bury you gotta

1447
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,599
learn a dig you gotta learn how to hide

1448
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,039
you gotta learn the line i mean there's

1449
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,559
a lot that goes into it

1450
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,318
yeah that we need to put a little

1451
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,318
respect on yeah yeah and you have to

1452
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:29,599
figure out which tools work the best

1453
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:32,000
for the song and all those kinds of

1454
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,000
things um um so

1455
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,119
thank you for the perspective that's

1456
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,239
that's what i was hoping

1457
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:41,760
will bring to this table uh before yeah

1458
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,559
so you uh uh you got a little bit greek

1459
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,400
in you

1460
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:48,318
uh one of the episodes on

1461
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,480
history hyenas you talked about the

1462
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:55,519
battle of crete

1463
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:58,240
where the greeks your people in uh

1464
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,119
in 19 i guess 41 in the early stages of

1465
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:01,919
the world war

1466
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,039
ii is one of the most epic battles of

1467
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,159
the war

1468
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:08,960
in fact in 1941 in a speech made

1469
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:11,118
at the reichstag hitler paid tribute to

1470
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,519
the bravery of the greek saying

1471
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,200
it must be said for the sake of

1472
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:18,159
historical truth

1473
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,118
that amongst all our opponents only the

1474
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:21,440
greeks fought

1475
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,640
with the endless courage and defiance of

1476
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,559
death

1477
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,159
so okay what do you make of this battle

1478
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:27,039
what do you make of the spirit of the

1479
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,719
greek people

1480
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,559
this is one of the closest things to me

1481
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,439
because my mother was

1482
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:33,838
actually on the island of crete during

1483
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,240
this

1484
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,599
the first aerial invasion in history a

1485
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:39,358
lot of people don't know that so this is

1486
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,440
a very significant battle

1487
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,559
um first time there was an invasion from

1488
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,039
the sky

1489
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:46,000
um and my mother was a little girl and

1490
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:48,159
she lived through

1491
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,599
four years of uh nazi occupation there

1492
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:51,199
so my mother was a human rights lawyer

1493
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,039
and everything but she just always hated

1494
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,199
germans it's just what it is

1495
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:57,039
she hated germans and she never got over

1496
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,279
it so the most progressive open-minded

1497
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,920
woman just could not get over this

1498
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,920
um it's a monumental battle that a lot

1499
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,200
of historians in retrospect have now

1500
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,838
looked back on

1501
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,279
and said because the nazis first off you

1502
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:10,880
got to take it back to when

1503
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,240
hitler instructed mussolini because

1504
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,000
let's be honest mussolini was hitler's

1505
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,439
[ __ ] you know what i mean it was like

1506
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,519
if it were you know if it was fantasy

1507
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,200
island hitler was the [ __ ]

1508
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,199
and the and mussolini was boss to play

1509
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:24,639
mussolini ever say no to hitler

1510
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:27,519
or even maybe it's always like yes yes

1511
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:27,920
yes we will do it and uh it's like it

1512
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,119
takes

1513
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,318
you have to take greece and so um

1514
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,079
yeah so italy being

1515
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,599
much bigger than greek greece is a tiny

1516
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,880
country nine ten million

1517
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:44,160
so italy invaded greece um

1518
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,000
you know um and aki day is a big

1519
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:47,679
it's a big holiday for greeks and this

1520
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
speaks to the spirit

1521
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:50,879
greeks in fight until we have a common

1522
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,838
enemy

1523
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,760
and then we unite you see it throughout

1524
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:58,480
history sparta and athens

1525
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,760
you see it in greek families where the

1526
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,880
brothers will fight but then as soon as

1527
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,359
we have a common enemy

1528
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,519
we unite and maybe it's an overactive

1529
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:06,239
brain we think too much our tradition's

1530
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,599
philosophy

1531
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:08,719
and we overthink things and we fight

1532
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:10,559
with each other and take things

1533
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,759
personally we're all so passionate

1534
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,119
but when italy said hey we're gonna move

1535
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,760
troops through

1536
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,200
you know uh greek said aki which means

1537
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,640
no and that was um

1538
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,558
and then italy attacked and uh

1539
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,239
we beat the [ __ ] out of them a much

1540
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,319
bigger country

1541
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,838
much uh more well-equipped country

1542
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:31,679
greece beat the [ __ ] of them kicked them

1543
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,759
back into albania actually

1544
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,519
not only repelled them actually like

1545
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,319
conquered some ground in albania and

1546
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:38,639
pushed them back

1547
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:40,800
and then hitler was like [ __ ] you know i

1548
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,558
was planning my march to russia

1549
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,920
uh but i have to go down because he

1550
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,800
basically said to mussolini like you

1551
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,159
know you

1552
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,839
basically [ __ ] laughed i'm like afraid

1553
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,279
i'm like i gotta do this myself because

1554
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:51,039
you're such a [ __ ] [ __ ]

1555
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,720
so then the nazis invaded greece

1556
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,800
obviously they took the mainland with

1557
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,399
fight and shot out the greeks never give

1558
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,920
credit to the british in new zealand and

1559
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,000
australian troops that were there

1560
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,039
you know they were a large part of this

1561
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,679
the majority of it

1562
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,239
but the greeks fight dude civilians i

1563
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:06,639
mean

1564
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:08,318
they fought you know the ottomans were

1565
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:09,759
there 400 years you go to greece now

1566
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:13,039
there's no evidence there's

1567
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,359
virtually no evidence of them ever being

1568
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:15,279
there

1569
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:17,119
that's the greek spirit kick them out

1570
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,040
and we kicked out hummus too

1571
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,800
so it's like your culture's gone you're

1572
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,558
gone because greeks are

1573
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,800
uh it's philotimo it's called philiptim

1574
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,720
and it's a real thing filoptimo is uh

1575
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,400
there's very little trans you can't

1576
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:31,519
translate it but it's kind of like

1577
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,838
honor loyalty friendship

1578
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,519
uh altruism it's uh it's you can't

1579
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,358
define it but greeks know it and we're

1580
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,239
taught it from our from our uh

1581
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:41,199
families it's a vibe and it's a greek

1582
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,118
cultural thing

1583
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,799
and we're an old culture and philotimo

1584
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:48,400
is what it's called

1585
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:50,800
and it's it's love it's passion

1586
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,639
and it comes out and it comes out and so

1587
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,519
um so hitler had to postpone his

1588
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:57,199
invasion

1589
00:49:53,519 --> 00:50:00,318
of um of russia went down

1590
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,879
the island of crete took 10 days to

1591
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:02,719
conquer

1592
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,200
it's an island to put that in

1593
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:07,439
perspective the country of

1594
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,558
france fell in three or four days i

1595
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,920
can't even remember because they [ __ ]

1596
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,920
just rolled over so what is it

1597
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,519
what does a couple hours matter when

1598
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,159
you're that much of a [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah

1599
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:15,759
okay

1600
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,199
what is a couple hours 12 hour [ __ ]

1601
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,520
three or four days

1602
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:20,239
the island of crete yeah took the

1603
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,199
germans

1604
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,719
10 days to conquer and because of that

1605
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:28,000
and because of the greek resistance

1606
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:30,239
hitler had to postpone his invasion

1607
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,440
of russia to win her and of course that

1608
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,358
was you know

1609
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,639
that was his downfall just as it was

1610
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:36,880
napoleons and

1611
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:38,318
never dude never try to invade russia

1612
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,800
they got millions of people to throw at

1613
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:40,159
death

1614
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,079
every time you read about russians in

1615
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:43,598
history books like and a million died

1616
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:45,440
i mean it's like you just guys throw

1617
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,119
millions of people at the problem

1618
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,720
and don't [ __ ] with that russian winner

1619
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,760
and don't [ __ ] with russian people dude

1620
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:51,439
they're tough

1621
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,800
people in new york know that you don't

1622
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,599
go to [ __ ] sheeps that man start

1623
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,359
talking [ __ ]

1624
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,960
you'll end up in a [ __ ] car trunk and

1625
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:58,159
they'll brutally murder you i do not

1626
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,039
[ __ ] with russians

1627
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:01,759
amen and then there's i mean there's a

1628
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:03,519
lot of people

1629
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,359
a lot of historians argue that that

1630
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:06,960
battle was because of the

1631
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:08,000
russian winter because of delaying the

1632
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,159
russian invasion but also

1633
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,800
psychologically delaying the invasion

1634
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,399
it was the first time i think it was the

1635
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,760
first time the germans

1636
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,880
failed not or didn't succeed like they

1637
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,079
wanted to

1638
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,000
early in the war which is a little like

1639
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,400
psychologically the impact of that i

1640
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,639
think is immeasurable

1641
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,519
and also a lot of people argue from a

1642
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,719
military

1643
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,079
strategy perspective that the

1644
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:35,838
just like you said it was an aerial

1645
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:39,039
attack and that

1646
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:40,719
hitler didn't think that that that

1647
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:42,079
kind of attack would then be useful for

1648
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,399
the rest of the war

1649
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,240
so that's that's a really part where

1650
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,240
whereas it might have been very

1651
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,239
useful so it's uh it's really

1652
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,318
interesting how these little battles can

1653
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:55,039
steer the directions of war of course

1654
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:57,119
me growing up in the soviet union we

1655
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:58,800
didn't hear much about this battle

1656
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,800
uh just like you said millions of

1657
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,160
soviets died all those

1658
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,079
people in history that you read about

1659
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:04,639
dying those are all civilians but i mean

1660
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,318
not all

1661
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,318
but a very large number of them are

1662
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:10,800
civilians and their stories

1663
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:13,358
obviously that's the rooted the

1664
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,200
literature the poetry the music

1665
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,920
just the way people talk the way they

1666
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:20,078
drink vodka the way they love

1667
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,159
the way they hate the way they fear

1668
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,440
that's all like rooted in world war

1669
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:28,480
ii and world war one and so

1670
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,760
but we never kind of think about

1671
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,280
europe and we certainly grown up didn't

1672
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,000
think about their role in the united

1673
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,359
states

1674
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,079
all this there's plenty of stories of

1675
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:40,799
heroism in uh in the soviet union

1676
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,240
enough enough for many lifetimes so but

1677
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,839
it was fascinating to read from a greek

1678
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:46,078
perspective

1679
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:47,358
um because i you know i don't have many

1680
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,720
greek friends

1681
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:53,199
i'm hoping to change that uh

1682
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:54,799
this is the beginning of a love affair

1683
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,199
of your people

1684
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,000
uh yeah likewise the americans don't

1685
00:52:57,199 --> 00:52:59,598
hear about the

1686
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,920
soviet contribution to the end of world

1687
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,760
war ii because obviously we became

1688
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,119
you know enemies after that because of

1689
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,119
the two systems but

1690
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,559
yeah without the russians with world war

1691
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,760
ii wouldn't have been one either

1692
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,680
yeah the stories are written by the

1693
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,480
victors that's really interesting i i

1694
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:15,440
just looking at the at history you

1695
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,199
wonder what's

1696
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,720
missing i'll tell you what's missing

1697
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:21,039
that i know for a fact

1698
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,480
because my dad told my dad uh told me

1699
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:23,759
combat's hell and he would tell me the

1700
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,039
reality of what it's really like guys

1701
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,839
pissing themselves calling for their

1702
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:27,759
mother

1703
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:28,960
the the fog of war obviously fracture

1704
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,079
side happens all the time it's

1705
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,760
pandemonium

1706
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,440
i mean there's skill involved but i mean

1707
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,440
there's no like it's a lot of that it's

1708
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,159
just luck my dad said he my dad won

1709
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,639
three

1710
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,598
he got you know medals brea purple

1711
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:40,879
hearts all that [ __ ]

1712
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,079
and he said the reason was because he

1713
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,440
can't he always said there's another

1714
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,720
thing he told me you can't pin a medal

1715
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,318
on a dead guy

1716
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,000
so it's like those are the guys who

1717
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:48,719
deserve it but you can't pin a medal you

1718
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,440
can't

1719
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,318
do the pomp and with and um i'll tell

1720
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,039
you one thing

1721
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,800
is that uh it is written by the victors

1722
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:58,639
and all these leaders they say were in

1723
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,559
the front were not in the front

1724
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:02,480
we're not whenever the history books say

1725
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,000
he led his troops into battle it's like

1726
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,240
did he really

1727
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,760
did he then how did he live because they

1728
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:08,078
put like kids in the front you know it's

1729
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,760
like

1730
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,599
nobody limps back from the front with

1731
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,640
like a injury you know that's

1732
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,599
that's army pr you know whenever you

1733
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:18,558
read

1734
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,880
uh you know if uh 27 soldiers died 14

1735
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,920
were

1736
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,240
injured the word injured is pr that's

1737
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,880
like

1738
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:25,679
injured was he did he sprain his ankle

1739
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,079
did he need

1740
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,199
did he get carried off the court or you

1741
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,359
know he was maimed

1742
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,558
i mean he was like his leg was blown up

1743
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:34,799
you know it's like

1744
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,920
so uh i think that you know alexander

1745
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,839
the great was just kind of in the back

1746
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,280
on his horse and just kind of he had his

1747
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:40,798
eunuch bloom a few times and he was like

1748
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,160
is it bad up there

1749
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:43,920
and then like after that he was like

1750
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,118
okay with my scribe give me my scribe

1751
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,240
okay when you write this down can you

1752
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,798
put me in the front

1753
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:49,919
yeah and i was just making me a big hero

1754
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:51,838
and i was in there and then

1755
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,960
you know he just blew his you know he

1756
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:53,920
had sex with his eunuch and rode off

1757
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,440
into the sunset

1758
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,039
because there's just no way you survived

1759
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,358
in the front especially warfare back

1760
00:54:57,039 --> 00:54:59,519
then

1761
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:00,400
i mean it's like brutal then again you

1762
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:04,239
have like uh

1763
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,200
genghis khan the sense i got that he was

1764
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:07,598
a little bit

1765
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,558
up on the front at least the first yeah

1766
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,079
or is that also

1767
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,760
is he a little bit alex give me my

1768
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,680
scribe yeah it's all lore i mean you

1769
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,760
ever play the game of telephone

1770
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:17,838
you know it's like you know there's no

1771
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,319
video cameras back then so [ __ ] just get

1772
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:21,519
turns into myth you know and uh there's

1773
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:23,440
no way he was in the front

1774
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:25,199
there's no way he wouldn't have lived

1775
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,200
you know he was probably

1776
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:28,960
good on horseback because those those

1777
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,159
dudes were good on horseback but

1778
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,280
it was like game of thrones back then

1779
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:32,000
you had all these different people and

1780
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,400
they kind of

1781
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,400
yeah the the the mongols were wild dude

1782
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,000
they are actually said like um

1783
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,519
they started like they were more

1784
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,119
adaptable to the horse because they were

1785
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,039
so good on horseback that

1786
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,960
kids started to be born like kind of bow

1787
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,519
legged like to fit the horse it's wild

1788
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,440
and they would

1789
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:48,880
stretch their heads and [ __ ] like that

1790
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,559
they'd wrap them and stretch their head

1791
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,280
so they find like mongol

1792
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,760
skulls and they look like cone heads and

1793
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,319
they were

1794
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,760
brutal and vicious then they would

1795
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,480
maraude and rape and

1796
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,839
all the fun stuff that you know when you

1797
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,280
know when you visit other places back

1798
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:05,039
then there's no tchotchke stops and

1799
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,920
souvenir shops what you do is you take

1800
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:07,759
women

1801
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,440
and those are the tokens you know you

1802
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,960
burn a few huts

1803
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,880
different tourism was different back

1804
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,079
then

1805
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,760
yeah that's another difficult thing just

1806
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,760
we're talking about nature and predators

1807
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,440
to think about

1808
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,040
the long stretch of history where it was

1809
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,960
just murder yeah

1810
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,719
and we made so much progress i guess

1811
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,199
in the past couple of centuries the

1812
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:32,879
united states is a shiny example of that

1813
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:34,639
but do you think also that it's that

1814
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,480
effect that we would

1815
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:37,759
a lot of good things had to happen too

1816
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,760
or else we wouldn't be here

1817
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,119
so do we just focus isn't it like a car

1818
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,559
crash effect

1819
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,838
that like we're you know and the the

1820
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,280
rubber neck who everyone pulls over to

1821
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:46,480
see a car crasher are we just only

1822
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,440
focusing on the negative things of

1823
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,480
history because they're just more

1824
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,838
exciting to us

1825
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,960
like it's just not it's boring to be

1826
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:53,039
like yeah and then there was a bunch of

1827
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:56,880
villagers and they ate every day and

1828
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:59,358
danced and loved yeah i wonder

1829
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,400
i wonder how different those people were

1830
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:03,519
you know like

1831
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,200
they might have had the same exact loves

1832
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:08,079
and fears and

1833
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:09,679
like they were they perhaps had the same

1834
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,318
kind of brilliant ideas in their head

1835
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:13,919
if not more brilliant and we kind of

1836
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:15,199
think about like this moment in history

1837
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,000
is like the most special

1838
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,439
moment like we're doing the coolest [ __ ]

1839
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,358
but we're doing the most amazing

1840
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,039
building the most amazing things but

1841
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,558
maybe they were building amazing things

1842
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,719
in their different way with like less

1843
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,559
technological but in the space of ideas

1844
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:30,159
in the space of just

1845
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:31,760
all the different the camaraderie and

1846
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:34,558
the space of um

1847
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,440
like concepts uh mathematics all those

1848
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,480
kinds of things

1849
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,079
yeah i mean greece you look at the

1850
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,760
architecture it still stands up i mean

1851
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:42,318
all the government played still

1852
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,520
arguably i mean as far as objective

1853
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:44,880
beauty it's hard to argue that

1854
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:46,719
greco-roman

1855
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,880
it's just something about it with the

1856
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:52,159
with the columns it's just

1857
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:54,160
it's powerful it's i don't know even ayn

1858
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:57,420
rand would probably appreciate it

1859
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:59,039
she doesn't no no no

1860
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,599
[Laughter]

1861
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:03,358
so in your history hyenas that

1862
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,960
unfortunately has come to an end yeah

1863
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,199
we're talking about empires coming to an

1864
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:11,119
end all empires fall yeah

1865
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:14,159
um that one um oh it may rise again

1866
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:16,880
empires might rise who knows who knows i

1867
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,920
i'm obviously a fan so i hope it does

1868
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,838
rise again

1869
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,240
but you've uh seemed to develop your own

1870
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:26,318
language

1871
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:29,919
can you uh you know it's what it is

1872
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:31,519
what is what is that what the hell um

1873
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,039
is this some kind of medical condition

1874
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:35,519
or can you can you

1875
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:37,279
explain like the linguistic essentials

1876
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:39,358
that uh

1877
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,480
catch us up to the linguistic essentials

1878
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:42,880
that people need to know

1879
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,559
to understand the way you speak you ever

1880
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,680
you know leopold and loeb you know the

1881
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,839
story of those two

1882
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:49,358
uh they murdered that kid and they had

1883
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:50,798
this weird relationship

1884
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:53,279
uh anyway it's an interesting thing to

1885
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:54,880
google leopold and love these two guys

1886
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,240
who ended up murdering a kid because

1887
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,400
they developed their own language with

1888
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:58,879
each other and uh this whole reality and

1889
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,160
this

1890
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,358
weird thing and they wanted to know what

1891
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:03,519
it's like to murder a kid in a murder

1892
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:06,719
kid it's a famous story in american

1893
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:08,719
lore and history whatever famous case

1894
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:10,318
um but this phenomenon yeah me and chris

1895
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:12,000
got together

1896
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:13,440
it wasn't as dark as leopold though we

1897
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,559
didn't murder a kid but

1898
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,559
we murdered a podcast

1899
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,039
or at least stab it a few times yeah

1900
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:23,439
it's um it was something in

1901
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:25,519
the organic chemistry of me and chris

1902
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,920
that i think we'll both

1903
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,358
end up appreciating even probably more

1904
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,400
than we do now

1905
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,039
that uh it's mysterious i gotta be

1906
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,240
honest with you

1907
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:38,880
it's um it was the thing that

1908
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,759
it wasn't conscious uh wasn't

1909
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,358
intentional

1910
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,440
it was something that happened in the

1911
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:45,679
music of our energies

1912
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,519
yeah that just went it's fascinating

1913
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:49,598
like when you hear someone sing or

1914
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,358
when a jazz band hits a rhythm or even

1915
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,359
when i'm on stage and i just

1916
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:54,639
catch a rhythm it's like dude i didn't

1917
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:56,719
make a choice there i don't know what

1918
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:59,440
that is i don't know how to explain it

1919
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:00,399
but it comes from somewhere else and uh

1920
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,119
i don't know what it is

1921
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,000
it's beyond my comprehension but with

1922
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,240
chris

1923
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,838
uh there was this magical chemistry that

1924
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:08,719
uh you know i have chemistry with a lot

1925
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:10,798
of people

1926
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:12,798
and uh it can be funny and i feel zero

1927
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:14,159
chemistry here this is great

1928
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:16,000
yeah it's a little bit more intelligent

1929
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:18,798
than what me and chris did

1930
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,679
uh but you know uh me and chris uh i

1931
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:23,119
think we connected

1932
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:23,759
in on the funny bone like i he i found

1933
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,640
him so

1934
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,599
funny and we found the same things funny

1935
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,078
and from that

1936
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,318
these organic expressions came from the

1937
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,318
some part of our brains

1938
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:36,239
that was created from this chemistry and

1939
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:37,679
yeah we just developed this in

1940
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:39,279
language in this cult following and

1941
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,279
people were really upset

1942
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,640
when we ended but it was the right thing

1943
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,079
to end because

1944
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,920
like all things that end it was kind of

1945
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,798
done a few episodes even before we

1946
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,720
finished and

1947
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:50,239
i think we pulled the plug before it

1948
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:53,039
started rolling downhill

1949
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:54,479
like all uh you know like all great

1950
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:55,039
flings you know there's a long

1951
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,960
relationship

1952
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:58,960
long marriages are boring and

1953
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,000
comfortable

1954
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:05,119
the one you really like [ __ ] always

1955
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,280
ends abruptly and sadly and uh but you

1956
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:10,160
always look back and you jerk off to it

1957
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,839
and uh but so you guys made love we made

1958
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:12,639
yeah so it's like it was like a hot

1959
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:15,279
fling

1960
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:15,759
with me and him and it was intense and

1961
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,000
we

1962
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,960
burned the candle at both ends and it

1963
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,318
was me i think

1964
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,480
that podcast was meant to be three years

1965
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:25,358
and um maybe people will go back and

1966
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,199
appreciate it and

1967
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:28,880
listen to it over and over again and i

1968
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:29,519
think the new things we do people will

1969
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,519
love i

1970
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,639
i'm doing long days now that podcast and

1971
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:34,639
people seem to enjoy it i'm really

1972
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:35,118
enjoying the long days yeah yeah on

1973
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:38,879
youtube

1974
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:40,720
i just found myself just like staring it

1975
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,318
at you uh ranting for same with tim

1976
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,159
dillon i really enjoyed the whatever

1977
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:46,000
those rants are the genius of just

1978
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,440
one thing after the other but definitely

1979
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,079
the chemistry

1980
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,679
almost as a study i remember the reason

1981
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,440
i first started listening to it i was

1982
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:56,000
trying to get

1983
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,358
an a perspective on certain historical

1984
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,358
moments

1985
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:01,279
like it was interesting i tuned in to

1986
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,519
learn history

1987
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,720
yeah i came for the history and like

1988
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:08,559
stayed for the

1989
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:11,118
the chaos and crack open and clean out

1990
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:12,160
and yeah this it was almost i listened

1991
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:15,358
to rogan

1992
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:17,358
like this sometimes i'll i'll re-listen

1993
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:20,960
to an episode

1994
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:23,519
uh to to try to understand why was this

1995
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,119
so fun to listen to

1996
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:26,880
it's it's almost like trying to analyze

1997
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,640
humor or something like that but

1998
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,119
it's nice from from a conversational

1999
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:32,159
perspective like why was this so easy to

2000
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,240
listen to

2001
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:36,558
and then and uh with history hyena is

2002
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:39,759
like why is the chemistry so good

2003
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:41,519
it's it's so it's weird it's weird

2004
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,960
uh because there's not many podcasts

2005
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:44,639
like i don't know any

2006
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,480
with chemistry like that yeah it's

2007
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:50,159
interesting and it's kind of sad

2008
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:53,119
that uh that that uh the the fling

2009
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:53,679
or the prostitute in vegas has to end

2010
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,880
you know

2011
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:56,639
like that but that's what makes it

2012
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,519
special it's the bokowski thing with the

2013
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,519
fog

2014
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:00,719
the the british office one of my

2015
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:03,038
favorite shows was

2016
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:04,639
was that it ended very quick you know

2017
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:05,680
it's only a couple seasons or something

2018
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:07,838
like that

2019
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:09,440
and that was tragic but that took guts

2020
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:10,960
to just end it

2021
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,358
given all the money you could have made

2022
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,358
given all the you just end it and that's

2023
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:16,480
what makes it like truly special

2024
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:18,719
yeah and i'll tell you man i'll just

2025
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,199
emphasize it because i marvel at it too

2026
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:22,000
um because as a guy who tries to always

2027
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:24,960
figure out

2028
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,480
uh what the causes of things i gotta be

2029
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,318
honest man looking back on that even

2030
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,240
with retrospective wisdom you know that

2031
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,838
2020 hindsight we've been done a couple

2032
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,479
months now

2033
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:35,038
it's um it's something that i can't

2034
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,960
explain

2035
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,720
yeah it's something that i don't know

2036
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,079
how you quantify it i don't know how you

2037
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:42,558
describe it

2038
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,440
it's it's musical it's really kind of

2039
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,319
rhythmic

2040
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,119
so maybe uh maybe like a netflix show

2041
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:48,798
about history

2042
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,480
that's that's another that that's in the

2043
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:52,639
future

2044
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,599
with the two of you yeah who knows you

2045
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:55,920
guys will meet like

2046
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,880
uh with that the way you meet with the

2047
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,480
fling like

2048
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:03,440
a decade from now at a diner and uh

2049
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,880
you're both way fatter and uglier and

2050
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,798
then you just reminisce

2051
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,480
over some cigarettes and coffee that

2052
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:10,559
could be yeah it could be

2053
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,400
yeah but it's definitely a classic

2054
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,640
podcast that people can go back and

2055
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,559
appreciate it's fast-paced and

2056
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:18,239
it was unique what was it like to

2057
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,160
research for uh

2058
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:22,798
i mean it was really scholarly the the

2059
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,960
depth of research that you performed

2060
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:26,159
it sometimes felt like you almost read

2061
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,039
an entire wikipedia

2062
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:29,038
article beforehand

2063
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:36,160
or like exactly true uh we were we were

2064
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:38,000
one fan we attracted such

2065
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:39,519
funny people to that podcast and the

2066
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,599
fans were so funny

2067
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:43,119
and one fan called us nicknamed those

2068
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,119
wikipedia [ __ ]

2069
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,960
and so it just stuck yeah we just would

2070
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,000
read wikipedia i would do a lot more

2071
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,559
research to chris

2072
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,159
yeah and uh so i would actually uh you

2073
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:53,200
know once in a while he'd get into it

2074
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:56,159
too but

2075
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:56,480
for very interesting episodes i got some

2076
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,078
some

2077
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,838
some subject matter would just pull me

2078
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:01,039
in like bernie madoff just to think of

2079
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:02,318
one that was recent it was one of our

2080
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,200
last ones and i think one of our better

2081
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:05,920
episodes

2082
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:07,358
and i'm glad that uh it kind of ended

2083
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,519
after that because it was rare that

2084
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:11,440
i think we started to slip a little bit

2085
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:13,280
um i got fascinated and i got i did a

2086
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,960
lot of research for bernie madoff but

2087
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,240
usually yeah we'd pull up wikipedia and

2088
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,240
we'd have fun we were sort of the

2089
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:19,519
antithesis of dan carlin i mean you went

2090
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:22,639
to dan carlin

2091
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:23,440
for uh accuracy and thoughtfulness and

2092
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:26,159
you went to us

2093
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,599
for it was a hang with history that's

2094
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:28,558
why history hyenas was such an

2095
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,480
appropriate name

2096
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,039
because it was it was a little bit of

2097
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,280
his some some episodes were more hyena

2098
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,559
more wild and a little history and some

2099
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,400
were a little more dense like the battle

2100
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,680
of crete and less hyena so

2101
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,200
you were you were always going to get

2102
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:42,798
both you're either going to get a

2103
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:44,798
majority of one or the other yeah and

2104
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:47,119
dan carl is the lion i guess

2105
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:48,400
yeah and uh you guys look pretty

2106
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,599
predictably good

2107
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,358
uh i mean what what are your thoughts

2108
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,960
about i mean he's a storyteller too he

2109
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:57,119
gets a lot of criticism for the

2110
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,880
from the historians quote-unquote that's

2111
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:01,599
why he likes to knock

2112
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,358
he keeps saying he's not a historian but

2113
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,039
what's your um

2114
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:06,960
what are your thoughts about uh hardcore

2115
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,520
history with dan carlin like was he an

2116
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:13,358
inspiration to

2117
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:15,838
the podcast you were doing uh or

2118
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:17,598
or like an account like uh almost like

2119
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:19,599
reverse psychology inspiration

2120
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:21,920
where you wanted to do some kind of

2121
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:25,920
opposing type of podcast in history

2122
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:28,798
or was history always just like a

2123
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,760
a launching pad to just talk [ __ ] about

2124
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,000
human nature

2125
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,520
more the latter i wasn't even aware of

2126
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,960
his podcast when we started oh

2127
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:37,119
interesting yeah and uh

2128
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,480
so we it was just very organic again

2129
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,559
like the chemistry me and chris

2130
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,599
became very good friends we started the

2131
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:43,039
podcast

2132
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,280
first we did a web series called bay

2133
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:46,799
ridge boys which has its sort of little

2134
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,760
cult following he did like five episodes

2135
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,480
and ended it

2136
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,319
um and then we did the podcast and uh

2137
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,838
hyenas were my favorite animal

2138
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:55,358
and i talked about them passionately and

2139
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:57,038
i told chris about them and then he

2140
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:58,798
started appreciating him and we both

2141
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,400
loved history i majored in history it's

2142
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:02,079
one of the things i love i go to museums

2143
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,200
all the time i go to his i do history

2144
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,359
tours so does he

2145
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:07,038
and so it was just sort of a natural

2146
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:09,440
let's do a history podcast and it gave

2147
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,359
us something to talk about each episode

2148
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,480
to sort of lean our you know hang our

2149
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:15,038
hats on and

2150
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,400
riff off of so it had nothing to do with

2151
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:17,200
dan's what i think about dan's i think

2152
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,240
it's great

2153
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:22,719
i think even if he's inaccurate uh in

2154
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:24,479
the opinions of the historical community

2155
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,558
it starts conversations

2156
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,318
which is good it's like this thing where

2157
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,440
people go oh it's dangerous rhetoric

2158
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:31,119
it's like no

2159
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,880
rhetoric only becomes dangerous when

2160
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:35,280
education fails what's going on in

2161
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,599
america is education has failed

2162
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,200
so if you call someone online dangerous

2163
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,960
it's not him that's dangerous

2164
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:42,318
it's the [ __ ] stupid people that's

2165
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,159
dangerous and it's the fault of this

2166
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:46,558
country we didn't listen to aristotle

2167
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:47,759
the future of a civilization depends on

2168
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,720
public education

2169
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,880
yeah and we failed education has failed

2170
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:55,679
kids are kids are not interested in [ __ ]

2171
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:57,519
and um so in some sense those uh like

2172
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,679
dan's podcasts and

2173
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:01,838
podcasts can be incredibly educational

2174
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:05,199
that's he's uh

2175
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:07,759
the storytelling that pulls you in

2176
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:09,598
ultimately leads to you internalizing

2177
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,160
these stories and like remembering them

2178
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,359
and and

2179
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:12,798
thinking through them and all those

2180
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:14,078
kinds of things that is much more

2181
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:16,560
powerful than any

2182
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:18,560
book on history that's accurate i think

2183
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,920
often it inspires you to go learn more

2184
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,839
so it's like i know we did that i mean

2185
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,359
you know i people would go hey i went

2186
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:24,880
and learned about this because they knew

2187
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,440
with us there was no pretense which was

2188
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,679
great

2189
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:29,198
that we had no standard so it's like

2190
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,239
nobody came to us for historical

2191
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:32,639
accuracy

2192
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,519
but i was kind of turned on by the fact

2193
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,679
that it

2194
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,679
inspired people to go learn about this

2195
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:39,000
stuff or to at least know like battle of

2196
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:42,399
crete like you said a very

2197
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,640
underappreciated battle um even winston

2198
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:46,000
churchill said uh from here on we will

2199
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,319
no longer say

2200
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,880
that uh greeks fight like heroes but

2201
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:53,679
heroes fight like greeks i mean it was a

2202
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,719
monumental battle and um you know not

2203
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:57,440
talked about enough and

2204
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:58,560
i i i our podcast would inspire people

2205
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:01,439
to go actually learn

2206
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,560
more to go listen to dan carlin or to go

2207
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:05,198
pick up a book or

2208
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:07,679
to do research on their own and so i

2209
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:09,439
think podcasts dan carlin's obviously

2210
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,880
much more accurate than us but

2211
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:12,479
it's good that people are going to

2212
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,520
podcast like yours and

2213
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:17,678
to learn [ __ ] joe was is really like

2214
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,040
the progenitor of that i mean you know

2215
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:22,158
having intellectuals on

2216
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:23,759
and getting the public interested with

2217
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:27,198
this new medium

2218
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:28,798
um in in people who are intelligent

2219
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:31,439
it's nice because you know what the

2220
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:34,560
mainstream press pushes out is horseshit

2221
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,358
gorgeous horseshit it's got a beautiful

2222
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,239
veneer

2223
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,838
but no substance and so this this is a

2224
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:41,838
nice pushback

2225
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:43,838
yeah the authenticity of joe's show i

2226
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:45,838
mean i'm through i started listening

2227
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,679
from the very beginning you know doing

2228
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:50,640
my in grad school

2229
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,838
you know i like a technical person and

2230
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,679
he just pulled me in

2231
01:09:51,838 --> 01:09:54,880
and made me curious to learn about all

2232
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:58,480
kinds of things

2233
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,199
and use my own critical reasoning skills

2234
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:00,879
on some of the

2235
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:03,279
[ __ ] guests he's had and some of the

2236
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:06,159
most inspiring guests he's had

2237
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:08,000
so i'll teach you to think can you uh i

2238
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:09,039
don't know much about bernie madoff as a

2239
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,399
small tangent

2240
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:13,198
can you tell me who the hell is bernie

2241
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:16,639
man oh birdie madoff is the goat

2242
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:18,639
the greatest thief of all time dude um

2243
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,679
hedge fund guy ran a hedge fund and uh

2244
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,119
pulled uh

2245
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,679
stole the most money in the history of

2246
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:26,479
america i mean a con artist

2247
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:27,679
and um he just people obviously he's

2248
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:29,359
become

2249
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:31,279
he's a household name because of the

2250
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:33,839
magnitude of his crime but you got to

2251
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:35,439
appreciate again you got to appreciate

2252
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,880
what went into this and how long he was

2253
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:40,079
able to pull it off

2254
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,600
uh by tricking the smartest and richest

2255
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:45,119
people in the world

2256
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,840
and a brilliant scam the con man uh con

2257
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:48,158
man is

2258
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,199
short for confidence man and it it came

2259
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:51,279
from

2260
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:53,119
yeah con men basically they they exude

2261
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:56,079
confidence and they trick people

2262
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:56,479
by playing on their ego and blind spots

2263
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:58,158
and

2264
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,079
uh the word comes from a guy i can't

2265
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:01,279
remember where but what he used to do i

2266
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:02,880
can't remember the guy's name and you

2267
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:04,719
know whatever you can google it

2268
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,000
con man but it's very interesting the

2269
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,279
the first con man that

2270
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,800
is on record what he would do it he

2271
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:10,399
would go to very rich people and he'd be

2272
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,880
very well dressed

2273
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:14,479
right and he'd go he's i bet you you

2274
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:17,199
don't have the confidence

2275
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:18,319
to give me your watch and he would plan

2276
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:19,519
the egos these very

2277
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:21,359
powerful and rich people and they would

2278
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,120
give him the watch for some reason some

2279
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:24,158
sort of reverse psychology [ __ ]

2280
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:26,319
and he'd take the watch and he would

2281
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:27,519
just steal it

2282
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:28,399
because basically saying like i don't

2283
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,600
have the compass give him the watch

2284
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:30,559
because you don't i don't know you don't

2285
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,480
think i'm gonna give it back and he

2286
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,480
would just take it yeah so bernie madoff

2287
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:35,279
was a very sophistic sophisticated con

2288
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:36,559
man

2289
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:37,840
and again we were talking about people

2290
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,719
pretending to be the opposite of what

2291
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,079
they are

2292
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:45,198
bernie hid his uh

2293
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:46,559
thievery in how available he was to his

2294
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:48,079
clients how he would show up at every

2295
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,760
bar mitzvah every birthday he was always

2296
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:52,719
available for their phone calls

2297
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,880
and he uh played on their egos he made

2298
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:55,359
it so people were wanted to invest in

2299
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,119
him

2300
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:58,960
like they were competing he made it very

2301
01:11:57,119 --> 01:11:59,679
exclusive he he wouldn't just take

2302
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,960
anyone

2303
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:03,520
and there was a method behind that

2304
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,719
madness because he wanted the whales

2305
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,159
that wouldn't notice that he was he was

2306
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,600
had this pyramid scene going and so what

2307
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:10,319
he would do is he would just rob from

2308
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,159
the richer

2309
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:13,439
and he'd just get it was like he'd pay

2310
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:13,839
back the richer with the guy who was a

2311
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:16,559
little

2312
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,800
and it was a pyramid scheme and um he

2313
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:21,440
was able to do it for so long and steal

2314
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,279
so much money and he would win people

2315
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:24,960
over with the scheme because with that

2316
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:25,679
scheme he was the only guy who could

2317
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,359
provide

2318
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:30,158
who could guarantee like a one percent

2319
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:32,719
return even during times of recession

2320
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:34,639
and because he was such a good con man

2321
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,439
he hijacked people's reasoning with his

2322
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,800
charm

2323
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:38,479
and that's what con artists do that's

2324
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:39,199
what psychopaths do they're so [ __ ]

2325
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,959
charming

2326
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:42,399
they get in that volkswagen beetle

2327
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,760
because if they use their reasoning for

2328
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:45,759
one second they'd go hey

2329
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,520
nobody can provide one percent returns

2330
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,880
during recessions how the [ __ ] is this

2331
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,360
guy doing it i'll tell you how he's

2332
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,039
doing it

2333
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:52,719
he's stealing from another guy to pay

2334
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:54,880
you you [ __ ] idiot

2335
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,000
so charisma is essential to you maybe

2336
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,840
you can

2337
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,600
help explain something to me something i

2338
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,119
have been

2339
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,400
affected by way too loud for your

2340
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:04,079
listeners there's gonna be comments like

2341
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:06,960
tell this guy to calm down i'm sorry i'm

2342
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:10,640
greek a positive

2343
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:12,480
yeah no that's beautiful i love it

2344
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:14,719
something that i have been thinking

2345
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:16,399
about and have encountered indirectly is

2346
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:19,760
jeffrey epstein

2347
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:21,679
and i have a sense because of mit

2348
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,400
because of all the other

2349
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:26,239
people that have been uh touched the

2350
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:26,799
wrong term by jeffrey epstein in the

2351
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:29,198
sense that

2352
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,159
literally literally and figuratively

2353
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:33,039
yeah

2354
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:33,519
and it always felt to me like there's

2355
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,079
not

2356
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,640
a deep conspiracy i don't know i don't

2357
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,640
know

2358
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,880
but it felt to me like it's not

2359
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:44,000
something deeply rooted conspiracy

2360
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:46,640
where like eric weinstein thinks that

2361
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,679
there's some probability that uh that uh

2362
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,159
jeffrey epstein

2363
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:52,239
is a front for like an intelligent

2364
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:55,279
agency whether it's israeli or

2365
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:57,439
uh the cia i don't know but is a front

2366
01:13:55,279 --> 01:14:00,719
for something much much bigger

2367
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:02,479
and then i always thought that he's just

2368
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:04,158
maybe you can correct me but more of the

2369
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:07,198
bernie madoff variety

2370
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:10,479
where he's just a charismatic guy who

2371
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:13,759
uh maybe a psychopathic in some sense so

2372
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:15,599
you know also a pedophile but just

2373
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,159
charismatic and is able to convince

2374
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,480
people of that one percent of any idea

2375
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:21,439
that uh in in the case of scientists is

2376
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:24,959
able to convince

2377
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:26,960
these people that their ideas matter

2378
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,079
uh so one thing scientists don't really

2379
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,760
you know

2380
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:31,600
despite what people say i don't think

2381
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,159
they care about money as much as people

2382
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,360
think

2383
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:34,559
i mean people are ridiculous when they

2384
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:36,158
think that yeah that's why people get

2385
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,520
into science for the money yeah right

2386
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:40,000
the personalized against science are

2387
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,600
obsessed with minutia and when they

2388
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,439
they do the scientific method you know

2389
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,440
how boring that is like you

2390
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:47,039
have to have a love for it yeah exactly

2391
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:50,319
in order to do it but the thing

2392
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:52,000
true what drives you is for your ideas

2393
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:54,559
to be then heard

2394
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,079
and when uh when a rich guy comes over

2395
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,800
probably super charismatic

2396
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:59,920
is going to tell you that your ideas

2397
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,119
especially so for some of these

2398
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,800
outsiders at mit

2399
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:07,920
at harvard and caltech all these like uh

2400
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,640
sort of uh big scien like

2401
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:12,000
physics biology artificial intelligence

2402
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,800
computing

2403
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,600
fields to hear somebody say that your

2404
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,320
ideas

2405
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:19,600
are brilliant and ideas matter it's

2406
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:20,158
pretty powerful especially when you've

2407
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,400
been

2408
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:24,399
an outsider like he's talked to a bunch

2409
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:27,439
of people who were

2410
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:30,158
who had outsider ideas you know the

2411
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:32,639
the the the big negative for me of

2412
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:34,479
modern academia is that

2413
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,400
most people actually like most

2414
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:36,879
communities most people think the same

2415
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:38,879
and there's

2416
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,000
just these brilliant outsiders and the

2417
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,880
outsiders are just

2418
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,439
uh derided and so when you have jeffrey

2419
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,480
epstein

2420
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:48,479
like a hyena sorry sorry sorry

2421
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:49,919
uh going from on the outside and picking

2422
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:50,799
off these brilliant minds that are the

2423
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,199
outsiders

2424
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,320
you can use charisma to convince them to

2425
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:57,119
uh

2426
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:58,238
to to collaborate with him to take his

2427
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:01,599
funding and then

2428
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:03,839
thereby he builds a reputation like uh

2429
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,880
slowly accumulates these people that

2430
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,319
actually results in

2431
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,560
a network of like some of the most

2432
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,319
brilliant people in the world

2433
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,080
you know and then pulls in people like

2434
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:17,599
bill gates and i don't know

2435
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:17,920
political figures i tend to believe that

2436
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,159
one

2437
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,960
one person can do that yeah i mean look

2438
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:23,439
at hitler

2439
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,158
charisma is blinding i think that's what

2440
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:25,919
con man

2441
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:27,839
speaking of bernie madoff that's one of

2442
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:31,520
their major tools

2443
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,520
is flattery glib superficial charm

2444
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,120
it creates those blind spots people want

2445
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,600
to hear how great they are they want to

2446
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:38,319
be flattered it it takes your defenses

2447
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,039
down

2448
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:42,880
plays to our ego the the how much we're

2449
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:43,920
all just pieces of garbage and want to

2450
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,520
hear how great we are

2451
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,600
we want that love from our mother and

2452
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,360
our father it's freudian and

2453
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,440
and they know because they're not

2454
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:54,319
burdened with that need

2455
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:56,319
they're not burdened with that uh

2456
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:58,399
empathy or emotions and they just see

2457
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:00,880
things very calculatively

2458
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:01,679
um they play they know that we're prey

2459
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,400
in their game

2460
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:05,520
and they use that against us and that is

2461
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:08,158
why someone

2462
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,679
who is not that intelligent like hitler

2463
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:10,960
can probably convince a lot more

2464
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:12,719
intelligent people

2465
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,000
you know and that's why we can't give

2466
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:15,840
him dylan power because

2467
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,679
you know he already stands on a stage i

2468
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,279
mean if we let that guy i mean he will

2469
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:21,119
just take over a country and everyone

2470
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:21,519
who can't cook well will be eliminated

2471
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:23,119
yeah

2472
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,719
so it's like i wonder why he keeps

2473
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:26,079
complimenting me when we're in private

2474
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,239
exactly be careful

2475
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:30,000
he looks at me just your your i like

2476
01:17:28,238 --> 01:17:31,599
your suit i like the cut of your

2477
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,560
jib yeah definitely i wouldn't be

2478
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:36,320
careful that kid he's hitler

2479
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,920
but it's crazy to me clip that please

2480
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:39,279
the internet i mean but i mean quentin

2481
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,119
tarantino said it to bed i mean

2482
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:43,039
in his grip personality goes a long way

2483
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:47,039
dude yeah i mean personality

2484
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:48,719
can can usurp common sense and reason of

2485
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:51,439
the smartest people these

2486
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,640
absolute smartest people can be

2487
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:55,359
hypnotized

2488
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,560
it's sort of like a sexy woman it's like

2489
01:17:55,359 --> 01:17:57,920
you can just it just

2490
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,000
you can be tricked because we have such

2491
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:03,359
a blind spot for uh

2492
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,760
you know for uh for flattery yeah i

2493
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:06,319
wonder

2494
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,600
i think there's a bbc documentary on uh

2495
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:08,479
i think it's called something like

2496
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,480
charisma

2497
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:12,799
hitler's charisma or something like that

2498
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:13,198
just quite i mean that one focused more

2499
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,920
about

2500
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:16,559
the power of the speeches but i wonder

2501
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,079
if

2502
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:21,920
most of the success or the rise of

2503
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:23,119
hitler and the third reich had to do

2504
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,119
with the

2505
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:27,519
charisma of hitler when he's alone in a

2506
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:30,719
room with somebody with the generals

2507
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:32,480
just one-on-one like i wonder i wonder

2508
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:34,560
if that's the essential element

2509
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,319
of just being able to just look into a

2510
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,719
person's eyes

2511
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:40,000
like flatter them or whatever is needed

2512
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:42,560
right to earn their

2513
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,760
trust and then convince them of anything

2514
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,679
you want

2515
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:48,239
right yeah i mean you're right because

2516
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,679
that's that's the one piece of history

2517
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:51,759
we don't have i don't know

2518
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:53,119
we don't know we do know that the kid

2519
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,440
crushed

2520
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:57,519
i mean he was a headliner he got up

2521
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:00,799
there and his phone

2522
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,000
would flop around i mean he crushed it

2523
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,520
yeah there's certain elements about

2524
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,399
nationalism and pride that are really

2525
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:08,320
powerful like

2526
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:08,879
a lot of us uh humans i think long for

2527
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:11,039
that

2528
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,640
for the feeling of belonging and when

2529
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:16,560
some charismatic leader

2530
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:19,520
makes us feel like we belong to a group

2531
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,039
the uh the amount of evil we can do to

2532
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,320
other humans because of that

2533
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:26,000
especially nobody wants to look and

2534
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:27,439
nobody wants to do the work to be better

2535
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,279
or look at where they messed up why does

2536
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:32,559
it always have to be the jews that are

2537
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:34,880
you know it's like get over it guys

2538
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:37,039

2539
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,319

uh do you have any from a historical

2564
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:18,879
perspective or just a human perspective

2565
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:21,119
conspiracy theories you connect with or

2566
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:23,800
you're not necessarily conspiratorial

2567
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,439
i'm uh i'm not necessarily

2568
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:29,920
conspiratorial

2569
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:29,919
um nobody cares that much um but they're

2570
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:34,960
but then you know what happens is you

2571
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:36,560
find out this one or this two

2572
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,920
uh and you start questioning everything

2573
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,360
and you start questioning everything man

2574
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,119
it's like you know the vietnam war

2575
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:43,920
started that was a lie

2576
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:45,760
um that was a false flag and then next

2577
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,920
thing you know everything's a false flag

2578
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,800
there are some strange things on 911

2579
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,319
um you know there's some strange things

2580
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,520
from a scientific perspective i'm no

2581
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:56,399
scientist but it's like

2582
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,080
you know yeah three steel framed uh

2583
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:00,960
skyscrapers falling

2584
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:01,439
on the same day in the same way a lot of

2585
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,439
people

2586
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:04,399
say oh it was they were hit by planes

2587
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:06,399
it's like yeah but that's not where they

2588
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:10,000
fell they fell because of fires

2589
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:13,359
and usually not usually

2590
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,960
all the time except for three times and

2591
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:16,880
there was buildings that have burned for

2592
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,399
longer than that um

2593
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,319
and there might be good explanations but

2594
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:22,238
the lack of transparency

2595
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:23,840
it's like i feel like government and

2596
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:25,198
building seven's weird i mean the way it

2597
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,679
kind of died just a neat

2598
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:28,238
just a neat the physical i mean you're a

2599
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:30,399
scientist

2600
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:32,000
is that well i don't i i has their

2601
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:33,920
resistance from the steel and so

2602
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,119
no is it in the free fall not all

2603
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,800
scientists know everything i'm

2604
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:38,319
just a computer guy okay because i had

2605
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,880
some questions i wanted to ask you

2606
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:42,000
about my biology but yeah so exactly i

2607
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,719
don't understand biology i don't

2608
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,880
understand

2609
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:47,039
the melting point of steel i don't but

2610
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,800
i'm just a common sense human

2611
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:50,158
that looks at government and

2612
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,279
institutions when they try to

2613
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:53,519
communicate

2614
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:54,399
and there's a certain human element

2615
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,239
where you

2616
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:58,238
can sense that there's dishonesty going

2617
01:21:56,238 --> 01:21:59,759
on that dishonesty might not be deeply

2618
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:00,879
rooted in a conspiracy theory and

2619
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,880
something malevolent

2620
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,319
it might just be rooted more likely to

2621
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,199
me in a basic

2622
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,158
fear of losing your job right so when

2623
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:09,599
you have a bunch of people that are

2624
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:12,879
afraid of losing their job

2625
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,880
you know and they just don't want to

2626
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,079
uh like the origins of the virus whether

2627
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,560
it came from a labyrinth

2628
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:20,319
or not you know that's a pretty i know a

2629
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,039
lot of biologists behind

2630
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:24,000
closed doors that that say it's very

2631
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:26,479
likely it was leaked from

2632
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
the lab right but like they don't want

2633
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:29,198
to talk about it because there's not

2634
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,198
good evidence either way

2635
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:32,879
it's mostly you're just using common

2636
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:34,158
sense so they're waiting for good

2637
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,719
evidence to come out

2638
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:38,000
in either direction but just like nobody

2639
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:39,679
in positions of uh

2640
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,359
institutional like centralized power

2641
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:43,840
wants to just honestly say

2642
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:46,000
we don't know or on the point of masks

2643
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,279
or all those kinds of things to say

2644
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,560
you know here's the best evidence we

2645
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:49,920
have we're not sure we're trying to

2646
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,480
figure it out we're desperately trying

2647
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,239
to figure that out or just like honesty

2648
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:56,479
especially in the modern day that's the

2649
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:58,559
hope i have for the 21st century is

2650
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:00,079
people seem to detect [ __ ] much much

2651
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,639
better because yeah internet

2652
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:03,920
internet yeah yeah and we also believe

2653
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:05,440
crazy [ __ ] too

2654
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,840
there's no yang without a yang i guess

2655
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:09,279
but the i think the conspiracy theories

2656
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,400
arise only

2657
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:14,079
when the people in positions of power

2658
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:15,119
and government and institutions are full

2659
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:16,880
of [ __ ]

2660
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:18,639
like the error will be taken out of the

2661
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,480
conspiracy theories if the people in

2662
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:21,760
elected power would be much more honest

2663
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:23,519
like just like real

2664
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,800
you have people like andrew yang

2665
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:27,120
whatever you think about him

2666
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,239
just more honest he he just like says

2667
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:30,719
whatever the hell

2668
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:32,158
uh comes to mind by the way he's running

2669
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,719
for new york

2670
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:36,879
mayor there we go do you have opinions

2671
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,600
yeah it's no good i like andrew yang and

2672
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,199
it's no good

2673
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,120
i i'll be honest with you i'm i'm a

2674
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:41,678
lifelong new yorker i mean i'm a new

2675
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:43,760
yorker

2676
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:45,600
well you're in new york or so nothing's

2677
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,679
good well something is good

2678
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,639
okay and talking on let's be honest

2679
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:50,960
about new york

2680
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:52,800
yeah it's a very socially liberal place

2681
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:55,279
it is the head of the snake

2682
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,719
new york is the country if new york when

2683
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:57,679
new york's not doing good countries not

2684
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,399
doing good

2685
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:01,359
um it's the most important city dc new

2686
01:24:00,399 --> 01:24:03,920
york

2687
01:24:01,359 --> 01:24:05,519
it's really rome be honest it's it's uh

2688
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:09,279
i maybe i'm biased i don't know

2689
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:10,639
no we just new yorkers we walk around

2690
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:11,679
everywhere we go this is just like new

2691
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:16,319
york but not new york

2692
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:17,520
it's um but and new york needs and i'm a

2693
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:19,439
guy who leans left i

2694
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,960
you know i just i lean left and that's

2695
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:22,399
just what it is a dictator

2696
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:25,119
is that where you're going no we don't

2697
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:27,679
like stalin we need it's a money town

2698
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:29,439
let's be come on man i mean new york is

2699
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:32,239
a money town

2700
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,559
and uh wall street and then when aoc and

2701
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:35,759
her

2702
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,360
cronies um at the local level rejected

2703
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,760
that amazon thing you're going like

2704
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:41,759
what do you think makes cities and what

2705
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,800
what's going to create jobs in the 21st

2706
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,520
century what do we need

2707
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:47,279
more nail salons more pizza places i

2708
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,760
mean we're living in the tech revolution

2709
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:49,759
and

2710
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,280
you know whatever your opinions are

2711
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:54,000
about jeff bezos

2712
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:54,639
that's the world tech and they wants to

2713
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,920
come here

2714
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:58,079
of course you give them tax breaks

2715
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,319
that's why any companies go anywhere

2716
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:02,238
she's so [ __ ] utopian and that that

2717
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:05,279
progressive wing is so utopian

2718
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:06,559
and that always ends in disaster because

2719
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:08,158
it's not rooted in reality

2720
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,679
it doesn't accept the reality that

2721
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:10,879
people are self-interested now they're

2722
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:13,279
going to do this 14

2723
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,800
15 tax hike on people making a million

2724
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,158
dollars more in new york city a million

2725
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,079
dollars is not that much

2726
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:19,679
so people are gonna flee new york the

2727
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:21,279
tax base is gonna flee

2728
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:22,800
new york's gonna follow [ __ ] like it did

2729
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:23,198
before so you're saying it basically

2730
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,719
needs

2731
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:26,238
a more capitalist front like

2732
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,880
capitalistic type of thinker that

2733
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:28,959
bloomberg

2734
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,039
giuliani when he was still sane and his

2735
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:33,679
hair wasn't melting off his face

2736
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:34,639
prosecutor you need to talk i mean i

2737
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:35,520
don't know what's happened that guy's

2738
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:37,440
lost it

2739
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,199
but it's fun yeah it's fun to watch yeah

2740
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:40,879
it's fun to watch him be just like uh

2741
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:42,158
trump's lacking like yeah boy whatever

2742
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,760
you want boss i'll just say whatever you

2743
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:46,399
want boys

2744
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:48,000
uh new york is a money town that needs a

2745
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:49,839
money guy and sort of more

2746
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,760
of a republican i have to say on the

2747
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,039
local level as more of a guy who leans

2748
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,079
left i'll just be honest

2749
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:57,600
it it's a tough city that needs a tough

2750
01:25:56,079 --> 01:25:59,359
mayor not some guy who's going like i

2751
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,840
understand we all need free money

2752
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:03,119
you know andrew yang i think is right in

2753
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,800
the big picture because all the

2754
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:06,479
real jobs are somewhere else you look at

2755
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,840
those asian cities you go like oh

2756
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:09,599
that's what our cities used to look like

2757
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,039
at the industrial revolution you know

2758
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,560
there was like there was jobs and people

2759
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:14,079
were making things here and

2760
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,440
now you look at those cities in asia and

2761
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:16,399
you're going like wow and then you go to

2762
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:18,238
detroit and you're like

2763
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:19,759
yeah we're done you go to cleveland you

2764
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:22,879
go we we're done

2765
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,880
so i i don't actually it's funny the the

2766
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,960
reason i really like andrew yang is

2767
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,639
i've learned a lot every time he talks

2768
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,639
like it's not his opinions

2769
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:32,079
he's just giving a lot of data yeah like

2770
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:33,760
information which i

2771
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:35,279
just start a podcast don't run for mayor

2772
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,320
well yeah that's true he already has a

2773
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:38,319
podcast i think

2774
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:40,158
yang speaks who doesn't who doesn't

2775
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:41,599
[ __ ] who does it now

2776
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:44,079
that's the way we communicate i don't

2777
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:46,079
even talk to people unless it's on a box

2778
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:47,439
what listen man i'm a i'm not going to

2779
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:47,840
criticize that because there is

2780
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:51,279
something

2781
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:53,119
like i talked to my dad on a podcast

2782
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:55,359
for four hours and i'm not sure i

2783
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:57,359
wouldn't i would ever talk to him

2784
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:58,559
in the way we talked without the podcast

2785
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:02,000
what does he do

2786
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:06,719
uh physicist oh [ __ ] but like

2787
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:09,039
yeah it's uh episode 100 and

2788
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,039
you know

2789
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:14,799
i uh the way i recorded that podcast is

2790
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:16,000
i tried to put my ego aside it's

2791
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,880
actually really tough to talk to your

2792
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,238
dad

2793
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,319
especially because you're giving him a

2794
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:21,759
platform uh

2795
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:23,198
especially so at that time this is

2796
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,480
already a bit of a platform for this

2797
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:27,519
podcast

2798
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:29,919
and so there's this as a sun

2799
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,440
you think like oh here it goes with this

2800
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:33,039
[ __ ] again like that's the natural

2801
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:35,599
sun thought

2802
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:36,800
you have but at the same time i wanted

2803
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,560
to

2804
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,560
the way i thought about it is in 20

2805
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,840
years when i look back like i want to do

2806
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,080
a conversation where i'm

2807
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,760
happy with it you know so i want to make

2808
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:48,000
him shine

2809
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,840
but i also called him on like why were

2810
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,238
you so distant

2811
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,679
like like all that kind of stuff yeah it

2812
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:55,039
was very difficult to do but it was

2813
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:56,480
really important to do and i don't think

2814
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:59,359
i'd be able to do it without a

2815
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:00,399
without a microphone right listen how

2816
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:02,238
often do we sit there

2817
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:03,519
and just focus our attention just look

2818
01:28:02,238 --> 01:28:06,238
at the other person

2819
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:09,120
i i don't know man this is not even

2820
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:10,879
recording right now

2821
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:12,639
i just invited you over just so we could

2822
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,000
actually you're right the podcast does

2823
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,840
make like i listen i've been listening

2824
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,039
to every word you've been saying and if

2825
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,039
we weren't doing a podcast

2826
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:20,560
i might be looking at my phone or being

2827
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:22,319
self-conscious about something else or

2828
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,600
you're nervous or excited

2829
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:25,759
especially with people close to you i

2830
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,639
mean that was i recommend that actually

2831
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,960
for people

2832
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,239
to talk to their family on a podcast

2833
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,279
okay or like

2834
01:28:30,238 --> 01:28:34,799
fake or not that's really powerful uh

2835
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:36,559
it made me realize that there's a clear

2836
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,960
distinction between the conversations we

2837
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:39,679
usually have with humans and those we

2838
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,039
have

2839
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:44,158
when the podcast is being recorded um

2840
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:46,560
what the [ __ ] were we talking about

2841
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:47,920
before that uh i knew you were gonna

2842
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,400
lose your train of thought on that one

2843
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,840
because

2844
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:51,920
that's a big one there's a motion behind

2845
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:52,239
that one a podcast with dad is gonna

2846
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,679
take

2847
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:56,158
that's gonna take you to a place i took

2848
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:59,199
you to a place it took you outside

2849
01:28:56,158 --> 01:29:01,599
of interviewer new york place yeah

2850
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:02,799
in new york and yang yeah so the data

2851
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,380
one of the things that really surprised

2852
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,360
me about

2853
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:06,800
[Laughter]

2854
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:09,279
i liked the psychoanalysis you just

2855
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,279
threw in there

2856
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,400
[ __ ] million people listening to this

2857
01:29:19,039 --> 01:29:22,639
14 rogans

2858
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:24,960
isn't it enough dad i'm creating robots

2859
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:26,159
is that enough for you

2860
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,600
that's what drives you probably that's

2861
01:29:26,158 --> 01:29:29,119
probably what drives me that's what

2862
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,159
gives meaning to life is it's never

2863
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:32,238
enough

2864
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:34,559
and uh i hope to pass that on to my kids

2865
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:36,319
one day uh that nothing's ever enough

2866
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,480
whether they're robot or human right

2867
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:40,000
your kids most likely let's be honest

2868
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:41,119
bro i call one of your robots

2869
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,238
if you love your are you starting to

2870
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:43,920
love your is it going to be like that

2871
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:45,039
pygmalion thing you create them and then

2872
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,239
they kill you but even while they're

2873
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:48,639
killing you you got a tear right

2874
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:49,839
here a slow one one tier one tear and

2875
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,840
just yeah why are you doing this

2876
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:54,239
frankenstein

2877
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:56,000
why but i loved you those would be the

2878
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:57,919
last words out of my mouth

2879
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,198
uh but andrew yang mentioned something

2880
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:02,158
on um

2881
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:03,678
that it cost uh four hundred thousand

2882
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:05,599
dollars

2883
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:07,279
over four hundred thousand dollars per

2884
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:11,120
year to support

2885
01:30:07,279 --> 01:30:13,439
one person in prison in new york

2886
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:15,198
like when i heard that number it was

2887
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:18,839
really confusing to me

2888
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:20,879
like that it cost that much 400k per

2889
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,719
person

2890
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,239
and it was really refreshing to hear a

2891
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:27,039
politician

2892
01:30:24,238 --> 01:30:27,759
describe a particular problem with data

2893
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:29,519
that this is

2894
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,800
this prison industrial complex whatever

2895
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,800
the hell it is

2896
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,560
and whether the solution it's unclear

2897
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:36,639
what the solution is i think he has

2898
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,239
solutions but just the honesty of

2899
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:40,400
presenting that information

2900
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:41,279
was refreshing and i'm not sure a

2901
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:43,359
capitalistic

2902
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:44,719
person would solve that those kinds of

2903
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:48,000
problems he might make worse

2904
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:48,719
and i'm not you know i'm a huge fan of

2905
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,238
capitalism

2906
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:53,840
i think i think the free market

2907
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:55,599
is is the way we make progress in this

2908
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:58,239
world but it

2909
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:00,000
seems to go wrong in certain directions

2910
01:30:58,238 --> 01:31:00,718
like the military-industrial complex the

2911
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,319
prison

2912
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:04,079
anything that ends with industrial

2913
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:07,519
complex

2914
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:10,238
and so i'm i'm not sure i'm not sure if

2915
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,480
all of the problems you're basically

2916
01:31:10,238 --> 01:31:12,479
saying

2917
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:19,199
let's put new york's problems aside

2918
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:20,479
we need to have new york shine first to

2919
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:22,559
do what it does best

2920
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:23,919
essentially yeah and then the problems

2921
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,080
will fix them well

2922
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,359
and then we can focus on the problems

2923
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:28,559
but if you just say like here's a

2924
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:29,119
problem here's the problem here's a

2925
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,480
problem

2926
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:32,158
let's make sure we have the safety net

2927
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:33,839
that protects against all these kinds of

2928
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:35,519
problems that's not going to

2929
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:37,119
that's going to kill the city the spirit

2930
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,920
of the uh of the city

2931
01:31:37,119 --> 01:31:42,479
that is in your biased opinion the rome

2932
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,480
of the world

2933
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:46,000
that said a lot of people are fleeing

2934
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:47,920
new york yeah that that's why i say it

2935
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,039
uh that's the reality of the situation

2936
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,359
is you know

2937
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:52,399
um i i'm all for the public good but

2938
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:54,000
yeah there needs to be

2939
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:56,158
back to that greek expression pon metro

2940
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,840
narstan i i also

2941
01:31:56,158 --> 01:31:59,759
think the free market is responsible for

2942
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:01,360
progress i think it's the most natural

2943
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,440
thing the thing that's most aligned with

2944
01:32:01,359 --> 01:32:05,679
human nature which is self-interest

2945
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:07,439
and um which i believe not to the extent

2946
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:08,800
that iran would but i do believe people

2947
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:11,439
are mostly self-interested

2948
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,719
especially with one gun to the head um

2949
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:15,198
morals are out the window

2950
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,000
you know it's about survival so you know

2951
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:17,919
create a system

2952
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
that respects that and acknowledges that

2953
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:23,039
but socialism works very well

2954
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,840
at least right now as a check as to

2955
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:25,840
temper

2956
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,600
uh the excesses of capitalism and in

2957
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:30,719
certain scenarios

2958
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:32,560
is uh the more appropriate system you

2959
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:35,920
know in a vacuum so one being

2960
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:39,039
prisons or you know uh you know

2961
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,440
governance uh you know uh maybe even

2962
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:41,439
well

2963
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:43,119
and this is a difficult one but in

2964
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:44,799
health care health care

2965
01:32:43,119 --> 01:32:48,639
it's unclear what's right there's a lot

2966
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,639
of debates there yeah doctors want boats

2967
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,480
so i guess you're voting for aoc you're

2968
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,679
saying but no i'm not vote for issue but

2969
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:55,519
i do

2970
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:57,679
it's just a tough one that's a tough one

2971
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:00,480
but ultimately

2972
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:02,079
the hippocratic oath it's like how do

2973
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:03,519
you turn people away man how do you do

2974
01:33:02,079 --> 01:33:07,519
that to people it's like

2975
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:10,480
it's it's a tough thing to uh

2976
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:12,000
to reconcile helping people curing

2977
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:14,559
people with

2978
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,399
the uh the marketplace it's just i can

2979
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,920
understand why that one's so tough

2980
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:19,439
and then you got hypochondriacs of

2981
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,480
course who drain the system you know

2982
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:22,719
like people who are

2983
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:24,000
have anxiety like me who had coveted

2984
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:26,960
called 14

2985
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,479
uh you know i called 14 ambulances so

2986
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:30,239
and then of course we're fat and the

2987
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:30,799
free market made us fat because it

2988
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:32,238
played

2989
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,920
the marketing made us want all this junk

2990
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:35,039
food and that's a burden on the health

2991
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,319
care system so we got to do something

2992
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,158
about that we got to get creative we

2993
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:39,599
need new thinkers i'll be one of them

2994
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:41,519
when you go to a fast food restaurant

2995
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,239
you stand on a scale if you're over a

2996
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,480
certain thing

2997
01:33:42,238 --> 01:33:45,439
you can't be served it's good for the

2998
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:46,879
health care system

2999
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:48,719
you know you just hand it a salad and

3000
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,039
say sorry this burger's illegal for

3001
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:53,198
right now if you achieve these certain

3002
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:55,760
uh bmi goals

3003
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:56,638
then you can you can have this burger

3004
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,840
but right now

3005
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:00,000
you can that's where the state's

3006
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:01,440
important yeah okay to regulate our

3007
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,439
freedoms no slurpees i'm with you

3008
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:04,960
bloomberg

3009
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:06,479
well i'm with you to go along i think

3010
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,760
the salads are too expensive they should

3011
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:10,319
be subsidized if you

3012
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:11,760
if you go to like a fast food joint uh

3013
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:12,639
the burger is always going to be cheaper

3014
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,000
than the salad yeah

3015
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:15,440
and this does not make sense we should

3016
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,319
run this platform delicious i'll be your

3017
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:18,479
vice president

3018
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:19,679
we'll ban burgers for uh for people over

3019
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:21,439
a certain way

3020
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:23,279
and make salads cheap three-day work

3021
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:24,638
weeks why has that wait wait

3022
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:26,319
okay where are you going with this one

3023
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:28,800
good good for the economy

3024
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:30,238
stimulates the economy right more shifts

3025
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,440
it creates more jobs

3026
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:33,198
more people spending because they have

3027
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:33,839
more leisure time boosts the leisure

3028
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:35,678
economy

3029
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,520
you know why are we still doing the

3030
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:39,039
five-day work week that that was

3031
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:40,960
that was tempered from the seven-day

3032
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:41,920
work week that was so the seventh it

3033
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,600
used to be seven day work

3034
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,039
it used to be like and people who were

3035
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,679
just these libertarians like come on

3036
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:47,359
dude

3037
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,960
what is this fresh are we freshman in

3038
01:34:47,359 --> 01:34:50,158
college yeah you're gonna you

3039
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,079
we're gonna talk about iron ran next

3040
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:54,158
like let's talk about reality okay and

3041
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:56,238
human nature people are [ __ ] greedy

3042
01:34:54,158 --> 01:34:57,920
they're they lie they you know there's

3043
01:34:56,238 --> 01:34:58,959
no end to up which is one of my favorite

3044
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:01,199
expressions

3045
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,520
um no center up no end to up there's no

3046
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:04,719
in top but can we dissect that yeah from

3047
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:07,760
a randian perspective

3048
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:09,600
there's no end to up which is uh you

3049
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,119
just keep going it's never enough

3050
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,639
oh never enough no it's never enough no

3051
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:14,880
end to up more more

3052
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:16,000
more and you know you have to reconcile

3053
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,760
your fact that you're going to die so

3054
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,279
like there's no end up thing is that

3055
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:24,320
balance is is just

3056
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:26,800
as valuable as

3057
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:28,000
progress so we have to reconcile those

3058
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:31,039
two things and put them

3059
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,000
on a seesaw and figure out how to get

3060
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:34,238
two people who have the

3061
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,600
equal weight to to keep it like that and

3062
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:36,799
that's the goal and it constantly

3063
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,400
vacillates

3064
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,279
uh according to the time you sometimes

3065
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:40,000
you need a little more socialism

3066
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:40,719
sometimes you need a little more

3067
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,238
capitalism

3068
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:44,800
you gotta you gotta you gotta fly the

3069
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:48,000
plane man you gotta fly the plane dude

3070
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,639
what's your um looking back at history

3071
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,238
hyenas

3072
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:53,440
is there a moment time period in history

3073
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:54,879
a person in history

3074
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:56,319
that's most fascinating to you you

3075
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,840
mentioned bernie madoff maybe he's

3076
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:00,000
second to birth made up

3077
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,880
is there in a battle of crete is there

3078
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,158
something that you've always been

3079
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,440
curious about even if it's something you

3080
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:04,158
haven't actually researched that well

3081
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:05,439
yet

3082
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:07,759
just something that pulled your

3083
01:36:05,439 --> 01:36:08,879
curiosity that uh instructed the way you

3084
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,600
think about the world

3085
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:13,118
an individual or an event or an event

3086
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:16,560
individual

3087
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:19,839
uh you know yeah moment in history

3088
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:22,840
or person in history um

3089
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:25,199
there's a few but uh you know queen

3090
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:26,960
elizabeth uh the elizabethan

3091
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:28,319
era you know the sun never sets in the

3092
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:31,359
british empire

3093
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:35,279
very successful empire uh

3094
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:39,039
what an absolute success story that is

3095
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:40,399
for a leader and a woman um

3096
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:41,920
can you tell a little bit about her

3097
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:43,359
story well i actually don't know much

3098
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,880
about the bridge yeah she had a good run

3099
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:46,319
i think it's like 70 years you know

3100
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,840
there's a shakespeare

3101
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:50,000
the you know the oh i guess what's the

3102
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,400
word pax romana the the

3103
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,158
period of rome that was at peace and

3104
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:56,238
they flourished like a couple of

3105
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:57,599
emperors like trajan or some good ones

3106
01:36:56,238 --> 01:36:58,718
and i think he was part of the pox

3107
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,320
romana that

3108
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:02,639
sort of just a peace and a comfortable

3109
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:05,198
flourishing time and england

3110
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:07,359
had sort of that in their empire under

3111
01:37:05,198 --> 01:37:08,238
her successful range she murdered her

3112
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:09,599

know um kate blanchett plays her

3115
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,639
and and does so and she didn't win the

3116
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:18,559
oscar because [ __ ] gwyneth paltrow

3117
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:20,400
put a put a british accent on in

3118
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,199
shakespeare in love it's a tragedy why

3119
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:22,719
do i know this

3120
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:25,118
because i'm not a full man i'm a

3121
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:26,158
comedian which means i do skits and i

3122
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:28,319
perform

3123
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:29,759
um and i uh cate blanchett's incredible

3124
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:32,960
actress great movies

3125
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:35,199
she was just so and here's the thing she

3126
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:36,319
she never got married she was oh she was

3127
01:37:35,198 --> 01:37:40,000
so

3128
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:42,799
um astute at public relations

3129
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,800
and and and imagine how strong you got

3130
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:46,719
to be as a woman to lead

3131
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,639
the greatest empire maybe known to man

3132
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:51,520
at the time and to do so

3133
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:52,960
so successfully how machiavellian you

3134
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,320
have to be how idealist you have to be

3135
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,719
how much of a good marketer you have to

3136
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:56,639
be

3137
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:58,000
propaganda machine was on point she was

3138
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:00,560
married to england

3139
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,279
she was adored the way she adorned

3140
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,119
herself

3141
01:38:01,279 --> 01:38:04,319
you walked in you're like holy man god

3142
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:06,479
just walked in here

3143
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:07,439
and of course she got [ __ ] i mean who

3144
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:09,678
doesn't [ __ ]

3145
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:11,439
we all [ __ ] even robots one day will

3146
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:13,920
[ __ ] yeah but she was

3147
01:38:11,439 --> 01:38:15,439
she she did that propaganda thing and

3148
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,158
historians aren't

3149
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:19,198
uh haven't they haven't decided this but

3150
01:38:18,158 --> 01:38:22,479
i believe

3151
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:22,799
she [ __ ] and i believe she did that as

3152
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:25,599
a

3153
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,159
tool of propaganda i'm married to

3154
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,560
england

3155
01:38:26,158 --> 01:38:30,479
so you oh you're directly referring to

3156
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,039
like using sex as a way to manipulate

3157
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:34,000
people

3158
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:35,519
well she her she was known as like the

3159
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,960
the virgin queen

3160
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,400
and uh and her thing was like i'm

3161
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,359
married to england like i can't be

3162
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:41,839
distracted by

3163
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:45,519
man a woman she never had any kids

3164
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:48,880
nothing i think she did that as a tool

3165
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:51,280
of manipulation yes which you need yeah

3166
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:52,480
rulers need to you know obama made you

3167
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:54,559
feel good and then he went

3168
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:55,599
carpet bombed everywhere you need to

3169
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:57,520
feel good

3170
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,600
about your guy no matter how evil they

3171
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,679
are and she was [ __ ]

3172
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,119
a dictator but when you look back at her

3173
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:03,600
everyone's like oh my god she was so

3174
01:39:03,118 --> 01:39:05,359
great

3175
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,440
the horror and the [ __ ] that she had to

3176
01:39:05,359 --> 01:39:08,079
do she didn't put that in the history

3177
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:09,759
books

3178
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:11,679
but that's what probably was part of

3179
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:14,239
what made her successful

3180
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:15,520
and um she's a fascinating character to

3181
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:16,879
to ponder him because she was so

3182
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,920
successful and

3183
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:21,440
and and england flourished so much

3184
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:23,359
and uh it's just fascinating to me

3185
01:39:21,439 --> 01:39:23,759
because she was the great virgin queen

3186
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:25,679
and

3187
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,920
can you think of a there's no other

3188
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:29,039
woman who was that say i mean angela

3189
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,960
merkel i mean come on

3190
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:32,238
yeah i mean there's nobody who comes

3191
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,760
close and

3192
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:35,519
defeating the spanish armada i think

3193
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,600
that happened under her i mean i'm no

3194
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:39,199
professionalist but i mean the woman

3195
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,719
crushed

3196
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:42,238
and uh do you think it's more effective

3197
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,239
to lead by

3198
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:46,638
love which just sounds like what she did

3199
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:48,079
from the pr perspective or by fear

3200
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:49,279
where where do you land on that would

3201
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:49,840
not give out peter that's a great

3202
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:53,359
question

3203
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,360
um i'm not we gotta ask joe

3204
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,119
well yeah this is interesting because i

3205
01:39:55,279 --> 01:39:58,079
think leading in the 21st century in

3206
01:39:57,118 --> 01:40:00,399
whatever ways

3207
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:01,840
is different i think it's very difficult

3208
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:04,399
to lead by fear

3209
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:05,600
i mean i'm that's why i i find putin

3210
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:08,719
fascinating

3211
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:11,760
and like really fascinating

3212
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:13,520
like is he a relic of another era

3213
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,360
or is he something that will still be

3214
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,639
necessary in the coming decades for

3215
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:18,960
certain nations

3216
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:20,319
i think he's a i don't think he's a

3217
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:21,279
relic from another era i think his

3218
01:40:20,319 --> 01:40:22,880
background

3219
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:25,279
i think he is who you think he is

3220
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:27,840
because his background was an espionage

3221
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:29,198
his background was in subterfuge and

3222
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,279
espionage i think i've said the word

3223
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:33,439
subdivision maybe 10 times now

3224
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:34,880
but he uh you like big words

3225
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:36,319
intellectuals i just

3226
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,159
i'm sitting here with you it's my it's

3227
01:40:36,319 --> 01:40:40,639
time to flex

3228
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:42,079
um but he um he's very good at that

3229
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:44,239
right like uh

3230
01:40:42,079 --> 01:40:45,679
controlling people with psychology and

3231
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:47,039
even if you look at the way he's sort of

3232
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:49,920
used the internet

3233
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:50,399
and um has sort of been you know gotten

3234
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,960
in

3235
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:54,238
to the citizens of other countries

3236
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,359
opinions and

3237
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:59,279
it's very kgb he also looks great

3238
01:40:57,359 --> 01:41:02,559
without a shirt on a pony

3239
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:03,840
on a horse on a horse yeah yeah

3240
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,159
i thought he would choose a pony because

3241
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:07,679
a pony's smaller would uh would you

3242
01:41:06,158 --> 01:41:10,319
would you put queen elizabeth as the

3243
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:13,279
greatest leader of all time probably

3244
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:13,840
yeah i think as a woman and you look at

3245
01:41:13,279 --> 01:41:16,719
uh

3246
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:18,400
you look at the the length of the rain i

3247
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:20,158
think it's like 70 something years or

3248
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:23,839
something like that with that she

3249
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:26,319
reigned success man success she used the

3250
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:28,560
church she used public psychology

3251
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:29,679
shakespeare the greatest playwright of

3252
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,000
all time

3253
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:33,520
uh under her reign you know people were

3254
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,439
going to plays

3255
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:37,280
and uh it was it was a successful run

3256
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:40,319
and she was marauding everywhere else

3257
01:41:37,279 --> 01:41:41,599
marauding and and culling resources for

3258
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:44,719
the empire

3259
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:47,119
just say uh absolute successful it's

3260
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:48,560
even uh a token of her success we don't

3261
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:51,118
consider her a dictator

3262
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:52,080
yeah she's a dictator you know she was

3263
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:53,679
queen i

3264
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:55,279
this my thing i love about the feudal

3265
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:56,480
system that these [ __ ] countries

3266
01:41:55,279 --> 01:41:58,880
still have feudal systems

3267
01:41:56,479 --> 01:42:00,479
they're celebrating a horrible thing

3268
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:03,600
divine right of kings

3269
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:05,198
oppression kings were dictators and now

3270
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,520
they have [ __ ] ceremonial

3271
01:42:05,198 --> 01:42:08,479
why don't we have a ceremonial fuhrer

3272
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,679
what is in germany

3273
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:11,599
he doesn't do any of the bad stuff he

3274
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:13,199
just rolls around and does legit

3275
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:15,119
i mean it's like what the [ __ ] there's

3276
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:16,638
no difference between a hitler and a

3277
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:18,559
[ __ ] king they did the same

3278
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:19,840
horrible [ __ ] why not a [ __ ]

3279
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,520
ceremonial conqueror

3280
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,880
alexander the great walks in rapes a

3281
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,520
little bit but it's all fun it's for

3282
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,560
ceremony

3283
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:29,760
he represents the country macedonia

3284
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:31,520
it's interesting to see that uh

3285
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,760
some you're starting to see a bit of

3286
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:36,639
that in russia with stalin

3287
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:37,600
actually the celebration of of a man

3288
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:40,800
that helped

3289
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:42,320
win the great patriotic war uh-oh yeah

3290
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,840
right so like you you're already

3291
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:45,840
starting to see that it's very possible

3292
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:47,279
in history books you'll be seen as

3293
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:49,360
maybe like a genghis khan type of

3294
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:51,840
character and you forget

3295
01:42:49,359 --> 01:42:53,439
the millions that he tortured right so

3296
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,400
you're one of the most successful and

the world has ever seen so you're the

3299
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,319
good person to ask uh

for advice you know there's a lot of

3301
01:43:00,319 --> 01:43:05,198
young people that look up to you

the right choice

3304
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:10,479
what advice would you give to a young

3305
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,760
person maybe to yourself to a young

3306
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:14,718
version of yourself

3307
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:16,400
you know just how to live a successful a

3308
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:19,279
good life

3309
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:20,799
be doggedly you i think the magic

3310
01:43:19,279 --> 01:43:24,079
happens when

3311
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:26,000
you are stubbornly doggedly you and you

3312
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:26,238
meet other people who are doing the same

3313
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,198
and

3314
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:31,118
um the real magic of life the real true

3315
01:43:29,198 --> 01:43:31,919
currency and this ephemeral life is sort

3316
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:34,880
of

3317
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:36,158
the communication that happens between

3318
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:38,000
people

3319
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:40,238
uh that's the real currency friendships

3320
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,158
love it's it's cliche but it's uh

3321
01:43:40,238 --> 01:43:43,839
i think the meaning of life is to

3322
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:46,638
experience

3323
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:48,239
to experience love and uh i think uh

3324
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:50,400
people often mistake maybe it's because

3325
01:43:48,238 --> 01:43:53,359
of hollywood films and things like that

3326
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:53,759
that love is uh feeling but it's not

3327
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:56,479
it's an

3328
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:58,480
action so uh that took me a while to

3329
01:43:56,479 --> 01:43:59,919
learn and i think that's why i've made

3330
01:43:58,479 --> 01:44:01,599
decisions since that i think have been

3331
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,079
good for me and healthy for me

3332
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:06,320
love is an action uh people can say

3333
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:07,920
things you can feel things

3334
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:10,000
um that doesn't mean they're necessarily

3335
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:13,118
real it's all chemical reactions

3336
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:16,000
it's all uh tied to our immaturity

3337
01:44:13,118 --> 01:44:16,960
and uh psychological issues and uh

3338
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,439
survival

3339
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,319
but action when so when you do things

3340
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:23,759
when you

3341
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:26,479
act out of love and you that's

3342
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:28,000
that's what it's about is there uh times

3343
01:44:26,479 --> 01:44:28,559
when you're younger where you were kind

3344
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
of

3345
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:32,800
this uh dishonest with who you are to

3346
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,800
yourself

3347
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,480
yeah in terms of like what what kind of

3348
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,880
things did you have to do to

3349
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:39,678
to shake yourself up and be like okay i

3350
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:41,679
thought

3351
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:43,679
um i thought i'm going to be a scientist

3352
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:44,319
but instead i i realized i'm going to do

3353
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:46,719
this

3354
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:47,599
yeah my parents make funny yeah my

3355
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:49,520

nations

3377
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:31,919
um and yeah i was a comedian i was

3378
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:33,599
always a [ __ ] up and uh

3379
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:35,679
the thing that i was best at the only

3380
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:37,679
thing i was ever decent at was just like

3381
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:39,039
making people laugh i don't know why i

3382
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:41,440
don't know where that comes from

3383
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:42,960
but uh was there a question or did was

3384
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:44,399
there a moment where you decided this is

3385
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,960
what i'm gonna do there was a moment

3386
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:46,879
after i

3387
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:49,198
graduated college yeah but i was

3388
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:51,600
thinking about all types of stuff that

3389
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:53,439
other people imposed on me and um i was

3390
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:55,039
honest with myself and uh once i figured

3391
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:56,559
out it was an actual career path

3392
01:45:55,039 --> 01:45:59,118
i wasn't even aware back then the

3393
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:01,440
internet wasn't huge you know in late 99

3394
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:02,639
2000 it wasn't big yet so i didn't i

3395
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:03,839
thought robin williams was just like an

3396
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:04,719
actor i didn't know there was comedy

3397
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,639
clubs and all

3398
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:08,239
so once i learned that i was just like i

3399
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:10,159
tried it i

3400
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:12,000
suffered from massive anxiety i remember

3401
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:13,439
the first time i did comedy my arms went

3402
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,679
numb i started having a massive panic

3403
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:16,319
attack i have my first set i can show it

3404
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:18,158
to you it's like

3405
01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:20,158
i suggest i just i'm a video yeah i'm

3406
01:46:18,158 --> 01:46:21,359
video oh thank you thank you thank you

3407
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:22,879
and the reason why i kept saying thank

3408
01:46:21,359 --> 01:46:23,759
you because i forgot my old jokes i was

3409
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:25,039
so scared

3410
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,639
and then they laughed because of the

3411
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:28,158
amount of times i said thank you and

3412
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:30,000
then once they laughed

3413
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:31,599
i was i remembered the whole thing and i

3414
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,319
did the five minutes and i remember

3415
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:34,079
getting off

3416
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:36,238
and for a person who never felt like he

3417
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:37,118
had a place anywhere nothing ever felt

3418
01:46:36,238 --> 01:46:39,678
right

3419
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:41,039
that felt like okay i found it this is

3420
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:43,118
what i'm supposed to do

3421
01:46:41,039 --> 01:46:45,039
this is it it was the only time in my

3422
01:46:43,118 --> 01:46:47,118
life i felt that i haven't felt it since

3423
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:48,319
never felt it before so that's the only

3424
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:50,319
thing i can do

3425
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:52,000
and um yeah i had that you know it's

3426
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:54,719
funny because there's uh i've

3427
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,319
similar experience like immigrant family

3428
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,800
and the world tells you to do certain

3429
01:46:56,319 --> 01:47:00,399
things

3430
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:03,440
and you think that's right but but then

3431
01:47:00,399 --> 01:47:04,399
you put yourself in situations by luck

3432
01:47:03,439 --> 01:47:07,678
probably

3433
01:47:04,399 --> 01:47:08,799
where it's like oh this this this is

3434
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:10,158
this feels right

3435
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,239
i don't know what this means but this

3436
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:14,079
feels right i think the

3437
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:15,599
the the biggest moment like that for me

3438
01:47:14,079 --> 01:47:18,000
was uh i don't know

3439
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,719
what to make of it exactly but when i

3440
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,279
met

3441
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:22,000
spot the robot the legged robot it was

3442
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:25,439
like five years

3443
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:28,719
ago it felt like this

3444
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:30,719
there the depth of fascinating ideas

3445
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:32,399
that are yet to be explored with this

3446
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:34,239
thing this felt like a journey it was

3447
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:36,158
like a door that opened

3448
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:38,000
and i was like i don't want to be a

3449
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:41,039
professor

3450
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:43,920
at that point i realized i don't want to

3451
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:45,760
do sort of uh generic stuff i want to do

3452
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,560
something crazy i want to do something

3453
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,920
big

3454
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:50,080
that's the reason i stepped away from

3455
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:51,760
mit that's the reason i have this

3456
01:47:50,079 --> 01:47:53,920
burning desire to do a startup that's

3457
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:55,520
the reason i came to austin

3458
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,440
yeah i don't know what the hell it all

3459
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:58,159
means but you just kind of follow that

3460
01:47:57,439 --> 01:47:59,519
that's awesome

3461
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:01,439
that sounds like you're following what's

3462
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:04,239
doggedly you and also i think

3463
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:06,079
uh just to just to piggyback off it i

3464
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:07,919
think that means

3465
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:10,399
no matter what it is because i think our

3466
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:11,199
uh the american dream is sold like hey

3467
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:13,519
if you're not

3468
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:14,399
beyonce or if you're not famous you're

3469
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:16,080
not worth it i

3470
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:17,439
hate that and that's what i love so much

3471
01:48:16,079 --> 01:48:17,679
about certain countries like sweden it's

3472
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:19,759
a

3473
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:20,639
it's like um where everyone has

3474
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,520
healthcare and stuff like that because

3475
