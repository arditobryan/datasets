00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,320
conversations this year on the topic of

28
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,640
cryptocurrency

29
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,359
i'm reading and thinking a lot on this

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,439
topic

31
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,799
i just recently finished reading the

32
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,759
bitcoin standard

33
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,759
a book i highly recommend as always with

34
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,719
this podcast i'm approaching it with an

35
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,840
open mind

36
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,798
with compassion with as little ego as

37
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,000
possible

38
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,360
and yes with love i hope you go along

and don't judge me too harshly on any

41
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,040
likely missteps as usual i will play

42
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,079
devil's advocate

43
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,799
i will on purpose sometimes

44
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,359
ask simple even dumb questions all to

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,840
try and explore the space of ideas here

46
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,680
with as much grace as i can muster i

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,079
have no financial interests here

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,280
i only have a simple curiosity and a

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,679
love for knowledge

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,719
especially about a set of technologies

51
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,880
that may very well

52
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,478
transform the fabric of human

53
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,319
civilization

and now here's my conversation with

61
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,560
silvio

62
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:03,280
mccauley let's start with the big

63
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,320
and the basic question what is a

64
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,920
blockchain

65
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,079
and why is it interesting why is it

66
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,719
fascinating why is it powerful

67
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
all right so a blockchain think of it is

68
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,959
a

69
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,280
is really a common database distributed

70
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,759
think about is a ledger

71
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,640
in which everybody can write an entry in

72
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,759
a page

73
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,799
you can write i can write and everybody

74
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,439
can read

75
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
and you have a guarantee that everybody

76
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,639
has the same

77
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,280
copy of the ledger that is in front of

78
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,439
you so if

79
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,318
whatever you see on page seven anyone

80
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:39,519
else is on page seven

81
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:42,799
so what is uh extraordinary about this

82
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,640
is this a common knowledge thing that i

83
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,200
think is a really

84
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,878
a first for humanity i mean if you look

85
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,159
at communication

86
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,039
like right now you can communicate very

87
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,000
quickly

88
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,799
images of thoughts or photos but do you

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,639
have a

90
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
certainty that whatever you have

91
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,958
received has been received by everybody

92
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,878
else

93
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,719
and not really and so there's a

94
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,199
commonality of knowledge

95
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,479
and the certainty that everybody can

96
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,000
write nobody

97
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,919
has been prevented for having whatever

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,318
they want nobody can erase

99
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,439
nobody can tear a page of a ledger

100
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,479
nobody can swap

101
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,919
page nobody can change anything and uh

102
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,560
that is an immutable coma record is uh

103
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,518
extremely powerful and uh there's

104
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,759
something

105
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,439
fundamental that is decentralized about

106
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,000
it so at least in spirit

107
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,158
uh some degree against maybe a

108
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,759
resistance to centralization

109
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:40,639
absolutely if it is not decentralized

110
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,439
how can it be common knowledge if only

111
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,518
one person or a few people are villager

112
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,120
the only way you don't have villager you

113
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,680
have to ask you know what is on page

114
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,360
seven

115
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,360
and how do you know that whatever they

116
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,040
tell you is on page seven

117
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,799
they tell the same thing to everybody

118
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,560
else and so

119
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,319
that is this commandant is like

120
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,438
extremely

121
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,438
powerful just uh um just to give you an

122
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,479
example a sumo beta

123
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:09,359
you do an auction okay you have uh work

124
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,878
very hard you build a building and now

125
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,519
you want to auction off

126
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,079
make sense because uh you want to

127
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,760
auction

128
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,600
worldwide better yet you want to

129
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,918
tokenize the building and sell it you

130
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,040
know

131
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:24,240
in parcels now

132
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,919
everybody sees the bids and you know

133
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,600
that everybody sees the bids you and i

134
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,319
see the same [ __ ] and so does everybody

135
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,080
else

136
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,519
so you know that the fair price has

137
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,198
reached and you know

138
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:38,319
who owns what and who has spent how much

139
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,520
and if you do it instead of advising on

140
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,000
a centralized system

141
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,719
i put a bid say oh congratulations alex

142
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
you won

143
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:50,400
and your prize is 12 570 dollars

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,639
how do you know so if instead there is a

145
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:57,439
common knowledge is a very powerful uh

146
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
tool for humanity so we'll return to it

147
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,199
from

148
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,959
a bunch of different perspectives

149
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,840
including like a technical perspective

150
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,959
but

151
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,879
you often talk about blockchain

152
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,038
and some of these concepts of

153
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,120
decentralization

154
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,560
scalability security all those kinds of

155
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,319
things

156
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,600
but one of the most maybe impactful

157
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:23,199
exciting things that leverage

158
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,280
the blockchain this kind of ledger idea

159
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,080
of common knowledge is cryptocurrency

160
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,879
so the fight in the financial space so

161
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,199
is there

162
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,959
can you say in the same kind of basic

163
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,120
way what is cryptocurrency in the

164
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,038
context of this common knowledge and

165
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,319
context of the blockchain

166
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:43,599
great cryptocurrency that is a currency

167
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,879
that is on such a ledger so imagine that

168
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,919
on vallejo right initially you know that

169
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,120
somehow

170
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,519
say you and i are the only owner each

171
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,199
one

172
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:58,079
let's give it our ourselves a billion uh

173
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,439
each or whatever this unit then i start

174
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,918
up

175
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,680
writing on the ledger i give a hundred

176
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,719
of these units to my sister

177
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,439
you give i give this match to my end and

178
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,199
then

179
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,800
and then now because it's written on

180
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,600
belgium and everybody can see

181
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,560
my sister can give 57 of his units that

182
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,840
she received from me

183
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,160
to somebody else and so and and that is

184
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,439
money and that is money because

185
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,280
you can see that somebody who

186
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,120
tenders your payment has really the

187
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,959
money there right you don't have any

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,680
more of a doubt when you want to sell an

189
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,239
item

190
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,840
if i got your check is the check covered

191
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,918
if

192
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,439
right or um do i have the money at the

193
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,359
moment of a transaction

194
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,959
you really see because the ledger is

195
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,000
always operated what you see

196
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:46,079
is what i see what the merchant sees you

197
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
know where the money so is

198
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:52,399
the most powerful money system there is

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,639
because it is totally transparent and so

200
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,879
you know that you have been paid

201
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,400
and and you know that the money is there

202
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,719
you have not to second guess anything

203
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,638
else

204
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,160
so the the common knowledge applied

205
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,000
there is

206
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,439
you're basically mimicking the same kind

207
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,279
of thing you would get in the physical

208
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,360
space which is

209
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,519
uh if you give a hundred bucks or a

210
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,319
hundred of that thing whatever

211
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,198
of that cryptocurrency to your sister

212
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,598
the actual

213
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:23,120
transfer is as real as you giving like

214
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:26,079
a a a basket of apples to your sister

215
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,680
because that uh so in the case in the

216
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,598
physical space

217
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,959
the the common knowledge is in the

218
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,918
physics

219
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,918
right of the atoms and then it's digital

220
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:36,799
space the common knowledge is in this

221
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,079
ledger

222
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,038
and so that transfer holds

223
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:45,038
um the same kind of power but now it's

224
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:49,199
operating in the digital space

225
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,719
correct again i apologize for a set of

226
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,080
ridiculous questions but

227
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,680
uh you mentioned cryptocurrencies of

228
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:59,198
money

229
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,439
what what is money why do we have money

230
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,439
do you think about this kind of from

231
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,879
this high philosophical level

232
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:09,759
at times of this uh

233
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,160
tool this idea that we humans have all

234
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,240
kind of

235
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,599
came up with and seem to be using

236
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,598
effectively to do stuff

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,160
money is a social construct okay in

238
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,800
my opinion and this has been somehow

239
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,479
people always felt that somehow money

240
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,639
is a way to allow us to transact

241
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,199
even though we want to different things

242
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,479
so i have

243
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,360
two sheep and then you have

244
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,278
one cow and i want the cow but uh you

245
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,680
are looking for blankets instead you

246
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,080
know

247
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,239
so to have money it's really simplifies

248
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,639
this but at the end of and that's why

249
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,399
a bit was invented and you started with

250
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,559
gold you started when the

251
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,320
corny edge when you started with czech

252
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,199
but at the end of the day

253
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
money is essentially a social construct

254
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,240
because

255
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,320
you know that what you receive you can

256
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,720
actually spend with somebody else

257
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,240
and so there is a kind of a social pact

258
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,600
and social belief

259
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,600
that that you have at the end of the day

260
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:17,120
even a barter is of requires

261
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,920
um beliefs that other people are going

262
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,399
to accept

263
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,958
the quote-unquote currency you offer

264
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,600
them

265
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,599
because if i'm amazing and you asked me

266
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,000
to build a wall

267
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,480
in your field then i did and you

268
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,240
in exchange you give me a thousand ship

269
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,879
what am i going to do eat them all

270
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,839
now i to feed them and if i don't feed

271
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,360
them they die and i

272
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,560
my value is zero so in receiving visa

273
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,120
livestock i must believe that somebody

274
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,838
else

275
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,320
will accept them in return for something

276
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,680
else

277
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,879
yeah so money is a social belief

278
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,319
social shared belief system that makes

279
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,838
people transact

280
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,519
that's fascinating i didn't even i

281
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,240
didn't even think about that that you

282
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,360
you're actually

283
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,159
uh you have a deep like

284
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,800
network of beliefs about how society

285
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,519
operates

286
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,519
so the value is assigned even to sheep

287
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,278
based on that everyone will continue

288
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,200
operating how they were previously

289
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,360
operating yeah somebody will feed the

290
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,879
sheep

291
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,800
i didn't even i didn't even think about

292
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,159
that that's that's fascinating so

293
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,759
that directly transfers to uh

294
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,679
to the space of money and then to the

295
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,559
space of digital money cryptocurrency

296
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,199
okay

297
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,239
does it bother you sort of

298
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,079
intellectually

299
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,600
when this money that is a social

300
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,799
construct is

301
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,200
not directly tied to physical goods like

302
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,319
uh

303
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,560
gold for example not at all because

304
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,720
after all gold has some

305
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,838
industrial value nobody delights it it's

306
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,000
a it's a metal

307
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,200
it doesn't oxidate he has some good

308
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
things about it

309
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,879
but uh does this industrial value really

310
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,519
represent

311
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,240
the value at which it now is trading no

312
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,159
so

313
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,159
gold is another way to express our

314
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,240
belief i give you an ounce of gold

315
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,199
you treat her like oh somebody else will

316
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,159
want to miss

317
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,800
for doing uh something else so it is a

318
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,838
really

319
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,559
this notion of this money is a mental

320
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,600
construct

321
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,199
it's really uh and is a shared is a

322
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
social construct i really

323
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,959
believe and so some people feel that

324
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,000
it's physical so therefore gold

325
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:30,159
exists then as you know now

326
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,039
we countries more sophisticated

327
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,519
countries right now they print their own

328
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,199
money

329
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,120
and you believe that they are not going

330
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,120
to exaggerate it with inflation

331
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,360
not everybody believes in what i'm

332
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,679
saying there is at least

333
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,800
not we are not going to exaggerate it

334
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,799
bludently

335
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,039
and uh and therefore you receive it

336
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,719
because you know that uh

337
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:52,879
somebody else will accept it will have

338
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,560
faith in the currency and so on so forth

339
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,200
but the weather is gold whether it is

340
00:11:54,559 --> 00:12:00,239
livestock or whether whatever it is

341
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,120
money is really a shared belief so there

342
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,879
is something

343
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,799
you know and i've been reading more and

344
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,799
more about different cryptocurrencies

345
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,519
there is a kind of uh belief that

346
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,799
the scarcity of a particular resource

347
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,480
like bitcoin has a

348
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,039
limited amount uh in its tied to

349
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,759
physical

350
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,039
you know uh to to proof of work so it's

351
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,439
tied to physical

352
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,799
reality in terms of how much you can

353
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,360
mine effectively

354
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,799
and so on that that's an important

355
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,720
feature of money

356
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,759
do you think that's an important feature

357
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,959
to be a part of whatever the money is

358
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:41,200
that is certainly a very useful part so

359
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,319
um at some point in time you know assume

360
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,240
a veteran or

361
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,879
money something that all of a sudden we

362
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,440
say this is money i have a currency

363
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,480
then uh you know i offer you 10 days is

364
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,480
in payment of

365
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,839
whatever goods and services you want to

366
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,000
provide but but

367
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,320
at the end of the day if you know that

368
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,278
uh you can cultivate it and generate

369
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,160
them um

370
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,039
at will then perhaps you know you should

371
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,319
not accept

372
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:09,759
my payment in uh here is a

373
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,120
a bouquet of basis so you need some kind

374
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,759
of a scarcity the inability to create a

375
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,560
sudden layout or nothing is uh is uh is

376
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,159
unimportant

377
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:23,919
and uh um it's not an

378
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:26,000
intrinsic necessity but it's much easier

379
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,240
to accept once you know that there is a

380
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,958
fixed number of units or whatever

381
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
currency there is and therefore you can

382
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,319
mentally

383
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,399
understand i'm getting you know this

384
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,040
much of this piece of a pie

385
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,440
and therefore i consider myself paid i

386
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,679
understand what i'm receiving

387
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,360
you describe the goals of a blockchain

388
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,799
you have a nice presentation on this

389
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,759
as scalability security and

390
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:52,078
decentralization

391
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,879
and you challenge the blockchain

392
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,719
trilemma

393
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,000
that claims you can only have two of the

394
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
three so

395
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,399
let's talk about each what is

396
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,160
scalability in the context

397
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,759
of blockchain and cryptocurrency what

398
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,399
does scalability mean

399
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,120
so remember if we said that the

400
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,039
blockchain

401
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,600
is a ledger and each page receives that

402
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,480
gets transaction and everybody can write

403
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,560
in this

404
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,079
in these pages of a ledger nobody can be

405
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,638
stopped for writing and everybody can

406
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,919
read them

407
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,560
okay scalability means how fast can you

408
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,120
write just

409
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,000
imagine that you can write an entry in

410
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,278
this uh

411
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,039
special shared ledger once every hour

412
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,439
well you know what you're going to do if

413
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:35,599
you ever know one transaction per hour

414
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,399
the world that doesn't go around so you

415
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,759
need to have scalability means here that

416
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,799
you can somehow write a lot of

417
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,679
transaction

418
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,958
and then you can read them and everybody

419
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,159
can validate them

420
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:52,559
and that is the speed and and this

421
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,799
and the number of transactions are per

422
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,958
second and the fact that they are shared

423
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,359
so you want to have this

424
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,159
this uh the speed not only in writing

425
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,680
but in in

426
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,399
sharing and uh and uh an inspection for

427
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,439
validity

428
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,278
this is scalability the world is big

429
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
the world wants to interact with the

430
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,958
people want to interact with each other

431
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,720
and you better be prepared to have a

432
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,599
ledger in which you can write lots and

433
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,600
lots and lots of

434
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,800
transactions in this special way very

435
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,720
very very quickly

436
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,240
so maybe from a more mathematical

437
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,480
perspective or

438
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,560
can we say something about how much

439
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,360
scalability is needed

440
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,000
for a world that is big well it really

441
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,480
depends

442
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,360
how many transactions so you want but

443
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,159
remember

444
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,519
veteran um i i think you know i'm right

445
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,879
now yet to go into

446
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,320
at least thousands of transactions are

447
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:46,958
per second even if you look at the norm

448
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,839
credit cards right you know we are going

449
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,518
to go from

450
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,000
an average of 1600 to peaks over 20 000

451
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,120
or

452
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,240
40 000 something like this but

453
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,919
but remember it's not only a question of

454
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,440
the transaction per se but

455
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:06,240
the value is that the transaction

456
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,320
is actually been shared and visible to

457
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,278
everybody and the certainty that that is

458
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,639
the case

459
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,720
i can print them on my own printer

460
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,919
way more transactions but nobody has the

461
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,480
time to see or

462
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,759
to inspect that doesn't count right so

463
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,079
you want

464
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,919
scalability at this common knowledge

465
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,239
level that is the challenge

466
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,399
i also meant from a perspective of like

467
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,039
uh like a complexity analysis

468
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,879
so does it you know when you get more

469
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,639
and more people involved

470
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,559
doesn't need to scale in some kind of

471
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,360
way that uh

472
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,879
like do you do you like to see certain

473
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
kind of properties in order to say

474
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,639
something is scalable

475
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,679
oh absolutely i took a little bit

476
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,399
implicitly that

477
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,120
the people transacting are actually very

478
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,759
different

479
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,399
so if there is a two people who can do

480
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,919
uh

481
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,839
fast and satisfaction per second with

482
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,759
each other this is not so interesting

483
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,680
what do we really need is to save

484
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,360
billions of people and at any point in

485
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,919
time you know thousands and thousands of

486
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,480
them

487
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,359
want to transact with each other and you

488
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,640
want to support

489
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:12,159
that so algorand uh

490
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,038
it solves so that's the the the company

491
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,880
the team

492
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,798
of cryptographers mathematicians

493
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,959
engineers so on that challenge the

494
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,599
blockchain trilemma

495
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,360
so let's break it down in terms of

496
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,838
achieving scalability

497
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,359
how do we achieve scalability in the

498
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,720
space of blockchain in the space of

499
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,240
cryptocurrency

500
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,240
okay so uh scalability security remember

501
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,839
and the decentralization nice so

502
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,440
that's what they want what's the best

503
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,959
way to approach can we break it down

504
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,960
let's start with scalability

505
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,480
and think about how do we achieve it

506
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,480
well to achieve it

507
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,480
one at a time is perhaps elise even

508
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,919
security if nobody transacts

509
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,120
nobody loses money so beta is secure but

510
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,160
it's not scalable so let me tell you i'm

511
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,279
a cryptographer

512
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,320
so i try to fight the bad guys

513
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,960
and what what you want is that a vessel

514
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:07,599
ledger that we discussed before

515
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,880
uh cannot be tampered with so you must

516
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,439
think of it avetta

517
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,160
is a special link that nobody can erase

518
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,519
okay then

519
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,720
it has to be everybody should be able

520
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:21,679
uh to read and not to

521
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,319
alter the pages or the content of the

522
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,360
pages

523
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,000
that's okay but you know what that is

524
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,000
actually

525
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,160
easy cryptographically easy

526
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,960
cryptographical means you can use

527
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,440
tools invented 50 years ago which in

528
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,160
cryptographic time is prehistory okay we

529
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,558
are

530
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,480
cavemen working around and solve their

531
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,319
problem in cryptography land

532
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,000
but you know but there is really a

533
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,759
fundamental problem which is really

534
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,480
almost a social seems a political

535
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,759
problem is to say

536
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:55,679
who the hell chooses

537
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:58,480
or publishes the next page of villager

538
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,200
i mean that is really the challenge this

539
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,519
ledger

540
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,640
you can always add a page because more

541
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,558
transactions to be

542
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,000
written on there and somebody has to

543
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,558
assemble with

544
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,160
this transaction put them on a page and

545
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,399
under the next page

546
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,400
who is the somebody who chooses the page

547
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,720
and adds it on who can be trusted to do

548
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,200
it

549
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,200
exactly assume it is me for what i'm

550
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,319
being not that i want to volunteer for a

551
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,720
job but

552
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,480
then i would have more power than any

553
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,400
absolute monarch in history

554
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,960
because i would have a tremendous power

555
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,840
to say these are the transactions that

556
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,319
the entire

557
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,279
world should see and whatever i don't

558
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,279
write

559
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,399
this transaction will never see the

560
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,119
light of day

561
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,679
i mean no one had any such a power in

562
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,199
history

563
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:46,080
so it's very important to uh to do that

564
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,200
and that is the quintessential problem

565
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,359
in a blockchain

566
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,120
and uh people have thought about it to

567
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,240
say it's not me it's not you but

568
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,918
for instance in uh proof of work

569
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,000
what people say is to say okay it's not

570
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,759
me it's not you you know what it is

571
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,599
we make a very difficult we invent an

572
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,158
a cryptographic puzzle very hard to

573
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,558
solve the first one to solve that

574
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,360
as the right to add one page to the

575
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:12,558
ledger

576
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,279
on behalf of everybody else and that's

577
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,480
now is

578
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,240
seems okay because you know sometimes i

579
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,038
solve a puzzle before you do sometimes

580
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,960
you solve

581
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,240
before i do or before somebody else

582
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,960
somebody else solves it

583
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,079
it's okay and presumably the effort you

584
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
put in

585
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,519
is somehow correlated with how much

586
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,440
trust

587
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:35,200
you should be given to add to the ledger

588
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,960
yeah so somehow you want to make sure

589
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,519
that you know you need to

590
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,400
work because you want to prevent you

591
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,960
want to make sure

592
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,000
that you know you get a one solution

593
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,640
every 10 minutes

594
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,679
say like in particular example of

595
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,240
bitcoin

596
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,600
so that is very rare but two pages are

597
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,919
added at the same time

598
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,519
because if i solve the puzzle at the

599
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,400
same time you do

600
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,759
you could happen that if it happens once

601
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,840
or twice we can survive

602
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,119
it but if it happens you know every

603
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,759
other page you know

604
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,359
is a double page of when uh which of the

605
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,240
two is the real page it becomes a

606
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,519
problem

607
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,240
so that's why in bitcoin it is important

608
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,720
that to have

609
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,079
substantial amount of work so that no

610
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,440
many how many people try

611
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,759
on earth to solve a puzzle you have

612
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,440
one solution out of how many people are

613
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,079
trying every 10 minutes

614
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,798
so that you have you distantiate this

615
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,720
pages

616
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,400
and you have the time to propagate for

617
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,640
the network resolution

618
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
and the page attached to it and

619
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,159
therefore there is one page at a time

620
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,559
that is added

621
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,840
and they say well why don't we do that

622
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,839
we have a solution

623
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,480
well first of all a page every 10

624
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,558
minutes

625
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,679
is not fast enough it's a question of

626
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,480
scalability

627
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,159
and second of all to ensure that no

628
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,679
matter how many people

629
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,840
try you get a one page generator minutes

630
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,440
one solution to the riddle every 10

631
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,959
minutes this means

632
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,240
that the riddle becomes very very hard

633
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,798
and to to have a chance to solve it

634
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,400
in within 10 minutes you must have such

635
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,960
an expensive

636
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,759
apparatus in terms of specialized

637
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,360
computers not

638
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,679
one not two but thousands and thousands

639
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,319
of them and they produce a tons of heat

640
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,320
okay these

641
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,240
they dissipate it like maniac and you

642
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,839
need to refrigerate them too

643
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,759
and so then now you have air

644
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,599
conditioning uh galore

645
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,119
to add to the thing it becomes so

646
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,599
expensive

647
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,719
that fewer and fewer and fewer people

648
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,480
can actually

649
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:40,558
compete in order to add to the page and

650
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:45,279
the problem becomes a so some

651
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:46,720
crucial vietnam in in in bitcoin um

652
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,879
depending on which day of the week you

653
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,400
look at it you are going to have

654
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,200
two or three mining pools are really

655
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,919
the ones are uh capable of controlling

656
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,240
the chain

657
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,360
so you're saying that uh that's almost

658
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,480
like uh

659
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,359
at least a centralization right it

660
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,880
started being

661
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,519
decentralized and uh but the expenses

662
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,039
become

663
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,279
higher and higher and higher when the

664
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,798
cost becomes higher and higher fewer and

665
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,440
fewer people can afford them

666
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,038
and then you know it becomes you know de

667
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,840
facto centralized right

668
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:22,079
yeah and uh in a different type of

669
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:23,839
approach

670
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,359
is instead for instance a delegated

671
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:29,038
proof of stake

672
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:32,399
which is also very easy to explain

673
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:35,599
essentially boils down to to say well

674
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,840
look at these 21 people say okay

675
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:38,879
don't they look honest yes they do in

676
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:40,558
fact

677
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,640
i believe if they're going to remain

678
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,480
honest for the foreseeable future so

679
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,720
when do we do ourselves a favor

680
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,278
let's entrust them to add the page

681
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,880
on behalf of all of us to the ledger

682
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,599
okay

683
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,520
okay but now we are going to say is this

684
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,240
centralized or decentralized well

685
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,038
21 is better than one what to say is

686
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,278
very little

687
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,200
so if you look at uh when people

688
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,038
rebelled to centralized power i don't

689
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,919
know the french revolutions okay

690
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,599
there was a monarch and the nobles yes

691
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,679
were there 21 nobles

692
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,000
no there were thousands of them but

693
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,200
there were millions and millions of

694
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
disempowered citizens so one is

695
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,400
centralized

696
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,919
21 is also centralized right so that's

697
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,519
delegated proof of stake

698
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,038
delegate kind of like a representative

699
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:33,839
democracy i guess

700
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:33,839
yes which is good working great right

701
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,400
there's problems there are problems yeah

702
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,798
and

703
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,200
and so we were looking for a different

704
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:49,759
uh

705
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,319
um when thinking about algonquin for a

706
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,879
different approach

707
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,278
and so we have a man approaching retinol

708
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,039
is really really decentralized because

709
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:02,720
essentially um

710
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,200
it works as follows so you have a bunch

711
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,278
of tokens right these are the tokens

712
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,360
and that have equal power and you have

713
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,440
to say 10 billions of tokens distributed

714
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:15,199
from um

715
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:19,200
to the entire world and the owners

716
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:22,960
each token has a chance to add value

717
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,600
equal probability driver everybody else

718
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,798
in fact actually if you want here is how

719
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,759
it works

720
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,359
so think about you know by some magic

721
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,440
cryptographic process

722
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,719
which is not magic it's mathematics but

723
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,240
think about the magic

724
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,240
assume that you select a thousand tokens

725
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,240
and so sometimes a random okay and you

726
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,200
have a guarantee that were handled

727
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,640
selected

728
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,360
and then this the owners of this 1000

729
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,159
tokens

730
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,599
somehow agree on the next page they all

731
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,720
sign it

732
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:59,278
and that's the next page okay

733
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,839
so it is clear that you know nobody has

734
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,798
the power but you know

735
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,599
once uh up in a while one of your tokens

736
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,798
is selected

737
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:11,599
and you are in charge of this committee

738
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,158
to select the next page but this goes

739
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,278
around

740
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,600
very quickly so and if you look at this

741
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,359
the question really is that is not

742
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:22,079
really centralized

743
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:24,798
and because of what for for agreeing on

744
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:27,759
the same page it is important that

745
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,038
the 1000 tokens that you're randomly

746
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,158
selected

747
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:34,879
are in honest ends the majority of them

748
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,640
so which if the majority of the tokens

749
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,559
are in honest ends that is

750
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,320
essentially true because if the majority

751
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,918
of the tokens are in honest ends

752
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,480
if you select say 90 percent of the

753
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,360
people

754
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,319
are 90 percent of the tokens are in

755
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,199
honest hands

756
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:55,278
so can you randomly select a thousand in

757
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,240
this thousand you find the 501

758
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,880
tokens in bad ends very very improbable

759
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,159
so

760
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,000
basically uh when a large fraction of

761
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,679
people are honest then you can use

762
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,798
randomness as a powerful tool to get

763
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:12,000
decentralization

764
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,319
so what does honesty mean and uh now

765
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,278
we're

766
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,639
into the social side of things which is

767
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,159
uh

768
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,200
how do we know that

769
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,039
like the fraction a large fraction of uh

770
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,080
people or participating parties are

771
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,319
honest

772
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,759
that is an excellent question so by the

773
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,960
way first of all we should

774
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,480
realize that the same thing is for every

775
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,200
other system when you look at proof of

776
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,319
work

777
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,600
you realize that the majority of the

778
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,918
mining power

779
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,079
is in honest hands yes when you look at

780
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,640
a delegated proof of stake

781
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,240
you realize that the majority of these

782
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,640
21 people are honest

783
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,839
what is the difference the difference is

784
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,559
veta

785
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,759
in these other systems you soon to say

786
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,879
the whole economy

787
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:03,200
is secure if the majority of this

788
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:06,000
small piece of economy are honest

789
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,200
and that is a big question but instead

790
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,240
what

791
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,319
in our grand in our approach we say

792
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,759
the whole economy is secure if the

793
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,398
majority of economy

794
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,640
is honest in other words who can subvert

795
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,278
all grant is not a majority of a small

796
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,440
group

797
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,679
but is a majority of the token holders

798
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,000
had to conspire with each other in order

799
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,480
to think of a very economy for which

800
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,119
they own the majority of yes but i think

801
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,880
it is a bit

802
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,479
harder too like a self-destructive

803
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,520
majority essentially

804
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,399
and you're also making me realize that

805
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,839
basically every system that we have in

806
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,639
the world today

807
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:45,038
assumes that the majority of

808
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,120
participants is honest

809
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,079
yes the only difference is the majority

810
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,079
of whom

811
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,639
and in in some cases the majority of a

812
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,519
club and in our case is the majority of

813
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,278
the old system

814
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,000
the whole the whole system okay so

815
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:01,759
that's that's fast so through that kind

816
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,038
of uh random

817
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,278
sampling you can achieve

818
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:08,720
decentralization

819
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:11,839
you can achieve so the scalability

820
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,240
i understand and then the security that

821
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,119
you're

822
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,798
referring to basically the security

823
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,359
comes from the fact that

824
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,960
the sample selected would uh likely

825
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,839
include honest people

826
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,038
so it's very difficult to so by the way

827
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,798
the security as you

828
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,200
as you mentioned that you're referring

829
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:32,480
to is basically

830
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,159
security against dishonesty right or

831
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,399
manipulation or whatever yes

832
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,399
yes so essentially when what you're

833
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:39,119
going to to do is to be following and

834
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:41,359
say say well

835
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,278
silvio i understood what you're saying

836
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,119
but somebody has to randomly selected

837
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,798
with tokens when i believe you so then

838
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,278
who does this random selection that's a

839
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,319
good point

840
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,200
and uh in uh in algorithm we do

841
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,240
something a little bit

842
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,600
unorthodox essentially is

843
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,000
the token choose themselves

844
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,398
at random and you say if you think about

845
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,240
it that seems to be a terrible idea

846
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,000
because if you want to say choose

847
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,399
yourself at random and whoever chooses

848
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,200
himself is a fuss and people committee

849
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,158
you choose the page for for the rest of

850
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,840
us

851
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,200
and because if i'm a bad person i'm

852
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,038
going to select myself

853
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,519
over and over again because i want to be

854
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:22,640
part of the committee every single time

855
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,639
but not so fast so what do we do

856
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,960
in algon what does it mean that i select

857
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,799
myself that each one of us

858
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,240
in the privacy of our own computer

859
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:34,079
actually a laptop

860
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,359
what you do is that you execute your own

861
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:40,398
individual lottery and

862
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:41,599
uh think about that you pull a lever of

863
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:44,239
a slot machine

864
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,038
you can only pull the lever once not

865
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,200
until you win

866
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,240
not enough times until you win and when

867
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,720
you pull the lever

868
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,200
case one either you win in such a case

869
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,960
you have a winning ticket

870
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,480
or you lose you don't get any winning

871
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,960
ticket so

872
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,038
if you don't have a winning ticket you

873
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,919
can say anything you want about the next

874
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,240
page in village nobody pays attention

875
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,759
but

876
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,000
if you ever winning ticket people say oh

877
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:11,839
wow this is one of the 1000 winning

878
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,278
tickets we better pay attention to what

879
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:17,199
he or she says

880
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:19,519
and that's how it works and the lottery

881
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,880
is a cryptographic lottery which means

882
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,319
that even if i am

883
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,880
an entire nation extremely powerful with

884
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:29,359
incredible computing powers i don't have

885
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,480
the ability to improve even minimally my

886
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,918
probability

887
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,240
of one talking winning the lottery and

888
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,759
that's how it happens so everybody pulls

889
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,200
the lever

890
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,319
the 1000 random winners say oh here is

891
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,480
my winning

892
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,879
ticket and here is my opinion up or down

893
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,480
above the block these are the ones that

894
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,120
count

895
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,880
and if you think about it while this is

896
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,719
distributed because there is

897
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,880
in the case of argon there is a 10

898
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,038
billion tokens and you select a

899
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,720
1000 of them more distributed than this

900
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,919
you cannot get

901
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,159
and then why is this you know scalable

902
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,120
because what you have to do okay yeah to

903
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,919
do the lottery

904
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:12,398
how long the lottery takes it takes

905
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,480
actually one microsecond

906
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,398
whether you have one token or two tokens

907
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,079
or a billion tokens is always one

908
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,959
microsecond of computation

909
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:24,000
which is very fast we don't hit the

910
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,120
planet with a microsecond of computation

911
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,159
and and finally why is this secure

912
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:33,359
because even if i were

913
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,159
a very evil and very very powerful

914
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,158
individual

915
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,278
i'm so powerful that i can corrupt

916
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,399
anybody i want

917
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,960
instantaneously in the world

918
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:43,839
whomever i want to corrupt the people in

919
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,679
the committee

920
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:48,558
so that i can choose the page of the

921
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:52,000
legion but i do have a problem

922
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:54,319
i do not know whom i should corrupt

923
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,398
should i corrupt this lady in shanghai

924
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,079
the sovereign guy in paris

925
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,918
because i don't know i should the

926
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,278
winners are random so i don't know whom

927
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,159
i should corrupt

928
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,519
but once the winner come forward and say

929
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,519
here is my winning ticket

930
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,960
and you propagate your winning ticket

931
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,960
across the network

932
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,919
together with your opinion about the

933
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,679
block now i know who they are

934
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,960
for sure i can corrupt all thousands of

935
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,399
them given to my

936
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,120
incredible powers but so what whatever

937
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:25,038
they said they already said and they're

938
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:26,879
winning tickets and their opinions

939
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:30,000
are virally propagated across the

940
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,000
network and i do not have the power

941
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,200
no more than the us government or any

942
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,640
government has the power

943
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,319
to put back in the bottle a message

944
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,480
virally propagated by wikileaks

945
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,480
so everything you've just described is

946
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,759
kind of it's fascinating

947
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,360
a set of ideas and you know online i've

948
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,278
been reading quite a bit and people are

949
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:54,719
really excited about a set of ideas

950
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:58,558
nevertheless it is not the

951
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,759
dominating technology today so bitcoin

952
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:04,319
in terms of cryptocurrency is the

953
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,038
most popular uh cryptocurrency and then

954
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,359
ethereum

955
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,199
and so on so it's useful to kind of

956
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,480
comment we already talked about proof of

957
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,598
work a little bit

958
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,559
but what in your sense does bitcoin get

959
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,440
right

960
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:19,759
and where is it lacking okay so the

961
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,878
first thing that bitcoin got right

962
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,000
is to understand that there was the need

963
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,239
of a cryptocurrency and that my opinion

964
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,960
of

965
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:31,039
trumps would deserve all the success

966
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,800
because they said the time is ripe from

967
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,480
this idea yes because very often

968
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,000
is not enough to be right here to be

969
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,719
right at the right time yes

970
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,320
and uh somebody got it right there so

971
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,759
hot off to bitcoin

972
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,720
for that and um and so what they got to

973
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,040
write

974
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:51,918
is they make that is make if it is hard

975
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,800
to subvert and change value to to cancel

976
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,559
a

977
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,240
transaction it's not impossible that is

978
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,358
very hard

979
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,319
what they did not get right is

980
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:03,920
somehow is a great story of value

981
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,640
currency wise

982
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,760
but money is not only a question that

983
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,679
you store it

984
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,280
and you put under the mattress money

985
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,838
wants to be transacted

986
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,480
and the transaction in bitcoins are very

987
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,799
little

988
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,800
so if you want to store value everybody

989
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,560
needs a store value might as well

990
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,519
use a bitcoin i mean it's the brand but

991
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,239
if you are don't look at that for a

992
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:28,960
moment

993
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:30,000
at least is a great store of value and

994
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,920
everybody needs a store

995
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,440
of value but most of the time we want to

996
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,200
transact we want to interact we don't

997
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,920
put the money under the markets right

998
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,519
so we wanted to try and bet they didn't

999
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,320
get it right that is

1000
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:44,719
too slow to transact to too few

1001
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,599
transactions scalability basically the

1002
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,598
issue

1003
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,720
is it possible to build stuff on top of

1004
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,519
bitcoin

1005
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,480
that's uh sort of uh fixes the

1006
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,159
scalability

1007
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,679
i mean this is the thing you look at

1008
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,838
there's a bunch of technologies that

1009
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:02,000
kind of

1010
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:05,199
hit the right need at the right time

1011
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,199
and they have flaws but we kind of build

1012
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:10,000
infrastructures on top of them

1013
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,639
over time to fix it as opposed to

1014
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,679
getting it

1015
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,879
right from the beginning or is is it

1016
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,039
difficult to do

1017
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,320
well that is difficult to do so you're

1018
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,279
talking to somebody

1019
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,800
that when i decided to throw my heart in

1020
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,040
the arena

1021
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,720
and i decided first of all i as i said

1022
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,800
before i much admire

1023
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,639
my predecessors i mean they got it right

1024
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,839
a lot of things and i

1025
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,319
and i i really am admired for that but

1026
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,519
you know

1027
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,119
i had a choice to make either high patch

1028
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,639
something with other holes all over the

1029
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,160
place or i start from scratch

1030
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,838
i decided to start from scratch because

1031
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:45,199
sometimes it's a better way so what

1032
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:47,440
about

1033
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,879
ethereum which looks at proof of stake

1034
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,920
and a lot of different

1035
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,160
innovative ideas that kind of improve or

1036
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,039
seek to improve on some of the flaws of

1037
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,199
bitcoin

1038
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,119
etio made another great idea so they

1039
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:02,159
figured out if it was

1040
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,880
that money and payments are important as

1041
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,000
they are

1042
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,039
they are only the first level the first

1043
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,400
stepping stone

1044
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:12,480
the next level are smart contracts and

1045
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,519
they were at the vision to say

1046
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:19,039
the people will need smart contract

1047
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:21,119
which allow me and you to somehow to to

1048
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,358
transact securely without being shopped

1049
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,320
around by a trusted third party by a

1050
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:25,838
mediator

1051
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,519
by the way because the mediators are

1052
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:29,679
hard to find

1053
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,679
and in fact maybe even impossible to

1054
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,319
find if you live in thailand and i live

1055
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,639
in um

1056
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,000
in new zealand maybe we don't have a

1057
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,279
common person that we know

1058
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,440
and trust and even if we find them

1059
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,640
guess what they want to be paid so much

1060
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,920
so right that uh

1061
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:48,879
six percent of the world uh gdp is

1062
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,320
uh goes into financial friction which is

1063
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,640
essentially third party

1064
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,920
so the headed right of the world needed

1065
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:58,000
that

1066
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:01,200
but again the scalability

1067
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,400
is not there and the system

1068
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:08,480
is of smart contracts in the is slow

1069
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:11,599
and expensive and and i believe

1070
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,240
is not enough to satisfy the appetite

1071
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,880
and the need

1072
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:17,118
we have for smart contracts well what do

1073
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,599
you make of just as a small sort of

1074
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,160
a side in human history perhaps it's a

1075
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,720
big one

1076
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,559
is the nft the non-fungible tokens do

1077
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,559
you find those interesting technically

1078
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,078
or is it more interesting on the social

1079
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,960
side of things

1080
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,519
well both i think you know i think it's

1081
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,838
um

1082
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,199
nfts are actually great right so you

1083
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:38,159
have always um

1084
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,118
you're an artist to create a a song or

1085
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:44,559
you could be

1086
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:47,119
um a piece of art

1087
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,679
he has many unique representation right

1088
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,720
over

1089
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:52,078
of unique uh uh a piece whether he's an

1090
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:55,199
artifact of uh

1091
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,880
uh something dream napa by you and uh

1092
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,799
and as unique representation but now you

1093
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,880
can trade and allow

1094
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,920
in the important part is that now you

1095
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,880
have a visa

1096
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,680
not only the nfts themselves but the

1097
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,400
ability

1098
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:13,838
to trade them quickly fast securely

1099
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:17,200
knowing that who owns which rights and

1100
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:19,440
that gives a totally new opportunity for

1101
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,799
content creators to be remunerated for

1102
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,280
what they do

1103
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,880
so but ultimately you still have to have

1104
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,839
that scalability security

1105
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,640
and decentralization to to make it you

1106
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:32,799
know

1107
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,679
to make it work for bigger and bigger

1108
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,160
applications

1109
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:38,799
correct yeah yeah i still wonder what

1110
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:41,519
kind of applications are yet to be

1111
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,560
like enabled by it because so much the

1112
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,838
interesting thing about

1113
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:47,199
nft is you know if you look outside of

1114
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,480
art

1115
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,960
is uh just like money you can start

1116
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,079
playing with different social

1117
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,880
constructs is you can start

1118
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,880
playing with ideas you can start playing

1119
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,400
with um

1120
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,119
with uh even like investing somebody was

1121
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,880
talking about almost creating an economy

1122
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,720
out of uh

1123
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,559
like uh creative people or influencers

1124
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:15,759
like if you start a youtube channel or

1125
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:18,078
something like that

1126
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,720
you can invest in that person and you

1127
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,359
can start trading their creations

1128
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:25,039
and then almost like create a market out

1129
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:26,239
of people's ideas out of people's

1130
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,679
creations out of

1131
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,759
the people themselves that

1132
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,358
generate those creations and there's a

1133
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,720
lot of interesting possibilities of what

1134
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,400
you can do with that i mean it seems

1135
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,199
ridiculous but

1136
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,720
you're basically creating a hierarchy of

1137
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:44,159
value

1138
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:47,519
maybe artificial in the digital world

1139
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,199
and are trading that but in so doing are

1140
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,480
inspiring people to

1141
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,960
create so maybe uh

1142
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,679
as a sort of our economy gets better and

1143
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,119
better and better

1144
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:01,199
where actual work in the physical space

1145
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,358
uh becomes less and less in terms of its

1146
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:07,358
importance maybe we'll completely be

1147
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:09,519
operating in a digital space where

1148
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,559
where these kinds of economies have more

1149
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:12,239
and more power

1150
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:13,599
and then you have to have this kind of

1151
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,479
blockchains

1152
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,519
to uh the scalability security and

1153
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,159
decentralization

1154
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:20,960
and decentralization is of course the

1155
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,000
tricky one

1156
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,280
because uh people in power start to get

1157
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,039
nervous

1158
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,599
absolutely once in power you always

1159
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,838
never

1160
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,960
be supplanted by somebody else but this

1161
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:34,639
is your job

1162
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,559
see you congratulations you don't have a

1163
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:37,440
job the top job and now everybody wants

1164
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:40,480
it

1165
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,960
well what is your sense about our our

1166
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,318
time

1167
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,280
and the future hope about the

1168
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:47,759
decentralization

1169
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,640
of power do you think that's something

1170
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,760
that we can actually achieve

1171
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,679
uh given that power corrupts and

1172
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,599
absolute power corrupts absolutely and

1173
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,960
it's so wonderful to be

1174
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,920
absolutely powerful well good question

1175
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,400
savage

1176
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,039
so first of all i believe by the way

1177
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,559
there is a

1178
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:11,759
um it's a complex questions uh lex um

1179
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:14,000
um uh and like uh all the rest of your

1180
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,920
questions

1181
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,719
i'm so very sorry it's okay i am

1182
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,440
enjoying it

1183
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,480
so but uh so there are two things first

1184
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,960
of all

1185
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,079
power has been um centralized for

1186
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,000
various reasons

1187
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,359
when you want to get it is easier for

1188
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,318
somebody

1189
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,838
even a single law person to grab power

1190
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:37,838
but there is also

1191
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:40,880
some kind of a technology lack thereof

1192
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,960
that justified having power because

1193
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,000
in a way in a society in which even

1194
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,000
communication never

1195
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,599
mind blockchain which is common

1196
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,719
knowledge but even simple

1197
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,480
unilateral communication is hard it is

1198
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:56,239
much easier to say

1199
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,400
you do as i say because the alternative

1200
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:00,719
but as so there is a little bit of a

1201
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,559
technology barrier but i think of it

1202
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,078
and and now to get to this common

1203
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,799
knowledge of it is a totally different

1204
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,720
story

1205
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,839
now we have finally the technology for

1206
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,919
doing this so

1207
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,199
that is one part but i really believe

1208
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,119
that you know not

1209
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,759
by having a distributed system not only

1210
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,079
you don't have a

1211
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,839
you have actually much more stable and

1212
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,160
durable system

1213
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,759
because not only for corruption but even

1214
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,118
for things that go astray and you give

1215
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,880
it a long enough time

1216
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:31,920
by stranger version of murphy's law

1217
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,280
whatever goes wrong goes wrong

1218
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,760
and so and if you the power is diffused

1219
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,880
you actually are much more stable if you

1220
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,480
look at uh

1221
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,200
any any living uh

1222
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,760
complex living being is distributed i

1223
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,239
mean um

1224
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,000
uh i don't know if somebody is a okay

1225
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:52,078
tell silvia now it's time to eat uh

1226
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,400
right so you have millions of cells in

1227
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,480
your body you have billions of bacteria

1228
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,960
exactly help me in the guts everything

1229
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,559
you know we are in a soup of it somehow

1230
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,800
it keeps us alive yes it is uh and

1231
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,799
so and strange enough however when we

1232
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,640
design systems

1233
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,359
we designed them centralized we

1234
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,679
ourselves are distributed beings

1235
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,480
and when we plan and say okay i want to

1236
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,679
create

1237
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,400
an architecture how about i i make a

1238
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,440
pyramid

1239
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,318
i put west on the top and

1240
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,880
the power flows down and um and so again

1241
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:27,279
it's a

1242
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,200
little bit perhaps of a technology

1243
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,680
problem but now the technology is there

1244
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:33,519
so that is a big challenge to rethink

1245
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:36,879
how we want to organize power

1246
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:39,039
um in very large system and uh

1247
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,280
and and and distribute the system in my

1248
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,838
opinion are much more resilient

1249
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,850
let's put this way there was a mine of

1250
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:45,920
my

1251
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,759
[Music]

1252
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,599
italian competitors right you know

1253
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,839
machiavelli who

1254
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,680
looked at the time there was a big there

1255
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,599
was a bunch of a small state

1256
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,039
democratic republic of florence of

1257
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,880
venison and the other thing

1258
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,719
and there was the ottoman empire that at

1259
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,200
the time was an empire and

1260
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,759
assad and was very centralized and he

1261
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:07,679
made a political observation

1262
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,359
that goes roughly to say whenever you

1263
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:09,838
have such a centralized thing it's very

1264
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,279
hard

1265
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:14,480
to overtake but that former government

1266
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,680
is centralized

1267
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,039
but if you get it it's so easy to keep

1268
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,358
the population

1269
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,159
one instead with other uh with other

1270
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:25,679
things a much

1271
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,759
more resilient time

1272
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,799
when the power is distributed is much

1273
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,880
more it's going to be

1274
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,079
lasting for much longer time and

1275
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,000
ultimately maybe

1276
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,200
the human spirit wants that kind of

1277
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,838
resilience wants that kind of

1278
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,598
distribution

1279
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:39,519
it's just that we didn't have technology

1280
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,160
throughout history machiavelli didn't

1281
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,440
have

1282
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:46,719
the computer the internet and uh

1283
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,280
certainly part of a reason yes you've

1284
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,239
written an interesting blog post if we

1285
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,160
take a step

1286
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:56,959
out of the realm of bits and into this

1287
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,559
the realm of governance you wrote a blog

1288
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,519
post about making algorand

1289
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,119
governance decentralized now can you

1290
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:04,318
explain what that means the philosophy

1291
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,559
behind that

1292
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:08,239
you know how how do you decentralize

1293
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,199
basically all aspects

1294
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,639
of this kind of system well the

1295
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,838
philosophy

1296
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,400
and the how let's start with the

1297
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:19,440
philosophy so i really believe

1298
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:22,400
that uh nothing fixed

1299
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,880
last very long and and so i really

1300
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,920
believe

1301
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:30,000
that life is about intelligent

1302
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:34,240
adaptation things change and we have to

1303
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:39,039
be nimble and adjust to change and

1304
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,039
when i when i see a lot of of a

1305
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:44,159
crypto project actually very proud to

1306
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:47,519
say it's fixed in stone

1307
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:49,199
um right you know code is law law is

1308
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:49,920
called a verify of the code that will

1309
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:51,919
never change

1310
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,200
you go wow when i'm saying this is a

1311
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,119
recipe to me of disaster not immediately

1312
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,118
soon just imagine you take an ocean

1313
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,640
liner and you want to go

1314
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:06,480
i don't know from lisbon

1315
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:10,159
to new york and you set the course

1316
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,639
iceberg no iceberg tempest not tempest

1317
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:12,639
and all

1318
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,159
it doesn't matter you keep on going but

1319
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,960
it's not the way you need

1320
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,239
a teal you need to correct you need to

1321
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,838
adjust

1322
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:23,439
and um and so on um by the way we design

1323
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:27,039
algorithm with the idea

1324
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,838
that the code was evolving

1325
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,480
as the needs and of course however is a

1326
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:32,239
system

1327
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,240
in which and every time there is an

1328
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:34,719
adjustment you must have essentially a

1329
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,159
vote

1330
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:40,159
that right now is orchestrated

1331
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:42,159
at 90 percent of the stake they say okay

1332
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,799
we are ready we agree on the next

1333
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,279
version

1334
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,640
and we pick up this version so we are

1335
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,559
able to evolve without

1336
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:51,039
losing too many components left and

1337
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,519
right but i think without evolving

1338
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,279
any system essentially become aesthetic

1339
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,318
and that is going to shrivel

1340
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,640
and die sooner or later and and so that

1341
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,000
is

1342
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:03,679
uh is needed and what you want to do

1343
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,480
under the blockchain you have a

1344
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:10,719
perfect platform in which you can log

1345
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,480
your wishes your votes your thing so

1346
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:14,558
that you have a guarantee that

1347
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,838
whatever vote you express is actually

1348
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,960
seen by everybody else

1349
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,558
so everybody sees really the outcome or

1350
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,800
call it of a referendum

1351
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:26,960
of a change and veto is uh in my opinion

1352
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,720
a system that wants to live long as to

1353
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,920
adapt

1354
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,639
there is an interesting question about

1355
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,639
leaders i've talked to vitalik buter and

1356
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:36,960
i'll probably talk to him again soon

1357
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:38,719
he's the

1358
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,800
one of the leaders maybe one of the

1359
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:43,199
faces of the ethereum project

1360
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,200
and it's interesting you have uh uh

1361
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:47,838
satoshi nakamoto who's

1362
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:48,960
the face of bitcoin i guess but he's

1363
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:52,078
faceless

1364
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,079
he she they

1365
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,358
it does seem like in our whatever it is

1366
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:00,480
maybe it's 20th century

1367
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:03,358
maybe it's machiavellian thinking but

1368
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,480
we seek leaders leaders have value linus

1369
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:07,838
torvald

1370
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,240
the leader of uh of linux

1371
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:11,519
um the open source development a lot i

1372
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:13,919
mean there's no

1373
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,679
it's not it's not that the leadership is

1374
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,079
sort of dogmatic

1375
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:23,519
but it's inspiring and it's also

1376
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:26,400
powerful in that through leaders

1377
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:28,318
we propagate the vision like the vision

1378
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,720
of the project is more stable

1379
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:32,480
maybe not the details but the vision and

1380
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:35,199
so do you think there's value

1381
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,079
to because we're there's a tension

1382
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:41,039
between decentralization and leadership

1383
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,400
like in visionary yes what do you make

1384
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:44,719
of that attention

1385
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,400
okay so i really believe that if it's a

1386
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:47,118
another good question i think of it you

1387
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,358
know

1388
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,640
um i really believe in the power of

1389
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,279
emotions i think the

1390
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,480
emotion i have a creative impulse of

1391
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,440
everybody else and very

1392
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,079
very far is very easy for a leader to be

1393
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,519
a

1394
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:04,318
a physical person a real being and uh

1395
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,280
that interprets our emotions and by the

1396
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:07,599
way

1397
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,680
this emotion has to resonate and what is

1398
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,599
good is that

1399
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:13,199
the more intimate our emotions are the

1400
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,400
more universal they are

1401
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:18,799
paradoxically more personal the more

1402
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,880
everybody else yes somehow magically

1403
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,920
agrees and feels a bit the same

1404
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,480
and so and it's very important to have a

1405
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,639
leader in the initial phase that

1406
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,240
generates out or nothing something that

1407
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:32,799
is important leadership

1408
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,479
but then the true tested leadership is

1409
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,960
to disappear after you led

1410
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,480
the community so in my opinion the

1411
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,838
quintessential leader

1412
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,838
in my

1413
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:47,439
according to my vision is george

1414
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:49,598
washington he served for one term

1415
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,760
for another term and then all of a

1416
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,880
sudden he retired and became a private

1417
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,240
citizen

1418
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,559
and 200 and change years later

1419
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,719
we still are we send the facts but we

1420
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,640
have done a lot of things right

1421
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,358
and we have been able to evolve that to

1422
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:07,759
me is success in leadership

1423
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:09,358
when instead you contrast our experiment

1424
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,920
with a lot of experiments i've done

1425
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:12,558
so much so well that i want another four

1426
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,280
years

1427
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,640
and why shouldn't i be only a four and i

1428
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,240
have another eight

1429
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:20,318
why should be another eight give me

1430
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:22,719
sixteen and we'll fix all your problem

1431
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:24,480
and now then is the type in my opinion

1432
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:27,118
of failed dealership

1433
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,240
leadership ought to be really lead

1434
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,559
ignite

1435
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:31,919
and disappear and if you don't disappear

1436
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,319
the system is going to die

1437
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,599
with you and it's not a good idea for of

1438
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:37,199
everybody else

1439
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,800
is there so we've been talking a little

1440
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:41,679
bit about cryptocurrency but

1441
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,160
is there spaces where this kind of

1442
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:47,519
blockchain ideas that you're describing

1443
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:49,118
which i find fascinating uh do you think

1444
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,119
they can revolutionize some other

1445
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:54,079
aspects of our world

1446
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,280
that's not just money a lot of things

1447
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,559
are going to be

1448
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,200
revolutionized is uh is uh independent

1449
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,839
of finance

1450
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:06,558
by the way i really believe that um

1451
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:07,599
finance is uh an incredible form of

1452
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,519
freedom i mean

1453
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,200
if i free to do anything i want to but i

1454
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,199
don't even mean to do anything that's a

1455
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:13,598
bad idea so i really think the financial

1456
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:16,558
freedom

1457
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:18,240
is very very important but you know but

1458
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,640
you just i can say that you know

1459
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,558
against you know censorship you write

1460
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:23,440
something of a chain and now nobody can

1461
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,079
take it out you can't

1462
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,480
take it out that is a very important way

1463
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,599
to

1464
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,000
express you know um

1465
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,559
our view and um and then the

1466
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,119
transparency that uh

1467
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,040
that you give because everybody can see

1468
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,920
what's happening on the blockchain

1469
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,480
so transparency is not money but i

1470
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,599
believe

1471
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,240
the transparency actually is a very

1472
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,519
important

1473
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:50,399
ingredient also of finance let's put it

1474
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:52,159
this way

1475
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,838
as much as i'm enthusiastic about

1476
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:57,118
blockchain and

1477
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:59,358
decentralized finance um

1478
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,720
and we have actually our expression

1479
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:01,838
we're trying to be creating with the

1480
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,639
future five because

1481
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:04,960
as much as we want to do we must agree

1482
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:09,118
that

1483
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:12,159
the first guarantee of financial growth

1484
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,800
and prosperity are really the legal

1485
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,440
system

1486
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,960
the courts because we may not think

1487
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,519
about them and say oh the courts are

1488
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,400
kind of a bunch of boring lawyers but

1489
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:22,318
without them

1490
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,160
i'm saying there is no certainty there

1491
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:26,558
is no um

1492
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,799
notion of equality there is no notion

1493
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,800
that you can resolve your disputes

1494
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,720
thing that's what thrives the commerce

1495
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,160
and things and so what i really believe

1496
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:36,558
that the blockchain

1497
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:38,399
actually makes a lot of this trust

1498
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,599
essentially automatic by making it

1499
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,599
impossible to cheat in the way you don't

1500
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,880
even need to go to court

1501
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:50,880
if nobody can change a villager right

1502
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,720
so essentially is a way of

1503
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,079
you cannot solve and the legal system

1504
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:56,399
reduces to a blockchain

1505
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,318
but what i'm saying a big chunk of it

1506
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,240
can actually be

1507
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:03,679
guaranteed and there is no reason why

1508
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:05,679
technology should be antagonistic

1509
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:06,879
to legal scholarship it could be

1510
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,118
actually coexisting

1511
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,880
and one should start to doing the

1512
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,000
interesting things that the economy

1513
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,800
alone cannot do

1514
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,239
and then you go from there but but i

1515
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:21,519
think that is uh

1516
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:25,279
essentially is uh blockchain can affect

1517
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:28,960
all kinds of our yes in some sense the

1518
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,319
transparency the required transparency

1519
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,838
ensures honesty

1520
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:33,679
prevents corruption so there's a lot of

1521
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:34,960
system that could use that and the legal

1522
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,598
system is one of them

1523
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,679
there is a little bit of attention that

1524
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,720
i wonder if you can speak to

1525
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:44,960
where this kind of transparency there's

1526
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:48,558
a tension with privacy

1527
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:52,798
is it possible to achieve privacy

1528
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:54,160
if wanted on uh on a blockchain

1529
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:55,679
do you have do you have ideas about

1530
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:57,039
different technologies that can do that

1531
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:58,078
people have been playing with different

1532
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:01,279
ideas

1533
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:03,839
so absolutely the answer is that yes

1534
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,798
and um but by the way i'm a

1535
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,358
cryptographer

1536
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:08,719
right okay so i really believe in

1537
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:13,039
privacy and i believe

1538
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:15,679
in and never devoted an um

1539
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:17,358
a big chunk of my life to guarantee

1540
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,039
privacy even when it seems almost

1541
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,960
impossible to have it

1542
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,960
and and it is possible to everything

1543
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:26,559
also in the blockchain too

1544
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:29,280
and however i believe in timing

1545
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,599
as well and i believe that the people

1546
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,760
have

1547
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:39,359
the right to understand

1548
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:42,400
their system we live in and right now

1549
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:43,759
um people can understand the blockchain

1550
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,358
to be

1551
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,640
something that is not con cannot be

1552
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:50,880
altered

1553
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:52,318
and is uh transparent and that is good

1554
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,240
enough and right now

1555
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:56,639
any way to add and there is a pseudo

1556
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,118
privacy for the fact that

1557
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,798
who knows if this keys belong publicly

1558
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:03,039
belongs to me or to you

1559
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:04,400
right and i can when i want to change my

1560
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,159
money from one public key

1561
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,920
i split it through other public keys go

1562
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,519
on to figure out which one is silvio

1563
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,000
all of them are sylvia or only one of

1564
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:12,960
sylvia who knows so you get some vanilla

1565
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,199
privacy no

1566
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,079
no not the one i created and i think

1567
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:18,318
it's good enough

1568
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,240
because and it's important for now that

1569
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:22,239
we absorb the best stage

1570
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:24,239
because in the next stage we must

1571
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,439
understand the privacy tool rather than

1572
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:27,598
taking on faith

1573
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,599
when the public starts saying i believe

1574
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,280
in the scientist and whatever they say

1575
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,798
i swear by them and therefore if they

1576
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,640
tell me private is private

1577
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:36,719
and nobody understands it very well we

1578
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:39,920
need a much more

1579
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:43,039
educated about the tools we are using

1580
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,559
and so i look forward to deploying

1581
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:49,759
more and more privacy on the blockchain

1582
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:52,720
but we are not i i i will not

1583
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,559
rush to it until the people understand

1584
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:56,798
and are behind whatever we have right

1585
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,798
now

1586
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,240
so you build privacy on top of the power

1587
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,960
of the blockchain you have to first

1588
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:03,598
understand

1589
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,480
the power of the blockchain yes so

1590
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,318
algorand

1591
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,519
is like one of the most exciting

1592
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:10,719
technically at least

1593
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:12,159
from my perspective technologies ideas

1594
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:15,039
in this whole space

1595
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:16,719
what's the future of algon look like uh

1596
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:17,759
is it possible for it to dominate the

1597
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:21,519
world

1598
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:24,559
let's put the best way i certainly

1599
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:27,679
working very hard with a great team

1600
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:31,040
to give the best blockchain that

1601
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:33,598
one can demand and enjoy

1602
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,759
and they said i really believe that

1603
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,760
there is going to be

1604
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,400
it's not a winner takes them all so it's

1605
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:44,079
going to be a few blockchains

1606
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,880
and each one is going to have its own

1607
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,680
brand and it's going to be great at

1608
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,079
something

1609
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:50,798
and sometimes is a scalability sometimes

1610
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,440
is uh

1611
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:54,079
is your views or sometimes is uh thing

1612
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,000
and and

1613
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,280
it's important to have a dialogue

1614
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,599
between these things and

1615
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,440
i'm sure and i'm working very hard to

1616
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,599
make sure the underground is one of them

1617
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:04,720
but i don't believe of it you know he's

1618
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,160
even uh

1619
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:11,919
desirable to have you know a winner

1620
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:13,679
takes all because we need to express

1621
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,318
different things but the important thing

1622
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:19,679
is going to have enough interoperability

1623
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:21,199
of our systems so that you can transfer

1624
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:23,519
your assets

1625
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:25,759
where you have the best tool to service

1626
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:28,559
them whatever your needs are at the time

1627
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,200
so there's a idea i don't know they call

1628
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,559
themselves

1629
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,919
bitcoin maximalists which is essentially

1630
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:38,400
the bet that

1631
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,960
uh the philosophy that bitcoin will

1632
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,559
eat the world so you're talking about

1633
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,358
it's good to have variety

1634
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,798
their claim is it's good to have the

1635
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:50,639
best technology

1636
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:52,159
dominate the the medium of exchange the

1637
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:54,960
the medium of

1638
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:55,519
store value the money the digi you know

1639
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,720
the

1640
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:59,519
the digital currency space what's your

1641
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:01,598
sense

1642
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:03,280
of the positives and the negatives of

1643
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,559
that

1644
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,400
so i feel people are smart and it's

1645
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,440
going to be very hard

1646
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,079
for anybody and to end going a man

1647
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,519
to win and because people want more and

1648
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,000
more things

1649
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:18,559
and there is an italian saying that goes

1650
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,519
as

1651
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,319
translates well i think uh it goes the

1652
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:24,880
appetite

1653
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:25,679
grows while eating okay i think you

1654
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,200
don't understand

1655
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:29,358
what do you mean yes so i say yeah i'm

1656
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:32,078
not hungry okay food

1657
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:32,558
let me try so we want more and more and

1658
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,559
more

1659
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,319
and when you find something like a

1660
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,640
bitcoin which are really

1661
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:39,759
very good things to say but it does

1662
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:43,759
something very well

1663
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:47,599
but is a static i mean store value

1664
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:50,240
yes i think it's a great like

1665
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:52,480
you know it would be a sad world if the

1666
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:55,199
world in which we are so anchoring down

1667
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,960
some and defensive that we want to store

1668
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:59,838
value and higher than the matters

1669
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,440
i i long for a world in which is open

1670
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:01,759
people want to transact and interact

1671
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,880
with

1672
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:06,400
which way and therefore when you want to

1673
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,599
store value

1674
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,880
one perhaps one chain when you want to

1675
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,920
have a transaction maybe

1676
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,920
is another i'm not saying that you know

1677
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,119
when chain cannot be stored of value of

1678
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:21,599
everything but i really believe

1679
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,480
i believe in the ingenuity of people in

1680
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,480
in the

1681
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,400
innovation that is intrinsic to the

1682
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,000
human nature we want always different

1683
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,880
things so how can it be something

1684
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,639
invented whatever it is decades ago is

1685
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,559
going to fulfill the needs of our future

1686
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:37,358
generations

1687
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,920
i'm not going to fulfill my needs let

1688
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:42,318
alone

1689
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,318
one of my kids or their kids

1690
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,680
we are going to have a different world

1691
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,760
and uh

1692
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:48,879
things will evolve so you believe yeah

1693
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,799
so you believe that

1694
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,200
life intelligent life is ultimately

1695
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:57,039
about adaptability

1696
01:00:53,199 --> 01:01:00,960
and evolving so static is

1697
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:04,400
static loses in the end yes

1698
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,960
let me ask the well first the ridiculous

1699
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,280
question

1700
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,199
do you have any clue who's who satoshi

1701
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,640
nakamoto is

1702
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:14,960
is that even a interesting question

1703
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,318
well is it you your question by the way

1704
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,679
are very interesting

1705
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:19,920
so and i think so i would say first of

1706
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,399
all

1707
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,519
it's not me okay and i can prove it

1708
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,519
because you know

1709
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,599
if i was satoshi nakamoto i would have

1710
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:30,079
not found that algorithm

1711
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,720
takes totally different principle to to

1712
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,960
approach

1713
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:34,798
to the system but the other thing who is

1714
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,920
tadashi nakamoto you know what the right

1715
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:39,280
answer is

1716
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:42,480
it's not him or she hair or them

1717
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:45,920
satoshi nakamura is bitcoin

1718
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,838
because to me is such a coherent proof

1719
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,400
of work but at the end

1720
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:51,199
the creator and the creation identify

1721
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,838
themselves

1722
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:55,679
so he says okay i understand the

1723
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:57,920
michelangelo okay he did the resistant

1724
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:58,318
chapel fine he did the way some peter's

1725
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,240
dome

1726
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:04,639
fine he did uh the the most of the pieta

1727
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:05,838
started you're fine but besides this who

1728
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:07,838
was

1729
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:08,960
yeah that's very wrong question is his

1730
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:12,078
own work vet

1731
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,960
is michelangelo so i think that

1732
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,240
when you look at the bitcoin is a piece

1733
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,199
of work

1734
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:20,479
that as it defects yes like anything

1735
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:23,519
human but it was

1736
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:26,400
captivated the imaginations of

1737
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,000
millions of people as subverted the

1738
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,119
status quo

1739
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,159
and i'm saying you know whoever

1740
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:36,559
this person or people are he's living

1741
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:38,078
in this piece of work yeah i mean it is

1742
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:41,680
bitcoin that's better

1743
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:43,839
with my idea the work is is bigger

1744
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:45,519
we forget that sometimes it's something

1745
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:47,838
about our biology once

1746
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:48,639
likes to see a face and attach a face to

1747
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:50,558
the idea

1748
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,239
when really the idea is the thing we

1749
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:54,798
love the ideas the thing that

1750
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,479
impact ideas the thing that ultimately

1751
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:57,920
we you know steve jobs or something like

1752
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,039
that we associate

1753
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,400
with the mac with the iphone with just

1754
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,280
everything he did at apple

1755
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,798
apple actually the company is steve jobs

1756
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,319
steve jobs the man is

1757
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:11,519
uh is uh is appalls in comparison to the

1758
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:13,519
creation

1759
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:15,199
and the sense of aesthetics that has

1760
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:18,318
brought to the daily lives

1761
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:20,480
and very often uh aesthetic wins

1762
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:21,599
in the long in veron in the long game

1763
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,880
and these are

1764
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,960
very elegant design product and when you

1765
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,760
say oh elegance a very few people care

1766
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,519
about it apparently

1767
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,119
millions and millions and millions and

1768
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:34,318
millions of people do because we are

1769
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,318
attacked by beauty

1770
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:37,599
and these are beautifully designed

1771
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:40,798
products

1772
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:43,039
and uh and uh and you know

1773
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:44,000
and they've uh in addition to the

1774
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,000
technological

1775
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,239
aspect of the other thing and i think

1776
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,159
yes that is uh

1777
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:52,000
yeah as dostoyevsky said beauty will

1778
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,719
save the world so i'm i'm with you on

1779
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,838
that one

1780
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:59,519
right it uh currently seems like

1781
01:03:56,838 --> 01:04:01,199
cryptocurrency all these different

1782
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:05,038
technologies

1783
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:08,000
are gathering a lot of excitement

1784
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,799
not just in our discourse but in their

1785
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,599
like

1786
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:12,960
scale financial impact a lot of

1787
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,640
companies are starting to invest in

1788
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,000
bitcoin

1789
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:22,239
do you think that the main method

1790
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:26,079
of store value and exchange

1791
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:27,838
of value basically money will soon or at

1792
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:29,839
some point in the century will become

1793
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:32,798
cryptocurrency

1794
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:34,558
yes so mind you as i said that the

1795
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:37,119
notion of cryptocurrency

1796
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,559
like any other fundamental human notion

1797
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,920
has to evolve

1798
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:45,519
but yes so i think of it uh

1799
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:48,639
he has a lot of momentum behind it

1800
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:52,000
and he's not only static as of his

1801
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:53,838
programmable money as a i think smart

1802
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,280
consciousness

1803
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:59,358
it allows a peer-to-peer interaction

1804
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,640
among people who don't even know each

1805
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:02,318
other right uh

1806
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:04,480
and they don't even therefore cannot

1807
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:07,038
even trust each other just because

1808
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,079
they never saw each other so i think

1809
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:12,000
it's so powerful

1810
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:15,599
that uh is going to do this said

1811
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,159
again a particular cryptocurrency

1812
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,119
should develop and cryptocurrency they

1813
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:22,000
will all develop

1814
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:23,358
but the answer is yes we are going

1815
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,960
towards a much more

1816
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:27,598
uh unless we have a society a sudden

1817
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,440
crisis

1818
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,680
for different reasons which oh there's

1819
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,280
nobody hopes there's always an asteroid

1820
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:36,239
there's always

1821
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,319
something uh nuclear war and all the

1822
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,639
existential crisis that we kind of think

1823
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:45,838
about including artificial intelligence

1824
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:48,639
uh okay it's funny you mentioned that um

1825
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:50,558
michelangelo and steve jobs you know set

1826
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:51,519
of ideas represents the person's work so

1827
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,079
we talked about

1828
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:55,280
algorithm which is a super interesting

1829
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:59,119
set of technologies

1830
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:02,240
but you know he did also win the

1831
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,599
touring award you have a bunch of you

1832
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:06,879
have a bunch of

1833
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:10,079
ideas that are you know

1834
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:11,599
seminal ideas so can we talk about

1835
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,599
cryptography for a little bit

1836
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,079
what is the most beautiful idea in

1837
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:18,880
cryptography or computer science or

1838
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,519
mathematics in general asking somebody

1839
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:23,680
who has

1840
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,679
explored the depths of all

1841
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:29,920
well a few contenders

1842
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:33,280
[Laughter]

1843
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:36,480
and either your work or uh or

1844
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,359
what other words let's leave my work

1845
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:42,159
aside yes

1846
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:46,000
and uh and uh so but one powerful

1847
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:49,118
idea and is a both an old idea

1848
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,039
in some sense and a very very modern one

1849
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:53,358
and in my opinion is this idea of a

1850
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:56,480
one-way function

1851
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:59,598
so a function that easy

1852
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,000
to evaluate so given x you can compute f

1853
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,200
of x

1854
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,480
easily but given f of x

1855
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:10,480
is very hard to go back to x okay

1856
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:14,559
think like breaking a glass

1857
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:18,000
easy reconstruct the glass hard

1858
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:21,200
frying an egg easy for the side egg

1859
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,280
to go back to your original leg hard

1860
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,558
if you want to be extreme killing a

1861
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,839
living being

1862
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,960
unfortunately easy the other way around

1863
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:31,519
very hard

1864
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,519
and so the fact that the notion of a

1865
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:35,759
function which you have a recipe that is

1866
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:36,480
in front of your eyes to transform an x

1867
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,680
into

1868
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:41,519
f of x and then from f of x even though

1869
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:44,558
you see the recipe to transform it

1870
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:46,639
you cannot go back to x that in my

1871
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:50,559
opinion is one of the most

1872
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:53,440
elegant and momentous

1873
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:55,440
notions that there are and is a

1874
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,920
computational notion because of the

1875
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,519
difficulties in a computational sense

1876
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,920
and it's a mathematical notion because

1877
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:05,038
we were talking about function

1878
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,480
and is so fruitful because that is

1879
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,319
actually the foundation of all the

1880
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,679
cryptography

1881
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:14,719
and let me tell you is an old notion

1882
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:18,238
because very often in any mythology

1883
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:19,198
that we think of the most powerful gods

1884
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:22,879
or goddesses

1885
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:25,678
are the ones of x and the opposite of x

1886
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,400
the gods of love and death and when you

1887
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,600
take

1888
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:31,838
opposites they don't just you know

1889
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,960
erase one another you create something

1890
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:36,399
way more powerful

1891
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:39,838
and this one-way function is extremely

1892
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:42,639
powerful because essentially becomes

1893
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:43,519
something that is easy for the good guys

1894
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,880
and bad

1895
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,799
for the but hard for the bad guys

1896
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,239
so for reason in pseudorandom number

1897
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:51,759
generation

1898
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:53,759
the easy part of the function

1899
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:55,119
corresponds you want to generate bits

1900
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,920
very quickly

1901
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:58,479
and hard is predicting what the next bit

1902
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,039
is

1903
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:02,079
it says geo it doesn't look the same one

1904
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:04,238
is x f of x

1905
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:06,079
going from x for x to x r let us do

1906
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:11,119
predicting bits

1907
01:09:06,079 --> 01:09:14,318
by a magic of reductions in mathematical

1908
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:16,238
apparatus this simple function

1909
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,239
morphs itself into pseudogenomic

1910
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:20,158
generation this is simple function

1911
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,959
morphs in cells in digital signature

1912
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:23,358
scheme

1913
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,520
in which digitally signing should be

1914
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,838
easy and forging should be hard

1915
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,640
again a digital signature is not going

1916
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:32,158
from x to f

1917
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,600
x but the magic and the richness of this

1918
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:36,719
notion is meant that

1919
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,920
it is so powerful it morphs

1920
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:42,798
in all kinds of incredible constructs

1921
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,759
and uh in both these two opposites

1922
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:45,519
coexist

1923
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:48,880
the easy and the hard and in my opinion

1924
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:51,440
is a very very elegant notion so

1925
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,960
that simple notion ties together

1926
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:54,960
cryptography

1927
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,079
like you said pseudo-random number

1928
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,079
generation

1929
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:03,119
you have work on pseudo-random functions

1930
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:05,840
what are those what

1931
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:06,880
uh what's the difference in those and

1932
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,520
the generators

1933
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,640
should run random number generators okay

1934
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,360
let's start how do they work

1935
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,400
let's uh let's go back to pseudogana

1936
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:16,719
number generation

1937
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:18,719
yes first of all people think of the

1938
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,158
surrogate moderation generates a random

1939
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,640
number not true

1940
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:23,920
because i don't believe that uh from

1941
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,960
nothing you can get

1942
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:30,960
you can you can get uh something

1943
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:32,719
so nothing for nothing but the

1944
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,119
randomness you cannot create out on

1945
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:37,679
nothing but what you can do

1946
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:39,039
is that you click it can be expanded so

1947
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,840
in other words

1948
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:43,198
if you give me somehow 300 random bits

1949
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,800
truly random bits

1950
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:48,799
then i can give you 300 300 million 300

1951
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:52,159
trillions 300 quadrillions as

1952
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,640
many as you want random beats soviet

1953
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:56,719
even though i tell you the recipe by

1954
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:59,280
which i produce these beats

1955
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:01,520
but i don't tell you the initial 300

1956
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:03,840
random numbers i keep them secret

1957
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,040
and you see all the bits i produce so

1958
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,079
far

1959
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:09,198
if i if you were to bet given all the

1960
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:11,519
bits produced so far

1961
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:13,439
what is the next bit in my sequence

1962
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:15,760
better than 50 50.

1963
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:16,719
of course 50 50 anybody can guess right

1964
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,560
but to be

1965
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,000
inferring something you have to be a bit

1966
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,280
better then

1967
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,600
the effort to to do this extra bit

1968
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,559
is so enormous that is the fact of

1969
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,560
random

1970
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,880
so that is a sort of random generator

1971
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,760
are these expanders

1972
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,960
of secret randomness which goes

1973
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,760
extremely

1974
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:39,198
fast okay let's say what's the standards

1975
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,400
of secret randomness

1976
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:44,238
beautifully put okay so every time every

1977
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:45,759
time somebody who if you're a programmer

1978
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,839
is using a function

1979
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,600
that's not called pseudorandom it's

1980
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,880
called random usually you know these

1981
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,640
programming languages and it's

1982
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,440
generating different

1983
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,400
uh that's essentially expanding the

1984
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:58,879
secret

1985
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:00,719
randomness but they should and in the

1986
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,159
past actually most of the library they

1987
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:05,679
used

1988
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:08,158
something pre-modern cryptography

1989
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,359
unfortunately they'll be better served

1990
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:13,920
to take

1991
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:16,479
300 uh real seed random number

1992
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,760
and uh and then expand them properly as

1993
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:21,519
we know now

1994
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:24,159
uh but met has been a very

1995
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,320
old idea in fact one of the um best

1996
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:29,198
philosophers have debated

1997
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:30,479
the wave of the world was deterministic

1998
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:33,039
or probabilistic

1999
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,519
very big questions right does god play

2000
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:36,800
dice

2001
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:40,159
exactly einstein says it does it doesn't

2002
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,719
but in fact now we have a language that

2003
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:43,279
even

2004
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:45,279
at the alberta time was not around but

2005
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:47,439
it was this complexity of a modern

2006
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:48,399
complexity-based cryptography and now we

2007
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:52,960
know that

2008
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:55,359
in the universe has 300 random beats

2009
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,158
whether there is random or probabilistic

2010
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:58,319
or

2011
01:12:56,158 --> 01:12:59,439
deterministic it doesn't matter because

2012
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,319
you can expand

2013
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:02,960
this initial seed of randomness forever

2014
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:05,599
in which

2015
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:07,359
all the experiments you could do all the

2016
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,320
inferences you could do all the things

2017
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:09,679
you could do

2018
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:11,840
there you would not be able to

2019
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:14,319
distinguish them from truly random

2020
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,679
so if you are not able to distinguish

2021
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:20,000
truly random

2022
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:21,520
from this super duper pseudo randomness

2023
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,039
are the really different things that's

2024
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,199
what i say so many

2025
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:27,198
to become really philosophical so for

2026
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:29,119
things to be different but i don't have

2027
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:30,960
in my lifetime in my lifetime of the

2028
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,599
universe any method

2029
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,880
to set them aside well i should be

2030
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:39,360
intellectually honest to say well

2031
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,960
pseudorandom investment satisfaction is

2032
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:44,719
as good as random

2033
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:48,158
do you think true randomness is

2034
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:51,279
possible and what does that mean

2035
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:52,879
so i practically speaking exactly as you

2036
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:56,479
said if you're being honest

2037
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:59,520
the the the pseudo randomness approaches

2038
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:01,678
through randomness pretty quickly

2039
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,360
but is it is it uh maybe is this a

2040
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:06,399
philosophical question is there such a

2041
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:08,960
thing as true randomness

2042
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:09,679
well the answer is actually maybe but if

2043
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,119
there

2044
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:16,399
exists most probably is

2045
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:19,119
expensive to get and uh

2046
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:20,319
and uh and in any case if i give you one

2047
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:23,359
of mine

2048
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:25,519
um you'll never tell them apart

2049
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:28,238
yeah but not any other shape no matter

2050
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:31,280
how much you work on it so in some sense

2051
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:33,198
if it exists or not it really is a quote

2052
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:36,399
philosophical sense in the

2053
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:36,960
um colloquial way to say that we cannot

2054
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:39,279
uh

2055
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,079
somehow pin it down do you ever again

2056
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:42,319
just

2057
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:43,359
stay on philosophical for a bit for a

2058
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:46,399
brief moment

2059
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:49,198
do you ever think about free will and

2060
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:50,799
uh whether that exists because

2061
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:54,000
ultimately

2062
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:57,199
free will sort of is this experience

2063
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,238
that we have like we're making choices

2064
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:03,119
even though it appears that

2065
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:04,158
you know the world is deterministic at

2066
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:06,479
the core i mean

2067
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:08,559
it's against the debate but if it is in

2068
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:10,559
fact deterministic at the lowest

2069
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,080
possible level

2070
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:16,239
uh at the at the physics level

2071
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:18,319
uh how do you make if if it is

2072
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:19,678
deterministic how do you make uh

2073
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:21,519
how do you make sense of the difference

2074
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,119
between the experience of us

2075
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,199
feeling like we're making a choice and

2076
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:26,880
the whole thing being deterministic

2077
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:28,879
so first of all let me give you a gut

2078
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:32,640
reaction yeah to my question

2079
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,640
and a gut reaction is that

2080
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:39,520
it is important that we believe that

2081
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:43,359
there exists free will and second of all

2082
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:45,440
almost uh by weird logic

2083
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:46,719
if we believe it exists then it does

2084
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:48,960
exist okay

2085
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,920
yeah so it's very important for our

2086
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,600
social

2087
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,039
apparatus for our sense sensibility of

2088
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,600
ourselves

2089
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:56,399
that it exists and the moment in which

2090
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,640
you know we

2091
01:15:56,399 --> 01:15:59,920
we so want to be almost we conjure it up

2092
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,480
in existence

2093
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,679
but again i really feel that if you look

2094
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:06,479
at some point

2095
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,480
and the space of free will seems to

2096
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:11,919
shrink

2097
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,559
we realize how more and more how much of

2098
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,960
our

2099
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,320
say genetic apparatus dictates who we

2100
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,198
are why we prefer

2101
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:22,079
certain things than others right and why

2102
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:24,158
we react to noises of music

2103
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:26,399
we prefer poetry of everything else we

2104
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:29,439
may explain even always

2105
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:30,158
but uh but at the end of the day whether

2106
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:32,399
it

2107
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:34,960
exists in a philosophical sense or not

2108
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:37,920
it's like randomness if you can

2109
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,719
pseudorandom is as good as random

2110
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,880
vis-a-vis

2111
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:42,480
lifetime of the universe our experience

2112
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:46,640
when does it really matter

2113
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:49,519
yeah so you know we're talking about

2114
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,560
randomness i wonder if i can weave in

2115
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,239
quantum mechanics

2116
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:55,920
for a brief moment there's a

2117
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:57,759
you know a lot of advancements on the

2118
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:01,520
quantum computing side

2119
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:03,360
so leveraging quantum mechanics to

2120
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,440
perform a new kind of computation

2121
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,639
and there's concern of that being a

2122
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:08,719
threat

2123
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:11,119
to a lot of the basic assumptions that

2124
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:13,119
underlie cryptography

2125
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:15,439
what do you think do you think quantum

2126
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:18,559
computing will challenge

2127
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:20,000
a lot of cryptography will cryptography

2128
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,039
be able to defend

2129
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,880
all those kinds of things okay great so

2130
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:26,479
first of all

2131
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,119
foreign because i think it matters but

2132
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:30,158
it's important

2133
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:30,719
that there are people who continue to

2134
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:33,839
contend

2135
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:35,198
that quantum mechanics exist but has

2136
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,800
nothing to do with computing is not

2137
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:40,879
going to accelerate it

2138
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,880
and at least you know

2139
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:47,519
very basic and um are the computation

2140
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,560
that is a belief that you cannot uh take

2141
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,760
it out

2142
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,199
i'm a little bit uh more agnostic about

2143
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,360
it but i really believe

2144
01:17:53,198 --> 01:17:57,439
going back to whatever i said about the

2145
01:17:55,359 --> 01:18:00,079
the one-way function

2146
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:00,960
so one way function what is it what is a

2147
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:03,679
cryptography

2148
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,158
so does quantum computing challenge the

2149
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,239
one

2150
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:08,238
function essentially you can boil it

2151
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:09,759
down to does one computing find one way

2152
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:11,678
function what is one way function

2153
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,800
easy in one direction other than the

2154
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:15,679
other

2155
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,840
okay but if quantum computing exists

2156
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:21,119
when you define what it is easy

2157
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:23,279
it's not by easy by a classical computer

2158
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:25,359
and art by a classical computer but is

2159
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:26,158
it for for a quantum computer that's a

2160
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:29,279
bad idea

2161
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:30,799
but once easy means it should be easy

2162
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:34,079
for a quantum

2163
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,800
and hard for also quantum then you can

2164
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:37,198
see that

2165
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,119
you are yes is a challenge but you have

2166
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:41,439
hope because you can absorb

2167
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:42,960
if one computing really realizes and

2168
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:46,238
becomes available

2169
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:49,119
and according to the promises then you

2170
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:51,519
can use them also for the easy part

2171
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:52,399
and once you use it from the easy part

2172
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,159
the

2173
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,920
choices that you have a one-way function

2174
01:18:54,158 --> 01:18:58,719
they multiply so okay

2175
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,319
so the particular candidates of one-way

2176
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:04,000
function

2177
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:06,079
may not be one way anymore

2178
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,679
but quantum one-way function may

2179
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:11,439
continue to exist

2180
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,440
and so i really believe that

2181
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:20,239
for uh life to be meaningful

2182
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:21,119
with one way function had to exist

2183
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:24,559
because

2184
01:19:21,119 --> 01:19:28,079
just imagine that anything that is

2185
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:29,280
becomes easy to to do i mean what kind

2186
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,960
of life is it

2187
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:35,039
i mean so you need that and if something

2188
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,960
is hard but it's so hard to generate

2189
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:39,279
you'll never find something which is

2190
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,520
hard for you you want but there is

2191
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:43,759
abundance if it is easy to produce

2192
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,960
heart problem what's in my opinion is

2193
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,320
why life is interesting

2194
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:51,119
because art form pop up another really

2195
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:52,559
relatable speed so in some sense i

2196
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,279
almost think that

2197
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,560
i do hope they exist if they don't exist

2198
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,119
somehow life is

2199
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:00,960
way less interesting than uh it actually

2200
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:02,399
is yeah it does

2201
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,359
that's funny it does seem like the

2202
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:08,479
one-way function is fundamental to all

2203
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:10,319
of life which is the the emergence of

2204
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:12,718
the complexity that we see around us

2205
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:15,599
seem to require the one-way function

2206
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,800
i don't know if you uh play with

2207
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,199
cellular automata

2208
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,960
that's just another formulation of i

2209
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:23,759
know but yeah it's a

2210
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,039
very simple it's almost a very simple

2211
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:28,159
illustration of

2212
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:30,479
starting out with simple rules and

2213
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:31,359
one way being able to generate

2214
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:33,519
incredible

2215
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:36,399
amounts of complexity but then you ask

2216
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:40,239
the question can i reverse that

2217
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:43,359
then it's just it's just a surprising

2218
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:46,079
how difficult it is to reverse that

2219
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:47,279
it's surprising even in constrained

2220
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:51,198
situations it's

2221
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:55,679
very difficult to prove anything uh that

2222
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:57,439
it almost i mean the sad thing about it

2223
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,639
well i don't know if it's sad but it

2224
01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:00,799
seems like we don't even have the

2225
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:03,679
mathematical tools

2226
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,960
to reverse engineer stuff i don't know

2227
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:06,639
if they exist or not

2228
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,079
but in the space of cellular automata

2229
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:09,359
where you start with something simple

2230
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:10,800
and you create something incredibly

2231
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:13,039
complex

2232
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,000
can you take something a small picture

2233
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:16,479
of that complex

2234
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,920
and reverse engineer that's kind of what

2235
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:19,759
we're doing as scientists

2236
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,279
here you're seeing the result of the

2237
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,159
complexity and you're trying to come up

2238
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:24,960
with some

2239
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:25,759
universal law that generate all of this

2240
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,439
what is the

2241
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,039
you know the theory of everything what

2242
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:30,638
are the basic physics laws that

2243
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:32,399
generated this whole thing

2244
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:34,000
and there's a hope that you should be

2245
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:36,479
able to do that but

2246
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,158
it gets it's difficult yeah but there is

2247
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:38,799
also some portrait of the fact that it's

2248
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:41,920
difficult

2249
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,639
right because he it gives us a mystery

2250
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,960
to life

2251
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,400
which yeah without the wheelchair i mean

2252
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,119
uh it's not so fun uh

2253
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:50,799
all right life will be less fun can we

2254
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:51,359
talk about interactive proofs a little

2255
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,840
bit and

2256
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:55,198
zero knowledge proofs what are those

2257
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:58,239
okay how do they work

2258
01:21:55,198 --> 01:22:01,678
so interactive proof actually

2259
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:04,198
is um is

2260
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:06,560
is a modern realization and uh

2261
01:22:04,198 --> 01:22:09,599
conceptualization of something

2262
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:11,199
that we knew was true but you know that

2263
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,440
is easy to go to lecture

2264
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:15,039
in fact that's my motivation we invented

2265
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:16,399
the schools to go to lecture right we

2266
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:18,399
don't say oh i have a minister of

2267
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:18,719
education i publish this book you read

2268
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:20,960
it

2269
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:22,840
yeah invest this book for this year this

2270
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:25,920
book for version

2271
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:27,600
we spend a lot of our treasury in

2272
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,960
educating our kids

2273
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:32,320
and in person educating go to class

2274
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,639
interact with a teacher on the

2275
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:37,198
blackboard and chalk on my time

2276
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,880
now we can have you know whiteboard and

2277
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:39,198
presumably you're going to have actually

2278
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,319
this

2279
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:45,439
uh magic pens and the display instead

2280
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:48,639
but the the the idea is that

2281
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:51,439
interactively you can convey truth much

2282
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:52,719
more efficiently and we knew this

2283
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:54,399
psychologically

2284
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:57,600
it's better to hear the explanation than

2285
01:22:54,399 --> 01:23:00,319
just to be labor or some paper right

2286
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,360
same thing so interactive proofs is a

2287
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:03,119
way to

2288
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:05,198
to do a following rather than doing in

2289
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:07,119
some complicated very long

2290
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:09,519
papers and possibly infinitely long

2291
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:12,079
proofs exponentially long proofs

2292
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,719
you say the following if this theorem is

2293
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:14,719
true

2294
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,480
there is a game that is associated to

2295
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:19,840
the theorem

2296
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:21,839
and if the theorem is true this game

2297
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,199
i have a winning strategy that i can win

2298
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,319
half of it

2299
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:28,158
all the time no matter what you do

2300
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:29,759
okay so then you say well is the theorem

2301
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:31,279
true you believe me why should i believe

2302
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,639
you so okay let's play

2303
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:35,279
so and if i prove that i have a strategy

2304
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,119
that

2305
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:39,279
and i win the first time and i win the

2306
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:41,119
second time then i lose a third time but

2307
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:43,840
i win

2308
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:44,158
every say more than half of a time or i

2309
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,480
win

2310
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:47,198
say all the time if the serum is true

2311
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:48,638
and at least

2312
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:51,599
at the most half of a time if the

2313
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:53,600
theorem is false you statistically

2314
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,800
get convinced you can verify this

2315
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:58,079
quickly

2316
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,400
and and therefore is a much when the

2317
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:01,760
game

2318
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:04,719
in the game typically is extremely fast

2319
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:06,000
so you generate a miniature game in

2320
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:07,920
which the theorem is true

2321
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,920
i win all the time in the theorem is

2322
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,880
false i can win at most

2323
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:14,480
half of a time and if i win win win win

2324
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,359
win win win you can deduce either the

2325
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:17,279
firm is true

2326
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:19,039
which most probably is the case of this

2327
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:22,800
week

2328
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:25,519
or i've been very very unlucky because

2329
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,119
it's like if i had a hundred coin tosses

2330
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:30,000
and i got a hundred heads

2331
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:32,000
very improbable right so that is a way

2332
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,119
and so this transformation

2333
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,760
from the state formal statement of a

2334
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:38,800
proof

2335
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:41,679
into a game that can be quickly

2336
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:43,760
played and you can draw statistics how

2337
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:46,880
many times you win and you

2338
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:49,760
is a is one of a

2339
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:52,960
big conquest of a modern complex theory

2340
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,280
and in fact actually as a highlighted

2341
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,520
the notion of uh of a proof has really

2342
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:58,238
give us a new insight to what to be true

2343
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,480
means and

2344
01:24:58,238 --> 01:25:03,198
what what the truth is and what proofs

2345
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:07,198
are so these are generally proofs

2346
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:10,399
so what kind of

2347
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:14,238
mysteries can it allow us to unlock

2348
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:17,279
and prove he said truth

2349
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:19,039
uh so uh what does it allow us

2350
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:20,319
what kind of truth does that allow us to

2351
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:23,600
arrive at

2352
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:24,880
so it enlarges the real mobot is

2353
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,840
provable because

2354
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,639
in some sense the classical way of

2355
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:32,239
proving things

2356
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:34,719
was extremely inefficient

2357
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:35,919
from the very fire point of view yes

2358
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:38,158
right so

2359
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,399
and and so therefore there is so much

2360
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:43,039
proof that you can take and

2361
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:44,879
but in this way you can actually very

2362
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:47,920
quickly minutes

2363
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:50,239
verify something that is

2364
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,560
the correctness of an assertion that

2365
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:55,439
otherwise would have taken our lifetime

2366
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:57,600
to belabor and check all the

2367
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:59,119
the passages of a very very very long

2368
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,679
proof and you better check

2369
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:02,559
all of them because if you don't check

2370
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:05,199
one line

2371
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:07,120
an error can be in that line and so you

2372
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:08,238
have to go linearly through all the

2373
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:10,880
stuff rather than

2374
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:11,678
bypass this so you enlarge tremendous

2375
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:15,920
amount

2376
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,920
whatever proof is and in addition

2377
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:22,000
once you have the idea that essentially

2378
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:24,559
a proof system is something that

2379
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,319
allows me to convince you of a true

2380
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,560
statement

2381
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:30,799
but does not allow me to convince you of

2382
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,280
a false statement

2383
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,039
and better at the ancestor proof proof

2384
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:38,158
can be beautiful should be

2385
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:39,519
should be elegant but advances is true

2386
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:40,399
or false so she wants to be able to

2387
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,560
differentiate

2388
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:44,879
it is possible to prove the truth and it

2389
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,239
should be impossible or statistically

2390
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,639
extremely hard

2391
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:50,000
to prove something false and if you do

2392
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:52,800
this you can prove way way

2393
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,399
more once you understand this and on top

2394
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,719
of it

2395
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:57,759
we got some insight i can visit zero

2396
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:01,039
knowledge proofs

2397
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,079
that is in something which you took for

2398
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:06,319
granted were

2399
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:08,960
the same knowledge and verification

2400
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:10,079
are actually separate concepts so you

2401
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:13,119
can verify

2402
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:13,600
that an assertion is correct without

2403
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:16,800
having

2404
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:19,039
any idea why this is so and so

2405
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,079
people fail to say if you want to verify

2406
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:21,840
something you have to

2407
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:23,679
to have a proof once you have a proof

2408
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,719
you know why it's true you have

2409
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:31,600
the proof itself and so somehow you can

2410
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:34,719
totally differentiate knowledge

2411
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:35,600
and and uh and verification validity so

2412
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,439
totally you can

2413
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,960
decide if something is true and still

2414
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:42,319
have no idea is there a good example

2415
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:45,039
in your mind oh actually

2416
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:45,359
you know at the beginning we labor to

2417
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:47,600
find

2418
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:49,359
the first knowledge zero knowledge proof

2419
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,239
then we find a second then we've had the

2420
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:52,960
third

2421
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:54,319
and then a few years later actually we

2422
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:57,439
proved a theorem

2423
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:58,880
which essentially says every theorem no

2424
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:03,759
matter what about

2425
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:07,039
can be explained in a zero-knowledge way

2426
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:09,920
okay so it's not a class of fear but

2427
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:11,760
all theorems and is a very powerful

2428
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:14,880
thing so if we were really

2429
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:17,199
for thousands of years

2430
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,079
bought this identity between knowledge

2431
01:28:17,198 --> 01:28:20,799
and verification

2432
01:28:18,079 --> 01:28:22,079
to be hand-in-hand together and uh for

2433
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,920
no reason at all

2434
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:25,760
i mean we had to develop a weaver

2435
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,199
technology as you know i'm very big on

2436
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,480
technology because

2437
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:31,519
it makes us more human and and make us

2438
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:33,599
understand

2439
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,719
more things than before and uh and i

2440
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,760
think of it is a

2441
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:41,760
that is a that's a good thing

2442
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:44,079
so this interactive proof process

2443
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:44,800
there's power in games yeah and you've

2444
01:28:44,079 --> 01:28:47,279
recently

2445
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,000
gotten into uh recently i'm not sure you

2446
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:51,359
can correct me

2447
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,039
uh mechanism design yeah uh

2448
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:54,880
so it's i mean first of all maybe you

2449
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:59,679
can explain what mechanism design is

2450
01:28:54,880 --> 01:29:01,279
and the the fascinating space of playing

2451
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:04,639
with games

2452
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:05,039
and designing games mechanism design is

2453
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:08,319
that

2454
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:10,560
you want to you want a certain behavior

2455
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:11,759
to arise right if you want to organize

2456
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:13,679
you know

2457
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,360
a societal structure or something you

2458
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:18,079
want to have some orderly

2459
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:19,439
uh behavior to our eyes right because uh

2460
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:22,719
it is important for

2461
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:24,879
your goals but

2462
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,319
but you know that people they don't care

2463
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:29,520
what my goals are

2464
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:32,158
makers about uh maximizing their utility

2465
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,960
so put the grassley making money the

2466
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:35,439
more money

2467
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:37,359
the better so to speak right i'm

2468
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:39,039
exaggerating my self-interest

2469
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:41,039
in what self-interest in whatever way

2470
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:46,479
them so what you want to do

2471
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:50,840
is ideally what you want to do is to

2472
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:53,198
design a game so that while people

2473
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:55,039
played so to maximize their

2474
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:57,039
self-interest

2475
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:59,039
they achieve the social goal and

2476
01:29:57,039 --> 01:30:02,479
behavior that i want

2477
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:06,319
that is really the best type of thing

2478
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:09,919
and it is a very

2479
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:13,359
hard science and art to design

2480
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:15,600
with games and it challenges us

2481
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:15,599
to

2482
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:22,079
actually come up with solution concepts

2483
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:25,199
for way to analyzing the games

2484
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:25,840
that need to be broader and i think the

2485
01:30:25,198 --> 01:30:28,399
number

2486
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:31,119
game theory has a developing a bunch of

2487
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:33,119
very compelling

2488
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:34,559
way to analyze the game that if the game

2489
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:36,479
has a best property

2490
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,480
well you can have a pretty good

2491
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:39,839
guarantee that is going to be played in

2492
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:43,919
a given way

2493
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:46,079
but as it turns out and not surprisingly

2494
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,000
these tools have a range of action like

2495
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:49,679
anything else all these

2496
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,520
so-called the technical resolution

2497
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,920
concept the way to analyze the game

2498
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,440
like dominant strategy equilibrium when

2499
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:59,920
something comes to mind to be

2500
01:30:55,439 --> 01:31:03,039
very meaningful but as a limited power

2501
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:05,679
in some sense the games that they can be

2502
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:07,359
i'll admit such a way to be analysis

2503
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:08,158
there's a very specific kind of games

2504
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:09,679
and the

2505
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:11,839
the rules are set the constraints are

2506
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:14,639
set the utilities are all set

2507
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:16,239
yes so if you want to reason if there is

2508
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:19,440
always say

2509
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:20,879
that you can analyze a restricted class

2510
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:23,759
of games this way

2511
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,880
but most games you know don't fall into

2512
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,000
the rest of the class

2513
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:31,760
then what do i do when you need to

2514
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,560
enlarge a way what a rational player can

2515
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,520
do

2516
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:38,000
so for instance uh in my opinion at

2517
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:41,280
least in some of my

2518
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:44,880
i played with this for a few years and i

2519
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:48,000
i was doing some exotic things i'm sure

2520
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,880
in in the space that was not exactly

2521
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,359
mainstream

2522
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,159
and then i changed my interest and our

2523
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:54,319
blockchain

2524
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:55,198
but what i'm saying for a while i was

2525
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:58,000
doing

2526
01:31:55,198 --> 01:32:00,000
so for instance to me is a way in which

2527
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,960
i design the game

2528
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,960
and you don't have the best move for you

2529
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:06,560
the best move is the move that is best

2530
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,198
for you no matter what the other players

2531
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,960
are doing

2532
01:32:07,198 --> 01:32:10,559
sometimes a game doesn't have that okay

2533
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:13,840
it's too much to ask

2534
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:15,760
but i can design the game such of it

2535
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,360
given the option in front of you say oh

2536
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:20,079
these are really stupid for me

2537
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:21,198
take them aside but these these are not

2538
01:32:20,079 --> 01:32:23,920
stupid

2539
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:25,439
so if you design them the game solve it

2540
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,920
in any combination

2541
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:28,719
or non stupid things that the player can

2542
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,920
do

2543
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:32,639
i achieve what i want i'm done i don't

2544
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,679
care

2545
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:38,560
to find the very unique equilibrium

2546
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:40,319
i i don't give a damn i want to say well

2547
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,719
as long as you don't do stupid things

2548
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:45,759
and nobody else does stupid things

2549
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:47,198
good social things outcome guys i should

2550
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,320
be equally happy

2551
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:53,759
and so i really believe that um

2552
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:54,719
this type of analysis you know is uh as

2553
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,840
possible and

2554
01:32:54,719 --> 01:33:01,198
uh as a bigger

2555
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:02,880
radius so it reaches some more games

2556
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:04,960
more classes of games

2557
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,560
and uh and after that we have to enlarge

2558
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,399
it again and uh

2559
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,679
and it's going to be we're going to have

2560
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:12,319
fun because uh

2561
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:14,480
human behavior can be conceptualized

2562
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:16,639
again in many ways and uh

2563
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:18,399
it's it's a long game jim it's a long

2564
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:20,560
game do you have uh favorite games that

2565
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:22,399
you're looking at now i mean i suppose

2566
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,639
your work with blockchain and algorithm

2567
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:27,279
is the kind of game that you're

2568
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:29,600
you you basically just mechanism design

2569
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:33,439
design the game such that it's

2570
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:35,600
scalable secure and decentralized right

2571
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:36,559
yes yes and very often you have to say

2572
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,239
and verify and

2573
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:41,600
you must also design so that the

2574
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:41,599
incentives are uh

2575
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:49,520
in terms of whatever little i learned

2576
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:51,679
from my venture in uh mechanism design

2577
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,280
is that incentives are very hard to

2578
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:55,279
design

2579
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:56,960
because people are very complex

2580
01:33:55,279 --> 01:33:59,039
creatures and so

2581
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,079
and so somehow the way we design

2582
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:02,479
algorithm is a

2583
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:05,840
totally different way essentially with

2584
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:05,839
no incentives essentially

2585
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,600
and and but but technically speaking

2586
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:13,198
there is a notion

2587
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:16,639
that uh uh is actually believable right

2588
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:18,000
so that to say um people want to

2589
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:20,719
maximize their utility

2590
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,279
yes up to a point let me let me tell you

2591
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:25,039
assume

2592
01:34:21,279 --> 01:34:28,399
that if you are honest

2593
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:30,560
you make 100 bucks but if you are

2594
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:32,319
dishonest no matter how dishonest you

2595
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:35,280
are you can only make 100 bucks

2596
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:37,759
and one cent what are you going to be

2597
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:40,399
i'm saying you know what

2598
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,079
technically speaking even that one's

2599
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:43,679
nobody bothers and say

2600
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:46,639
how much am i going to make by honest

2601
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:48,480
100 if i'm devious and if i'm a criminal

2602
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,920
100 bucks in one cent you know i might

2603
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:53,039
as well be honest okay

2604
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:55,920
so that essentially is called you know

2605
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:57,198
epsilon utility equilibrium but uh i

2606
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:00,158
think it's it's good

2607
01:34:57,198 --> 01:35:02,638
and and and uh and that's what we design

2608
01:35:00,158 --> 01:35:05,920
essentially means of it you know

2609
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:07,600
the reason uh having no incentives

2610
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:09,920
is actually a good thing because to

2611
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,840
prevent people from reasoning how else i

2612
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:14,239
encounter game the system

2613
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,520
but why can we achieve an argon to have

2614
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:17,839
known incentives

2615
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:19,600
and in bitcoin instead yet to pay the

2616
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:21,039
miners because they do tremendous amount

2617
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:24,800
of work because

2618
01:35:21,039 --> 01:35:27,359
if you have to do a lot of work

2619
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,239
then you demand to be paid accordingly

2620
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:30,799
because you right

2621
01:35:28,238 --> 01:35:32,399
but if i'm going to say here to add two

2622
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,159
and two equal to four how much you want

2623
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:34,879
to me pay for vessel if you don't give

2624
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:36,638
me advice

2625
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,920
i don't add the two and two i would say

2626
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:39,840
you can add 22

2627
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,279
in your sleep you don't need to be paid

2628
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,279
to other 2. so

2629
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:44,319
the idea is that if we make the system

2630
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:47,599
so efficient

2631
01:35:44,319 --> 01:35:50,079
so that generating the next block is

2632
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:52,000
so damn simple it doesn't hit the

2633
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:53,600
universe let alone my computer

2634
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,079
let alone take some microsecond or

2635
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,719
computation i might as well

2636
01:35:56,079 --> 01:35:59,359
not being received incentives for doing

2637
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:01,118
that

2638
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:02,639
and try to incentivize some other part

2639
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:04,719
of the system but not

2640
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,560
the main consensus which is a mechanism

2641
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:08,800
for generating an adding block to the

2642
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,800
chain

2643
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:14,639
since you're italian sicilian

2644
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:17,599
i also heard rumors that you are a

2645
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:17,600
connoisseur of food

2646
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:22,399
uh what you know if i said today is the

2647
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:24,399
last day

2648
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:26,238
you get to be alive i'm rushing you

2649
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:27,519
shouldn't have trusted me

2650
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:29,279
you never know the russian whether

2651
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,600
you're gonna make it out or not well if

2652
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:32,719
you

2653
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:34,800
had one last meal you can travel

2654
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:36,560
somewhere in the world either you make

2655
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:39,279
it or somebody else makes it

2656
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,679
uh what's that going to look like all

2657
01:36:39,279 --> 01:36:42,800
right

2658
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:46,079
this is one last meal i must say hey

2659
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:49,520
you know in this ira kovid

2660
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:53,279
i've not been able to see my mom and

2661
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:54,400
uh and that was my mama was a fantastic

2662
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:57,759
chef okay

2663
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:59,359
and ahead of this very traditional food

2664
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,960
as you know the very traditional food

2665
01:36:59,359 --> 01:37:03,839
are great for a reason

2666
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:05,118
because they survived hundreds of years

2667
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,159
of culinary innovation

2668
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:08,559
yeah so and there is one very laborious

2669
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:11,198
thing

2670
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,760
which is uh and you heard the name which

2671
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:14,799
is this

2672
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:16,639
uh parmigiana

2673
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:18,079
but to do it it's a piece of art

2674
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:20,079
requires so many hours

2675
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:22,319
but only my mama could do it if we have

2676
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:25,198
one last meal i want to parmesan

2677
01:37:22,319 --> 01:37:27,198
okay what is uh what's what's the

2678
01:37:25,198 --> 01:37:30,399
laborious processes

2679
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:33,759
the ingredients is it the the actual

2680
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:35,359
process is it the the atmosphere and the

2681
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:38,400
humans involved

2682
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:43,039
and the latter a the ingredient

2683
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:46,479
like in any other in italian cuisine

2684
01:37:43,039 --> 01:37:49,760
believes in very few ingredients

2685
01:37:46,479 --> 01:37:52,238
if you take say quintessential

2686
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,440
italian recipe everybody knows spaghetti

2687
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:57,039
paste okay

2688
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:58,879
pesto is olive oil very good extra

2689
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:02,479
virgin oil

2690
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:06,480
um basil

2691
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:08,319
pine nuts pepper a clove of garlic not

2692
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:10,238
too much otherwise used

2693
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:11,840
yeah you know the flour everything and

2694
01:38:10,238 --> 01:38:14,559
then you have to

2695
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:16,960
do either two schools of food parmesan

2696
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,960
or pecorino or a mixed number two

2697
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,480
yeah i mentioned six ingredients yes

2698
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:22,719
that is typical italian

2699
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:24,638
that is i understand that there are

2700
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:25,279
cuisines for instance a french cuisine

2701
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,760
which is

2702
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:29,039
extremely sophisticated and extremely

2703
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:31,520
combinatorial

2704
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:32,319
or some chinese cuisine which has a lot

2705
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,880
of

2706
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:36,799
many more ingredients than this and yet

2707
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:39,679
the artist to put them together

2708
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,960
a lot of things in italy is really

2709
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:43,679
striving for simplicity

2710
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:45,439
yet to find few ingredients but the

2711
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:46,960
right ingredients to create

2712
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:48,719
something so in parmigiana the

2713
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:49,679
ingredients are eggplants they are

2714
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:53,198
tomatoes

2715
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:54,079
we are basil but but how to put them

2716
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:57,439
together

2717
01:38:54,079 --> 01:39:01,679
in the process he's a he's an actor

2718
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:05,039
of love okay labor and love is that uh

2719
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:06,960
you can spend uh the entire day when i'm

2720
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:07,439
exaggerating by the entire morning for

2721
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:10,880
sure

2722
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:11,599
to do it uh properly yes the japanese

2723
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,679
cuisine too

2724
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:15,199
there's a mastery to the simplicity with

2725
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:17,520
the sushi i don't know if you've seen

2726
01:39:15,198 --> 01:39:18,319
george of sushi but there's a mastery to

2727
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,080
that that's

2728
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:21,599
propagated through the generations it's

2729
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:24,000
fascinating that's fascinating

2730
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,880
you know people love it uh when i ask

2731
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,238
about books

2732
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:29,199
i don't know if uh books whether fiction

2733
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:31,919
non-fiction

2734
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:33,439
technical or completely non-technical

2735
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:34,880
had an impact in your life

2736
01:39:33,439 --> 01:39:36,879
throughout if there's anything you would

2737
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,000
recommend or even just mention as

2738
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:41,600
something they give you

2739
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:44,880
an insight or moved you in some way

2740
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:47,760
so okay so i don't know if i recommend

2741
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,679
because in some sense you almost had to

2742
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,000
be italian or to be such a scholar but

2743
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:54,399
being

2744
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:57,039
italian one thing that really

2745
01:39:54,399 --> 01:39:57,759
impressed me tremendously is the divine

2746
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:00,880
comedy

2747
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:04,320
it is a medieval poem a very long poem

2748
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:06,000
divided in three parts hell purgatory in

2749
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:09,118
paradise okay

2750
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:13,520
and the vet is the non-trivial story

2751
01:40:09,118 --> 01:40:16,719
of a middleman man

2752
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:19,920
gets into a crisis personal crisis

2753
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:23,198
and then out of this crisis

2754
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:25,199
he purifies mesa catastrophes he

2755
01:40:23,198 --> 01:40:26,879
purifies himself more and more and more

2756
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:30,238
until

2757
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:31,118
he's become capable of actually meeting

2758
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:34,000
god

2759
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:34,479
okay and that is actually a complex

2760
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,238
story

2761
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:37,678
so you have to get some very

2762
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:40,000
sophisticated

2763
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:42,960
language maybe latino at that point that

2764
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:46,800
we were talking about 1200s um

2765
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:49,600
uh italy right in in florence

2766
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,560
and this guy instead he chose his own

2767
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,800
dialect

2768
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,920
not spoken outside his own immediate

2769
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,279
circle right

2770
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:58,639
um a florentine dollar actually he dante

2771
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:01,439
really made italian

2772
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:03,679
italian he was it's like how can you

2773
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:04,879
express such a sophisticated things and

2774
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:08,079
so this

2775
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:10,480
and then the point is that these words

2776
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:12,158
that uh nobody actually knew because

2777
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:15,118
they were essentially dialect

2778
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:16,960
and plus a bunch of very intricate

2779
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:18,158
rhymes in which they had to rhyme with

2780
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:21,840
things

2781
01:41:18,158 --> 01:41:23,439
and turns out that by getting meaning

2782
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:25,920
from the things with the rhyme

2783
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:26,960
you essentially guess what the world

2784
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,960
means

2785
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,239
and you invent italian and you

2786
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,719
communicate

2787
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:34,399
by almost osmosis what you want is a

2788
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:36,639
miracle of communication

2789
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:38,399
in a dialect a very poor language very

2790
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:39,679
unsophisticated to express a very

2791
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:42,799
sophisticated

2792
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:46,000
situation i love it

2793
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:49,360
people who love it and italians are not

2794
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,760
italian but but what i got of it is that

2795
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:53,439
you know

2796
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:55,840
very often limitations

2797
01:41:53,439 --> 01:41:58,000
are our strength because if you limit

2798
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,800
yourself at a very poor language

2799
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,399
somehow you get out of it and you

2800
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,719
achieve even better form of

2801
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:05,439
communication that are using a

2802
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:07,359
hyper-sophisticated and literary

2803
01:42:05,439 --> 01:42:09,279
language with lots of resonance from the

2804
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:11,439
prior books so that you can actually

2805
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:12,880
instantaneously quote he couldn't quote

2806
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:14,238
anything because nothing was written in

2807
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:17,920
italian before him

2808
01:42:14,238 --> 01:42:19,279
so i really felt that limitations are

2809
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:22,319
our strength

2810
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:23,519
and i think that rather than complaining

2811
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:27,840
about eliminations

2812
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:30,239
we should embrace them because

2813
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,360
if you embrace our limitation limited as

2814
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,638
we are we find

2815
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:37,439
very creative solutions that people with

2816
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:39,039
less limitation we have we would not

2817
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:40,879
even think about it oh this

2818
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:42,560
limitation is a kind of superpower if

2819
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:44,639
you choose to see it that way

2820
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:46,560
uh is there since you speak both

2821
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:49,679
languages is there something that's

2822
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:51,360
lost in translation to you is there

2823
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:53,440
something you can express in italian

2824
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:56,158
that you can't in english

2825
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:57,678
and vice versa maybe is there something

2826
01:42:56,158 --> 01:42:58,399
you could say to the musicality of the

2827
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:00,239
language

2828
01:42:58,399 --> 01:43:01,759
i mean i from i've been to italy a few

2829
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:04,399
times and uh

2830
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:05,520
i'm not sure if it's the actual words

2831
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:08,799
but it's

2832
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:11,040
the people are certainly very um

2833
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,440
there's body language too there's just

2834
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:16,079
the whole being is language

2835
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:16,719
so i don't know if uh you miss some of

2836
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:18,319
that

2837
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:20,800
when you're speaking english in this

2838
01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:24,479
country yes in fact

2839
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:26,800
actually i certainly i i'm uh

2840
01:43:24,479 --> 01:43:28,079
i miss it and uh somehow it was a

2841
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:31,119
sacrifice

2842
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:31,439
that i made consciously by the time when

2843
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:33,839
um

2844
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:35,678
i arrived i knew that this i was not

2845
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:38,880
going to express myself

2846
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:41,760
i'm a better level and uh and

2847
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,800
it was also sacrificed because uh given

2848
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,360
to you ever also

2849
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:46,000
your mother tongue is russian so you

2850
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:47,599
know that

2851
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
you can be very expressive in your

2852
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:52,719
mother tongue and not very expressive

2853
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,039
there's a neutron a new language and

2854
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:54,399
then

2855
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:56,719
what people think of you in the new

2856
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:58,079
language because when the precise of

2857
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:01,039
expression of things

2858
01:43:58,079 --> 01:44:02,079
it generates you know it shows a normal

2859
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:05,279
elegance

2860
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:08,399
or it shows you know knowledge or he

2861
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:10,238
shows us a census or he shows us a caste

2862
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:11,839
or an education whatever it is

2863
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:12,309
so all of a sudden i found myself on the

2864
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,639
border

2865
01:44:12,310 --> 01:44:17,199
[Laughter]

2866
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,840
so i had to fight all my way up back up

2867
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:21,118
and but

2868
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:22,960
but i'm not saying i go back to fasting

2869
01:44:21,118 --> 01:44:24,799
their limitations are actually our

2870
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:28,480
strength in fact is a trick

2871
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,960
to limit yourself to exceed right and

2872
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:31,198
you know

2873
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:34,000
there are examples in history if you

2874
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:37,039
think about you know

2875
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,439
right he goes to invade mexico he has

2876
01:44:37,039 --> 01:44:40,639
what

2877
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:42,799
a few hundred people with him and uh

2878
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:43,920
he has a hundred thousand people in arms

2879
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:47,279
on the other side

2880
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:50,719
first thing he does he limits himself

2881
01:44:47,279 --> 01:44:53,519
he sinks his own ship there is no return

2882
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:54,079
okay and at that point he actually

2883
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,600
managed

2884
01:44:54,079 --> 01:45:00,238
that's really good i i actually

2885
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:02,159
first of all that's inspiring to me i

2886
01:45:00,238 --> 01:45:03,359
feel like i have quite a few limitations

2887
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:06,559
but more practically

2888
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:07,920
on the russian side i'm going to try to

2889
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,000
do a couple of really

2890
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,279
big and really tough interviews in

2891
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,279
russian

2892
01:45:11,279 --> 01:45:14,960
uh once coveted lifts a little bit i'm

2893
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:18,639
traveling to russia

2894
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:20,560
and i'll keep your advice in mind

2895
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:22,239
that the limitations is a kind of

2896
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,039
superpower we should use it to our

2897
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:26,638
advantage

2898
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:28,840
because you do feel less

2899
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:30,239
like you're not able to convey your

2900
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,920
wisdom

2901
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:33,839
in in the russian language because i i

2902
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:36,800
moved here when i was 13

2903
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:37,360
so you don't you know the parts of life

2904
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:39,679
you live

2905
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:41,279
under a certain language are the parts

2906
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:45,359
of life you're able to communicate

2907
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:49,519
you know i became i became a thoughtful

2908
01:45:45,359 --> 01:45:53,039
deeply thoughtful human in english

2909
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:53,440
yes but the the the pain from world war

2910
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:56,158
ii

2911
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:57,279
this the the music of the people that

2912
01:45:56,158 --> 01:45:59,839
was instilled with me

2913
01:45:57,279 --> 01:46:01,359
in russian so i can carry both of those

2914
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:04,000
and there's limitations in both

2915
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:05,439
i can't say philosophically profound

2916
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,399
stuff in russian

2917
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:10,079
but i can't in english express like that

2918
01:46:08,399 --> 01:46:12,319
melancholy feeling

2919
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:13,600
of like the people and so combining

2920
01:46:12,319 --> 01:46:15,679
those two also

2921
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,800
beautifully said thanks for sharing this

2922
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:19,199
is great yes i

2923
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,000
totally understand you yes you've

2924
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:23,359
accomplished some

2925
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,158
incredible things in this space of

2926
01:46:23,359 --> 01:46:27,519
science

2927
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:30,638
in the space of technology

2928
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:31,600
space of theory and engineering do you

2929
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:34,000
have advice

2930
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:36,079
for somebody young an undergraduate

2931
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,600
student somebody in high school

2932
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:40,000
or anyone who just feels young uh about

2933
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:42,639
life

2934
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,000
or about career about making their way

2935
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:46,480
in this world

2936
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,520
so i was telling before but i believe in

2937
01:46:46,479 --> 01:46:51,439
emotion and

2938
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:54,800
my thing is to be true to your

2939
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:56,000
own emotion and that i think that if you

2940
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:57,920
do that

2941
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,279
you're doing well because it's a life

2942
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:03,199
well spent

2943
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:05,359
and you are going never tire because you

2944
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:05,919
want to solve all these emotional notes

2945
01:47:05,359 --> 01:47:07,839
that have

2946
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:10,319
always intrigued you from the beginning

2947
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:13,360
and i really believe that you know

2948
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:16,479
to to live live meaningfully

2949
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:17,599
creatively and yet to live your

2950
01:47:16,479 --> 01:47:19,678
emotional life

2951
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:20,960
so i really believe that whether you're

2952
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:23,359
a scientist or an

2953
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:24,960
artist even more but a scientist i think

2954
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:25,759
of them as artists as well if you are a

2955
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,158
human being

2956
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:28,880
so you are really to live fully your

2957
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:31,839
emotions

2958
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:33,760
and to the extent possible sometimes

2959
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:38,239
emotions cannot be overbearing

2960
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:40,159
and my devices try to express them

2961
01:47:38,238 --> 01:47:41,839
more and more confident sometimes is

2962
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:45,039
hard but that you are going to be

2963
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:45,840
much more fulfilled than by suppressing

2964
01:47:45,039 --> 01:47:48,319
them

2965
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:50,239
what about love one of the big ones what

2966
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:53,359
role does that play um it's

2967
01:47:50,238 --> 01:47:53,919
a bit uh a bigger part of emotions but

2968
01:47:53,359 --> 01:47:56,399
it's a

2969
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,199
it's a scary thing right it's a there's

2970
01:47:56,399 --> 01:48:00,319
a lot of

2971
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:03,839
vulnerability that comes with a love

2972
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:04,880
but there is uh also so much you know

2973
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:08,639
energy

2974
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:10,960
and power and uh and um and love in all

2975
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:14,159
senses and in the traditional sense

2976
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:16,719
but also in in the sense of uh

2977
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:18,000
a broader sense for uh for humanity

2978
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:20,880
feeling this you know

2979
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,399
compassion of it you know makes us one

2980
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,159
with you know other people and be

2981
01:48:22,399 --> 01:48:28,158
suffering or other people

2982
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:28,559
i mean all of this is uh is a very scary

2983
01:48:28,158 --> 01:48:32,879
stuff

2984
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:32,880
but he's really very very

2985
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:38,319
the sad thing is it really hurts to lose

2986
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:40,479
it

2987
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:42,079
yes that's why you have all the ability

2988
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:43,599
that comes with it yes that's the thing

2989
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:46,800
about emotion is

2990
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:48,000
it's up and down and uh the down seems

2991
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:51,440
to come always

2992
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,880
with up so but the up only comes with a

2993
01:48:51,439 --> 01:48:56,079
down so

2994
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:58,880
yeah uh let me ask you about the

2995
01:48:56,079 --> 01:49:00,238
the ultimate down which is uh

2996
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:03,920
unfortunately

2997
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:05,919
we humans are mortal or appear to be

2998
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:07,760
for the most part uh do you think about

2999
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:11,199
your own mortality

3000
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:14,320
do you do you fear death

3001
01:49:11,198 --> 01:49:16,799
i hope so and i because

3002
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:18,799
i mean without death there is no life so

3003
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,360
at least there is no meaningful life

3004
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:23,119
a death is actually in some sense our

3005
01:49:21,359 --> 01:49:25,920
ultimate motivator

3006
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:26,479
to live a beautiful a meaningful life i

3007
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:29,760
myself

3008
01:49:26,479 --> 01:49:32,319
felt as a young man a vetter unless i

3009
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:34,560
i gotten something that i wanted to do i

3010
01:49:32,319 --> 01:49:36,559
don't know why i go to this idea i said

3011
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:38,400
something to say if i'm not able to say

3012
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:40,480
i would suicide so

3013
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:41,920
maybe it was a way to motivate myself

3014
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:42,479
but you don't need to motivate it

3015
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:44,480
because

3016
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:45,598
in some sense unfortunately death is

3017
01:49:44,479 --> 01:49:48,959
there so

3018
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:52,319
you better get up and do your thing

3019
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:56,480
and uh because that is

3020
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:58,399
the best motivation to to live fully

3021
01:49:56,479 --> 01:50:01,039
what do you think what do you hope your

3022
01:49:58,399 --> 01:50:01,039
legacy is

3023
01:50:03,198 --> 01:50:11,678
you know you mentioned you have two kids

3024
01:50:08,319 --> 01:50:14,719
yes and so i really feel that you know

3025
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:18,158
there is uh on one side

3026
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:21,920
is my biological uh legacy and that

3027
01:50:18,158 --> 01:50:25,198
is uh my two kids right and uh

3028
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:25,840
and their kids hopefully and that is one

3029
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:29,359
fine

3030
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:32,800
and the other thing is uh this a

3031
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:36,158
common enterprise which is a

3032
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:37,360
society and i really feel that my legacy

3033
01:50:36,158 --> 01:50:42,399
would be

3034
01:50:37,359 --> 01:50:45,759
better by providing security and privacy

3035
01:50:42,399 --> 01:50:47,359
actually for me are metaphorical to say

3036
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,719
i want to give you the ability to

3037
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:52,000
interact more and take

3038
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:53,760
more risks and and reach out tomorrow

3039
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,279
for more people as difficult and

3040
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:58,800
dangerous as amazing

3041
01:50:55,279 --> 01:51:01,679
but my old scientific work is about to

3042
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:03,760
to guarantee privacy and and give you

3043
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:06,560
the security of interaction

3044
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:08,960
and not only in that transaction like it

3045
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:13,360
would be a blockchain transaction but

3046
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:15,760
that is really one of the hardcore of my

3047
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:16,880
emotional problems and i think of it you

3048
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:19,679
know

3049
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:21,039
these are the problems i want to tackle

3050
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:24,399
yeah and ultimately

3051
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:26,719
privacy and security is freedom yes

3052
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:29,839
freedom is at the core of this uh it's

3053
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:32,000
uh dangerous just it's like the emotion

3054
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:33,520
yeah but ultimately that's how we create

3055
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,520
all the beautiful things around us do

3056
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:39,199
you think there's meaning to it all

3057
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:41,119
uh this life except the urgency that

3058
01:51:39,198 --> 01:51:45,039
death provides

3059
01:51:41,118 --> 01:51:46,079
and us anxious beings create cool stuff

3060
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:48,319
along the way

3061
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:49,920
is there a deeper meaning and if it is

3062
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:52,079
what is it

3063
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:53,760
well meaning your life actually there

3064
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:57,599
are three meanings of life

3065
01:51:53,760 --> 01:52:01,039
great that's great one too sick

3066
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:03,920
two too sick and three too sick

3067
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:04,800
to seek what you know or is there no

3068
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:07,039
answer there

3069
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:08,159
is no answer to that i really think that

3070
01:52:07,039 --> 01:52:10,880
the journey is more

3071
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:12,319
more important than uh the destination

3072
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:16,239
whatever to be

3073
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:16,719
and i think uh that is uh a journey and

3074
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:19,519
uh

3075
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:19,920
is uh in my opinion at the end of the

3076
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:24,560
day

3077
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:27,199
i must admit meaningful in itself and uh

3078
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:28,719
we must admit that maybe whatever your

3079
01:52:27,198 --> 01:52:32,158
destination

3080
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:35,279
might be i'd hang it you know

3081
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:37,920
we may never get there but uh hell was a

3082
01:52:35,279 --> 01:52:39,519
great ride

3083
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:41,679
