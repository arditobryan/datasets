00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,759
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,160
peter white a theoretical physicist at

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,638
columbia outspoken critical string

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,359
theory and the author of the popular

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:13,439
physics and mathematics blog called not

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,678
even wrong

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,439
this is the lex friedman podcast to

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,839
support it please check out our sponsors

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,600
in the description and now here's my

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,599
conversation with peter white

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,199
you're both a physicist and a

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,960
mathematician

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,519
so let me ask what is the difference

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,200
between physics and mathematics

15
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,479
well there's kind of a conventional

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
understanding of the subject that

17
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,359
they're

18
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,519
two you know quite different things so

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,558
that mathematics is about you know

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,399
making

21
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,519
rigorous statements about

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,520
these abstract you know abstract things

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,680
things of mathematics and and proving

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,600
them rigorously and physics is about you

25
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,320
know doing experiments and

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,079
testing various models and that but i

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,878
think the more interesting thing is that

28
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,558
the

29
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,399
there's a

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,000
yeah there's a wide variety of what

31
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,439
people do as mathematics what they do is

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,159
physics and there's a significant

33
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,039
overlap and that i think is actually the

34
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,960
much much very very interesting area and

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,840
if you go back kind of far enough to in

36
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,759
in in history and look at figures like

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,040
newton or something i mean there it at

38
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,319
that point you can't really tell you

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,560
know was newton a physicist or a

40
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,679
mathematician yeah mathematicians will

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,280
tell you as a mathematician the

42
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,799
physicist will tell you as a physicist

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,680
but he would say he's a philosopher yeah

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,840
yeah

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,759
that's that's interesting but uh yeah

46
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,600
anyway there there was kind of no such

47
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,799
distinction then it's more of a modern

48
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,158
thing and

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,600
but anyway i think these days there's a

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,640
very interesting space in between the

51
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,640
two so in the story of the 20th century

52
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,478
and the early 21st century what is the

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,759
overlap between mathematics and physics

54
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,039
would you say

55
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,040
well i think

56
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,560
it's actually become very very

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,240
complicated i think it's really

58
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,600
interesting to see a lot of what my

59
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,000
colleagues and

60
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,039
math department are doing they

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,640
most of what they're doing they're doing

62
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,159
all sorts of different things but um

63
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,239
most of them have some kind of overlap

64
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
with physics or other

65
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,078
so i mean i'm personally interested in

66
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,679
one spec one particular aspect of this

67
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:08,719
overlap which i think

68
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,239
has a lot to do with the most

69
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,120
fundamental ideas about physics and

70
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,280
about

71
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,239
mathematics but um

72
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,719
there's just

73
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,719
you you kind of see this this uh

74
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,560
really really everywhere at this point

75
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,919
which particular overlap are you looking

76
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,120
at group theory yeah so the um

77
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,559
at least

78
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,400
what the way it seems to me that if you

79
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,920
look at physics and look at the our most

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,760
successful um

81
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,878
laws of fundamental physics

82
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,079
they're

83
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:35,679
really you know they have a certain kind

84
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,560
of mathematical structure it's based

85
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,159
upon

86
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,280
certain kind of mathematical objects and

87
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,759
geometry connections and curvature the

88
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
spinners the rock equation

89
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,280
and uh that

90
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
these this very deep mathematics

91
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,919
provides kind of a unifying

92
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,840
set of meth of ways of thinking that

93
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,000
allow you to to make a unified theory of

94
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
physics but the interesting thing is

95
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,479
that if you go to mathematics and look

96
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,598
at what's been going on in mathematics

97
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,639
the last

98
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,000
1500 years and even especially recently

99
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,639
there's a

100
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
similarly some kind of unifying ideas

101
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,598
which bring together different areas of

102
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,120
mathematics and which have been

103
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,479
especially powerful in number theory

104
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,800
recently and

105
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,039
there's a book for instance by um

106
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,719
edward frankel about love and math and

107
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,000
oh yeah that book is great i recommend

108
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,719
it highly it's uh partially accessible

109
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,878
but there's a nice audio book

110
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,759
that i had listened to while

111
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:34,399
running an exceptionally long distance

112
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,359
like across the san francisco

113
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
bridge

114
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,680
and uh there's something magic about the

115
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,878
way he writes about it but some of the

116
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,840
group theory in there is a little bit

117
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:43,598
difficult

118
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
uh yeah it's a problem with any of these

119
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,878
things to kind of really say what's

120
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,879
going on is

121
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,560
and make it accessible is very hard

122
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:52,878
he in this book and elsewhere i think

123
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,400
you know takes the attitude that kinds

124
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,039
of mathematics he's interested in and

125
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,120
that he's talking about are provide kind

126
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,239
of a grand unified theory of mathematics

127
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,000
they um they bring together geometry and

128
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,680
number theory and

129
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,039
representation theory a lot of different

130
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,080
ideas

131
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,519
in a really

132
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,200
unexpected way

133
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,480
but i think to me the most fascinating

134
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,759
thing is if you look at

135
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,518
the kind of grand unified theory of

136
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,358
mathematics he's talking about and you

137
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,759
look at the physicists kind of ideas

138
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,439
about unification it's more or less the

139
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,479
same mathematical objects are appearing

140
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,719
in both

141
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,319
so it's this um i think there's a really

142
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
we're seeing a really strong indication

143
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,680
that you know the deepest

144
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,279
ideas that we're discovering about

145
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,040
physics and some of the deepest ideas

146
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,959
that mathematicians are learning about

147
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,000
are really are you know intimately

148
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,239
connected

149
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
is there something like if i was five

150
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,040
years old you were trying to explain

151
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,080
this to me is there ways to try to sneak

152
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,600
up to the to to what this unified world

153
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,240
of mathematics looks like you said

154
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,400
number theory he said geometry

155
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,079
words like topology

156
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,399
what does this universe begin to look

157
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,399
like are these what should we imagine in

158
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,560
our mind is it a

159
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,399
a three-dimensional surface

160
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,120
and we're trying to say something about

161
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,560
it

162
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
is it uh

163
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,959
triangles and squares and cubes like

164
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,280
what what are we supposed to imagine our

165
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,680
minds is this natural number what what's

166
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,198
a good thing to try to

167
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,879
for people that

168
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,879
don't know any of these tools except

169
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,639
maybe some basic calculus and geometry

170
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,159
from high school that they should keep

171
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,720
in their minds

172
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,800
as to the unified world of mathematics

173
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,720
that also

174
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,840
allows us to explore the unified world

175
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,600
of physics

176
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,239
the i mean what i

177
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
find kind of remarkable about this is

178
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,240
the way in which

179
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,319
these we've discovered these ideas but

180
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,038
they're they're actually quite alien to

181
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,639
our everyday understanding you know we

182
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,399
grow up in this three spatial

183
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,079
dimensional world and we have

184
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,319
intimate understanding of certain kinds

185
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,879
of geometry and certain kinds of things

186
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,839
but um these things that we've

187
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,519
discovered in both math and physics are

188
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,758
that they're not at all

189
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,680
close have any obvious connection to

190
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,759
kind of human everyday experience that

191
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,680
they're really quite different and i can

192
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,038
say some of my initial fascination with

193
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,639
this when i was

194
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:09,519
young and starting to learn about it was

195
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,639
actually

196
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,639
exactly this um

197
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,800
this kind of arcane nature of these

198
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,199
things it was a little bit like being

199
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,120
being told well there are these kind of

200
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,240
some semi-mystical experience that you

201
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,120
can acquire by a long study and whatever

202
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,038
except

203
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,240
that that it was actually true there's

204
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,360
actually evidence that this actually

205
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,519
works

206
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,960
so you know i'm a little bit wary of

207
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,918
trying to give people

208
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,599
and that kind of thing because i think

209
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,839
it's mostly misleading but one thing to

210
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,199
say is that you know that geometry is a

211
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,279
large

212
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,120
part of it and um

213
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,638
maybe one interesting thing to say very

214
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,038
that's about more recent some of the

215
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,360
most recent ideas is that it um when we

216
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,598
think about the geometry of our space

217
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,400
and time it's kind of three spatial and

218
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,360
one

219
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,758
time dimension it's a um

220
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,919
physics is in some sense about

221
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,400
something as kind of four dimensional in

222
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,159
a way and that a really interesting

223
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,638
thing about um some of the recent

224
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,199
developments and number theory have been

225
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,720
to realize that the um

226
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,038
these ideas that we were looking at you

227
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,479
know naturally fit into a context where

228
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,680
your theory is for is kind of four

229
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,639
dimensional

230
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,360
so

231
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,439
so so so i mean geometry is a big part

232
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,199
of this and we know a lot and feel a lot

233
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,598
about you know two one two three

234
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,000
dimensional geometry so wait a minute so

235
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:31,360
we can at least rely

236
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,038
on the four dimensions of space and time

237
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,598
and say that we can get pretty far by

238
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,719
working that in those four dimensions i

239
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,639
thought you were going to scare me that

240
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,960
we're going to have to go to many many

241
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,800
many many more dimensions than that

242
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,079
my point of view which is which goes

243
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,199
against a lot of these ideas about

244
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:49,279
unification is that no this is really

245
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,319
everything we do we know about really is

246
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:54,159
about four dimensions that um

247
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,439
and and that you can actually understand

248
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,960
a lot of these structures that we've

249
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,680
been seeing in fundamental physics and

250
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,478
in

251
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,560
in number theory just in terms of

252
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,279
four dimensions that it's kind of

253
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,199
it's in some sense i would claim

254
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,758
has been a really um

255
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,520
has been kind of a mistake that

256
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,639
physicists have made and

257
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,639
for decades and decades to try to

258
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,240
to try to go to higher dimensions to try

259
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,240
to formulate a theory in higher

260
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,038
dimensions and then then you're stuck

261
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,319
with

262
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,598
the problem how do you get rid of all

263
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,879
these extra dimensions that you've

264
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,319
created and

265
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,280
because we only ever see anything

266
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,039
important

267
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,359
that kind of thing leads us astray you

268
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,199
think so so creating all these extra

269
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,599
dimensions just to get to give yourself

270
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,120
extra degrees of freedom

271
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,519
yeah it's not i mean isn't that the

272
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,360
process of mathematics is to create

273
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,039
all these trajectories for yourself but

274
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,759
eventually you have to end up at the uh

275
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,159
like a final place but it's okay to

276
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:54,000
it's okay to sort of um

277
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,759
create abstract objects on your path to

278
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,759
uh proving something

279
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:59,519
yeah so yeah certainly but and from from

280
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,480
mathematicians point of view

281
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,080
i mean

282
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,000
the kinds of mathematicians also are

283
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,839
very different than physicists and that

284
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,519
we like to develop very general theories

285
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,600
we like to if we have an idea we want to

286
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,519
um see what's the greatest generality in

287
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,519
which you can talk about it so from the

288
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,759
point of view of most of the ways

289
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,440
geometry is formulated um

290
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,200
by mathematicians it really doesn't

291
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,160
matter it works in any dimension we can

292
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,920
do

293
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,519
one two three four any any number

294
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,039
there's no particular

295
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,080
for most of geometry there's no

296
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,919
particular special thing but for

297
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,320
but um

298
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,838
and anyway but but what physicists have

299
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,600
have been trying to do over the years is

300
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,279
try to understand

301
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
these fundamental theories in a

302
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,720
geometrical way and it's very tempting

303
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
to kind of just

304
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,320
start bringing in

305
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,079
extra dimensions

306
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,360
and using them to explain the structure

307
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,278
but

308
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
um

309
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,360
typically this this attempt kind of

310
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,839
founders because you just don't know

311
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,120
you end up not being able to explain why

312
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,920
we only see four and anyway

313
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,519
it is nice in the space of physics that

314
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,399
uh like if you look at from o's last

315
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,919
theorem

316
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,399
it's much easier to prove that there's

317
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:11,519
no solution for n equals three

318
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,159
than it is for the general case

319
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,480
and and so i guess that's the nice

320
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,159
benefit of being a physicist is you

321
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,399
don't have to worry about the general

322
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,679
case because we live in a universe with

323
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,200
n equals

324
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,278
four in this case

325
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,120
yeah the physiophysicists are very

326
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,120
interested in

327
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,839
saying something about specific examples

328
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,519
and

329
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,680
i find that interesting even when i'm

330
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,839
trying to do things in mathematics and

331
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,239
i'm trying even teaching courses and

332
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,079
mathematics students i find that

333
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,039
i'm teaching them in a different way

334
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:45,599
than um most mathematicians because i'm

335
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,639
very often very focused on examples on

336
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,399
what's

337
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,720
what's kind of the crucial example that

338
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,720
shows how this um

339
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,639
this powerful new mathematical technique

340
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,759
how it works and why you would want to

341
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,319
to do it

342
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,078
and i'm less interested in kind of

343
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,440
you know proving a precise theorem about

344
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:02,799
exactly when it's going to work and when

345
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,680
it's not going to work do you think

346
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:08,319
about really simple examples like uh

347
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,719
both for teaching and when you

348
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,399
try to solve a difficult problem are you

349
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,160
do construct like the simplest possible

350
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
examples that captures the fundamentals

351
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,480
of the problem and try to solve it yeah

352
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,399
yeah exactly that's often

353
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,120
a really fruitful way to if you've got

354
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,240
some idea to you just kind of try to

355
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,839
boil it down to what's the simplest

356
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,519
situation in which this kind of thing is

357
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,279
going to happen and then try to really

358
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,200
understand that and understand that and

359
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,039
that that is almost always a really good

360
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,839
way to get insight into do you work with

361
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,000
uh paper and pen or like for example for

362
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,440
me

363
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,519
coming from the programming side if you

364
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,000
if i look at a model if i look at some

365
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,399
kind of mathematical object

366
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,958
i like to mess around with it sort of

367
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,278
numerically i just visualize different

368
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,719
parts of it visualize however i can so

369
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,360
most of the work is like with neural

370
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,360
networks for example as you try to play

371
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,519
with the simplest possible example and

372
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,278
just to build up intuition by

373
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,720
um you know

374
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,799
any kind of object has a bunch of

375
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,320
variables in it

376
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,519
you start to mess around with them in

377
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,720
different ways and visualize in

378
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,078
different ways to start to build

379
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,120
intuition

380
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,239
or do you go to einstein route and just

381
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,519
imagine

382
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,600
like

383
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,240
everything inside your mind and sort of

384
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,639
build like thought experiments and then

385
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,120
work purely on paper and pen

386
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,000
well the problem with this kind of

387
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,159
stuff

388
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,679
i'm interested in is it you you rarely

389
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,439
can kind of

390
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,638
it's really something that is really

391
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
kind of

392
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,480
or even the simplest example

393
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,000
you know it can is you can kind of see

394
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,159
what's going on by it looking at

395
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,519
something happening in three dimensions

396
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,719
there's there's generally this the

397
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,240
structures involved are um

398
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,839
either they're more abstract or if you

399
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,799
try to kind of embed them in some kind

400
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,240
of space and where you could um

401
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,000
manipulate them in some kind of

402
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,240
geometrical way it's going to be a much

403
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,919
higher dimensional space so even simple

404
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,959
examples

405
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,399
the embedding them into

406
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,599
three-dimensional space you're losing a

407
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,958
lot yeah or but to capture what your

408
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,040
what you're trying to understand about

409
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,719
them you have to go to four or more

410
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,759
dimensions so it starts to get to be

411
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,959
hard to

412
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,039
i mean you can

413
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,479
train yourself to try it as much as to

414
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,319
kind of

415
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,519
think about things in your mind and you

416
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,399
know i often use pad and paper and often

417
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,639
if i'm

418
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,720
in my office often use the blackboard

419
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,480
um and you are kind of drawing things

420
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,560
but they're really kind of more abstract

421
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,959
representations of how

422
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,479
things are supposed to fit together and

423
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,399
they're not really

424
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,959
unfortunately not just kind of really

425
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,679
living in three dimensions where you can

426
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,198
are we supposed to be sad or excited by

427
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,879
the fact that our human minds can't

428
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,759
fully comprehend the kind of mathematics

429
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,120
you're talking about i i mean

430
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,679
what do we make of that i mean to me

431
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,120
that makes me quite sad it makes me it

432
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,359
makes it seem like there's a giant

433
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,360
mystery out there that we'll never truly

434
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,240
get to experience

435
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,639
directly it is kind of sad you know how

436
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,959
difficult this is i mean or i would put

437
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
it a different way that um

438
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,479
you know most questions that people have

439
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,480
about this kind of thing

440
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,399
you know you couldn't you can give them

441
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,759
a really a true answer and really

442
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,480
understand it but

443
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,600
the problem is is one more of um of time

444
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
it's like

445
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,240
yes you know i could explain to you how

446
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,159
this works but you have to be willing to

447
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,680
sit down with me and you know work at

448
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,838
this repeatedly for

449
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,078
you know for hours and days and weeks

450
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,480
and you you mean it's just going to take

451
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,519
that long for your mind to really wrap

452
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,600
itself around what's going on and um

453
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,759
and that so that does make things an

454
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,759
inaccessible which is uh

455
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,278
which is sad but it again i mean it's

456
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,039
just kind of part of life that we all

457
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,519
have a limited amount of time and we

458
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,759
have to decide what we're going to

459
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,399
what we're going to spend our time doing

460
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:55,039
speaking of a limited amount of time we

461
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,600
only have a few hours maybe a few days

462
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,838
together here on this podcast

463
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,959
let me ask you the question

464
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,800
of um

465
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,599
amongst many of the ideas that you work

466
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,919
on

467
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,079
in mathematics and physics what to use

468
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,159
the most beautiful idea or one of the

469
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:13,039
most beautiful ideas maybe a surprising

470
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,719
idea and once again unfortunately the

471
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,319
way life works we only have a limited

472
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,278
time together try to convey such an idea

473
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,160
okay well actually let me just tell you

474
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,600
something which i i'm tempted to kind of

475
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,278
start trying to explain what i think is

476
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,519
this most powerful idea that brings

477
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,519
together math and physics ideas about

478
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,600
groups and representations and how it

479
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,198
fits quantum mechanics and but in some

480
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,320
sense i wrote a whole textbook about

481
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:37,519
that and

482
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,920
i don't think we really have time to get

483
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,078
very far into it so well can i actually

484
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,519
on a small tangent you did write a paper

485
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,519
towards the grant unified theory

486
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,839
mathematics and physics

487
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,519
um maybe you could step there first what

488
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,440
is the key idea in that paper well i

489
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,959
think we've kind of gone over that i

490
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,240
think that the key idea is what we were

491
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:58,000
talking about earlier that um

492
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
that just kind of a claim that if you

493
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
look and see what's that have been

494
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,519
successful ideas in unification in

495
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,240
physics and over the last

496
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,759
um 50 years or so and what

497
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,198
has been happening in mathematics and

498
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,199
the kind of thing that

499
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,879
frankl's book is about that these are

500
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,319
very much the same kind of mathematics

501
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,439
and so it's kind of an argument that

502
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
there really

503
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,199
is

504
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,879
you shouldn't be looking to unify just

505
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,240
math or just

506
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,559
fundamental physics but taking

507
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,000
inspiration for looking for new ideas in

508
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,479
fundamental physics that they are going

509
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,720
to be in the same direction of

510
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,199
getting deeper into mathematics and

511
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,480
looking for more inspiration mathematics

512
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,159
from

513
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,199
these successful ideas about fundamental

514
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:38,879
physics

515
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,479
could you put words to sort of the

516
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,559
disciplines we're trying to unify so you

517
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,839
said number theory are we literally

518
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,159
talking about all the major fields of

519
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,839
mathematics so it's like the number

520
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,719
theory geometry

521
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,680
uh so the differential geometry topology

522
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,199
like yeah

523
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:57,439
so the i mean one one name for this

524
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,599
that this is acquired in in mathematics

525
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,120
is the so-called language program

526
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,040
and uh so this started out in

527
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,480
mathematics it's that

528
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,038
you know robert langland's kind of

529
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,880
realized that a lot of what people were

530
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,240
doing and um

531
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,959
that was starting to be really

532
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,880
successful in number theory in the

533
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,959
60s and so that this actually

534
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,559
was

535
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,720
anyway that this could be could be

536
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,558
thought of in terms of um

537
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
these ideas about symmetry in groups and

538
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,078
representations

539
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,759
and and

540
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,720
in a way that was also close to some

541
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,960
ideas about about geometry and um then

542
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,798
it more later on in the 80s and 90s

543
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,200
there was something called um

544
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,720
geometric language that people realize

545
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
that you could take what people have

546
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,720
been doing in number theory in language

547
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,240
and and and get re just forget about the

548
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,319
number theory and ask what is this

549
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,240
telling you about geometry and you get a

550
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,240
whole some new insights into certain

551
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,400
kinds of geometry that way

552
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,319
so it's anyway that that's kind of the

553
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,919
name for this area is langlins and

554
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,439
geometric language

555
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,038
and just recently in the last few months

556
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,558
there's been um

557
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,279
there's kind of a really major paper

558
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:07,678
that uh appeared by uh peter schultz and

559
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,399
laurel farg where they

560
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,720
you know made you know some serious

561
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,880
advance and trying to understand

562
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,720
a very much

563
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,799
kind of a local problem of what happens

564
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,720
in number theory near a certain prime

565
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,038
number and they

566
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,200
turn this into a problem of exactly the

567
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,558
the kind the geometric

568
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,798
language people had been doing these

569
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,678
kind of pure a pure geometry problem and

570
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:30,798
they

571
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,320
found

572
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:33,839
by generalizing the mathematics they

573
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,879
could actually reformulate it in that

574
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:39,678
way and it worked perfectly well

575
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,280
one of the things that makes me sad

576
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,600
is you know i'm um pretty knowledgeable

577
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,960
person and then

578
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,798
uh what is it at least i'm in the

579
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,400
neighborhood of like theoretical

580
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,639
computer science right

581
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,320
and it's still way out of my reach and

582
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,840
so many people talk about like language

583
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,159
for example is one of the most brilliant

584
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,839
people in mathematics and just really

585
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,279
admires work

586
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,519
and i can't

587
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,759
it's like almost i can't hear the music

588
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,319
that he composed and it makes me sad

589
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,558
yeah well i mean i i think that

590
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,038
unfortunately it's not just

591
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,038
you as i think even most mathematicians

592
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,879
have no really don't actually understand

593
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,279
this about them in the the group of

594
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,039
people who really understand

595
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,319
all these ideas and so for instance this

596
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:23,679
paper of

597
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,279
schultz and farg that i was talking

598
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,160
about the number of people who really

599
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,678
actually understand how that works is

600
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,320
anyway one

601
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,519
very very small and so it's uh so i i

602
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,038
think even

603
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,960
you find if you talk to mathematicians

604
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:38,558
and physicists even they will often feel

605
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,360
that you know there's this really

606
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,720
interesting sounding stuff going on and

607
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,240
which i should be able to understand

608
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,558
it's kind of in my own field i have a

609
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,599
phd in but it still seems it's pretty

610
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:52,160
clearly far beyond me right now

611
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,399
well if we can step into the back to the

612
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,038
question of beauty uh

613
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,400
is there an idea that maybe is a little

614
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:59,919
bit smaller

615
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,840
that you find beautiful in the space of

616
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,600
mathematics or physics

617
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,599
there's an idea that you know i kind of

618
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,678
went got a physics phd and spent a lot

619
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,639
of time learning about mathematics and i

620
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,720
guess

621
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,400
it was embarrassing and i hadn't really

622
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,440
actually understood this very simple

623
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,600
idea

624
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,000
um until and kind of learned it when i

625
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,839
actually started teaching math classes

626
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,400
which

627
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:23,839
is maybe that there there may be

628
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,240
there's a simple way to explain kind of

629
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,558
the fundamental way in which algebra and

630
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,519
geometry are connected so you normally

631
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,519
think of geometry is about these spaces

632
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,359
and these points and

633
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,679
and you think of algebra is this very

634
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,519
abstract thing about with these

635
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,159
abstract objects that satisfy certain

636
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,759
kinds of relations you can multiply them

637
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,280
and add them and

638
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,119
do stuff but it's it's completely

639
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,798
abstract and there's nothing geometric

640
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,639
about it but the um

641
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,359
the kind of really

642
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,159
fundamental idea is that unifies algebra

643
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:59,599
and geometry is to is to realize is to

644
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,440
think when whenever anybody gives you

645
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,119
what you call an algebra some abstract

646
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,159
thing of things that you can multiply

647
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,239
and add

648
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,559
that you should ask yourself

649
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,480
is that algebra the space of functions

650
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,158
on some geometry

651
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,240
so one of the most surprising examples

652
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,480
of this for instance is a

653
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,679
i mean a standard kind of

654
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,159
thing that seems to have nothing to do

655
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,120
with geometry is the um

656
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,039
is the

657
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:26,158
the integers so then they're you can you

658
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:28,879
can multiply them and add them it's

659
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,000
it's an algebra but the um

660
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,000
it has seems to have nothing to do with

661
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,599
geometry but what you can it turns out

662
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,319
but if you ask yourself this question

663
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,678
and ask you know is are integers can you

664
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,359
think if somebody gives you an integer

665
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,640
can you think of it as a function on

666
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,038
some space

667
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,600
on some geometry and it turns out that

668
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,119
yes you can and the space is the space

669
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,558
of prime numbers

670
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,239
and so what you do is you just if

671
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,480
somebody gives you an integer

672
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,000
you can make a function on the prime

673
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,679
numbers by just

674
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,798
you know at each prime number taking

675
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,679
that

676
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,440
that integer modulo that prime so if uh

677
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,320
if you say i don't know if you get given

678
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,558
10

679
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,720
you know 10 and you ask what is its

680
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,678
value at 2 well it's

681
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,240
it's 5 times 2 so mod 2 it's zero so it

682
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,519
has zero one what what is what is this

683
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,079
value at three

684
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,279
well it's nine plus one so it's it's one

685
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,359
mod three

686
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,759
so it's about it's zero at two it's one

687
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,359
at three and you can kind of keep going

688
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,279
and so

689
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,519
this is really kind of a

690
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,279
truly fundamental idea it's at the basis

691
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,720
of what's called algebraic geometry and

692
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,000
it just links these two parts of

693
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,159
mathematics that look completely

694
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,640
different and it's just an incredibly

695
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,240
powerful idea and so much of mathematics

696
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,038
emerges from this kind of

697
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,038
simple relation so uh you're talking

698
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,440
about mapping from one discrete space to

699
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,879
another to another so

700
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,720
um

701
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,720
for a second i thought perhaps

702
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,400
uh mapping like a continuous space of

703
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,038
discrete space like functions over a

704
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,120
continuous space

705
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,839
because yeah well you can i mean you can

706
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:03,279
take if somebody gives you a space

707
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,639
you can ask you can say well let's let's

708
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,079
and this is also this is part of the

709
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,159
same idea the part of the same idea is

710
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,399
that if you try and do geometry and

711
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,760
somebody tells you here's a space

712
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,840
that what you should do is you said wait

713
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,839
say wait wait a minute maybe i should be

714
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,240
trying to solve this using algebra and

715
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,599
so if i do that the way to start is you

716
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,038
give me the space

717
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,678
i start to think about the functions of

718
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,679
the space okay so for to each point in

719
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,038
the space i associate

720
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,960
a number i can take different kinds of

721
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,519
functions and different kinds of values

722
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,440
but but basically functions on a space

723
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,400
so

724
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,480
what this

725
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,519
insight is telling you is that if you're

726
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,200
a geometer often the way to to to work

727
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:43,440
is to trans change your problem into

728
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,278
algebra by changing your space stop

729
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,038
thinking about your space and the points

730
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,038
in it and think about the functions on

731
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,480
it got it and if you're if you're an

732
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,319
algebraic and you and you've got these

733
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,038
abstract algebraic gadgets that you're

734
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,879
multiplying and adding say wait a minute

735
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,640
are those gadgets

736
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,000
can i think of them in some way as a

737
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,840
function on a space what would that

738
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,640
space be and what kind of functions

739
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:06,639
would they be and that going back and

740
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,159
forth really brings these two

741
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,799
completely different looking areas of

742
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,600
mathematics together do you have uh

743
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,359
particular examples where it allowed to

744
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,359
prove some difficult things by jumping

745
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,519
from one to the other is that something

746
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:22,158
that's a part of modern mathematics

747
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,359
where such jumps are made oh yes this is

748
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,278
kind of all the time

749
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,158
a lot much much of modern number theory

750
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,919
is kind of based on this idea but

751
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,799
and and when you start doing this you

752
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,640
start to realize that you need you know

753
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,558
what simple

754
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,880
things simple things on one side

755
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,079
algebras start to require you to think

756
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,000
about

757
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,119
the other side about geometry in a new

758
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,599
way you have to kind of get a more

759
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,399
sophisticated idea about geometry or if

760
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,678
you

761
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,880
start thinking about the functions on a

762
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,559
space

763
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,039
you may have you may need a more

764
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,558
sophisticated kind of algebra but um but

765
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,319
in some sense i mean much or most of

766
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,678
modern number theory is

767
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,200
based upon this move to geometry and um

768
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,000
there's also a lot of geometry and

769
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,600
topology is also based upon

770
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,038
yeah changing if you want to understand

771
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,000
the topology of something you look at

772
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,240
the functions you do dram comology and

773
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,519
you get the topology

774
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,038
anyway

775
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,879
well let me let me ask you then the

776
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,480
ridiculous question you said that this

777
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,120
idea is beautiful

778
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,558
uh can you formalize the definition of

779
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,359
the word beautiful

780
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,278
and why is this beautiful like first why

781
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,759
is this beautiful and second

782
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,640
um what is beautiful

783
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:31,759
well

784
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,360
and i think there are many different

785
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,278
things you can find beautiful for

786
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,879
different reasons i mean i think in this

787
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,558
context

788
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,000
the notion of beauty i think really is

789
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,558
just kind of

790
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,200
an idea is beautiful if it's

791
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:47,599
packages a huge amount of kind of

792
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,919
power and information into

793
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,240
something very simple so in some sense

794
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,320
you i mean

795
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,480
you can almost kind of try and measure

796
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,240
it in the sense of you know what's the

797
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,960
what are the implications of this idea

798
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,720
what

799
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,000
non-trivial things does it tell you

800
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,880
versus

801
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,359
you know how how how how simply can you

802
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,480
can you express the idea and so so level

803
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:13,119
of compression yeah uh what is it

804
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,120
correlates with uh beauty yeah that's

805
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,798
that's one and one aspect of it and so

806
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,719
you can start to tell that an idea is

807
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,879
becoming uglier and uglier

808
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,919
as you start kind of having to

809
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,440
you know it doesn't quite do what you

810
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,799
want so you throw in

811
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,240
something else to the idea and you keep

812
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,240
doing that until

813
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,599
you get what you want but that's how you

814
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,440
know you're doing something uglier and

815
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:34,000
uglier when you have to kind of keep

816
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,000
adding in

817
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,678
more

818
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,359
more into what was originally a fairly

819
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,679
simple idea and making it more and more

820
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:44,319
complicated to get what you want

821
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,080
okay so let's put some uh philosophical

822
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,639
words on the table and try to make some

823
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,720
sense of them one word is beauty another

824
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,278
one is simplicity as you mentioned

825
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,400
another one is truth

826
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,240
so

827
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,200
do you have a sense if i give you two

828
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,400
theories one is

829
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,080
simpler one is more complicated

830
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,759
do you have a sense which one is more

831
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,038
likely to be true

832
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,119
to uh

833
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,119
capture

834
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,119
deeply

835
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,719
the fabric of reality

836
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:18,398
the simple one or the more complicated

837
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,600
one yeah i think all of our evidence

838
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,319
what we see in the history of the

839
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,359
subject is the the simpler one though

840
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:27,439
often it's a surprise it's simpler in a

841
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,798
surprising way but um

842
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,880
yeah that that we just don't we just

843
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,398
anyway when the kind of best theories

844
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,440
have been coming coming up with are

845
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,759
ultimately when properly understood

846
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,679
relatively simple and uh much much

847
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,119
simpler than you would expect them to be

848
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,960
do you have a good explanation why that

849
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,959
is is it just because humans want it to

850
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,360
be that way are we just like ultra

851
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,960
biased then we we we just kind of

852
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,479
convinced ourselves

853
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,159
that simple is better because we find

854
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,000
simplicity beautiful or is there

855
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,200
something about at the our actual

856
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,839
universe

857
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,519
that uh at the core is simple

858
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,079
my own belief is that there is something

859
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,599
about a universe that that's simple and

860
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,119
i was trying to say that you know there

861
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,959
is some some kind of fundamental thing

862
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:10,639
about math physics

863
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,399
and physics and all this picture which

864
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,640
is um

865
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,719
which which is in some sense simple

866
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,919
it's true that you know it

867
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,839
it's of course true that you know our

868
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,240
minds have certain have

869
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,639
are very limited and can certainly do

870
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,480
certain things and not others so it

871
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,320
it's it's in principle possible that

872
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,679
there's some

873
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,119
great insight there are a lot of

874
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,200
insights into the way the world works

875
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,879
which is aren't accessible to us because

876
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,480
that's not the way our minds work we

877
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,760
don't and that what we're seeing this

878
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,120
kind of simplicity is just because

879
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,480
that's

880
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,959
all we ever have any hope of seeing but

881
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,679
so there's a brilliant

882
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,079
physicist by the name of sabine

883
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,640
hasenfelder who both agrees and

884
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,879
disagrees with you i suppose agrees

885
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,399
that uh

886
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,720
the final answer will be simple yeah

887
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:03,359
but uh simplicity and beauty leads us

888
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,278
astray in the lo in the local pockets of

889
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,839
scientific progress

890
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,519
uh do you uh do you agree with her

891
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,119
disagreement do you disagree with her

892
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,599
agreement

893
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,439
i agree with the agreement uh well i i i

894
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:16,959
i i i

895
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,360
yes i thought it was really fascinating

896
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,278
reading your book and and and anyway it

897
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,199
was finding disagreeing with with a lot

898
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:24,558
but then at the end when she says yes

899
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,480
when we find

900
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,398
there when we actually figure this out

901
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,360
it will it will be simple and yeah and

902
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:31,199
okay so

903
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:34,079
we agree in the end

904
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,480
does beauty lead us astray which is the

905
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,960
the core thesis of her work

906
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,120
in that book i actually i guess i do

907
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,880
disagree with her on on that so much i

908
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,319
don't think and especially and i

909
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,919
actually fairly strongly disagree with

910
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:47,759
her about sometimes sometimes the way

911
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,440
she'll refer to math and

912
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,240
so the problem is

913
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,519
you know

914
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,359
physicists and people in general just

915
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,639
refer to as math and and they're often

916
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,398
um

917
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,240
they're they're often meaning not what i

918
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,719
would call math which is the interesting

919
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,120
ideas of math but just

920
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,038
cause some complicated calculation and

921
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:06,639
and so um

922
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,158
i i guess

923
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,120
my feeling about it is more that it's

924
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,320
very

925
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,479
the problem with talking about

926
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,519
simplicity and using simplicity as a

927
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,000
guide

928
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,839
is that it's very um

929
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,240
it's very easy to fool yourself and you

930
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:23,199
know it's very easy to decide

931
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,200
to you know to fall in love with an idea

932
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,720
you have an idea you think oh this is

933
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,360
this is great and you fall in love with

934
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,880
it and it's like any kind of love affair

935
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,798
it's very easy to believe that you know

936
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,640
you're the object of your affections is

937
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,240
much more beautiful than they others

938
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,159
might think and they're that they really

939
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,640
are and that's

940
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,360
very very easy to do so um if you say

941
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,559
i'm just gonna pursue ideas about

942
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,558
beauty and

943
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,798
this and mathematics and this it's

944
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:51,519
extremely easy to to just fool yourself

945
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:53,038
i think um and i think that's a lot of

946
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,960
what

947
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,398
the story is she was thinking of about

948
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,240
where people have gone astray that i

949
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,798
think it's i would argue that as more

950
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,880
people it's not that there was some

951
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:06,000
simple powerful wonderful idea which

952
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,440
they'd found and it turned out not to be

953
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,880
um

954
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,399
not to be useful but it was more that

955
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,240
they kind of fooled themselves that this

956
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:14,000
was actually a better idea than it

957
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,440
really was and it was

958
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,119
simpler more beautiful than it really

959
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,558
was is a lot of the story um i see so

960
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,398
it's not that the simplicity would be

961
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:23,759
lisa's astrays that's just people or

962
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:26,239
people and they

963
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,240
uh fall in love with with whatever idea

964
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,399
they have and then they they weave

965
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,159
narratives around that idea or they

966
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:36,719
present in such a way that uh emphasizes

967
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,240
uh the simplicity and the beauty

968
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,720
yeah that's part of it but i mean the

969
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,798
thing about physics that you have

970
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,159
is that you you know what what really

971
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,000
can tell

972
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,960
if you can do an experiment and check

973
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,278
and see if nature is really doing what

974
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,360
your your idea expects that you you do

975
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:55,359
in principle have a way of really of

976
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:57,038
testing it and and it's certainly true

977
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:58,798
that if you um

978
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,879
you know if you thought you had a simple

979
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,639
idea and that doesn't work and you got

980
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,640
into an experiment and what actually

981
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,640
does work is somewhere maybe some more

982
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,399
complicated version of it that can

983
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,640
certainly happen and

984
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:13,199
that that that can be true

985
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,840
i think her emphasis is more that i

986
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,960
don't really disagree with is that

987
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,079
um

988
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,360
people should be concentrating on

989
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,879
when they're trying to develop better

990
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,038
theories on

991
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,760
morons on self-consistency not so much

992
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,960
on beauty but you know not is this idea

993
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:30,798
beautiful but you know is there

994
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,319
something about the theory which is not

995
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:35,119
quite consistent

996
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,639
and that and use that as a guide

997
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:39,599
that there's something wrong there which

998
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,759
needs fixing and and so i think that

999
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,839
part of her argument i think i was

1000
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,919
we're on the same page about

1001
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,839
uh what's what is consistency in

1002
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,799
inconsistencies

1003
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,798
what what exactly um

1004
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:55,519
do you have examples in mind

1005
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,000
well it can be just simple inconsistency

1006
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,839
between theory and an experiment that if

1007
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,200
you so we have this

1008
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,199
great fundamental theory but there are

1009
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,440
some things we see out there which don't

1010
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,278
seem to fit in it like like dark energy

1011
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,480
and dark matter for instance

1012
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,480
but if there's something which you can't

1013
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,599
test experimentally i think

1014
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,880
you know she would argue and i would

1015
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:14,398
agree that for instance if you're trying

1016
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,679
to think about

1017
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:17,518
gravity and how are you going to have a

1018
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,200
quantum theory of gravity you should

1019
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,359
kind of

1020
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,880
be you know and test any of your ideas

1021
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,798
with kind of

1022
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,240
kind of a thought experiment you know is

1023
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,158
does this actually give a consistent

1024
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,480
picture what's going to happen of what

1025
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,159
happens in this particular situation or

1026
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,759
not

1027
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,080
so this is a good example you've written

1028
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,759
about this um

1029
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:39,038
you know since quantum gravitational

1030
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:40,558
effects are

1031
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:44,158
really small

1032
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:46,558
super small arguably unobservably small

1033
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,440
should we have hope to arrive at a

1034
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,038
theory of quantum gravity somehow

1035
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,480
what are the different ways we can get

1036
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:55,119
there you've mentioned that you're not

1037
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,399
as interested in that effort because

1038
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,518
basically

1039
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,518
yes you cannot

1040
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,880
have uh ways to scientifically validate

1041
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,240
it given the tools of today yeah i've

1042
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,600
actually you know i've over the years

1043
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,320
certainly spent a lot of time learning

1044
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:09,918
about

1045
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,039
gravity and about attempts to quantize

1046
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,878
it but it

1047
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,279
it hasn't been that much

1048
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:17,358
in the past the focus of what i've been

1049
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,879
thinking about but

1050
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:22,480
i mean my feeling was always you know as

1051
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:24,159
i think speed would agree that the uh

1052
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,639
you know one way you can pursue this if

1053
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,039
you if you can't do experiments is

1054
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,440
just this kind of search for consistency

1055
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,119
you know it can be remarkably hard to

1056
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,519
come up with a completely consistent

1057
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,838
model of model of this in a way that

1058
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,358
brings together quantum mechanics and

1059
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:41,838
general relativity

1060
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:43,119
and that's i think kind of been

1061
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:44,878
the traditional way that people who have

1062
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,000
pursued quantum gravity have often

1063
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,000
pursued you know

1064
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,000
we have the best route to finding a

1065
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,000
consistent

1066
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,599
theory of quantum gravity and string

1067
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,920
theorists will tell you this

1068
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,160
other other people will tell you it it's

1069
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,400
it's kind of what people argue about but

1070
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,078
but the problem with all of that is that

1071
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
you end up

1072
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,560
um

1073
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:10,078
the danger is that you end up with that

1074
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,480
that everybody could be successful

1075
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,640
everybody everybody's

1076
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,000
program for how to find a theory of kind

1077
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,400
of gravity you know ends up with

1078
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,358
something that is consistent

1079
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,880
and so

1080
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:22,239
in some sense you could argue this is

1081
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,680
what happened to the strength there is

1082
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,358
they um

1083
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,960
they solved their problem of finding a

1084
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:29,119
consistent theory of quantum gravity and

1085
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,199
they ended but they found 10 of the 500

1086
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,640
solutions so

1087
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,639
you you know

1088
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:37,199
if you believe that everything that they

1089
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,598
would like to be true is true well

1090
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,279
okay you've got a theory but it's

1091
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,039
it ends up being kind of useless because

1092
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,599
it's just one of

1093
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,039
an infant essentially infinite number of

1094
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,640
things which you have no way to

1095
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,440
experimentally distinguish and so this

1096
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:51,598
is a

1097
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,838
just a depressing situation

1098
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,119
um but but i but i do think that there

1099
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:57,119
is a um

1100
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,200
so again i think pursuing ideas about

1101
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,720
what

1102
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,719
more about beauty and how can you

1103
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,639
integrate and unify

1104
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,319
these issues about gravity with other

1105
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:08,078
things we know about physics and can you

1106
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,920
find a theory which were they were these

1107
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,599
fit together in a in a way that makes

1108
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,838
sense and and hopefully predict

1109
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,160
something that's much more promising

1110
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,759
well it makes sense and hopefully i mean

1111
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,440
we'll sneak up

1112
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,880
onto this question a bunch of times

1113
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,358
because you kind of said

1114
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,440
uh a few slightly contradictory things

1115
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:27,039
which is like it's nice to have a theory

1116
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,400
that's consistent

1117
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,159
but then

1118
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,720
if the theory is consistent it doesn't

1119
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,799
necessarily mean anything

1120
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,239
so like it's it's not enough it's not

1121
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,079
enough it's not enough and that's the

1122
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,279
problem so it's like it keeps coming

1123
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,039
back to

1124
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,280
okay there should be some experimental

1125
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:44,639
validation

1126
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,480
so okay

1127
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,159
let's talk a little bit about string

1128
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,719
theory you've been uh

1129
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,319
a bit of an outspoken critic of strength

1130
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,959
theory

1131
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,559
maybe one question first to ask is what

1132
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,079
is string theory

1133
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,639
and uh

1134
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,760
beyond that why is it

1135
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,480
wrong

1136
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,599
or rather the title of your blog says

1137
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,880
not even wrong okay

1138
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,480
well one interesting thing about the

1139
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,400
current state of strength theory is that

1140
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,639
i think it i'd argue it's actually very

1141
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,320
very difficult to at this point to say

1142
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,559
what string theory means if people say

1143
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,960
they're string theorists what they

1144
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,719
mean and what they're doing is uh

1145
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,720
it's kind of hard it's hard to pin down

1146
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:28,159
the meaning of the term but the but the

1147
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:29,759
initial meaning i think goes back to um

1148
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,719
there was kind of a series of

1149
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,280
developments starting in 1984 in which

1150
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,000
people felt that they had found a

1151
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,000
unified theory of

1152
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,440
our so-called standard model of of all

1153
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,519
the standard

1154
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,679
well-known kind of particle interactions

1155
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,280
and gravity and it all fit together in a

1156
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,078
quantum theory and that you could do

1157
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,960
this

1158
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,760
in a very specific way by

1159
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,358
instead of thinking about

1160
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,079
having a quantum theory of particles

1161
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,519
moving around in space time think about

1162
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,200
uh quantum theory of kind of

1163
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,079
one-dimensional loops moving around in

1164
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,319
space-time so-called strings and so

1165
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,680
instead of one degree of freedom

1166
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,280
these have an infinite number of degrees

1167
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,078
of freedom it's a much more complicated

1168
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,760
theory but you can imagine

1169
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,560
okay we're going to quantize this theory

1170
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,119
of loops moving around in space-time

1171
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,960
and what they found is that they

1172
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,559
is that you could make you could do this

1173
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,119
and you could fairly relatively

1174
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:28,320
straightforwardly make sense of

1175
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,519
of such a quantum theory but only if

1176
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,359
space and time together were

1177
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,039
10-dimensional

1178
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,000
and so then you had this problem again

1179
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,639
the problem i referred to at the

1180
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
beginning of okay now once you make that

1181
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:39,440
move you've got to get rid of six

1182
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,519
dimensions

1183
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,039
and so the hope was that

1184
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,039
you could get rid of the six dimensions

1185
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:48,000
by making them very small and that

1186
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:50,639
consistency of the theory would require

1187
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,280
these that these six dimensions um

1188
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,838
satisfy a very specific condition called

1189
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,160
being a claudio manifold and that we

1190
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:00,159
knew very very few examples of this

1191
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,118
so what got a lot of people very excited

1192
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,920
back in

1193
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,760
84 85 was the hope that

1194
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,400
you could just take this some 10

1195
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,400
dimensional string theory and

1196
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,920
find one of a limited number of possible

1197
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,599
ways of

1198
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,119
of getting rid of six dimensions by

1199
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,119
making them small and then you would end

1200
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,640
up with a an effective four-dimensional

1201
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,880
theory which looked like the real world

1202
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,559
this was the hope so then

1203
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,400
there's been a very long story about

1204
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:25,759
what happened to that hope over the

1205
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,000
years i mean

1206
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,079
i i would argue and like part of the

1207
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,358
point of the book and its title was that

1208
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,960
um

1209
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:34,960
you know that this this ultimately was

1210
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,400
it was a failure that you ended up that

1211
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,400
this idea just didn't um

1212
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,759
there ended up being just too many ways

1213
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:43,838
of doing this and you didn't know how to

1214
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,359
do this consistently

1215
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:46,880
that it was kind of

1216
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:48,639
not even wrong in the sense that you

1217
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,320
couldn't even you never could pin it

1218
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:53,920
down well enough to actually get a real

1219
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,519
falsifiable prediction out of it that

1220
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,559
would tell you it was wrong but it was

1221
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,800
um

1222
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,320
it was kind of in the in the realm of

1223
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,920
ideas which initially looked good but

1224
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,359
the more you look at them

1225
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,880
they just um

1226
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:06,719
they don't work out the way the way you

1227
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,559
want and they don't actually end up

1228
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,279
carrying the power or the that you

1229
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:13,440
originally had this vision of

1230
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,680
and yes the the book title is not even

1231
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,679
wrong your blog your excellent blog

1232
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,838
title is not even wrong

1233
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,598
okay but there is nevertheless been a

1234
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,559
lot of excitement about string theory

1235
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,960
through the decades as you mentioned uh

1236
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:28,559
what are the different flavors of ideas

1237
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,280
that came

1238
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,838
uh

1239
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,680
like they branched out you mentioned 10

1240
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,400
dimensions you mentioned

1241
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:38,639
loops with infinite degrees of freedom

1242
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,800
what what other interesting ideas to you

1243
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,239
that kind of emerge from this world

1244
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,920
well yeah i mean the problem in talking

1245
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,598
about the whole subject and well partly

1246
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,159
one reason i wrote the book

1247
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,119
is that you know it it gets very very

1248
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,598
complicated i mean there's a huge amount

1249
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,800
you know you a lot of people got very

1250
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,119
interested in this a lot of people

1251
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,200
worked on it and and in some sense i

1252
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,200
think what happened is exactly because

1253
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:04,159
the idea didn't really work

1254
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,598
that this caused people to

1255
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:08,078
you know instead of focusing on this one

1256
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,359
idea and digging in and working on that

1257
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,000
they just kind of

1258
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,920
kept trying new things and so

1259
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
people i think ended up wandering around

1260
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,318
in a very very rich space of ideas about

1261
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,519
mathematics and physics and discovering

1262
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:21,599
you know all sorts of really interesting

1263
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,280
things it's just the problem is there

1264
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,280
tended to be an inverse relationship

1265
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,040
between how interesting and beautiful

1266
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,800
and fruitful this new

1267
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,480
idea that they were trying to pursue was

1268
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,680
and how much it looked like the real

1269
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,719
world

1270
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:34,399
so there's a lot of beautiful

1271
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,078
mathematics came out of it

1272
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,599
i think one of the most spectacular is

1273
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,880
what the

1274
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,280
physicists call two-dimensional

1275
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,800
conformal field theory and so these are

1276
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,519
basically

1277
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,200
[Music]

1278
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:46,800
quantum field theories and kind of think

1279
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,559
of it as one space and one time

1280
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,560
dimension which

1281
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:53,519
you know have just this huge amount of

1282
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,880
symmetry and a huge amount of structure

1283
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,159
which

1284
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,400
and just some totally fantastic

1285
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,318
mathematics behind it and um and again

1286
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,838
and and some of that mathematics

1287
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,920
is exactly also what appears in the

1288
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:07,279
language program so a lot of the um

1289
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,880
first interaction between math and

1290
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,240
physics around the language program has

1291
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,480
been around these two-dimensional

1292
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:15,039
conformal field theories

1293
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,280
is there um something you could say

1294
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,800
about what the major problems are with

1295
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,680
strength theory

1296
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,839
so

1297
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,039
like um

1298
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:25,679
besides

1299
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:29,519
that there's no experimental validation

1300
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:31,519
you've written that a big hole

1301
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:34,318
in string theory has been its

1302
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,920
perturbative definition yeah

1303
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,920
perhaps that's one can you explain what

1304
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,440
that means well maybe to begin with i

1305
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,079
mean i think i mean the simplest thing

1306
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,159
to say is

1307
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,039
you know the the initial idea really was

1308
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,879
that

1309
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:48,719
okay we're we have this

1310
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,559
instead of what's great is we have this

1311
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:53,118
thing that only works

1312
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,799
that's very structured and has to

1313
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,760
work in a certain way for it to make

1314
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,519
sense

1315
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,680
and um

1316
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,559
but but then you ended up you ended up

1317
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,159
in ten space time dimensions and so to

1318
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:05,599
get back to physics you had to get rid

1319
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,719
of five of the dimension six of

1320
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,519
dimensions

1321
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,719
and

1322
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,159
the bottom line i would say in some

1323
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,639
sense it's very simple that what people

1324
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:14,559
just discovered is just

1325
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:15,838
there there's kind of no particularly

1326
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,519
nice way of doing this there's an

1327
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:18,960
infinite number of ways of doing it and

1328
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:21,679
you can get whatever you want depending

1329
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,280
on how you do it so the you you end up

1330
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,358
the whole program of starting at ten

1331
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,079
dimensions and getting to four

1332
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,598
just kind of collapses out of a lack of

1333
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,359
any way to kind of get to where you want

1334
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,000
because you can get anything

1335
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:36,159
the hope around that problem has always

1336
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,159
been that

1337
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,559
the standard formulation that we have of

1338
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,399
string theory which is

1339
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,960
you can go in by the name perturbative

1340
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,559
but it's kind of um

1341
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,599
there's a standard way we know of given

1342
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,920
a classical theory of constructing

1343
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:55,280
a quantum theory and

1344
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,880
and working with it which is

1345
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,119
that's the so-called perturbation theory

1346
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,880
that um that we know how to do

1347
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,440
and that

1348
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,119
that by itself just just doesn't doesn't

1349
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,559
give you any hint as to what to do about

1350
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,559
the six dimensions

1351
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,078
so actual perturbed string theory by

1352
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:11,279
itself really only works in 10

1353
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,000
dimensions

1354
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,599
so

1355
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,318
you have to start making some kinds of

1356
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,960
assumptions about how i'm going to

1357
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,400
go beyond

1358
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,000
this formulation that we really

1359
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,318
understand of string theory and get rid

1360
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,239
of these six six dimensions so kind of

1361
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:27,920
the simplest one was the um

1362
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,199
the claudio

1363
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,400
postulate

1364
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,919
but um

1365
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,440
when that didn't really work out people

1366
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,280
have tried more and more different

1367
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,039
things and and the hope has always been

1368
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,319
that

1369
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:39,759
the solution

1370
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,480
this problem would be that you would

1371
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,480
find a a deeper and better understanding

1372
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,119
of what string theory is that would

1373
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,679
actually go beyond this perturbative

1374
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,400
expansion and which would um which would

1375
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,799
generalize this and and that once you

1376
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,358
had that it would um

1377
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,640
it would solve this problem of

1378
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:00,639
it would pick out what to do with the

1379
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:03,279
six dimensions how difficult is this

1380
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:03,279
problem so

1381
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:08,639
if i could restate the problem it seems

1382
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:10,639
like there's a very consistent

1383
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,279
physical world operating in four

1384
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:15,838
dimensions

1385
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,760
and uh how do you map a consistent

1386
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,759
physical world in 10 dimensions to a

1387
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,240
consistent physical world in four

1388
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,160
dimensions right and how how difficult

1389
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:25,598
is this problem is is that something you

1390
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:27,598
can even answer

1391
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,720
um

1392
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,640
just

1393
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,679
in terms of physics intuition in terms

1394
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,199
of mathematics mapping from

1395
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:36,559
ten dimensions to four dimensions well

1396
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:39,279
basically i mean you have to get rid of

1397
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:41,358
the of six of the dimensions so there's

1398
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,920
i mean there's kind of two ways of doing

1399
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,279
it one is what we call compactification

1400
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,358
you say that

1401
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,200
there really are 10 dimensions but for

1402
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,759
whatever reason six of them are really

1403
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:53,358
are so so small we can't see them

1404
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,520
so you basically start out with ten

1405
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,759
dimensions and what we call you know

1406
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:59,599
make make six of them

1407
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,760
not go out to infinity but just kind of

1408
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,680
a finite extent and then make that size

1409
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,760
go down

1410
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,159
so small it's unobservable but that's

1411
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,200
like that's a math trick

1412
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:11,358
so

1413
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,318
can you also help me build an intuition

1414
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:13,759
about

1415
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:16,000
how rich

1416
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,680
and interesting the world in those six

1417
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,599
dimensions is

1418
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,879
because so compactification seems to

1419
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,280
imply

1420
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,720
well that's very interesting well no but

1421
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,040
the problem is that what you learn if

1422
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,759
you start doing math mathematics looking

1423
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,440
at geometry and topology and in more and

1424
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,119
more dimensions is that

1425
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,639
i mean

1426
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,480
asking the question like what are all

1427
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:38,078
possible six dimensional spaces it's

1428
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,000
just a it's kind of an unanswerable

1429
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,680
question it's just uh i mean it's even

1430
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,199
kind of technically undecidable in some

1431
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:44,719
way they're just they're just too too

1432
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,078
they're too many things you can do with

1433
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,838
all these

1434
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,440
if you start trying to make if you start

1435
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,199
trying to make one-dimensional spaces

1436
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,838
it's like well you got a line you can

1437
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,679
make a circle you can make graphs you

1438
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,078
can kind of see what you can do but as

1439
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,559
you go to higher and higher dimensions

1440
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:04,079
there's just so many ways you can

1441
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:06,318
put things together of and get something

1442
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,680
of that dimensionality and

1443
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:09,279
so it it

1444
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:10,719
unless you have some very very strong

1445
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,480
principle which is going to pick out

1446
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:15,279
some very specific

1447
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,079
ones of these six dimensional spaces

1448
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,440
and

1449
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,920
they're just too many of them and you

1450
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,480
can get anything you want but um so if

1451
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,559
you have 10 dimensions

1452
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,480
the kind of things that happen

1453
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,920
say that's actually the way

1454
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,000
that's actually the fabric of our

1455
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,039
realities 10 dimensions there's a

1456
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,239
limited set of behaviors of objects i

1457
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,119
don't even know what the right

1458
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:39,439
terminology to use that can

1459
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,358
occur when within those dimensions like

1460
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,200
in reality yeah

1461
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,799
and so like

1462
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:47,199
what i'm getting at is like is there

1463
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,440
some consistent constraints

1464
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,960
so if you have some constraints that map

1465
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,358
to reality

1466
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,159
then you can start saying like

1467
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,759
dimension number seven is kind of boring

1468
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,318
all the excitement happens in the

1469
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,640
spatial dimensions one two three yeah

1470
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:04,000
and time is also kind of boring

1471
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:05,598
yeah and like

1472
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
some are more exciting than others or we

1473
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,599
can use our metric of beauty

1474
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,440
some dimensions are more beautiful than

1475
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,240
others once you have an actual

1476
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,838
understanding of what actually happens

1477
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:17,759
in those dimensions in our physical

1478
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,519
world as opposed to sort of all the

1479
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,440
possible things that could happen in

1480
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:22,639
some sense i mean just the basic factors

1481
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,639
you need to get rid of them we don't see

1482
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:26,078
them so you need to somehow explain them

1483
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:27,519
what you have to the main thing you're

1484
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,720
trying to do is to explain why we're not

1485
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:31,599
seeing them

1486
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:33,838
and so you can you have to come up with

1487
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,640
some theory of these extra dimensions

1488
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:38,239
and how they're going to behave and

1489
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:40,159
string theory gives you some ideas about

1490
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:41,519
how to do that but

1491
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:43,118
but

1492
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,880
the bottom line is where you're trying

1493
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,400
to go with this whole theory you're

1494
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,160
creating is

1495
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,480
to just make all of its effects

1496
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:52,480
essentially unobservable so it's a it's

1497
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,639
not a really

1498
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,559
it

1499
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:58,000
it's an inherently kind of dubious and

1500
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,440
worrisome thing that you're trying to do

1501
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,880
there why are you just

1502
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,318
adding in all the stuff and then trying

1503
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,760
to explain why we don't see it i mean

1504
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:06,159
it's just good this may be a dumb

1505
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,599
question but it's is this an obvious

1506
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:08,719
thing to state

1507
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,599
that

1508
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:14,838
those six dimensions are unobservable or

1509
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:17,200
anything beyond four dimensions is

1510
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:19,599
unobservable or

1511
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:20,879
do you leave a little door open to

1512
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,039
saying

1513
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,280
the current tools of physics

1514
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:26,639
and obviously our brains aren't unable

1515
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,040
to observe them

1516
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,879
yeah but we may need to come up with

1517
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,639
methodologies for observing so as

1518
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,960
opposed to collapsing your mathematical

1519
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,039
theory into four dimensions

1520
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,880
leaving the door open a little bit too

1521
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:41,199
maybe we need to come up with tools that

1522
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,559
actually allow us to directly measure

1523
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,000
those dimensions

1524
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,480
yes i mean but you mean you can

1525
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,159
certainly ask you know assume

1526
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,920
that that we've got

1527
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:51,519
model look look at models with more

1528
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,599
dimensions and ask you know what would

1529
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:54,800
the observable effects how would we

1530
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,119
know this and you go out and do

1531
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,559
experiments so for instance

1532
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,358
you have a

1533
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,040
like

1534
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:02,880
gravitationally you have an inverse

1535
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,800
square law of forces okay if you had

1536
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,480
more dimensions that inverse square law

1537
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,160
would change something else

1538
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,599
so you can go and start

1539
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:11,920
measuring the inverse square law and say

1540
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,960
okay an inverse square law is working

1541
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,400
but maybe if i get get and it turns out

1542
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,400
to be actually kind of very very hard

1543
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,519
measuring gravitational effects and even

1544
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,760
kind of

1545
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,159
you know somewhat macroscopic distances

1546
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,760
because they're so small so you can you

1547
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,838
can start looking at the inverse square

1548
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,880
law and say start trying to measure it

1549
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:33,440
at shorter and shorter distances and see

1550
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,960
if there were extra dimensions at those

1551
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,599
distance scales you would start to see

1552
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,599
the inverse square law fail and um so

1553
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,280
people look for that and again you don't

1554
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,559
see it but

1555
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,319
you can i mean there's all sorts of

1556
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,480
experiments of this kind you can you can

1557
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:48,480
imagine which test

1558
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,519
for effects of extra dimensions at

1559
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,440
different at

1560
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:53,599
different distance scales but

1561
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:57,119
you know none of them

1562
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,880
i mean they they all just don't work

1563
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,280
nothing yet i think yeah but you could

1564
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,960
say ah but it it's if it's just it's

1565
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:07,599
just much much smaller you can say that

1566
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,838
which by the way makes ligo and

1567
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:13,119
the detection of gravitational waves

1568
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:14,480
quite an incredible project

1569
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,160
ed whitten

1570
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,400
is often brought up as one of the most

1571
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:20,639
brilliant mathematicians and physicists

1572
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,639
ever

1573
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,239
what do you make of him and his work on

1574
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,680
string theory

1575
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,000
well i think you know he's a truly

1576
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:29,679
remarkable figure i've

1577
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,760
you know had the pleasure of meeting him

1578
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:32,799
first when he was a postdoc and um i

1579
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,000
mean he's a

1580
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,839
just completely

1581
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,318
amazing um mathematician and physicist

1582
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,239
and uh you know he's

1583
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:43,599
quite a bit smarter than just about

1584
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:45,519
about any of the rest of us and also

1585
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,039
more hard working and it's a it's a kind

1586
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,079
of frightening combination to see how

1587
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:49,358
much he's

1588
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,440
been able to do

1589
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:53,519
and um but i would actually argue that

1590
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,599
you know his his greatest work the

1591
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:57,519
things that he's done that have been of

1592
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,200
just this mind-blowing significance of

1593
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,920
giving us i mean he's completely

1594
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,598
revolutionized some areas of mathematics

1595
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,960
he's totally revolutionized the way we

1596
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,039
understand the relations between

1597
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,519
mathematics and physics

1598
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,599
and most of those

1599
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,759
his greatest work is is stuff that

1600
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,079
doesn't have has little or nothing to do

1601
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,200
with string theory i mean for instance

1602
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,480
he um

1603
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:20,239
you know he so he was actually one of

1604
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,159
fields the very strange thing about him

1605
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:24,318
in some sense is that he um

1606
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:25,679
he doesn't have a nobel prize so there

1607
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:26,558
there's a very large number of people

1608
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,719
who are

1609
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:30,079
nowhere near as smart as he is when

1610
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:32,318
don't work anywhere near as hard who

1611
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,760
have nobel prizes i think he just had

1612
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,838
the misfortune of

1613
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,599
coming into the field at a time when

1614
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,000
things had gotten much much much tougher

1615
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,920
and nobody really had

1616
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,159
no matter how smart you were it was very

1617
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,079
hard to come up with a new idea that was

1618
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,519
going to work physically and get you a

1619
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,000
nobel prize

1620
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,920
but he but he um you know he he got a

1621
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,760
fields medal for

1622
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,760
a certain work he did in um in

1623
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,200
mathematics and that's just completely

1624
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,200
unheard of you know for mathematicians

1625
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:02,558
to give a field medal to someone outside

1626
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:04,799
their field and physics is really um

1627
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,240
you know you wouldn't have before it he

1628
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,839
came around i don't think anybody would

1629
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:09,679
have thought that was even conceivable

1630
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:11,519
these things um

1631
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,558
he came into the field of theoretical

1632
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,639
physics at a time when um

1633
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,319
and still to today

1634
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:20,639
is you can't get a nobel prize for

1635
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:22,480
purely theoretical work a specific

1636
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:24,719
problem of trying to do better than the

1637
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,960
standard the standard model is just

1638
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:29,519
this insanely successful thing and it

1639
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,480
kind of came together in 1973 pretty

1640
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:32,800
much

1641
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,880
and post and so and and all of the

1642
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,640
people who kind of were involved in that

1643
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,960
coming together you know many of them

1644
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:41,199
ended up with nobel prizes for that but

1645
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,000
but if you look

1646
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:46,399
post 1973 pretty much it it's a little

1647
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,159
bit more there's some

1648
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,680
edge cases if you like but the if you

1649
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:53,759
look post 1973 at what people have done

1650
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:56,078
to try to do better than the standard

1651
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,000
model and to get a better unified theory

1652
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,359
it really hasn't it's been too hard a

1653
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,599
problem it hasn't worked the theory is

1654
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:02,639
too good and so it's not that other

1655
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,519
people

1656
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:07,199
went out there and did and did it and uh

1657
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:08,880
not him and that they got nobel prizes

1658
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:10,318
for doing it is that no one really the

1659
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,559
kind of thing he's been trying to do

1660
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:15,358
with string theory is not um no one has

1661
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,640
been able to do since 1973.

1662
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:18,159
is there something you can say about the

1663
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:21,039
standard model so the four laws of

1664
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:22,480
physics that seems to work very well and

1665
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:24,880
uh

1666
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,440
yet people are striving to do more

1667
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,519
talking about unification so on why

1668
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,800
what's wrong what's broken about the

1669
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:32,960
standard model

1670
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,880
why why does it need to be improved i

1671
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,159
mean the thing which gets most attention

1672
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,039
is um

1673
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:40,719
is gravity that we have trouble um

1674
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:43,119
so you want to you want to in some sense

1675
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:43,118
integrate

1676
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,279
integrate what we know about the

1677
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,798
gravitational force with it and have a

1678
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,400
unified quantum field theory that has

1679
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:51,838
gravitational interactions also so

1680
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,440
that's the big problem everybody talks

1681
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:54,239
about um

1682
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,760
i mean

1683
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,598
but but it's also true that if you look

1684
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,160
at the standard model it has these very

1685
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,838
very deep beautiful ideas but

1686
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:04,078
there's certain aspects of it that are

1687
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:04,078
very

1688
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,680
let's just say that they're not

1689
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,440
beautiful they're not um

1690
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:12,558
you have to to make the thing work you

1691
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,159
have to throw in

1692
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,519
lots and lots of extra parameters at

1693
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,598
various points

1694
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:19,119
um and a lot of this has to do with the

1695
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,559
so-called uh

1696
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,960
you know the so-called higgs mechanism

1697
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,880
in the higgs field that if you look at

1698
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,559
the theory it's

1699
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,720
everything is if you forget about the

1700
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:31,760
higgs field and what it needs to do

1701
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:33,598
the rest of the theory is

1702
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,760
is very very constrained and has very

1703
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,200
very few free parameters really a very

1704
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,880
small number there's a very small number

1705
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,719
of parameters and a few integers which

1706
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,160
tell you what the theory is

1707
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:44,159
to make this work as a theory of the

1708
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:45,279
real world you need a higgs field and

1709
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:46,719
you need to

1710
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,119
it needs to do

1711
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:50,879
to do something and

1712
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,798
once you introduce that higgs field all

1713
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,760
sorts of parameters

1714
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:58,559
um make an appearance so now we've got

1715
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,680
20 or 30 or whatever whatever parameters

1716
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,200
that are going to tell you what all the

1717
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:04,000
masses of things are and what's going to

1718
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,519
happen so you've gone from

1719
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,079
a very tightly constrained thing with a

1720
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:10,639
couple parameters to uh

1721
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,960
this this thing which the minute you put

1722
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:14,239
it in you had to add all this extra

1723
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,760
all these extra parameters to make

1724
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:19,118
things work and so that

1725
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,599
it may be one argument as well that's

1726
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,119
just the way the world is and

1727
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,480
the fact that you don't find that

1728
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,838
aesthetically pleasing is just your

1729
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,440
problem or

1730
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:28,838
maybe we live in a multiverse and those

1731
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,920
numbers are just different in every

1732
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:34,159
universe but but you know another

1733
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,519
reasonable conjecture is just that well

1734
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:38,078
this is just telling us that there's

1735
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:40,239
something we don't understand about

1736
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,079
what's going on in a deeper way which

1737
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:43,279
would explain those numbers and there's

1738
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,200
some kind of

1739
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,119
deeper idea about where the higgs field

1740
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,118
comes from and what's going on

1741
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:51,119
which we haven't figured out yet and

1742
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,440
that's

1743
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,798
that's what we should look for but to

1744
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,760
stick on string theory a little bit

1745
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:58,480
longer

1746
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,440
could you play devil's advocate

1747
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,760
and

1748
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,000
try to argue for string theory

1749
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,880
why it is something that

1750
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,400
deserved the effort that it got

1751
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,640
and still con

1752
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,200
like if you think of it as a flame still

1753
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:16,078
should be a little flame it keeps keeps

1754
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:18,078
burning well i i think the i mean

1755
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,359
the most positive argument for it is is

1756
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,119
all the um

1757
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:23,279
you know all sorts of new ideas about

1758
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,358
mathematics and about parts of physics

1759
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,559
really emerged from it so it was very a

1760
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:27,838
fruitful

1761
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,119
source of

1762
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:30,480
ideas and i think you know this is

1763
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,920
actually one argument you'll definitely

1764
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,519
which i kind of agree with i'll hear

1765
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,838
from from whitten and from other

1766
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:37,519
strength here i said you know this is uh

1767
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:40,400
this is just such a fruitful and

1768
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:41,759
inspiring idea and it's led to so many

1769
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,519
other different things coming out of it

1770
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,040
that you know there must be something

1771
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:47,519
right about this

1772
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:48,880
and um yeah that's you know okay that

1773
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,960
anyway i think that that's probably the

1774
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,280
strong the strongest thing that they

1775
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,798
that that they've got um but you you

1776
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,359
don't think there's

1777
00:57:54,798 --> 00:58:00,480
aspects to it that could be uh

1778
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:02,558
neighboring to to just to a theory that

1779
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,719
does unify everything to a theory of

1780
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:07,599
everything like it could it may not be

1781
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:10,480
exactly um

1782
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:12,640
uh exactly the theory but uh sticking on

1783
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,159
it longer might get us closer to the

1784
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:15,679
theory of everything

1785
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,598
well the problem now really is that you

1786
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,679
really don't know what it is now you've

1787
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,480
never nobody has ever kind of come up

1788
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:24,480
with this non-perturbative

1789
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,719
theory so there

1790
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,798
it's become more and more

1791
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:30,959
frustrating and an odd activity to try

1792
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:33,920
to argue with the string theorists about

1793
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,519
string theory because it's become

1794
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,119
less and less well-defined what what

1795
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:39,199
what it is

1796
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,798
and it's become actually more and more

1797
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,558
kind of uh whether

1798
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:44,639
you have this weird phenomenon of people

1799
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,640
calling themselves string theorists

1800
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:48,239
when they've never actually worked on

1801
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:49,440
any theory were there any strings

1802
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:51,519
anywhere

1803
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,679
so what has actually happened kind of

1804
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,960
sociologically is that

1805
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:57,519
you started out with this fairly

1806
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,039
well-defined proposal and then

1807
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:00,000
i would argue because that didn't work

1808
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,599
people and

1809
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,119
branched out in all sorts of directions

1810
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,440
doing all sorts of things it became

1811
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,160
farther and farther removed from that

1812
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,280
and for sociological reasons the ones

1813
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,519
who kind of

1814
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:14,079
started out

1815
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:16,400
or now or or were trained by the people

1816
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:19,039
who worked on that have now

1817
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,240
become this string string theorist and

1818
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:21,039
um

1819
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:22,959
and

1820
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:25,039
but but but it's become

1821
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,559
almost more kind of a tribal denominator

1822
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:28,159
than a um

1823
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,440
i think so it's very hard to know what

1824
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:30,879
you're arguing about when you're arguing

1825
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,240
about string theory these days well to

1826
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,480
push back on that a little bit i mean

1827
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:35,358
string theory it's just a term right it

1828
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,599
doesn't

1829
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:39,598
like you could uh like this is the way

1830
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,280
language evolves

1831
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,880
is it could start to represent something

1832
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,760
more than just the theory that involves

1833
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,039
strings it could represent the uh the

1834
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,160
effort

1835
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:52,880
to unify the laws of physics right yeah

1836
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:55,039
and uh at high dimensions with these

1837
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,920
super tiny objects right or something

1838
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,639
like that

1839
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,159
i mean we can sort of uh put string

1840
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:01,598
theory aside so for example neural

1841
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:02,639
networks in the space of machine

1842
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,760
learning

1843
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:05,358
there was a

1844
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,280
time when they were extremely popular

1845
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:08,480
they became much much less popular to a

1846
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,400
point where if you mentioned you'll

1847
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,480
never gain no funding

1848
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,639
and uh you're not going to be respected

1849
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,280
at conferences and then once again

1850
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:21,039
uh you know networks became all the all

1851
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,960
the rage about 10 15 years ago and as it

1852
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:25,679
goes up and down and a lot of people

1853
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,358
would argue that uh using terminology

1854
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:29,039
like machine learning and deep learning

1855
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:29,838
is um

1856
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,119
is

1857
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:34,719
you know often misused over general

1858
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,798
you know everything that works is deep

1859
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:38,318
learning everything that doesn't isn't

1860
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:40,000
yeah something like that you know that's

1861
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:42,798
just the way uh

1862
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,119
again we're back to sociological things

1863
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:47,679
but i guess what i'm trying to get at is

1864
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,920
if if we leave the sociological mess

1865
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:52,399
aside

1866
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,400
uh do we throw out the baby with the

1867
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,960
bath water is there some

1868
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:59,119
besides the side effects of nice ideas

1869
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,760
from the edwins of the world

1870
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:04,160
is there some core truths there

1871
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,720
that we should stick by

1872
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:08,558
in in in the full

1873
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:10,480
beautiful mess of a space that we call

1874
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,280
string theory that people call string

1875
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,760
theory

1876
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,319
you're right it is kind of a common

1877
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,240
problem that you know how what your what

1878
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:20,639
you call some field

1879
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:22,558
changes and evolves in

1880
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:23,920
interesting ways as the field changes

1881
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,839
but

1882
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,960
i mean

1883
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:28,798
i guess

1884
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,318
what i would argue is the you know the

1885
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:31,920
initial understanding of string theory

1886
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:33,759
that was quite specific we're talking

1887
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,680
about a specific idea 10-dimensional

1888
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,839
super strings compactified in six

1889
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:39,679
dimensions

1890
01:01:37,838 --> 01:01:41,199
to my mind the

1891
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:42,960
the really bad thing that's happened to

1892
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:45,759
the subject is that

1893
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,920
you it's hard to get people to admit at

1894
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,680
least publicly that that was a failure

1895
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,720
that this really didn't work

1896
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:52,399
and so

1897
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:53,679
the fact facto what people do is people

1898
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,000
stop doing that and they start doing

1899
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:59,440
more interesting things but they keep

1900
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,679
telling talking to the public about

1901
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,599
about string theory and

1902
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:05,279
referring back to that idea and using

1903
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,200
that as kind of the starting point and

1904
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,280
this kind of the

1905
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,318
the place where the

1906
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,680
the whole

1907
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:13,679
where the whole tribe starts and

1908
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:16,719
everything else comes from and so the

1909
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,639
problem with this is that having as your

1910
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:20,480
as your initial name and what what

1911
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,239
everything points back to

1912
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,760
something which

1913
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:26,318
um

1914
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,400
which really didn't work out it kind of

1915
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:30,159
makes everybody makes everything you've

1916
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,280
created this potentially very very

1917
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:32,879
interesting field with interesting

1918
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,680
things happening but

1919
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,400
you know

1920
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:35,679
people

1921
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,280
in

1922
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:38,960
graduate school take courses on string

1923
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,400
theory and everything kind of and this

1924
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,760
is what you tell the public in which you

1925
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,358
continually pointing back so you're

1926
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,400
continually pointing back to this idea

1927
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:47,679
which never worked out as you're

1928
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,760
guiding

1929
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:52,318
inspiration and it really kind of

1930
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,799
deforms the whole your whole way of um

1931
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:56,719
your your hopes of making progress and

1932
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:58,719
that's to me i think you know the kind

1933
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:00,239
of worst thing that has happened in this

1934
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:02,399
field okay so there's a lack of

1935
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:04,399
transparency and sort of authenticity

1936
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,440
about communicating the things that

1937
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,838
failed

1938
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,760
uh in the past and so you don't have a

1939
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:12,000
clear picture of

1940
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,920
like firm ground that you're standing on

1941
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,960
again those are sociological things and

1942
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,119
yeah

1943
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,318
i i

1944
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,400
there's a bunch of questions i want to

1945
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:23,679
ask you so one

1946
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,480
what's your intuition about

1947
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:27,279
um

1948
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,639
why the original idea failed so what can

1949
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,319
you say about

1950
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:34,558
why you're pretty sure has it has failed

1951
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:36,000
you know and the initial idea was as i

1952
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,160
tried to explain it it was quite

1953
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,318
seductive in that that you you could see

1954
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:42,159
why whitton and others got excited by it

1955
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:43,358
it was um

1956
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:44,558
you know

1957
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:46,960
at the time it looked like there were

1958
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,960
only a few these possible claudios that

1959
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,318
would work and it looked like okay we

1960
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,679
just have to understand this very

1961
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:53,519
specific

1962
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,598
model in these very specific six-special

1963
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:57,759
spaces and we're going to get everything

1964
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,880
and so it was a very subjective idea but

1965
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,440
it just

1966
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,280
you know as people

1967
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,679
learn worked more and more about it it

1968
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,960
just didn't um

1969
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:08,159
they just kind of realized that they're

1970
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,079
just more and more things you can do

1971
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:12,719
with these six dimensions and you can't

1972
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:15,280
and this this is just not going to work

1973
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:16,719
meaning like it's

1974
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,839
i mean

1975
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:22,798
what was the failure um

1976
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:24,159
mode here is is you could just have an

1977
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:25,838
infinite number of possibilities that

1978
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:27,519
you could do so it's you can come up

1979
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:29,519
with any theory you want you can fit

1980
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:31,119
quantum mechanics you can

1981
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,038
you can explain gravity you can explain

1982
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,720
anything you want with it right is that

1983
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:37,039
the basic failure mode yeah so it's a

1984
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:38,318
failure mode of kind of that this idea

1985
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,760
ended up

1986
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:41,519
being kind of being essentially empty

1987
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,119
that it it just didn't

1988
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,038
doesn't ends up not telling you anything

1989
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:47,200
because it's consistent with

1990
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:49,280
just about just about anything

1991
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:50,399
and so i mean there's a complex if you

1992
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,920
try and

1993
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,280
talk with strengtheners about this now i

1994
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,880
mean there's a there's an argument

1995
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,079
there's a long argument over this about

1996
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,039
whether um

1997
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:58,880
you know

1998
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,400
oh no no no maybe there still are

1999
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,880
constraints coming coming out of this

2000
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,480
idea or not and or maybe we live in a

2001
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,358
multiverse and

2002
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,039
you know everything is true anyway so

2003
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:10,960
you can there are various ways you can

2004
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,799
kind of the strength here as i kind of

2005
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,400
react react to this kind of argument

2006
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:16,239
that i'm making but

2007
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,960
try to hold on to it

2008
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:20,399
um what about experimental validation is

2009
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,720
that uh

2010
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,440
is that a fair

2011
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,798
standard to hold before

2012
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,039
a theory of everything that's trying to

2013
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:32,400
unify quantum mechanics and gravity yeah

2014
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:35,119
i mean ultimately to be really convinced

2015
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,720
that you know that on some new you know

2016
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,960
idea but unification really works you

2017
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:40,480
need some kind of uh you need to look at

2018
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,119
the real world and see that this is

2019
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,880
telling you something

2020
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:47,519
something true about it i mean you know

2021
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,519
either either

2022
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,798
telling you that if you do some

2023
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:53,038
experiment and go out and do it you'll

2024
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:55,358
get some unexpected result and

2025
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,559
that's the kind of gold standard or it

2026
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:58,318
may be

2027
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,160
just that like all those numbers that

2028
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:02,159
are we don't know how to explain it it

2029
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:04,078
will show you how to calculate them i

2030
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:06,399
mean you can it can be various kinds of

2031
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,680
experimental validation but that that's

2032
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,480
certainly ideally what you're looking

2033
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:10,078
for

2034
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,679
how tough is this do you think for a

2035
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,760
theory of everything not just string

2036
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:15,279
theory so for something that unifies

2037
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,359
gravity in quantum mechanics so the the

2038
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,960
very big and the very small

2039
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:22,960
is this uh

2040
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:25,760
let me ask it one way is is it a

2041
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,079
physics problem a math problem or an

2042
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,920
engineering problem

2043
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,680
my guess is it's a combination of a

2044
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,680
physics and a math problem that you

2045
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:35,279
really need

2046
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:37,598
it's it's not really interesting it's

2047
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,280
not like there's some kind of

2048
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,039
well-defined thing you can write down

2049
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,519
and we just don't have enough computer

2050
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:46,079
power to do the calculation that's not

2051
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:47,838
the kind of problem it is at all

2052
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,920
but the question is you know what

2053
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:52,239
mathematical tools you need to properly

2054
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:55,119
formulate the problem

2055
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:57,519
is unclear so one reasonable conjecture

2056
01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:00,160
is the way the reason that we haven't

2057
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,440
had any success yet is just that um

2058
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:03,279
we're missing

2059
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,039
either we're missing certain

2060
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,880
physical ideas or we're missing certain

2061
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:10,160
mathematical tools which

2062
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,680
or some combination of them which would

2063
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:13,598
which we need to kind of properly

2064
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:14,719
formulate the problem and see and and

2065
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:16,079
see that it

2066
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:18,879
it has a solution that looks like the

2067
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,079
real world but those you need uh i guess

2068
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,280
you don't but

2069
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,480
there's a sense that uh you need both

2070
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,720
gravity

2071
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,639
like all the laws of physics to be

2072
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:30,558
operating on the same level so this

2073
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:34,239
isn't it feels like you need an object

2074
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,240
like a black hole or something like that

2075
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:39,679
in order to make predictions about

2076
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,760
otherwise you're always making

2077
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:43,838
predictions about this joint

2078
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,599
phenomena

2079
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:47,358
or or can you do that as long as the

2080
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,720
theory is consistent and doesn't have

2081
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:50,719
special cases for each of the functions

2082
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:52,159
well your theory should i mean if your

2083
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:53,598
theory is going to include gravity our

2084
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:56,159
current understanding of gravity is that

2085
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:57,680
you should have um

2086
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:58,879
there should be black hole states in it

2087
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:01,358
you should be able to describe black

2088
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:04,160
holes in this theory and um and just one

2089
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:05,519
aspect that people concentrate a lot on

2090
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:07,519
is just this

2091
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:09,280
kind of questions about if your

2092
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:11,119
theory includes black holes like it's

2093
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,480
supposed to and it includes quantum

2094
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,480
mechanics then there's certain kind of

2095
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:16,000
paradoxes which come up and so that's

2096
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,238
that's been a huge focus of kind of

2097
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,158
quantum gravity work work has been just

2098
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:23,119
those paradoxes

2099
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:26,559
so stepping outside of string theory uh

2100
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:28,559
can you just say first at a high level

2101
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,319
what is the theory of everything what

2102
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,920
does the theory of everything seek to

2103
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,920
accomplish

2104
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,158
well i mean this is very much a kind of

2105
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,399
reductionist point of view in the sense

2106
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:39,838
that so it's not a theory this is not

2107
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,679
going to explain

2108
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:43,439
to you you know

2109
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,199
anything it doesn't really this kind of

2110
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:46,719
theory the theory this kind of theory of

2111
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:48,479
everything we're talking about doesn't

2112
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,719
say anything interesting particularly

2113
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:52,238
about like macroscopic objects about

2114
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:53,039
what the weather is going to be tomorrow

2115
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:54,238
or

2116
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:55,759
you know things are happening at this

2117
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:57,439
scale but

2118
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:59,759
just what we've discovered is that as

2119
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:01,678
you look at um

2120
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:03,520
the universe that kind of

2121
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,719
you know if you

2122
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,880
kind of start brit you can start

2123
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,960
breaking it apart into and you end up

2124
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,359
with some fairly simple pieces quanta if

2125
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,198
you like and which are doing which are

2126
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:14,319
interacting in some fair in some fairly

2127
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:16,079
simple way

2128
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,839
and it's um

2129
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:19,679
it's good so what we mean by the theory

2130
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:23,359
of everything is

2131
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:25,279
a theory that describes all

2132
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,199
all the objects all the correct objects

2133
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,120
you need to describe what's happening in

2134
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:30,479
the world and describes how they're

2135
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:33,439
interacting with each other at a most

2136
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,479
fundamental level how you get from that

2137
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:37,198
theory to

2138
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:39,599
describing some macroscopic incredibly

2139
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:41,439
complicated thing is there that becomes

2140
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,719
again more of an engineering problem and

2141
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,318
you may need machine learning or you

2142
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,719
made you know a lot of very different

2143
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,120
things to do it but i don't even

2144
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:53,039
think it's uh just engineering it's also

2145
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:54,000
science it one thing that i find

2146
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:56,399
um

2147
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:01,640
kind of interesting

2148
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:01,639
talking to physicists is is a little bit

2149
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,439
there's a

2150
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:08,719
a little bit of hubris so some of the

2151
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:11,279
most brilliant people i know are

2152
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,719
physicists both philosophy and just in

2153
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:14,639
terms of mathematics in terms of

2154
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,198
understanding the world but there's a

2155
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,480
kind of uh either a hubris or what would

2156
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:19,439
i call it

2157
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:21,678
uh

2158
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:23,599
like a confidence that if we have a

2159
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,760
theory of everything we will understand

2160
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,920
everything like this is the deepest

2161
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,679
thing to understand and i would say

2162
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:33,119
and like the rest is details right

2163
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,920
that's the the old rutherford thing uh

2164
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:35,359
but

2165
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,119
to me

2166
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:39,039
there's like this is like a cake or

2167
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:41,359
something there's layers to this thing

2168
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:44,560
and each one has a theory of everything

2169
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:49,599
yeah like at every level

2170
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:52,560
from biology like how life originates

2171
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:55,039
that itself like complex systems yeah

2172
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:58,159
like that in itself is like this

2173
01:10:55,039 --> 01:11:00,158
gigantic thing that requires a theory of

2174
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:02,960
everything and then there's the in the

2175
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:04,639
space of humans psychology like

2176
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,119
intelligence collective intelligence the

2177
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:09,199
way it emerges among species

2178
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:11,439
that feels like a complex system that

2179
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,879
requires its own theory of everything

2180
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:13,599
on top of that

2181
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,279
is

2182
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,800
things like in the computing space

2183
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:18,479
artificial intelligence systems like

2184
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:22,000
that feels like it is a theory of

2185
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:24,879
everything and it's almost like

2186
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,158
once we solve

2187
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,840
once we come up with the theory of

2188
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:30,238
everything that explains the basic laws

2189
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:33,199
of physics that gave us the universe

2190
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:35,119
even stuff that's super complex like uh

2191
01:11:33,198 --> 01:11:37,359
how like how the

2192
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:38,800
universe might be able to originate even

2193
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,799
explaining something that you're not a

2194
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,880
big fan of like multiverses or stuff

2195
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,239
that we don't have any evidence of yet

2196
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,679
still we won't

2197
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:48,639
be able to

2198
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:49,920
have a strong explanation

2199
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,960
of uh

2200
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,119
why

2201
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55,439
food tastes delicious oh yeah yeah i

2202
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:56,479
know no anyway i yeah i agree completely

2203
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:58,238
i mean this

2204
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:00,319
there is something kind of completely

2205
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:02,399
wrong with this terminology or theory of

2206
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:04,158
everything that it's not um it's really

2207
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:05,599
in some sense very bad term very

2208
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:08,079
hubristic and bad

2209
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:10,560
terminology because it's not um this is

2210
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:10,559
explaining

2211
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,840
this is a purely kind of reductionist

2212
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,440
point of view that you're trying to

2213
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,360
understand

2214
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:18,879
certain a certain very specific kind of

2215
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:20,880
things which

2216
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:22,480
you know in principle

2217
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,960
other things

2218
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:26,559
you know emerge from but

2219
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,198
to actually understand how anything

2220
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:32,080
emerges from this is it's hope it can't

2221
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:33,599
be understood in terms of

2222
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:35,039
this this underlying fundamental theory

2223
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,039
is going to be

2224
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:39,359
hopeless in terms of kind of telling you

2225
01:12:37,039 --> 01:12:41,119
what about this um

2226
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:42,238
this various emergent behavior and as

2227
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:43,519
you go to different levels of

2228
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:44,879
explanation you're going to need to

2229
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,239
develop new you know different

2230
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,239
completely different ideas completely

2231
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:50,399
different ways of thinking and

2232
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:51,839
i guess there's a famous kind of um

2233
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:53,198
phil anderson's

2234
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,159
slogan is that you know more is

2235
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:56,158
different

2236
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:57,679
and then yeah so it and

2237
01:12:56,158 --> 01:12:59,359
it's just it's just

2238
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:00,960
even once you understand how what a

2239
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:02,319
couple things well if you have a

2240
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,079
collection of stuff and you understand

2241
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:06,479
perfectly well how each thing is

2242
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:08,000
interacting with it

2243
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:09,279
with the others what the whole thing is

2244
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,198
going to do is just a completely

2245
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:12,238
different problem it's just not and you

2246
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:13,839
need completely different ways of

2247
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:14,879
thinking about it what do you think

2248
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,800
about this

2249
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,400
i got to ask you at a few different

2250
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,960
attempts at the theory of everything

2251
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:22,238
especially recently uh so

2252
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,000
i've been

2253
01:13:22,238 --> 01:13:26,000
for many years a big fan of cellular

2254
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,560
automata of complex systems and

2255
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,279
obviously if because of that a fan of

2256
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,039
stephen wolfram's work on in that space

2257
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:34,238
but he's recently been talking about a

2258
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:35,840
theory

2259
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:37,678
of everything through his physics

2260
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,199
project essentially

2261
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:42,000
uh what do you think about this kind of

2262
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:42,000
discrete

2263
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:46,319
theory of everything for like from

2264
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,198
simple rules and simple objects on the

2265
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:51,279
hyper graphs emerges all of our reality

2266
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:52,960
where time and space are emergent

2267
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:54,800
basically everything we see around us is

2268
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,198
immersed yeah yeah i i have to say

2269
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:00,159
unfortunately i have kind of pretty much

2270
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:01,599
zero sympathy for that i mean i don't um

2271
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:02,879
i spend a little time looking at it and

2272
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,800
i just don't see

2273
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,679
it doesn't seem to me to get anywhere

2274
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,679
and it really is just really really

2275
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:11,520
doesn't agree at all with what what with

2276
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,440
what i'm seeing this the kind of

2277
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,040
unification of math and physics that i'm

2278
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:17,359
kind of talking about around certain

2279
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:19,039
kinds of very deep ideas about geometry

2280
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:21,439
and stuff this

2281
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:23,359
if you want to believe that

2282
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:26,000
that your things are really coming out

2283
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:27,279
of cellular automata at the most um

2284
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,079
fundamental level you have to believe

2285
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:32,719
that everything that i've

2286
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:34,479
seen my whole career and as

2287
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:36,000
as beautiful powerful ideas that that's

2288
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:38,959
all just kind of a mirage which just

2289
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,960
kind of randomly is emerging from these

2290
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,880
more basic very very simple-minded

2291
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:44,158
things and i

2292
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,079
you have to give me some serious

2293
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:48,559
evidence for that and i'm saying nothing

2294
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:50,319
so mirage you don't think there could be

2295
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,360
a consistency

2296
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,679
where

2297
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:56,639
things like quantum mechanics

2298
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:58,319
could emerge from much much much smaller

2299
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,320
discrete

2300
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:01,840
like computational type systems i think

2301
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:03,359
from the point of view of certain

2302
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,600
mathematical point of view quantum

2303
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:07,439
mechanics is already

2304
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,840
mathematically as simple as it gets it

2305
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:12,559
really

2306
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:14,319
is a story about really

2307
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,920
the fundamental objects that you work

2308
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:18,399
with in when you write down a quantum

2309
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:21,039
theory are in some in some point of view

2310
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:22,719
precisely the fundamental objects

2311
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:23,920
at the deepest levels of mathematics

2312
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,960
that you're working with they're exactly

2313
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,239
the same

2314
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,679
so

2315
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:28,879
and cellular automata are something

2316
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,960
completely different which don't fit

2317
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:33,440
into these structures and so i just

2318
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,198
don't see why anyway i don't see it as a

2319
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:36,079
promising

2320
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:37,439
uh

2321
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:38,800
you know promising thing to do and then

2322
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:40,879
just looking at it and saying does this

2323
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,239
go anywhere does this solve any problem

2324
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,079
that i've ever

2325
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:46,559
that i didn't does this solve any

2326
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:48,800
problem of any kind i just don't see it

2327
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,480
yeah to me cellular automata and these

2328
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:53,679
hypographs

2329
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:56,319
i'm not sure solving a problem

2330
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:58,399
is even the standard to apply here at

2331
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:59,599
this moment to me

2332
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:02,399
the fascinating thing is that the

2333
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,719
question it asks have no good answers so

2334
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:06,799
there's not good math explaining forget

2335
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,119
the physics of it math explaining the

2336
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,640
behavior of complex systems yeah and

2337
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:12,880
that to me is

2338
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:16,079
both exciting and paralyzing like we're

2339
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:17,039
at very early days of understanding

2340
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:19,359
you know

2341
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:22,319
how complicated and fascinating things

2342
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:24,319
emerge from simple rules yeah you know i

2343
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:26,000
agree i think that is a

2344
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:29,519
truly great problem and

2345
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,800
depending where it goes it may be um

2346
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,679
you know

2347
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,880
it may

2348
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,399
start to develop some kind of

2349
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,079
connections to the

2350
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:38,000
the things that i've kind of found more

2351
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:40,319
fruitful and

2352
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,319
hard to know it just i think

2353
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,439
a lot of that area i i kind of strongly

2354
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:44,559
feel i

2355
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:46,719
best

2356
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,800
not say too much about it because i just

2357
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:51,198
i don't know too much about it and uh i

2358
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,560
mean again we're back to this original

2359
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:53,519
problem that you know your time in life

2360
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,039
is uh

2361
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,320
is limited you have to figure out what

2362
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:58,000
you're going to spend your time thinking

2363
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:00,079
about and that that's something i've

2364
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,520
just never seen enough to convince me to

2365
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:03,359
spend more time thinking about it well

2366
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,719
also timing it's not just that our time

2367
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,319
is limited but

2368
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,158
the timing of the kind of things you

2369
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:10,079
think about there there's some

2370
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,719
aspect to cellular autonomy these kinds

2371
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:16,319
of objects that it feels like

2372
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:18,158
we're very many years away from having

2373
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:19,759
big breakthroughs on

2374
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:22,000
and so it's like you have to pick the

2375
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,679
problems that are solvable today in fact

2376
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,319
my intuition

2377
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:28,960
again not perhaps biased

2378
01:17:26,319 --> 01:17:31,439
is it feels like the kind of systems

2379
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,719
that complex systems that cellular

2380
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:36,158
automata are

2381
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:38,800
would not be solved by human brains

2382
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:40,719
it feels like well like it feels like

2383
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,360
something post-human that will solve

2384
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:45,920
that problem or like significantly

2385
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:47,679
enhance humans meaning like using

2386
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,840
computational tools

2387
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:53,440
very powerful computational tools

2388
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,400
to us to to crack these problems open

2389
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:57,119
um

2390
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:58,799
that's that's if our

2391
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,399
approach to science our ability to

2392
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,159
understand science our ability to

2393
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:03,920
understand physics will become more and

2394
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:06,158
more computational or there'll be a

2395
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:07,679
whole field that's computational nature

2396
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:09,759
which currently is not the case that

2397
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,719
currently computation is the thing that

2398
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,400
sort of

2399
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,520
assists us

2400
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:15,119
in um

2401
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:17,120
understanding science the way we've been

2402
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,800
doing it all along but if there's a

2403
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:20,399
whole new i mean that

2404
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:24,000
world from new kind of science right

2405
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:25,359
it's a little bit dramatic but you know

2406
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,079
this

2407
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:30,960
if computers could do science on their

2408
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:32,158
own computational systems

2409
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,760
perhaps

2410
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:35,439
um

2411
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,640
that's the way they would do the science

2412
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:38,399
they would try to understand the

2413
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,880
cellular automata and that feels like

2414
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,799
we're decades away so

2415
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,560
perhaps he'll crack open some

2416
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,400
interesting facets of this physics

2417
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,719
problem but it's it's very far away so

2418
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:50,639
timing is everything that that's

2419
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,239
perfectly possible yeah

2420
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:55,039
uh well let me ask you then in the space

2421
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:56,319
of geometry

2422
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:59,760
i don't know how well you know eric

2423
01:18:56,319 --> 01:18:59,759
weinstein oh bro quite well

2424
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,079
what are your thoughts about

2425
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:06,158
his geometric community and the space of

2426
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:07,439
ideas that he's playing with

2427
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,119
on

2428
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:12,719
in his proposal for a theory of

2429
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:14,719
everything well i i think that he has

2430
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,560
he fundamentally has i think the same

2431
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:17,679
problems that everybody

2432
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,280
has had

2433
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,960
trying to do this and you know they're

2434
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:24,399
various they're really versions of the

2435
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,399
same problem that you try to um

2436
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:28,880
you try to get unity by put it putting

2437
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,920
everything into some bigger structure so

2438
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:32,159
he's

2439
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,920
has has has some other ones that he that

2440
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:36,639
are not so conventional that he's trying

2441
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,399
to work with but um

2442
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,119
he has that he has the same problem that

2443
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:41,119
even if he can

2444
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,560
if he can get a lot farther in terms of

2445
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:47,439
having a really well-defined

2446
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:49,440
well-understood clear picture of this

2447
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:52,000
these large these things he's working

2448
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:53,359
with they're really kind of large

2449
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,760
geometrical structures with many

2450
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:57,198
dimensions many kinds and i just don't

2451
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,560
see any way

2452
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:00,158
he's going to have the same problem the

2453
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,920
string leaders have how do you get back

2454
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:04,079
down to

2455
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:06,079
the structures of the standard model and

2456
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:08,238
how do you um

2457
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:09,359
yeah so i i just

2458
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:10,559
anyway

2459
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:13,039
it's the same

2460
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,800
and there's another interesting example

2461
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:16,319
of some similar kind of thing is um

2462
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,239
garrett lucy's

2463
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:19,840
theory of everything again you know he's

2464
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:21,359
there it's a little bit more specific

2465
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,679
than eric's he's

2466
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:24,479
working with this e8 but it um

2467
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,079
again

2468
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:29,279
i think all these things found her at

2469
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:29,279
the same point that you don't

2470
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:33,359
you know you create this unity but then

2471
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,880
you have no

2472
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:36,960
you don't actually have a good idea how

2473
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:39,279
you're going to get back to the to the

2474
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,279
actual

2475
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:43,760
to the objects we're seeing how are you

2476
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:45,759
going to you create these big symmetries

2477
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,880
how are you going to break them and and

2478
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:49,119
because because we don't see those

2479
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,039
imageries in in the real world and um so

2480
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:52,479
ultimately there would need to be a a

2481
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:53,760
simple

2482
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:56,079
process

2483
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,400
for collapsing it to four dimensions

2484
01:20:56,079 --> 01:21:00,238
you'd have to explain well yeah and i

2485
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:03,359
forget in his case but it's not just

2486
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:04,879
four dimensions it's also these um

2487
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:06,238
these structures you see in the standard

2488
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,520
model there's a

2489
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:09,359
you know there's certain very small

2490
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:12,000
dimensional groups of symmetry so called

2491
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:13,679
u1 su-2 and su-3 and

2492
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,719
the problem with

2493
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:17,760
and this has been the problem since the

2494
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:19,359
beginning almost immediately after 1973

2495
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,800
about a year later two years later

2496
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:23,439
people started talking about grand

2497
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:26,320
unified theories so you take

2498
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:27,599
the u1 the su-2 and the su-3 and you put

2499
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:31,359
them in together into this bigger

2500
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,400
structure called the su5 or so10

2501
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:33,519
but then

2502
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:35,039
you're stuck with this problem that wait

2503
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,199
a minute now how

2504
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:38,800
why does the world not look why do i not

2505
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:40,960
see

2506
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:44,560
the these su5 symmetries in the world i

2507
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:47,039
only see these and so

2508
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,800
and and i think you know those id

2509
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:50,158
the kind of thing that that that eric

2510
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,840
and all sudden garrett and lots of

2511
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:54,000
people try to do they all kind of found

2512
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,000
her in that same

2513
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,399
in that same way that they don't have

2514
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,119
they don't have a good answer to that

2515
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:02,960
are there lessons ideas to be learned

2516
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:04,559
from theories like that from gary leases

2517
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,560
from eric's

2518
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,639
um i don't know it depends i have to

2519
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,280
confess i haven't looked that closely at

2520
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:11,679
a

2521
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:14,079
at uh at eric's i mean he explained to

2522
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:15,679
this to me um personally uh a few times

2523
01:22:14,079 --> 01:22:17,439
i've looked a bit at his paper but it's

2524
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:19,359
um

2525
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:22,238
again we're back to the problem of a

2526
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:23,920
limited amount of time in life and

2527
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:26,238
yeah i mean it's an interesting effect

2528
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,239
right

2529
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:32,000
why don't more physicists look at it

2530
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,000
there

2531
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,359
i mean i i'm in this position that

2532
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,119
somehow

2533
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:40,000
you know

2534
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:42,158
uh

2535
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,158
i've of uh

2536
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:45,519
people write me emails for whatever

2537
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:47,759
reason

2538
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,760
and i'd work in the space of ai and so

2539
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,239
there's a lot of people perhaps ai is

2540
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:54,159
even way more accessible than physics in

2541
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:55,759
a certain sense it's a lot of people

2542
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:57,839
write to me with different theories

2543
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,840
about they have for how to create uh

2544
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,319
general intelligence

2545
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,239
and it's again a little bit of an excuse

2546
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:06,479
i say to myself like well i only have a

2547
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:09,759
limited amount of time so that's why i'm

2548
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:11,519
not investigating it but i wonder if um

2549
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:13,520
there's ideas out there

2550
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,760
that are still powerful they're still

2551
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,920
fascinating and that i'm missing because

2552
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:21,199
i'm

2553
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:23,600
because i'm dismissing them

2554
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:26,559
because they're outside of the sort of

2555
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:28,320
the usual process of academic research

2556
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,840
yeah well i mean the same thing and

2557
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:32,158
pretty much every day in my email

2558
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,600
there's a somebody's got a

2559
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:36,638
theory of everything about why all of

2560
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:36,639
what physicists are doing

2561
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:40,639
perhaps the most disturbing thing i

2562
01:23:38,479 --> 01:23:42,158
should say about my uh critique being a

2563
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,079
critic of string theory is is that when

2564
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:45,599
you realize who your fans are

2565
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:47,198
um that they

2566
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,560
every day i hear from somebody that oh

2567
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:50,000
well since you don't like string theory

2568
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,280
you must of course agree with me that

2569
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,158
this is the right way to think about

2570
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:53,840
everything

2571
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:55,198
oh no oh no

2572
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,639
and you know

2573
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:58,399
most of these

2574
01:23:56,639 --> 01:24:00,639
are you know you quickly you can see

2575
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:02,238
this is person doesn't know very much

2576
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:04,719
and doesn't know what they're doing you

2577
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:06,559
know but there's a whole continuum to

2578
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:08,079
you know people who are quite serious

2579
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,560
physicists and mathematicians who are

2580
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:13,119
making a fairly serious attempt to try

2581
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:15,520
to to do something and like like eric

2582
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:17,599
and uh and eric and then

2583
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,120
then your your problem is

2584
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,199
you know you spent you

2585
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:22,559
you do so won't try to spend more time

2586
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:24,719
looking at it and try to figure out what

2587
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,159
they're really doing but

2588
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,520
then at some point you just realize wait

2589
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:28,799
a minute you know for me to really

2590
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,880
really understand exactly what's going

2591
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,920
on here would just

2592
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,440
take

2593
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,960
time i just don't have

2594
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:37,039
yeah it takes a long time which is the

2595
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,679
nice thing about ai

2596
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:40,960
is unlike the kind of physics we're

2597
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:43,119
talking about

2598
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,480
if your idea is good

2599
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:47,359
that should

2600
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:49,678
quite naturally lead to you being able

2601
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:51,759
to build a system that's intelligent

2602
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:53,359
so you don't need to get approval from

2603
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,600
somebody that's saying you have a good

2604
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:57,439
idea here you can just utilize that idea

2605
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,840
and engineer a system like naturally

2606
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:01,119
leads to engineering with physics here

2607
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,000
if you have a

2608
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:06,800
perfect theory that explains everything

2609
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,119
that still doesn't obviously lead one to

2610
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,119
um

2611
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:14,399
to scientific experiments that can

2612
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:16,399
validate that theory and two to like uh

2613
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:18,399
trinkets you can build and sell right

2614
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:19,599
right at a store for five dollars i

2615
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:21,039
can't make money off of it

2616
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,880
[Laughter]

2617
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:25,679
so that that makes it much much more

2618
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,600
challenging um

2619
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:29,840
well let me also ask you about something

2620
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,679
that you found especially recently

2621
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:34,239
appealing which is roger penrose's

2622
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:36,000
twister theory

2623
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:37,839
what is it what kind of questions might

2624
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
it allow us to answer

2625
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,079
what will the answers look like it's

2626
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:44,000
only in the last couple years i really

2627
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:45,679
really kind of come to really i think to

2628
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,359
appreciate it and to see how to really

2629
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:49,039
what i i believe to see how to really do

2630
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:51,439
something with it and i've gotten very

2631
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:53,439
excited about that last year too i mean

2632
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:55,119
one way of saying

2633
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:57,279
one idea of twister theory is that what

2634
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:58,960
it's it's it's a different

2635
01:25:57,279 --> 01:26:01,198
way of thinking about

2636
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:03,119
what space and time are and about what

2637
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,559
points in space and time are

2638
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:06,158
but but which only which is very

2639
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,320
interesting that it only really works in

2640
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:10,079
four dimensions so four dimensions

2641
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:12,158
behaves very very specially unlike other

2642
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:13,198
dimensions and in four dimensions

2643
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:15,279
there's certain

2644
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:17,439
there is a way of thinking about

2645
01:26:15,279 --> 01:26:19,198
space and time geometry where you know

2646
01:26:17,439 --> 01:26:21,119
as well as just thinking about

2647
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:22,719
points in space and time

2648
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:23,920
you can also

2649
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,279
um

2650
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,279
think about different objects it's all

2651
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:29,679
called twisters and then when you do

2652
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:32,479
that you end up with a um kind of a

2653
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:33,600
really interesting insight that the um

2654
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:36,079
that

2655
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,239
you can formulate a theory and you can

2656
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:40,238
formulate a very take a standard theory

2657
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:43,039
that we formulated in terms of points of

2658
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:44,799
space and time and you can reformulate

2659
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:47,679
in this twister language and in this

2660
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,199
twister language it's the um

2661
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:51,440
the fundamental objects actually are

2662
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:53,198
more kind of the

2663
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:56,079
are actually spheres in some sense kind

2664
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:58,238
of the light cone so maybe one

2665
01:26:56,079 --> 01:27:00,639
way to say it which actually i think is

2666
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:00,638
is really

2667
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,639
is quite amazing is if you ask yourself

2668
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,880
you know what do we know about about the

2669
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:08,960
world we have this idea that

2670
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:11,199
the world out there is this all these

2671
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:13,039
different points in these points

2672
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:14,399
well that's kind of a derived quantity

2673
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:17,600
what really really know about the world

2674
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:19,439
is when we open our eyes what do you see

2675
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,960
you see a sphere

2676
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:23,119
and you and that what you're looking at

2677
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:25,359
is you're looking at this you know a

2678
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:27,840
sphere is worth a light rays coming into

2679
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:29,039
into your eyes and what penrose says is

2680
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:32,079
that

2681
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:33,679
well what what a point in space-time is

2682
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:35,840
is that sphere

2683
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,760
that sphere of all the light rays coming

2684
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,760
in and and he says and you should

2685
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,920
formulate your um instead of thinking

2686
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,880
about points you should think about the

2687
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,800
space of those spheres if you like and

2688
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,279
formulate the degrees of freedom as

2689
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,039
physics that's living on those fears

2690
01:27:49,279 --> 01:27:52,639
living on so you're kind of you're kind

2691
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:55,039
of living on your degrees of freedom are

2692
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:56,400
living on light rays not on points

2693
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:59,279
and it's a very different way of

2694
01:27:56,399 --> 01:27:59,279
thinking about um

2695
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:04,799
about about physics and you know he and

2696
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:06,960
others working with him developed a

2697
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:08,480
you know a beautiful mathematical this

2698
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,158
beautiful mathematical formalism and a

2699
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:12,638
way to go back and forth between our

2700
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:15,359
kind of some aspects of our standard way

2701
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:17,600
we write these things down and

2702
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:19,039
work on the so-called twister space and

2703
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,400
you know they

2704
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:21,600
certain things worked out very well but

2705
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:22,479
they ended up

2706
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,880
you know

2707
01:28:22,479 --> 01:28:26,718
i think kind of stuck by the 80s or 90s

2708
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,000
that they weren't

2709
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:29,600
a little bit like string theory that

2710
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,279
they they um

2711
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,320
by using these ideas about twisters they

2712
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:34,000
could develop them in different

2713
01:28:32,319 --> 01:28:35,840
directions and find all sorts of other

2714
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,600
interesting things but they were they

2715
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,760
were getting they weren't finding any

2716
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:43,039
way of doing that that brought them back

2717
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:44,960
to kind of new insights into physics

2718
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:47,119
and um my own i mean what's kind of

2719
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,600
gotten me excited really is is that what

2720
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:52,000
i think i have an idea about

2721
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:54,079
that i think does actually does actually

2722
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,639
work that goes more in that direction

2723
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:58,079
and um i can go on about that endlessly

2724
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:00,400
or talk a little bit about it but that's

2725
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:02,479
the um

2726
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:05,119
i think that that's the one kind of easy

2727
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:06,879
to explain insight about twister theory

2728
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:08,719
there are some more technical ones i

2729
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,079
should mean i think it's also very

2730
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:12,158
convincing what it tells you about

2731
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:14,158
spinners for instance but that's more

2732
01:29:12,158 --> 01:29:17,599
technical well first let's like linger

2733
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:19,519
on the spheres and the light cones

2734
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,400
you're saying twisted theory allows you

2735
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,320
to

2736
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:24,559
make that the fundamental object with

2737
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:26,559
which you're operating yeah

2738
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,719
how that i mean first of all like

2739
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,760
philosophically that's

2740
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:32,399
weird

2741
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,400
and beautiful

2742
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:36,959
maybe because it maps

2743
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:37,679
it feels like it moves us so much closer

2744
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,319
to

2745
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:44,079
the way human brains perceive reality

2746
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:44,079
yeah so it's almost like um

2747
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:51,439
our perception is

2748
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:54,400
like the the content of our perception

2749
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:57,119
is the fundamental object of reality

2750
01:29:54,399 --> 01:29:59,679
that's very appealing yeah

2751
01:29:57,119 --> 01:30:01,679
is it mathematically

2752
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:03,359
powerful

2753
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:04,560
is there something you can

2754
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:06,079
say

2755
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:09,199
can you say a little bit more about what

2756
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:10,479
the heck that even means uh for because

2757
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:12,319
it's much easier to think about

2758
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:14,399
mathematically like a point

2759
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:16,719
in space time like what does it mean to

2760
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:18,719
be operating on the light cone

2761
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,639
it uses a kind of mathematics that's

2762
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,158
relative that you know what was kind of

2763
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:24,560
goes back to the 19th century among

2764
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:26,559
mathematicians it's not um

2765
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,719
anyway it's a bit of a long story but

2766
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,239
one problem is that you have to start

2767
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:32,319
it's crucial that you think in terms of

2768
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:33,599
complex numbers and not just real

2769
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:35,359
numbers and

2770
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,440
this for most people that makes it

2771
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:39,279
harder to for mathematicians that's fine

2772
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:40,960
we love doing that but for most people

2773
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:43,279
that makes it harder to think about but

2774
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,439
um i i think perhaps the most the way

2775
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:47,679
that there is a uh something you can say

2776
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:49,198
very specifically about it

2777
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:50,480
you know in terms of spinners which i

2778
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:51,599
don't know if you want to i think at

2779
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:53,519
some point yeah

2780
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,120
so maybe what are spinners let's start

2781
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,120
with spinner because i think that if we

2782
01:30:55,119 --> 01:30:58,399
can introduce that then i can

2783
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:00,880
by the way

2784
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:03,679
twister spell with an o

2785
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:05,119
and spinner is spelled with an o as well

2786
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:06,800
yes okay

2787
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:08,719
so in case you want to google it and

2788
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,119
look it up that's very nice wikipedia

2789
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:12,399
pages as a starting point i don't know

2790
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:14,719
what is a good starting point for

2791
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:16,399
twister theory

2792
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:18,000
one thing you say about penrose i mean

2793
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:19,599
penrose is actually a very good writer

2794
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,119
and also very good draftsman he's on

2795
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,719
drafts he to the extent this is

2796
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:25,279
visualizable he actually has done some

2797
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:26,880
very nice drawings so i mean almost any

2798
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:28,880
kind of expository thing you can find

2799
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,639
him writing is is a very good a good

2800
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:34,239
place to start he's a

2801
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:35,119
he's a remarkable person but the um

2802
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:36,158
so

2803
01:31:35,119 --> 01:31:38,238
spinners are something that

2804
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:40,000
independently came out of mathematics

2805
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:41,839
and out of physics

2806
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,760
and um to say where they came out of

2807
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,039
physics i mean what people realized when

2808
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,960
they started looking at elementary

2809
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:48,560
particles like electrons

2810
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,158
or whatever that there there seemed to

2811
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,520
be

2812
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:53,198
there seemed to be some kind of doubling

2813
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,920
of the degrees of freedom going on if

2814
01:31:53,198 --> 01:31:55,279
you

2815
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,279
counted

2816
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:59,039
what was there in some sense in the way

2817
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:00,238
you would expect it and when you started

2818
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:01,760
doing quantum mechanics and started

2819
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:03,599
looking at elementary particles there

2820
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,800
were seem to be two degrees of freedom

2821
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,920
they're not one

2822
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:10,320
and one way of seeing it was that if you

2823
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,760
if you put your electron in a strong

2824
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:13,679
magnetic field

2825
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,440
and asked and asked what was the energy

2826
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,960
of it instead of it having one energy it

2827
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:19,359
would have two energies there'd be two

2828
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,719
energy levels and as you

2829
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:23,359
increase magnetic field the splitting

2830
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:24,639
would increase so

2831
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:26,479
physicists kind of realized that wait a

2832
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:27,600
minute so in we thought when we were

2833
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:30,479
doing first start doing quantum

2834
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:32,400
mechanics that the way to describe

2835
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:34,479
particles was in terms of wave functions

2836
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:36,638
and these wave functions were complex to

2837
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:38,000
complex values well

2838
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:39,840
if we actually look at particles that

2839
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,840
that's not right there they're they're

2840
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:44,000
pairs of complex numbers

2841
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:45,920
and pairs of complex numbers

2842
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,520
so you know why so one of the kind of

2843
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,520
fundamental from the physics point of

2844
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:53,280
view the fundamental question is why are

2845
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:55,600
all our kind of fundamental particles

2846
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:58,158
described by pairs of complex numbers

2847
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,600
just weird and then but if you go and

2848
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:01,439
then then you can ask you know what

2849
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:04,639
happens if you like

2850
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:06,479
take an electron and rotate it so how

2851
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:08,400
how do things move in this this pair of

2852
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:10,799
complex numbers

2853
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:11,839
well now if you go back to mathematics

2854
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,760
what had been

2855
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:15,440
been understood in mathematics you know

2856
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:18,320
some years earlier not that many years

2857
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:20,559
earlier was that if you um

2858
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:23,279
if you ask very very generally think

2859
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,080
about geometry of three dimensions and

2860
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:25,359
ask

2861
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:27,119
and if you think about things that are

2862
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:29,119
happening in three dimensions

2863
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:30,399
in the standard way everything

2864
01:33:29,119 --> 01:33:32,639
the standard way of doing geometry

2865
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:33,599
everything is about vectors right so if

2866
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:35,119
you've

2867
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,560
if you take any mathematics classes you

2868
01:33:35,119 --> 01:33:38,319
probably see vectors at some point

2869
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,199
they're just triplets of numbers tell

2870
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:41,198
you

2871
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:43,039
what a direction is or how far you're

2872
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:45,198
going in three dimensional space and

2873
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:47,439
most of everything we teach in most

2874
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:49,919
standard courses in

2875
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:51,919
mathematics is about vectors and things

2876
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:53,840
you build out of vectors so you express

2877
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,000
everything about geometry in terms of

2878
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,560
vectors or how they're changing or how

2879
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,158
you put two of them together and get

2880
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,920
planes and

2881
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:04,319
whatever but what

2882
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:06,000
had been realized that early on is that

2883
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:06,960
if you ask very very generally what are

2884
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,079
the

2885
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,920
if you have

2886
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:11,359
what are the things that that you can

2887
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,880
kind of consistently think about

2888
01:34:11,359 --> 01:34:14,319
rotating

2889
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,920
and um

2890
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:17,359
and you can so you you ask a technical

2891
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:19,279
question what are the representations of

2892
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:21,279
the rotation group well

2893
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:23,119
you you find that their one answer is

2894
01:34:21,279 --> 01:34:24,479
their vectors and everything you build

2895
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:26,319
out of vectors

2896
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:29,119
but then people found but wait a minute

2897
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:31,679
there's also these other things

2898
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:34,319
which you can't build out of vectors

2899
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:36,000
but which you can consistently rotate

2900
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:37,599
and they're they're described by pairs

2901
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,119
of complex numbers by two complex

2902
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,199
numbers and they're they're they're the

2903
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:43,279
spinners also and

2904
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:45,039
to make a lot and to make and and you

2905
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:46,880
can think of spinners in some sense is

2906
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:48,719
more fundamental than vectors because

2907
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,000
you can build vectors out of spinners

2908
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:51,039
you can take two spinners and make a

2909
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,039
vector

2910
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:54,960
but you can't

2911
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:56,479
you can't if you only have vectors you

2912
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:58,319
can't get spinners

2913
01:34:56,479 --> 01:35:00,879
so there in some sense at there's some

2914
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:02,319
kind of level of lower level of geometry

2915
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,159
beyond what we thought it was which was

2916
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:06,399
kind of spinner geometry

2917
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:08,158
and this is something which

2918
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,638
even to this day when we teach graduate

2919
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:13,279
courses in geometry we mostly

2920
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:15,199
don't talk about this because it's a bit

2921
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:16,880
it's a bit hard to hard to do correctly

2922
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:19,519
if you start if you start with your

2923
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:21,359
whole setup is in terms of vectors

2924
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:24,719
getting describing things in terms of

2925
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:27,599
spinners is a whole different ball game

2926
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:30,239
but um the but so but anyway it was just

2927
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:32,320
this amazing fact that this

2928
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:34,638
this kind of more fundamental piece of

2929
01:35:32,319 --> 01:35:36,238
geometry spinners and what we were

2930
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:37,760
actually seeing if you look at electron

2931
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:39,519
are one in the same

2932
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,480
so it's a

2933
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,719
i think it's kind of kind of a

2934
01:35:40,479 --> 01:35:44,799
mind-blowing thing but it it's very uh

2935
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:46,239
un counter-intuitive

2936
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,480
what are some weird properties of

2937
01:35:46,238 --> 01:35:50,238
spinners that are currently

2938
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:51,519
counter-intuitive

2939
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:54,559
there are some things that they do for

2940
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:57,440
instance if you rotate a spinner around

2941
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:59,440
360 degrees it doesn't come back to

2942
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:01,198
where it's it it becomes minus what it

2943
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:02,559
was

2944
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:04,479
so it's

2945
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,000
anyway so so the way rotations work

2946
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:08,158
there's a kind of a funny sign you have

2947
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,760
to keep track of in some sense um so

2948
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:11,759
they're kind of too valued in a way

2949
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:13,119
another weird way but there's but but

2950
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,560
the fundamental problem is that it's

2951
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:16,799
just not

2952
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:19,119
if you're used to visualizing

2953
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,560
vectors you just there's nothing you can

2954
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:22,158
do visualize in terms of vectors that

2955
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:23,679
will ever give you a spinner it just is

2956
01:36:22,158 --> 01:36:24,960
not going to ever work

2957
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,359
as you were saying that i was

2958
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,719
visualizing a vector walking along a

2959
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:31,599
mobius strip

2960
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:33,679
yeah and it ends up being upside down

2961
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:34,639
um but you're saying that doesn't really

2962
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:36,560
capture

2963
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:39,520
so i mean what really captures it the

2964
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:41,280
pro the problem is that it's really

2965
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:43,679
the simplest way to describe it is in

2966
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:45,039
terms of two complex numbers and your

2967
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,840
problem with two complex numbers is

2968
01:36:45,039 --> 01:36:49,519
that's four real numbers so

2969
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,560
your spinner kind of lies in a four

2970
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:54,480
dimensional space so you that makes it

2971
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:56,719
hard to visualize and

2972
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:58,399
it's crucial that it's not just any four

2973
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:59,840
dimensions it's just it's actually

2974
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:01,599
complex numbers you're really going to

2975
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:04,639
use the fact that

2976
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:06,800
these are the complex numbers so it um

2977
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:09,199
it's very hard to visualize but but to

2978
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,480
get back to what i think is mind-blowing

2979
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:11,839
about twisters

2980
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:13,839
is that the

2981
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,079
another way of saying this this idea

2982
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:17,279
about talking about spheres another way

2983
01:37:16,079 --> 01:37:19,279
of saying the fundamental idea of

2984
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:20,719
twister theory is

2985
01:37:19,279 --> 01:37:23,359
in some sense the fundamental idea of

2986
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:25,118
twister theory is that a point

2987
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:26,238
is a two

2988
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:28,719
is a two

2989
01:37:26,238 --> 01:37:30,319
is a two complex dimensional space so

2990
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:32,480
that every

2991
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:34,399
and that it lives inside the space that

2992
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:36,238
it lies inside is twister space

2993
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:38,399
so in the simplest case it's

2994
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:39,359
for twister space is four dimensional

2995
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:42,079
and

2996
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:43,279
a point in space time is a two complex

2997
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:44,079
dimensional

2998
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:46,238
um

2999
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:48,000
subspace of the f of all the four

3000
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:49,519
complex dimensions and as you move

3001
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,238
around in space time you're just moving

3002
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,119
your planes are just moving around okay

3003
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:55,599
and that

3004
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:57,920
and but but then the it's a plane in a

3005
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:00,400
four-dimensional space it's a yeah it

3006
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:02,800
plays complex complex planes so it's two

3007
01:38:00,399 --> 01:38:05,039
complex dimensions in four comics

3008
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:07,039
okay but then to me the mind-blowing

3009
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:08,800
thing about this is this then

3010
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:12,319
kind of tautologically answers the

3011
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:14,880
question is what is a spinner well

3012
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:18,000
a spinner is a point i mean the space of

3013
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,359
spinners at a point is the point in

3014
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,359
twister theory

3015
01:38:19,359 --> 01:38:23,039
the points are the complex two planes

3016
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:24,479
and and you want me to and you're asking

3017
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:26,800
what a spinner is

3018
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:28,158
well a spinner the space of spinners is

3019
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:31,039
that two plane

3020
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:32,960
so it's you know just your whole

3021
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:34,000
definition of what a pointed space time

3022
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,520
was just

3023
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,198
told you what a spinner was it's they're

3024
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:38,719
they're just it's the same thing yeah

3025
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:40,559
we're trying to project that into a

3026
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:42,158
three-dimensional space and trying to

3027
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,520
intuit but yeah

3028
01:38:42,158 --> 01:38:46,000
yeah so the intuition becomes very

3029
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:48,400
difficult but um but

3030
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,600
from if you don't you not using twister

3031
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:51,198
theory

3032
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:53,360
you have to kind of go through a certain

3033
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:55,759
fairly complicated rigor role to even

3034
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:57,439
describe spinners to describe electrons

3035
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,920
whereas using twister theory it's just

3036
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:01,519
completely tautological they're just

3037
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,960
what you want

3038
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:05,040
to describe

3039
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:06,719
the electron is

3040
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:08,238
fundamentally the way you're describing

3041
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,359
the point in space-time already it's

3042
01:39:08,238 --> 01:39:10,559
just there

3043
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:12,238
so

3044
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:14,159
do you have a hope you mentioned that

3045
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:16,638
you've been uh you found it appealing

3046
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:18,638
recently is it just because of certain

3047
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:20,079
aspects of its mathematical beauty or do

3048
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:22,400
you actually have a hope that this might

3049
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:24,479
lead to a theory of everything

3050
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:26,479
yeah i mean i certainly do have

3051
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:27,839
such a hope because what i've found i

3052
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:29,439
think the thing which which i've done

3053
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:31,360
which i i don't think as far as i can

3054
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:33,359
tell no one had really looked at

3055
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:35,599
from this point of view before

3056
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:35,599
is

3057
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,279
has to do with it this question of how

3058
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:42,000
do you how do you treat time in your in

3059
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:42,880
your quantum theory and um

3060
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,039
so

3061
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,760
there's another long story about how we

3062
01:39:45,039 --> 01:39:47,439
do

3063
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:50,400
quantum theories and about how we treat

3064
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:52,559
time and quantum theories which um

3065
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:54,319
it is a long story but

3066
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,840
to me the short version of it is that

3067
01:39:54,319 --> 01:39:58,319
what what people have found when you try

3068
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,600
and write down a quantum theory

3069
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:01,198
that

3070
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:04,000
it's often

3071
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:05,599
it's often a good idea to take

3072
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,679
your time coordinate whenever you're

3073
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,520
using your time coordinate and then

3074
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:12,000
multiply it by the square root of minus

3075
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:15,520
one and to make it purely imaginary and

3076
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,880
so you all these formulas which you have

3077
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:19,040
um

3078
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:20,960
in your standard theory if you do that

3079
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,560
to those i mean those those formulas

3080
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,079
have some very strange

3081
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,199
strange behavior and they're kind of

3082
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:27,600
singular

3083
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:29,118
if you ask even some simple questions

3084
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,960
you have to very

3085
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:33,359
take very delicate singular limits in

3086
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,319
order to get the correct answer and you

3087
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:36,799
have to take them from the right

3088
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:39,439
direction otherwise it doesn't work

3089
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:41,279
whereas if you just take time

3090
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:42,638
and if you just put a factor of square

3091
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:44,079
root of minus one wherever you see the

3092
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:46,000
time coordinate

3093
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:47,679
you end up with

3094
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,760
much simpler formulas which are much

3095
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:51,279
better behaved mathematically

3096
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:52,960
and what i what i hadn't really

3097
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:55,439
appreciated until fairly recently is

3098
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,520
also how dramatically that changes the

3099
01:40:55,439 --> 01:41:00,079
whole structure of the theory you end up

3100
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:03,119
with a consistent way of talking about

3101
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:04,399
these quantum theories but it has very

3102
01:41:03,118 --> 01:41:06,319
some very different flavor and very

3103
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:09,198
different aspects that i hadn't really

3104
01:41:06,319 --> 01:41:11,759
appreciated and in particular the way

3105
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:14,879
the way symmetries act on it is is not

3106
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:15,840
at all what i originally had expected

3107
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:17,840
and so

3108
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:19,840
that's the new thing that i've where i

3109
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:20,719
think i think gives you something is to

3110
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,960
um

3111
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:25,198
to do this move which people often think

3112
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,880
of as just kind of a

3113
01:41:25,198 --> 01:41:28,879
kind of a mathematical trick that you're

3114
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,039
doing to make some formulas work out

3115
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:33,039
nicely but to take that mathematical

3116
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:35,760
trick as really fundamental

3117
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:38,238
and um turns out in twister theory

3118
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,480
allows you to simultaneously talk about

3119
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:42,718
your usual time and the time times the

3120
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:44,559
square root of minus one they both

3121
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:47,520
fit they both fit very nicely into

3122
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:49,199
twister theory and um you end up with a

3123
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,760
some structures which look a lot like

3124
01:41:49,198 --> 01:41:53,198
the standard model

3125
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,119
well let me ask you about some nobel

3126
01:41:53,198 --> 01:41:57,839
prizes okay

3127
01:41:55,118 --> 01:42:00,799
do you think there will be uh

3128
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:04,000
uh there was a bet between um

3129
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:06,159
michio kaku and somebody else uh about

3130
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,960
john horgan here and john horgan about

3131
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:08,559
uh

3132
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:11,520
uh by the way maybe discover a cool

3133
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:13,520
website longbets.com or dot org yeah

3134
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:15,760
yeah it's cool it's cool that you can

3135
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:18,239
make a bet with people

3136
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:19,679
uh and then check in 20 years later

3137
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:21,359
that's uh i really love it there's a lot

3138
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,639
of interesting bets on there yeah i

3139
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:25,039
would love to participate but it's

3140
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:26,000
interesting to see you know time flies

3141
01:42:25,039 --> 01:42:27,840
yeah

3142
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,520
and you make a bet about what's going to

3143
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,920
happen 20 years you don't realize 20

3144
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:33,840
years just goes like this yeah yeah and

3145
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,440
then and then you get to face oh and you

3146
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,360
get to wonder

3147
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:38,238
like

3148
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:41,198
what

3149
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:43,198
was that person what was i thinking that

3150
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:44,399
person 20 years ago is almost like a

3151
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:46,238
different person what was i thinking

3152
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:48,079
back then to think that

3153
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:50,479
is interesting but so let me ask you

3154
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:52,880
this on record

3155
01:42:50,479 --> 01:42:54,158
uh you know 20 years from now or some

3156
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:56,960
number of years from now do you think

3157
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:59,439
there will be a nobel prize given for

3158
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:01,679
something directly connected to a first

3159
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:03,118
broadly theory of everything

3160
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:06,079
and second

3161
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:07,279
of course one of the possibilities one

3162
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:08,639
of them

3163
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:10,880
string theory

3164
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:12,239
um

3165
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:15,199
strength

3166
01:43:12,238 --> 01:43:16,000
definitely not that uh things have gone

3167
01:43:15,198 --> 01:43:17,678
yeah

3168
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,359
so fine if you were giving financial

3169
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:20,239
advice you would say not to bet no do

3170
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:22,719
not but

3171
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:24,559
and and even i actually suspect if you

3172
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:26,880
ask strength here is that question these

3173
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:28,560
as you you're going to get a few of them

3174
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,639
saying i mean if you'd asked them that

3175
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,080
question 20 years ago again when

3176
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:33,760
kaku was making this better whatever i

3177
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:35,279
think some some of them would have taken

3178
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,119
you up on it but um

3179
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:39,118
and certainly back in 1984 a bunch of

3180
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:42,158
them would have said oh sure yeah but

3181
01:43:39,118 --> 01:43:42,960
now i get the impression that

3182
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:44,559
they've

3183
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:46,719
even they realized that things are not

3184
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:48,239
looking good for that particular idea

3185
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:50,560
again it depends what you mean by string

3186
01:43:48,238 --> 01:43:52,399
theory whether maybe the term will

3187
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:54,960
evolve to mean something else which

3188
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:56,479
which will work out but i don't yeah i

3189
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:58,399
don't think that's not gonna

3190
01:43:56,479 --> 01:43:59,919
likely to work out whether um

3191
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:01,439
something else i mean i i still think

3192
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:03,118
it's relatively unlikely that you'll

3193
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:04,799
have any

3194
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:07,118
really successful theory of everything

3195
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,719
and and the main problem is is just the

3196
01:44:07,118 --> 01:44:10,319
um

3197
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:12,158
it's become so difficult to do

3198
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:15,118
experiments at higher energy that we've

3199
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:17,599
really lost this ability to kind of get

3200
01:44:15,118 --> 01:44:20,238
unexpected input from

3201
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:22,239
from experiment and and you can you know

3202
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:23,678
while it's maybe hard to figure out what

3203
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:26,718
people's thinking is going to be 20

3204
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:29,118
years from now looking at um

3205
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:31,039
you know energy particle energy

3206
01:44:29,118 --> 01:44:32,719
colliders and their technology it's

3207
01:44:31,039 --> 01:44:34,238
actually pretty easy to make a pretty

3208
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:35,039
accurate guess what it's going to look

3209
01:44:34,238 --> 01:44:36,559
what

3210
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:38,960
except what you're going to be doing 20

3211
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:40,639
years from now and um

3212
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:42,239
i think actually i

3213
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:43,520
i would actually claim that

3214
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:45,039
it's pretty clear where you're going to

3215
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,840
be 20 years from now and what it's going

3216
01:44:45,039 --> 01:44:49,920
to be is you're going to have the

3217
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:51,600
um you're going to have the the lhc

3218
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:53,359
you're going to have a lot more data an

3219
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,560
order of magnitude or more

3220
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:57,439
or more

3221
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:58,800
data from the lhc but at the same energy

3222
01:44:57,439 --> 01:45:01,279
you're not going to you're not going to

3223
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:03,119
see a higher energy

3224
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:06,719
accelerator operating successfully in

3225
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:08,719
the um in the next 20 years and like

3226
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:10,800
maybe machine learning or great sort of

3227
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:13,920
data science methodologies that process

3228
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:15,600
that data will not reveal any

3229
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:17,440
major

3230
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,199
like shifts in our understanding of the

3231
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:21,519
underlying physics you think i don't

3232
01:45:19,198 --> 01:45:24,559
think so i mean i think that that that

3233
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:26,159
feel that my understanding is that they

3234
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,679
they're starting to make a great use of

3235
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:29,759
those techniques but but it seems to

3236
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:31,199
look like it it will help them solve

3237
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:33,760
certain technical problems and be able

3238
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:35,198
to do things somewhat better but not

3239
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,639
completely change

3240
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:37,919
the way they're looking at things what

3241
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:39,440
do you think about

3242
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,118
the potential quantum computers

3243
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:43,519
simulating quantum mechanical systems

3244
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:46,479
and through that sneak up

3245
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:49,600
to sort of simu through simulation

3246
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:51,359
sneak up to a deep understanding of um

3247
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:53,039
the fundamental physics

3248
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:56,559
the problem there is

3249
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:58,960
that that's promising more for this um

3250
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:01,440
for uh you know for phil anderson's

3251
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:03,279
problem that you know if you want to

3252
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:04,079
there there's lots and lots of if you

3253
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:05,840
know

3254
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:07,519
you take

3255
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:08,960
you start putting together

3256
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,880
lots and lots of things and we think we

3257
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:13,279
know they're pair by pair interactions

3258
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,639
but what this thing is going to do we

3259
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:16,079
don't have any good calculational

3260
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:18,239
techniques

3261
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:20,800
you know quantum computers may very well

3262
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:22,238
give you those and so they may

3263
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:24,840
what we think of as kind of strong

3264
01:46:22,238 --> 01:46:26,399
coupling behavior we have no good way to

3265
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:27,520
calculate

3266
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:28,799
you know even though we can write down

3267
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:30,400
the theory we don't know how to

3268
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:33,039
calculate anything

3269
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:34,960
with any accuracy in it the um quantum

3270
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:36,560
computers may solve that problem but the

3271
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,079
problem is that they i don't think that

3272
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:39,440
they're going to solve the problem that

3273
01:46:38,079 --> 01:46:41,118
they help you with the problem of not

3274
01:46:39,439 --> 01:46:42,638
having their

3275
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:44,000
of knowing what the right underlying

3276
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:45,840
theory is

3277
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,639
as somebody uh

3278
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:51,119
who likes experimental validation let me

3279
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:52,239
ask you the perhaps ridiculous sounding

3280
01:46:51,118 --> 01:46:54,479
but i don't think it's actually a

3281
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:56,559
ridiculous question of

3282
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:58,399
do you think we live in a simulation

3283
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:00,320
do you find that thought experiment at

3284
01:46:58,399 --> 01:47:02,799
all useful or interesting

3285
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:05,599
not really not not really i don't uh it

3286
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:08,000
just doesn't uh

3287
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:10,239
yeah and anyway to me it doesn't

3288
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,560
actually lead to any kind of interesting

3289
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:14,879
lead anywhere interesting and yeah to me

3290
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:16,560
so maybe i'll i'll throw a wrench into

3291
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,000
your thing uh

3292
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,080
to me it's super interesting from an

3293
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,198
engineering perspective so if you look

3294
01:47:20,079 --> 01:47:26,639
at virtual reality systems

3295
01:47:23,198 --> 01:47:29,359
the the actual question is

3296
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:30,400
how much computation and how difficult

3297
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:32,880
is it

3298
01:47:30,399 --> 01:47:35,118
to construct a world

3299
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:36,639
that uh like there are several levels

3300
01:47:35,118 --> 01:47:37,920
here

3301
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:39,840
one

3302
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:41,760
is you won't know the difference our

3303
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,119
human perception systems and maybe even

3304
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,800
the tools of physics won't know the

3305
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:47,279
difference between the simulated world

3306
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:49,440
and the real world

3307
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:50,960
that's sort of more of a

3308
01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:52,960
physics question

3309
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:54,639
the the most interesting question to me

3310
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:58,639
has more to do with why food tastes

3311
01:47:54,639 --> 01:48:00,400
delicious which is create how difficult

3312
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:02,800
and how much computation is required to

3313
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:04,719
construct a simulation

3314
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:06,000
where you kind of know it's a simulation

3315
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:08,000
at first

3316
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,760
but you want to stay there anyway and

3317
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,840
over time

3318
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:14,159
you don't

3319
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,159
even remember yeah

3320
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:17,198
well yeah anyway i agree these are kind

3321
01:48:16,158 --> 01:48:18,879
of

3322
01:48:17,198 --> 01:48:21,198
fascinating questions and they may be

3323
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:22,800
very very relevant to our future as a

3324
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:26,079
species but um

3325
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:27,679
yeah they're just very far from anything

3326
01:48:26,079 --> 01:48:29,279
so from a physics perspective it's not

3327
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:31,600
useful to you to think

3328
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:32,960
taking a computational perspective to

3329
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,960
our universe think of it as an

3330
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,560
information processing system

3331
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,239
and then think of it as doing

3332
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:39,840
computation and then you think about the

3333
01:48:38,238 --> 01:48:42,079
resources required to do that kind of

3334
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,600
computation and all that kind of stuff

3335
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:45,920
you could just look at the basic physics

3336
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:47,440
and who cares what the the computer it's

3337
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:48,719
running on us yeah it just i mean the

3338
01:48:47,439 --> 01:48:50,399
kinds of i mean

3339
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:51,760
i'm willing to agree that you can get

3340
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:53,599
into interesting kinds of questions

3341
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,440
going down that road but they're just so

3342
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,199
different from anything from what i

3343
01:48:55,439 --> 01:48:58,879
found interesting that i just

3344
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:01,359
again i just have to

3345
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:03,039
kind of go back to life is too short and

3346
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:05,039
i'm very glad other people are thinking

3347
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:06,880
about this but

3348
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:08,639
i just don't see any anything i can do

3349
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,920
with it

3350
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:12,319
what about

3351
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:14,158
space itself so i have to ask you about

3352
01:49:12,319 --> 01:49:16,719
aliens

3353
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:18,638
again something uh since you emphasize

3354
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:20,800
evidence

3355
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:22,880
do you think there is how many do you

3356
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,719
think there are and how many

3357
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:25,760
intelligent alien civilizations are out

3358
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:27,840
there

3359
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:29,520
yeah i have i have no idea i have

3360
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,960
certainly as far as i know unless the

3361
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,719
government's covering it up or something

3362
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:34,800
we haven't heard from uh

3363
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:36,480
we don't have any evidence for

3364
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:38,480
such things yet but there's there seems

3365
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:40,879
to be no

3366
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:43,039
there's no particular obstruction

3367
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,560
why there shouldn't be so

3368
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:46,000
i mean do you

3369
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,159
you work on some

3370
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:51,439
fundamental questions about the physics

3371
01:49:48,158 --> 01:49:53,279
of reality when you look up to the stars

3372
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:55,678
do you think about whether somebody's

3373
01:49:53,279 --> 01:49:57,599
looking back at us

3374
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:59,118
actually i originally got interested in

3375
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:00,880
physics i actually started out as a kid

3376
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:02,639
interested in astronomy exactly that and

3377
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,719
a telescope and whatever that and

3378
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:07,440
certainly read a lot of

3379
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:09,118
science fiction and

3380
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:11,839
thought about that i i find over the

3381
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:12,960
years i find myself kind of less

3382
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,960
anyway

3383
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,639
less and less interested in that well

3384
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:18,880
just because i don't i don't really know

3385
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:20,239
what to do with them

3386
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:22,480
i've also kind of kind of at some point

3387
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:24,158
kind of stopped reading science fiction

3388
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:26,238
that much kind of feeling that there was

3389
01:50:24,158 --> 01:50:28,079
just two that the actual science i was

3390
01:50:26,238 --> 01:50:29,759
kind of learning about was

3391
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:32,399
perfectly kind of weird and fascinating

3392
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,760
and unusual enough but and better than

3393
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:36,479
any of the stuff that

3394
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,360
and isaac asimov so why should i

3395
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:39,678
yeah

3396
01:50:37,359 --> 01:50:41,519
and you can mess with the science

3397
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:42,480
much more than the the distant science

3398
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,480
fiction

3399
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:46,479
yeah the one that's exist in our

3400
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:49,279
imagination or the one that exists out

3401
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:51,039
there among the stars yeah

3402
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:53,840
well you mentioned science fiction

3403
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:56,319
you've written quite a few book reviews

3404
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:58,719
i gotta ask you about some books perhaps

3405
01:50:56,319 --> 01:51:01,519
if you don't mind

3406
01:50:58,719 --> 01:51:02,800
is is there one or two books that you

3407
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:05,119
would recommend

3408
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:08,719
to others and maybe if you can

3409
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:08,719
what ideas you drew from them

3410
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:15,279
either negative recommendations positive

3411
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:16,559
well do not read this book for sure well

3412
01:51:15,279 --> 01:51:18,238
i must say i mean

3413
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,840
unfortunately

3414
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:21,519
yeah you can go to my website and

3415
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:23,199
there's you can click on book reviews

3416
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:25,280
and you can see i've written

3417
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:27,279
read a lot of a lot of i mean

3418
01:51:25,279 --> 01:51:29,359
as you can tell from my views about

3419
01:51:27,279 --> 01:51:31,679
string theory i'm not a fan of a lot of

3420
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:33,519
the kind of popular books about oh isn't

3421
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:34,719
straight theory grade and

3422
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,320
about

3423
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:37,920
yeah so i'm not a fan of

3424
01:51:36,319 --> 01:51:41,198
a lot of things of that kind can ask you

3425
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:44,079
a quick question on this a small tangent

3426
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:46,399
are you a fan

3427
01:51:44,079 --> 01:51:48,719
okay can you explore the pros and cons

3428
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:51,598
of forget string theory

3429
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:54,880
sort of science communication

3430
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:57,520
sort of cosmo style

3431
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:59,520
communication of concepts to people that

3432
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:02,159
are outside of physics outside of

3433
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:04,880
mathematics outside of even the sciences

3434
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:07,118
and helping people to sort of dream and

3435
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:10,159
fill them with awe about the full

3436
01:52:07,118 --> 01:52:12,559
range of mysteries in our universe

3437
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:13,920
that's a complicated issue i think

3438
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,800
you know i certainly go back and go back

3439
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:18,399
to like what inspired me and um maybe to

3440
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,760
connect to connected a little bit to

3441
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:20,879
this question about books i mean

3442
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:22,079
certainly one

3443
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:24,159
the books that some books that i

3444
01:52:22,079 --> 01:52:25,679
remember reading when i was a kid were

3445
01:52:24,158 --> 01:52:27,359
about the early history of quant

3446
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:29,520
mechanics like heisenberg's books that

3447
01:52:27,359 --> 01:52:31,198
he wrote about you know kind of looking

3448
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:32,400
back at telling the history of what

3449
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:34,319
happened when he developed climate

3450
01:52:32,399 --> 01:52:36,479
change it's just kind of a

3451
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:38,319
totally fascinating romantic

3452
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:39,919
great story and uh those were very

3453
01:52:38,319 --> 01:52:41,679
inspirational to me

3454
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:42,719
and um i would think maybe other people

3455
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:45,118
might also

3456
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:46,719
also find them that but the um and

3457
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:48,960
that's that's almost like the human

3458
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:50,960
story of the development of the ideas

3459
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:52,560
yeah the human story but yeah just also

3460
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:54,079
how you know they they're these very

3461
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,760
very weird ideas that didn't seem to

3462
01:52:54,079 --> 01:52:58,158
make sense that how they were struggling

3463
01:52:55,760 --> 01:53:00,560
with them and how you know they actually

3464
01:52:58,158 --> 01:53:03,439
anyway it's it's it's it's i think it's

3465
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:06,800
the period of physics kind of beginning

3466
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:09,198
in 1905 plank and einstein and

3467
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:12,480
ending up with the war when these things

3468
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:14,479
are get used to you know make massively

3469
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:17,359
destructive weapons is it's just that

3470
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:19,279
truly amazing so many so many new ideas

3471
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:22,399
let me on another tangent on top of a

3472
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:24,639
change on top of a tangent ask

3473
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:26,559
if we didn't have einstein

3474
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:28,800
so how does science progress

3475
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:32,239
is it the long geniuses

3476
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:34,239
or is it uh some kind of weird network

3477
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:37,359
of ideas swimming in the air and just

3478
01:53:34,238 --> 01:53:39,359
kind of the the geniuses pop up to catch

3479
01:53:37,359 --> 01:53:41,118
them and others would anyway without

3480
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:44,479
einstein would we have

3481
01:53:41,118 --> 01:53:46,639
uh special relativity general relativity

3482
01:53:44,479 --> 01:53:48,238
i mean it it's an interesting case to

3483
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:50,480
case based i mean i mean especially

3484
01:53:48,238 --> 01:53:51,598
special relativity i think we would have

3485
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:53,759
had

3486
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:54,800
i mean there are other people

3487
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,320
anyway

3488
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:58,320
you could even argue that it was already

3489
01:53:56,319 --> 01:54:00,158
there in some form in some ways but i

3490
01:53:58,319 --> 01:54:02,158
think special relativity would have had

3491
01:54:00,158 --> 01:54:05,118
without einstein fairly

3492
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:07,439
fairly quickly general relativity

3493
01:54:05,118 --> 01:54:09,198
that was a much much harder thing to do

3494
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:11,118
and um

3495
01:54:09,198 --> 01:54:12,559
required a much more effort much more

3496
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:13,598
certificate that

3497
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:15,199
i think he would have had sooner or

3498
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:16,639
later but it would have taken taken

3499
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:18,158
quite a bit longer

3500
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:20,880
another thing that took a bunch of years

3501
01:54:18,158 --> 01:54:23,039
to validate scientifically the general

3502
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:24,719
relativity but even for einstein from

3503
01:54:23,039 --> 01:54:26,399
you know the point which he had kind of

3504
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:28,880
a general idea of what he was trying to

3505
01:54:26,399 --> 01:54:30,158
do to the point where he actually had a

3506
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:31,920
well-defined theory that you could

3507
01:54:30,158 --> 01:54:33,679
actually compare to the real world that

3508
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,359
was you know i kind of forget the

3509
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:37,599
numbers of the order of magnitude 10

3510
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:38,639
years of very serious work and um if he

3511
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:40,239
hadn't been

3512
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:41,760
around to do that it would have taken a

3513
01:54:40,238 --> 01:54:43,598
while before anyone else

3514
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,880
got around to it on the other hand there

3515
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:47,279
are things like

3516
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:51,199
with quant mechanics you have um

3517
01:54:47,279 --> 01:54:53,679
you know heisenberg and um schrodinger

3518
01:54:51,198 --> 01:54:55,359
came up with two

3519
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:56,560
which ultimately equivalent but two

3520
01:54:55,359 --> 01:54:58,559
different

3521
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:00,880
approaches to it you know within months

3522
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:02,639
of each other and you know so if

3523
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:04,079
heisenberg hadn't been there he already

3524
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:05,199
what about schrodinger or whatever and

3525
01:55:04,079 --> 01:55:07,118
if neither of them been there it would

3526
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:08,319
have been somebody else a few months

3527
01:55:07,118 --> 01:55:10,799
later so

3528
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:12,238
there are times when the um

3529
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:13,920
you know just the

3530
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:15,598
a lot often is

3531
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:17,599
the combination of

3532
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:19,599
the right ideas are in place and the

3533
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:21,199
right experimental data is in place to

3534
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:22,719
point in the right direction and it's

3535
01:55:21,198 --> 01:55:25,439
just waiting for

3536
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:27,679
somebody's going to find it um

3537
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:29,198
maybe maybe to go back to your uh to

3538
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:30,960
your aliens i guess the one thing i

3539
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:32,479
often wonder about aliens is would they

3540
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,560
have the same

3541
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:36,158
fundamental physics ideas as we if we

3542
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:38,000
have in mathematics would their mouth

3543
01:55:36,158 --> 01:55:39,519
you know would they

3544
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,599
you know

3545
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:43,119
how much is this really intrinsic to our

3546
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,480
minds if you start out with a different

3547
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:45,598
kind of mind when you end up with a

3548
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:47,359
different

3549
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:48,480
ideas of what fundamental physics is or

3550
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:51,759
what or what the structure of

3551
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:53,839
mathematics is so this is why like if i

3552
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:55,599
was uh

3553
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:58,400
you know i like video games the way i

3554
01:55:55,599 --> 01:56:00,319
would do it as a curious being so first

3555
01:55:58,399 --> 01:56:01,198
experiment i'd like to do is run earth

3556
01:56:00,319 --> 01:56:03,198
over

3557
01:56:01,198 --> 01:56:04,799
many thousands of times and see if our

3558
01:56:03,198 --> 01:56:07,279
particular

3559
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:09,039
um no you know what i wouldn't do the

3560
01:56:07,279 --> 01:56:11,279
full evolution i would start at homo

3561
01:56:09,039 --> 01:56:14,000
sapiens first and then see the evolution

3562
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:16,079
of homo sapiens millions of times and

3563
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,118
see how the the ideas of science would

3564
01:56:16,079 --> 01:56:18,319
evolve like

3565
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:20,000
would you get

3566
01:56:18,319 --> 01:56:22,079
like how would physics evolve how would

3567
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,079
math evolves i would particularly just

3568
01:56:22,079 --> 01:56:25,359
be curious about the notation they come

3569
01:56:24,079 --> 01:56:27,519
up with

3570
01:56:25,359 --> 01:56:29,920
um every once in a while i would like

3571
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:31,840
throw miracles at them to like to mess

3572
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:33,599
with them and stuff and then i would

3573
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:35,440
also like to run earth from the very

3574
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:37,199
beginning to see if evolution would

3575
01:56:35,439 --> 01:56:38,719
produce different kinds of brains that

3576
01:56:37,198 --> 01:56:41,359
would then produce different kinds of

3577
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:43,679
mathematics and physics and then finally

3578
01:56:41,359 --> 01:56:48,319
i would probably millions of times run

3579
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:50,480
the universe over to see what kind of um

3580
01:56:48,319 --> 01:56:52,559
what kind of environments

3581
01:56:50,479 --> 01:56:55,198
and what kind of uh life would be

3582
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,800
created to then lead to intelligent life

3583
01:56:55,198 --> 01:56:58,879
to then lead to

3584
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:01,199
um theories of mathematics and physics

3585
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:04,800
synthesis the full range and like sort

3586
01:57:01,198 --> 01:57:07,039
of uh like darwin kind of mark okay

3587
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:08,800
it took them uh

3588
01:57:07,039 --> 01:57:10,639
what is it

3589
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:12,079
several hundred million years to come up

3590
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:13,359
with uh

3591
01:57:12,079 --> 01:57:15,198
calculus

3592
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:17,759
i would just like keep noting how long

3593
01:57:15,198 --> 01:57:19,598
it does and get an average and see see

3594
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:22,079
which ideas are difficult which are not

3595
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:25,520
and and then and then conclusively

3596
01:57:22,079 --> 01:57:27,359
sort of figure out if it's uh

3597
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:29,440
if it's more collective intelligence or

3598
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:32,319
singular intelligence that's responsible

3599
01:57:29,439 --> 01:57:33,919
for shifts and for big phase shifts and

3600
01:57:32,319 --> 01:57:36,158
breakthroughs in science

3601
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:38,079
if i was playing a video game and

3602
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:39,118
i got a chance to run this whole thing

3603
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:40,158
yeah

3604
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:41,839
but um

3605
01:57:40,158 --> 01:57:43,519
we were talking about books before i

3606
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:46,079
distracted okay of course yeah go back

3607
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:47,679
books and yeah so and then yeah so

3608
01:57:46,079 --> 01:57:49,599
that's one thing i recommend is the

3609
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:50,800
books books about the

3610
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:52,719
from the original people especially

3611
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:54,320
heisenberg about the

3612
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:57,118
how that happened and there's also a

3613
01:57:54,319 --> 01:57:59,279
very very good kind of history of

3614
01:57:57,118 --> 01:58:01,279
of the kind of what happened during this

3615
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:03,359
20th century

3616
01:58:01,279 --> 01:58:05,359
in physics and you know up to the time

3617
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:08,000
of the standard model in 1973 it's

3618
01:58:05,359 --> 01:58:10,719
called the um the second creation by um

3619
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,719
pop crease and uh and man that's one of

3620
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:14,560
the best ones i know that's

3621
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:16,079
but the one thing that i can say is that

3622
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:20,159
so that book i think

3623
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:21,519
forget when it was late 80s 90s

3624
01:58:20,158 --> 01:58:22,960
the problem is that there just hasn't

3625
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:24,719
been much that's actually worked out

3626
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:25,840
since then so

3627
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:26,960
most of the books that are kind of

3628
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:29,079
trying to tell you about all the

3629
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:31,520
glorious things that have happened since

3630
01:58:29,079 --> 01:58:32,880
1973 are

3631
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:34,480
they're mostly telling you about how

3632
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:36,880
glorious things are which actually don't

3633
01:58:34,479 --> 01:58:38,479
really work it's really

3634
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:40,239
the argument people sometimes make in

3635
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:41,519
terms in favor of these books as well oh

3636
01:58:40,238 --> 01:58:42,799
you know they're really great because

3637
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:44,480
you want to do something that will get

3638
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,599
kids excited and then you know so

3639
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:47,118
they're getting excited about things

3640
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:48,639
something that's not really quite

3641
01:58:47,118 --> 01:58:50,639
working it's doesn't really matter the

3642
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:52,560
main thing is get them excited yeah the

3643
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:53,679
other argument is

3644
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,800
you know wait a minute when if you're

3645
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:56,239
getting

3646
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:57,679
people excited about ideas that are

3647
01:58:56,238 --> 01:58:59,519
wrong you're really kind of you're

3648
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:01,520
actually kind of discrediting the whole

3649
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:04,000
scientific enterprise in a not really

3650
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:05,760
good way so there's

3651
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,279
these problems so my uh

3652
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:09,360
my general feeling about expository

3653
01:59:07,279 --> 01:59:12,000
stuff is yeah it's to the extent you can

3654
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:13,839
do it kind of honestly and and and well

3655
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,359
that's great there are a lot of people

3656
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:17,679
doing that now but

3657
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:20,238
to the extent that you're

3658
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:22,158
just trying to get people

3659
01:59:20,238 --> 01:59:23,439
excited and enthusiastic by kind of

3660
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:25,118
telling them stuff which isn't really

3661
01:59:23,439 --> 01:59:26,638
true this is you really shouldn't be

3662
01:59:25,118 --> 01:59:27,839
doing that

3663
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:30,960
you obviously have a much better

3664
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:34,880
intuition about physics i i tend to um

3665
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:34,880
in the space of ai for example you could

3666
01:59:35,039 --> 01:59:41,198
you could use certain kinds of language

3667
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:43,520
like calling things um intelligent

3668
01:59:41,198 --> 01:59:44,960
that could rub people the wrong way but

3669
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:47,360
i never had a problem with that kind of

3670
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:49,198
thing you know saying that a program can

3671
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:50,880
learn its way without any human

3672
01:59:49,198 --> 01:59:53,519
supervision as

3673
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:56,239
alpha zero does to play chess

3674
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:58,320
to me that

3675
01:59:56,238 --> 02:00:00,399
may not be intelligence but it's sure

3676
01:59:58,319 --> 02:00:02,960
that as heck seems like

3677
02:00:00,399 --> 02:00:05,920
a few steps down the path towards

3678
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:08,158
intelligence yeah and so like i think

3679
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:09,760
that's a very peculiar

3680
02:00:08,158 --> 02:00:12,319
uh property of systems that can be

3681
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:13,599
engineered so even if the idea is fuzzy

3682
02:00:12,319 --> 02:00:15,118
even if you're not really sure what

3683
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:16,319
intelligence is

3684
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:18,238
or um

3685
02:00:16,319 --> 02:00:19,840
like if you don't have a deep

3686
02:00:18,238 --> 02:00:22,000
fundamental understanding or even a

3687
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:24,400
model what intelligence is if you build

3688
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:27,118
a system that sure as heck is impressive

3689
02:00:24,399 --> 02:00:29,679
and showing some of the signs of what

3690
02:00:27,118 --> 02:00:31,679
previously thought impossible

3691
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:33,840
for a non-intelligent

3692
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:35,760
uh system then that's impressive and

3693
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:37,840
that's inspiring and that's okay to

3694
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:39,760
celebrate in physics

3695
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:41,679
because you're not engineering anything

3696
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:43,760
you're just now swimming in the space

3697
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:45,440
directly when you do theoretical physics

3698
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:47,039
that it could be more dangerous you

3699
02:00:45,439 --> 02:00:49,439
could be out

3700
02:00:47,039 --> 02:00:50,639
too far away from shore yeah well the

3701
02:00:49,439 --> 02:00:53,039
problem

3702
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:54,639
i think if physics is it in a i think

3703
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:57,118
it's actually hard for people even to

3704
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:58,480
believe or really understand

3705
02:00:57,118 --> 02:01:00,479
how

3706
02:00:58,479 --> 02:01:02,718
that this particular kind of physicist

3707
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:04,799
has gotten itself into a really unusual

3708
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:07,599
and strange and historically unusual

3709
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:09,279
state which is not really i mean i

3710
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:11,119
spent half my life among mathematicians

3711
02:01:09,279 --> 02:01:12,960
and athletic physicists and you know

3712
02:01:11,118 --> 02:01:15,118
mathematics is kind of doing fine people

3713
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:17,439
are making progress and it has all the

3714
02:01:15,118 --> 02:01:19,198
usual problems but also

3715
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:21,118
so you could have a

3716
02:01:19,198 --> 02:01:22,960
but but you i just i don't know i've

3717
02:01:21,118 --> 02:01:24,719
never seen anything at all happening in

3718
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:27,599
mathematics like what's happened in the

3719
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:30,079
specific area in physics it's just

3720
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:31,440
the kind of sociology of this the way

3721
02:01:30,079 --> 02:01:32,880
this field

3722
02:01:31,439 --> 02:01:35,198
works

3723
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:36,480
banging up against this harder problem

3724
02:01:35,198 --> 02:01:38,719
without

3725
02:01:36,479 --> 02:01:40,238
anything from experiment to help it it's

3726
02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:41,760
really

3727
02:01:40,238 --> 02:01:44,799
it's led to some really kind of

3728
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:46,480
problematic things and those so it's one

3729
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:48,800
thing to kind of

3730
02:01:46,479 --> 02:01:50,959
you know oversimplify or to slightly

3731
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:53,119
misrepresent to try to explain things in

3732
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:55,039
a way that's not quite right but it's

3733
02:01:53,118 --> 02:01:56,639
another thing to start promoting to

3734
02:01:55,039 --> 02:01:58,880
people

3735
02:01:56,639 --> 02:02:01,599
as a successes ideas which which really

3736
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:03,520
completely failed and um so i mean i'm

3737
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:06,400
i've kind of a very very specific

3738
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:08,000
if you so have people

3739
02:02:06,399 --> 02:02:09,679
won't name any names for instance coming

3740
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,920
on certain podcasts like you're telling

3741
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:14,800
the world you know this is a huge

3742
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:16,399
success and this is really wonderful and

3743
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:18,960
it's just not true

3744
02:02:16,399 --> 02:02:20,799
and and this is this this is really

3745
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:24,319
problematic and it carries a serious

3746
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:26,239
danger of um you know once

3747
02:02:24,319 --> 02:02:28,399
when people realize that this is what's

3748
02:02:26,238 --> 02:02:31,598
going on you know they

3749
02:02:28,399 --> 02:02:33,839
you know the the loss of credibility of

3750
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:36,880
of science is is a real real problem for

3751
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:39,279
our society and and you don't want

3752
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:40,639
you don't want people to have an all too

3753
02:02:39,279 --> 02:02:43,519
good reason to

3754
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:44,800
to think that what they're being

3755
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:46,880
what they're being told by kind of some

3756
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:49,119
of the best uh institutions in our

3757
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:50,400
country or authorities is is not true

3758
02:02:49,118 --> 02:02:52,158
you know it is

3759
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:54,000
it's not true it's a problem

3760
02:02:52,158 --> 02:02:57,598
that's it's obviously a characteristic

3761
02:02:54,000 --> 02:03:00,399
of not just physics it's uh

3762
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:01,840
it's sociology yeah

3763
02:03:00,399 --> 02:03:04,079
and it's uh i mean obviously in the

3764
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:06,319
space of politics it's the the history

3765
02:03:04,079 --> 02:03:08,238
of politics is uh

3766
02:03:06,319 --> 02:03:11,920
you um

3767
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:14,000
you you sell ideas to people

3768
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:16,158
even when you don't have any proof that

3769
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,079
those ideas actually work if you speak

3770
02:03:16,158 --> 02:03:22,238
as if they've have worked and that that

3771
02:03:18,079 --> 02:03:22,238
seems to be the case throughout history

3772
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:29,840
and just like you said it's human beings

3773
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:29,840
running up against a really hard problem

3774
02:03:30,158 --> 02:03:33,118
i'm not sure if this is like a

3775
02:03:31,359 --> 02:03:36,238
particular

3776
02:03:33,118 --> 02:03:38,079
uh like trajectory through the progress

3777
02:03:36,238 --> 02:03:39,598
of physics that we're dealing with

3778
02:03:38,079 --> 02:03:41,279
knowledge it's just the natural progress

3779
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:42,719
of science you run up against a really

3780
02:03:41,279 --> 02:03:44,719
difficult

3781
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:46,000
stage of a field

3782
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:48,158
and

3783
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,158
uh

3784
02:03:49,439 --> 02:03:52,960
different people that behave differently

3785
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:55,280
in the face of that

3786
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:56,800
some sell books and sort of

3787
02:03:55,279 --> 02:03:59,359
tell narratives that are beautiful and

3788
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:01,440
so on they're not necessarily grounded

3789
02:03:59,359 --> 02:04:02,639
in um solutions that have proven

3790
02:04:01,439 --> 02:04:04,799
themselves

3791
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:06,719
others kind of uh put their head down

3792
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:08,719
quietly keep doing the work others sort

3793
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:11,599
of pivot to different fields and that's

3794
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:13,439
kind of like yeah ants scattering and

3795
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:15,920
then you have feels like machine

3796
02:04:13,439 --> 02:04:17,439
learning which is there's a few folks

3797
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:19,920
mostly scattered away from machine

3798
02:04:17,439 --> 02:04:23,118
learning in the in the 90s in the winter

3799
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:24,960
of ai ai winter as they call it but a

3800
02:04:23,118 --> 02:04:26,238
few people kept their head down and now

3801
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:28,000
they're called the fathers of deep

3802
02:04:26,238 --> 02:04:30,399
learning yeah

3803
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,279
and and they didn't think of it that way

3804
02:04:30,399 --> 02:04:32,799
um

3805
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:34,078
and in fact if there's another yeah i

3806
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:36,719
went to they'll just probably keep

3807
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:37,679
working on it anyway sort of like loyal

3808
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:39,198
ants

3809
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:40,319
to a particular

3810
02:04:39,198 --> 02:04:42,238
sure yeah

3811
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:44,238
so it's it's it's interesting but you're

3812
02:04:42,238 --> 02:04:46,479
sort of saying that um

3813
02:04:44,238 --> 02:04:48,319
we should be careful over hyping things

3814
02:04:46,479 --> 02:04:50,000
that have not proven themselves

3815
02:04:48,319 --> 02:04:51,359
because people will

3816
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:54,960
lose

3817
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:57,279
trust in the scientific process yeah but

3818
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:59,118
unfortunately there's been other

3819
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:01,279
ways in which people have lost trust in

3820
02:04:59,118 --> 02:05:02,719
the scientific process that ultimately

3821
02:05:01,279 --> 02:05:04,960
has to do actually with all the same

3822
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:06,399
kind of behavior as you're highlighting

3823
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:08,480
which is

3824
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:09,759
not being honest and transparent about

3825
02:05:08,479 --> 02:05:11,919
the flaws

3826
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:14,079
of mistakes of the past yeah i mean

3827
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:15,920
that's always a problem but um this

3828
02:05:14,078 --> 02:05:17,359
particular field is kind of fun mostly

3829
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:19,279
it it's a

3830
02:05:17,359 --> 02:05:21,279
it's always a strange one i mean i think

3831
02:05:19,279 --> 02:05:22,960
in the sense that

3832
02:05:21,279 --> 02:05:24,559
there's a lot of public fascination with

3833
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:26,960
it that it seems to speak to kind of our

3834
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:28,639
deepest questions about you know

3835
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:30,399
what is this physical reality where do

3836
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:32,319
we come from and what and these kind of

3837
02:05:30,399 --> 02:05:34,399
deep issues so there's there's this

3838
02:05:32,319 --> 02:05:36,158
unusual fascination with it mathematics

3839
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:38,078
is versus very different nobody nobody's

3840
02:05:36,158 --> 02:05:39,759
that interested in mathematics nobody

3841
02:05:38,078 --> 02:05:41,439
really kind of expects to

3842
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:42,480
learn really great

3843
02:05:41,439 --> 02:05:43,919
deep things about the world from

3844
02:05:42,479 --> 02:05:45,759
mathematics that much they don't ask

3845
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:48,560
mathematicians that so

3846
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:51,039
so so it's a very unusual it it draws

3847
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:53,599
this kind of unusual amount of attention

3848
02:05:51,039 --> 02:05:55,920
and it really is historically in a

3849
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:57,440
really unusual state it's kind of it's

3850
02:05:55,920 --> 02:06:00,078
gotten itself

3851
02:05:57,439 --> 02:06:03,439
way kind of down uh

3852
02:06:00,078 --> 02:06:05,279
down a blind alley in in in a way which

3853
02:06:03,439 --> 02:06:07,759
it it's hard to find other historical

3854
02:06:05,279 --> 02:06:10,559
parallels but sort of push back a little

3855
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:14,079
bit there's power to inspiring people

3856
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:15,520
and if i just empirically look

3857
02:06:14,078 --> 02:06:17,840
physicists

3858
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:19,280
are really good

3859
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:21,119
at

3860
02:06:19,279 --> 02:06:23,279
um combining

3861
02:06:21,118 --> 02:06:24,880
science and philosophy

3862
02:06:23,279 --> 02:06:26,479
and communicating it like there's

3863
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:28,800
something about physics often that

3864
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:30,799
forces you to build a strong intuition

3865
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:32,719
about the way reality works

3866
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:33,760
right and that allows you to think

3867
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:36,639
through

3868
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:38,639
sort of and communicate about all kinds

3869
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:40,480
of questions like if you see physicists

3870
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:42,000
it's always fascinating to take on

3871
02:06:40,479 --> 02:06:44,319
problems that have nothing to do with

3872
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,078
their particular discipline they think

3873
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:47,599
interest in interesting ways and they're

3874
02:06:46,078 --> 02:06:50,559
able to communicate their thinking

3875
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:52,719
interesting ways and so in some sense

3876
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:55,360
they have a responsibility not just to

3877
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:56,880
do science but to inspire

3878
02:06:55,359 --> 02:07:00,158
and not responsibility but the

3879
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:02,480
opportunity and thereby i would say

3880
02:07:00,158 --> 02:07:04,879
a little bit of a responsibility

3881
02:07:02,479 --> 02:07:06,959
yeah yeah and sometimes but um i know

3882
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:09,520
anyway it's hard to say because because

3883
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:10,880
different um there's many many people

3884
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,800
doing this kind of thing with different

3885
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:14,800
degrees of

3886
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:18,320
of success and

3887
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:20,239
whatever i i guess one thing um

3888
02:07:18,319 --> 02:07:21,679
but but i mean my what's kind of front

3889
02:07:20,238 --> 02:07:25,598
and center for me is kind of a more

3890
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:25,599
parochial interest is just kind of what

3891
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:29,039
what damage do you do to the subject

3892
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,198
itself

3893
02:07:29,039 --> 02:07:32,560
ignoring

3894
02:07:31,198 --> 02:07:33,839
misrepresenting you know what high

3895
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:36,079
school students think about string

3896
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:39,279
theory and not that doesn't matter much

3897
02:07:36,078 --> 02:07:41,039
but but what the smartest

3898
02:07:39,279 --> 02:07:43,279
undergraduates or the smartest graduate

3899
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:45,118
students in the world think about it and

3900
02:07:43,279 --> 02:07:47,679
what paths you're leading them down and

3901
02:07:45,118 --> 02:07:49,679
what story you're telling them and what

3902
02:07:47,679 --> 02:07:51,840
textbooks you're making them read and

3903
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:53,840
what they're hearing and um and so a lot

3904
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:55,440
of what's motivated me is more to try to

3905
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:57,520
speak to

3906
02:07:55,439 --> 02:07:59,279
as kind of a specific population of

3907
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:01,520
people to make sure that look you know

3908
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:03,599
people

3909
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:05,599
it doesn't matter so much what the

3910
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:07,119
rest of what the average person on the

3911
02:08:05,599 --> 02:08:09,039
street thinks about string theory but

3912
02:08:07,118 --> 02:08:10,960
you know what

3913
02:08:09,039 --> 02:08:12,560
what what what the best students at

3914
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:14,158
columbia or harvard or princeton or

3915
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:15,840
whatever who are who really want to

3916
02:08:14,158 --> 02:08:18,319
change work in this field and want to

3917
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:19,440
work that way what what they know about

3918
02:08:18,319 --> 02:08:21,439
it what they think about it and that

3919
02:08:19,439 --> 02:08:23,359
they not be go into the field being

3920
02:08:21,439 --> 02:08:24,960
misled and believing that a certain

3921
02:08:23,359 --> 02:08:27,920
story this is where this is all going

3922
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:30,078
this is what i got to do um is it is

3923
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:32,880
that's important to me well in general

3924
02:08:30,078 --> 02:08:34,158
for graduate students for uh people who

3925
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,400
seek to be experts in the field

3926
02:08:34,158 --> 02:08:40,158
diversity of ideas is really powerful

3927
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:42,078
and is getting into this local pocket of

3928
02:08:40,158 --> 02:08:44,799
ideas that people hold on to for several

3929
02:08:42,078 --> 02:08:46,399
decades is not good no matter what idea

3930
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:47,760
i would say no matter if the idea is

3931
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:50,238
right or wrong

3932
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:54,159
because there's no such thing as right

3933
02:08:50,238 --> 02:08:56,319
in the long term like it's right for now

3934
02:08:54,158 --> 02:08:58,158
until somebody builds on

3935
02:08:56,319 --> 02:09:01,118
something much bigger on top of it it

3936
02:08:58,158 --> 02:09:03,439
might end up being ripe but being a a

3937
02:09:01,118 --> 02:09:05,279
tiny subset of a much bigger thing

3938
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:07,359
so there you always should question sort

3939
02:09:05,279 --> 02:09:10,158
of the uh the ways of the past

3940
02:09:07,359 --> 02:09:11,679
yeah yeah so so how to kind of achieve

3941
02:09:10,158 --> 02:09:14,000
that kind of

3942
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:16,319
diversity of thought and uh within kind

3943
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,760
of the sociology of how we organize

3944
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:18,960
scientific research researches i know

3945
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:21,039
this is one thing that i think it's very

3946
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:22,880
interesting that uh sabine hassenfelder

3947
02:09:21,039 --> 02:09:24,960
is very it's interesting things to say

3948
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:26,960
about it and i think also at least mohan

3949
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:28,560
in his book which is also about that

3950
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:30,000
very

3951
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:32,480
very much in agreement with them that

3952
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,840
there's

3953
02:09:32,479 --> 02:09:36,158
anyway there's a really kind of

3954
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:38,800
important

3955
02:09:36,158 --> 02:09:40,879
questions about you know how

3956
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:42,800
how how research in this field is

3957
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:43,599
organized and how people

3958
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:45,360
you know

3959
02:09:43,599 --> 02:09:46,800
what can you do to kind of get and get

3960
02:09:45,359 --> 02:09:49,439
more diversity of thought and get more

3961
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:52,880
to and get people thinking about um

3962
02:09:49,439 --> 02:09:52,879
about a wider range of ideas

3963
02:09:53,039 --> 02:09:57,118
at the bottom i think humility always

3964
02:09:55,279 --> 02:09:58,158
helps

3965
02:09:57,118 --> 02:10:00,000
well

3966
02:09:58,158 --> 02:10:01,920
but the problem is that it's also it's a

3967
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,679
combination of humility to know when

3968
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:05,760
when you're wrong and also

3969
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:07,520
but also you have to have a you have to

3970
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:08,880
have a certain very serious lack of

3971
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:11,119
humility to believe that you're going to

3972
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:13,118
make progress on some of these problems

3973
02:10:11,118 --> 02:10:17,279
i think you have to have like both modes

3974
02:10:13,118 --> 02:10:17,279
and switch between them when needed

3975
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:21,118
let me ask you a question you're

3976
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:23,199
probably not going to want to answer

3977
02:10:21,118 --> 02:10:24,799
because uh

3978
02:10:23,198 --> 02:10:26,799
you're focused on the mathematics of

3979
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:28,400
things and mathematics can't answer the

3980
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:30,480
why questions but

3981
02:10:28,399 --> 02:10:31,759
let me ask you anyway

3982
02:10:30,479 --> 02:10:33,198
do you think there's meaning to this

3983
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:34,960
whole thing

3984
02:10:33,198 --> 02:10:36,719
what do you think is the meaning of life

3985
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:38,480
why are we here

3986
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:41,359
i don't i don't know yeah i

3987
02:10:38,479 --> 02:10:42,399
was thinking about this so the um

3988
02:10:41,359 --> 02:10:44,559
it did occur

3989
02:10:42,399 --> 02:10:46,158
one interesting

3990
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:49,599
thing about that question is that you

3991
02:10:46,158 --> 02:10:51,359
don't you know so i have

3992
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:53,679
this life in mathematics and this life

3993
02:10:51,359 --> 02:10:55,759
in physics and and i see

3994
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:58,000
some of my physicist colleagues you know

3995
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:59,599
kind of

3996
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,719
seem to be people are often asking them

3997
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:02,159
what's the meaning of life and they're

3998
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:03,439
writing books about the meaning of life

3999
02:11:02,158 --> 02:11:04,479
and teaching courses about the meaning

4000
02:11:03,439 --> 02:11:06,158
of life and

4001
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:08,799
but then i realized that no one ever

4002
02:11:06,158 --> 02:11:10,719
asked my mathematician colleagues

4003
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:11,560
nobody ever asks mathematicians yeah

4004
02:11:10,719 --> 02:11:13,198
that's funny so

4005
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:13,920
[Laughter]

4006
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:15,198
yeah

4007
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:16,239
everybody just kind of assumes okay well

4008
02:11:15,198 --> 02:11:18,399
you people are studying about that

4009
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:19,759
actually whatever you're doing it's

4010
02:11:18,399 --> 02:11:21,039
maybe very interesting but it's clearly

4011
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:23,119
not going to tell me anything useful

4012
02:11:21,039 --> 02:11:25,599
about the meaning of my life and i'm

4013
02:11:23,118 --> 02:11:27,679
afraid a lot of my point of view is that

4014
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:28,560
if people realized how little difference

4015
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:30,000
there was between what the

4016
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:31,119
mathematicians are doing and what a lot

4017
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,039
of these theoretical physicists are

4018
02:11:31,118 --> 02:11:34,000
doing they would they might understand

4019
02:11:33,039 --> 02:11:37,439
that

4020
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,880
it's a bit misguided to look for

4021
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:40,479
deep insight into the meaning of life

4022
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:42,639
from from

4023
02:11:40,479 --> 02:11:43,598
from many theoretical physicists it's

4024
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:45,039
not uh

4025
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:46,159
they you know they're they're people

4026
02:11:45,039 --> 02:11:47,519
they have they may have interesting

4027
02:11:46,158 --> 02:11:49,439
things to say about this you're right

4028
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:51,440
they have they know a lot about physical

4029
02:11:49,439 --> 02:11:52,399
reality and about

4030
02:11:51,439 --> 02:11:54,158
about

4031
02:11:52,399 --> 02:11:55,039
and sometimes about metaphysics about

4032
02:11:54,158 --> 02:11:59,118
what

4033
02:11:55,039 --> 02:11:59,118
is is real of this kind but um

4034
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:02,960
you're also

4035
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:04,400
to my mind i think you're also making a

4036
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:06,399
bit of a mistake that you're you're

4037
02:12:04,399 --> 02:12:08,238
looking to uh

4038
02:12:06,399 --> 02:12:10,000
i mean i'm very very aware that you know

4039
02:12:08,238 --> 02:12:11,839
i've led a very

4040
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,118
pleasant and fairly privileged existence

4041
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:14,719
of a fairly

4042
02:12:13,118 --> 02:12:18,479
without many challenges of different

4043
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:20,880
kinds of a certain kind and and um

4044
02:12:18,479 --> 02:12:22,319
i i'm really not in no way the kind of

4045
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:24,400
person that

4046
02:12:22,319 --> 02:12:26,158
a lot of people who are looking for to

4047
02:12:24,399 --> 02:12:28,000
try and understand

4048
02:12:26,158 --> 02:12:29,359
in some meaning of life in the sense of

4049
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,920
the challenges that they're facing in

4050
02:12:29,359 --> 02:12:33,519
life uh i can't really i'm really the

4051
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:35,039
wrong person for you to be asking about

4052
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:38,079
this well

4053
02:12:35,039 --> 02:12:40,078
if struggle is somehow a thing that's

4054
02:12:38,078 --> 02:12:42,319
core to meaning yeah perhaps

4055
02:12:40,078 --> 02:12:43,359
mathematicians are just quality the ones

4056
02:12:42,319 --> 02:12:45,279
who are

4057
02:12:43,359 --> 02:12:48,238
most equipped to answer that question if

4058
02:12:45,279 --> 02:12:50,880
in fact the creation or at least

4059
02:12:48,238 --> 02:12:52,319
experiencing beauty

4060
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:53,279
is uh

4061
02:12:52,319 --> 02:12:55,679
is

4062
02:12:53,279 --> 02:12:58,559
is at the core of the meaning of life

4063
02:12:55,679 --> 02:13:00,399
because it seems like mathematics is the

4064
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:03,520
methodology but which you can most

4065
02:13:00,399 --> 02:13:05,118
purely explore beautiful things

4066
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:06,960
right yeah

4067
02:13:05,118 --> 02:13:08,799
so in some sense maybe we should talk to

4068
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:11,679
mathematicians more

4069
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:13,360
yeah yeah maybe but but the uh

4070
02:13:11,679 --> 02:13:15,760
unfortunately you know people do have a

4071
02:13:13,359 --> 02:13:16,880
somewhat correct perception that what

4072
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:18,880
these people are doing every day

4073
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:21,199
whatever is is pretty far removed from

4074
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:21,199
anything

4075
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:25,039
yeah from from what's kind of close to

4076
02:13:24,078 --> 02:13:27,198
what i'm

4077
02:13:25,039 --> 02:13:28,960
what i do every day and what my typical

4078
02:13:27,198 --> 02:13:30,158
concerns are so you may learn something

4079
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:32,639
very interesting by talking to

4080
02:13:30,158 --> 02:13:33,920
mathematicians but it's uh

4081
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:35,118
it's probably not going to be you're

4082
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:36,880
probably not going to get what you were

4083
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:39,359
hoping

4084
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:41,279
so when you put the pen and paper down

4085
02:13:39,359 --> 02:13:42,399
and you're not thinking about physics

4086
02:13:41,279 --> 02:13:44,319
and you're not thinking about

4087
02:13:42,399 --> 02:13:46,879
mathematics and you just get to breathe

4088
02:13:44,319 --> 02:13:49,118
in the air and look around you and

4089
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:52,319
realize that you're going to die one day

4090
02:13:49,118 --> 02:13:55,759
you know you think about that

4091
02:13:52,319 --> 02:13:57,039
um your ideas will live on but you the

4092
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:58,639
human

4093
02:13:57,039 --> 02:14:00,800
not not especially much but certainly

4094
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:02,639
i've been getting getting older i'm now

4095
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:03,599
64 years old you start to realize well

4096
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:05,039
there's

4097
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:07,520
probably less ahead than there was

4098
02:14:05,039 --> 02:14:09,519
behind and so you start to

4099
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:10,880
that starts to become you know wait what

4100
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:12,639
do i think about that maybe i should

4101
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:14,000
actually

4102
02:14:12,639 --> 02:14:15,760
get serious about some getting some

4103
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,279
things done which i

4104
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:19,679
which i may not have which i may

4105
02:14:17,279 --> 02:14:20,960
otherwise not have time to do which i

4106
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:23,199
didn't see this didn't seem to be a

4107
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:24,639
problem when i was younger but um

4108
02:14:23,198 --> 02:14:26,638
that's the main i think the main way in

4109
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:29,118
which that thought occurs

4110
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:32,000
but it doesn't uh you know the stoics

4111
02:14:29,118 --> 02:14:33,359
are big on this meditating on mortality

4112
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,399
helps you

4113
02:14:33,359 --> 02:14:39,359
more intensely appreciate the beauty

4114
02:14:36,399 --> 02:14:41,439
when you do experience it

4115
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:42,960
i suppose that's true but it's not yeah

4116
02:14:41,439 --> 02:14:44,479
it's not

4117
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:47,118
not something i've spent

4118
02:14:44,479 --> 02:14:49,039
a lot of time trying but um but yeah

4119
02:14:47,118 --> 02:14:51,279
day to day you just enjoy the positive

4120
02:14:49,039 --> 02:14:53,599
mathematics just enjoy yeah or

4121
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:54,559
our life in general life is

4122
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:56,880
have a

4123
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:58,320
perfectly pleasant life and enjoy enjoy

4124
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:00,400
it and

4125
02:14:58,319 --> 02:15:01,439
often think wow this is i think things

4126
02:15:00,399 --> 02:15:02,799
are

4127
02:15:01,439 --> 02:15:04,158

and now let me leave you some words from

4144
02:15:34,158 --> 02:15:40,078
richard feynman the first principle is

4145
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:41,199
that you must not fool yourself

4146
02:15:40,078 --> 02:15:43,920
and you

4147
02:15:41,198 --> 02:15:45,759
are the easiest person to fool

4148
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:49,639
thank you for listening and hope to see

4149
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:49,639
