we'll get there we'll get there

23
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,119
yeah it's gotten soft

24
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,000
allow me to say that the spacex launch

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
of human beings to orbit on may 30th

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
2020

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,280
was seen by many as the first step in a

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,359
new era of human space exploration

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,519
these human space flight missions were a

30
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,438
beacon of hope to me and to millions

31
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,039
over the past two years is our world has

32
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,559
been going through one of the most

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,920
difficult periods in recent human

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,799
history

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,560
we saw we see the rise of division fear

36
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,600
cynicism and the loss of common humanity

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,439
right when it is needed most so first

38
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,118
elon let me say thank you for giving the

39
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,118
world hope and reason to be excited

40
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,078
about the future oh it's kind of you to

41
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,118
say it

42
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:40,158
i do want to do that humanity has uh

43
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:42,478
obviously a lot of issues and and uh you

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,280
know people at times do do bad things

45
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,159
but

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,640
you know

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,040
despite all that um you know i love

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,960
humanity and i think we should

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,479
uh

50
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,000
make sure we do everything we can to

51
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,319
have a good future and an exciting

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,159
future and one where that maximizes the

53
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:00,879
happiness of the people

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,799
let me ask about uh crew dragon demo two

55
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,239
so that that first flight with humans on

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,680
board

57
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,079
how did you feel leading up to that

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,319
launch were you scared are you excited

59
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,959
what's going through your mind so much

60
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,958
was at stake

61
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,119
yeah no that was extremely stressful no

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,959
question

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,840
we obviously could not

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,840
um

65
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
let them down in any way um so

66
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,519
extremely stressful i'd say

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,480
uh to say the least

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,159
but we did

69
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,000
i was confident that at the time that we

70
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,799
launched that

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,360
no one could think of anything

72
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,439
at all to do that would improve the

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,400
probability of success

74
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,680
um and we we racked our brains to think

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,120
of any possible way to improve the

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,599
probability of success we could not

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,840
think of anything more and and nor could

78
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,959
nasa and

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,598
so then that that's just the best that

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,598
we could do so then we we had

81
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,238
we went ahead and launched

82
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,878
now i'm not a religious person

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,680
um but i nonetheless got on my knees and

84
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,759
prayed for that mission

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,439
you able to sleep

86
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,039
no

87
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,120
how did it feel

88
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,039
when it was a success first when the

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,719
launch was a success and when they

90
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:19,840
returned back home or back to earth

91
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,840
it was a great relief

92
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,840
yeah

93
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,479
it's for high stress situations i find

94
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,400
it's not so much elation as relief

95
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,679
um

96
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
and um

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,360
you know i think once

98
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,359
as as we we got more comfortable and

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,360
improved out the systems because you

100
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
know we really

101
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,519
um

102
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,878
you know you got to make sure everything

103
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,560
works um

104
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,639
i was it was definitely a lot more

105
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,400
enjoyable with the subsequent uh

106
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,639
astronaut uh missions

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,560
and i thought the

108
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,639
the inspiration mission was was actually

109
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,039
very inspiring um the inspiration for

110
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,839
mission um i'd encourage people to watch

111
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,598
the

112
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,959
inspiration documentary on netflix it's

113
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,560
actually really good um and it really

114
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,560
isn't so i i was actually inspired by

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,719
that um and i i i so that one i felt i i

116
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,239
was kind of able to enjoy the the actual

117
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,639
mission and not just be super stressed

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,599
all the time so for people that somehow

119
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,399
don't know it's the all civilian first

120
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,199
time

121
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,000
all civilian out to space out to orbit

122
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,960
yeah it was the high i think the highest

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,720
orbit that uh in like under 30 or 40

124
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,680
years or something the only one that was

125
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,639
higher

126
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,079
was the one shuttle sorry a hubble uh

127
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,519
servicing mission

128
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,599
um and then before that it would have

129
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,039
been um apollo in 72.

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,280
it's pretty wild

131
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,600
so it's cool it's good you know i think

132
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,679
uh as you know

133
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
as a species like we want to be

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
you know continuing to

135
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,919
do better and and reach higher ground

136
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,639
and and like i think it would be tragic

137
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,879
extremely tragic if um apollo was the

138
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,240
high water mark for humanity you know

139
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,000
and that then that's as far as we ever

140
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,000
got

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,439
and it's um

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,680
it's concerning that here we are um

143
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,759
49 years after the last mission to the

144
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
moon

145
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,000
it's almost half a century

146
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,520
uh and we've not been back

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,439
um and that's

148
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,719
that's worrying it's like is that

149
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,879
does that mean

150
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,560
we've peaked as a civilization or what

151
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,000
so

152
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,319
like i think we got to get back to the

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,839
moon and build a base there you know a

154
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,759
science base i think we could learn a

155
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,198
lot about the nature of the universe if

156
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,000
we have a proper science base on the

157
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,478
moon

158
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,639
um you know like we have a science based

159
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,879
in antarctica and you know many other

160
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,960
parts of the world and

161
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,439
um so that that that's like i think the

162
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,159
next big thing we've got to have like a

163
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,478
serious like moon base um and then get

164
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
people to mars and

165
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,399
you know get get out there and

166
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,399
be a space bearing civilization

167
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,959
i'll ask you about some of those details

168
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,478
but since you're so busy with the hard

169
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,318
engineering challenges

170
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:01,680
of everything that's involved

171
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,319
are you still able to marvel at the

172
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,759
magic of it all of space travel

173
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,919
of every time the rocket goes up

174
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,560
especially when it's a crude mission

175
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,839
or you're just so overwhelmed with the

176
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,360
all the challenges that you have to

177
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,079
solve

178
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,759
and actually sort of to add to that

179
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:20,879
the reason i want to ask this question

180
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,400
of may 30th it's it's been some time so

181
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,879
you can look back and think about the

182
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,439
impact already it's already at the time

183
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,360
it was an engineering problem maybe now

184
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,800
it's becoming a historic moment like

185
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,080
it's a moment that

186
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,520
how many moments would be remembered

187
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,359
about the 21st century to me

188
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,198
that or something like that maybe

189
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,199
inspiration for one of those would be

190
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,080
remembered as the early steps of a new

191
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,478
age of uh space exploration

192
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,560
yeah i mean during the launches itself

193
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,918
so i mean i think i think maybe some

194
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,038
people know but a lot of people don't

195
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:52,799
know it's like i'm actually the chief

196
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,759
engineer of spacex so

197
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,639
um

198
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,560
the

199
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
you know i've signed off on pretty much

200
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,000
all the design decisions

201
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,560
um and

202
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,959
you know so if there's something that

203
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,720
goes wrong with that

204
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,918
vehicle it's it's fundamentally my fault

205
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,680
you know so

206
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,719
um

207
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,639
so i'm really just thinking

208
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,000
about all the things that like so so

209
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,360
when i see the rocket i see all the

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,439
things that could go wrong and the

211
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,639
things that could be better and the same

212
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,399
with the dragon spacecraft it's like

213
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,160
other people say oh this is a

214
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,839
spacecraft or a rocket and this looks

215
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,919
really cool i'm like

216
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,359
i've like a readout of like this is the

217
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,120
these are these are the risks these are

218
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,120
the pro the problems that's what i see

219
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,199
so it's

220
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,439
not what other people see when they see

221
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,199
the product you know so let me uh ask

222
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,759
you then to analyze starship in that

223
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,000
same way i know you have you'll talk

224
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,240
about in more detail about starship in

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,639
the near future perhaps yeah talk about

226
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,960
it now if you want um but just in that

227
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,560
same way like you said you see when you

228
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,079
see up

229
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,160
when you see a rocket you see a sort of

230
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,839
a list of risks in that same way you

231
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,199
said that starship is a really hard

232
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,318
problem

233
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,560
so there's many ways i can ask this but

234
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,560
if you magically could solve one problem

235
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,000
perfectly one engineering problem

236
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,478
perfectly which one would it be on sasha

237
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,720
on sorry on starship so is it maybe

238
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,478
related to the efficiency the

239
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,919
uh the engine the weight of the

240
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,159
different components the complexity of

241
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,878
various things maybe the controls of the

242
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,759
the crazy thing has to do to land no

243
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,399
it's actually the by far the the biggest

244
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,038
thing absorbing my time is uh

245
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,000
uh engine production

246
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:40,879
not not the design of the engine but

247
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,559
i've often said prototypes are

248
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,559
are easy production is hard

249
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,559
so

250
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,080
we have the most advanced rocket engine

251
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,000
that's ever been designed um

252
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,639
the because i say currently the the best

253
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,159
rocket engine ever is probably the rd

254
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,480
180 or rd-170 the um

255
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,600
that that's the russian engine basically

256
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,720
um

257
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,399
and um

258
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,080
and still i think an engine should only

259
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,879
count if it's gotten something to orbit

260
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,040
um

261
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,159
so our engine has not gotten anything to

262
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,480
orbit yet

263
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,559
um but it is it's the first engine

264
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,278
that's actually

265
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,958
better than than the the

266
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,480
russian rd engines which are

267
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,000
amazing design

268
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,080
so you're talking about raptor engine

269
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,320
what makes it amazing what what are the

270
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,480
different aspects of it that

271
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,640
make it like what are you the most

272
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,600
excited about uh if the whole thing

273
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,439
works

274
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,959
in terms of efficiency all those kinds

275
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,240
of things

276
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,079
well it's

277
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,519
the raptor is a

278
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,600
a full flow

279
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,759
uh staged combustion

280
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,680
um

281
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,519
engine and it's

282
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,719
operating at a very high chamber

283
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,360
pressure

284
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,000
so one of the key figures america

285
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
perhaps the key figure of merit is

286
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,879
um

287
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,039
what is the chamber pressure at which

288
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,879
the rocket engine can operate that's the

289
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,799
combustion chamber pressure

290
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,600
so a raptor is

291
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:11,919
designed to operate at 300 bar possibly

292
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,360
maybe higher that's 300 atmospheres so

293
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,360
um

294
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,200
the record right now for operational

295
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,879
engine is the rd engine that i mentioned

296
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
the russian rd which is i believe around

297
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,480
267

298
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,958
bar

299
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,720
and the the the difficulty of the

300
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,799
chamber pressure is increases on a

301
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,320
non-linear basis so

302
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,759
10 more

303
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,120
pressure is

304
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,159
more like uh

305
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,759
50

306
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,799
more difficult

307
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,879
um

308
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,799
but that that chain of pressure is that

309
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:44,240
that is what allows you to get a very

310
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:47,199
high uh power density

311
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,919
for the engine um so

312
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,200
uh enabling um

313
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,078
a very high thrust to weight ratio

314
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,879
and

315
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,958
a very high specific impulse

316
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,519
so specific impulse is like a measure of

317
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,518
the efficiency of a rocket engine or um

318
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,679
it's really the the

319
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,759
the uh

320
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,479
exhaust the effective exhaust velocity

321
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,720
of of the gas coming out of the engine

322
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,278
um

323
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,278
so uh

324
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:19,519
with a very high chamber pressure you

325
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,320
can have um

326
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,639
a

327
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,640
a compact engine that nonetheless has a

328
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,600
high expansion ratio which is the ratio

329
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,039
between the uh

330
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
exit nozzle

331
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,958
uh and the uh

332
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,240
throat so you know engine's got like you

333
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,399
see a rocket just got like sort of like

334
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,159
about like a hourglass shape it's like a

335
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,399
chamber and then it next down and

336
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,679
there's a nozzle and the ratio of the

337
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,799
the exit diameter to the

338
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,958
throat

339
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,799
expansion ratio so why is it such a hard

340
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,039
engine to manufacture

341
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,879
at scale

342
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,879
uh it's very complex

343
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,559
so a lot of what does complexity mean

344
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,639
here's a lot of components involved

345
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,000
there's a lot of a lot of components and

346
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,240
a lot of

347
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,360
uh unique materials

348
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,079
that so we had to invent a

349
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,639
several alloys that don't exist in order

350
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,439
to make this engine work

351
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,320
um

352
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,320
materials problem too

353
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,320
it's a materials problem and um it is in

354
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,320
a staged combustion a full flow stage

355
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,040
combustion there there are many uh

356
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,720
feedback loops in the system so

357
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,480
you uh

358
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,360
basically you've got

359
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,680
uh

360
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,200
propellant and and and uh hot gas

361
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,799
flowing

362
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,480
um

363
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,039
simultaneously to so many different

364
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,120
places on the engine

365
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,958
and

366
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,799
they all have a recursive effect on each

367
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,239
other so you change one thing here it

368
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,958
has a recursive effect here it changes

369
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,320
something over there and and it's

370
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,638
it's it's quite

371
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,920
hard to control um

372
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,159
like there's a reason no one's made this

373
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,199
before um

374
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,639
but

375
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,600
um

376
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,519
and the reason we're doing um a

377
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,639
stage combustion uh

378
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,360
full flow

379
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,639
is because it it has the highest uh the

380
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,600
highest uh

381
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,639
theoretical possible uh efficiency

382
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,839
um

383
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,120
so

384
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,160
in in in order to make a fully reusable

385
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
rocket

386
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,838
um

387
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,278
which that's the really the holy grail

388
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,720
of orbital rocketry um

389
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:28,320
you have to have

390
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,320
everything's got to be the best uh it's

391
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,360
got to be the best engine the best

392
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,320
airframe the best heat shield um

393
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,759
extremely light uh avionics

394
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,240
um

395
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:43,278
you know very clever control mechanisms

396
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,240
um you've got to shed mass in in any

397
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,759
possible way that you can um for example

398
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,278
instead of putting landing legs on the

399
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,439
booster and chip we are going to catch

400
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,720
them with a tower to save the weight of

401
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,959
the landing lens

402
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,160
legs so that's like

403
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,159
i mean

404
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,799
we're talking about catching

405
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:03,120
the largest flying object ever made

406
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,519
uh with

407
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,399
on a giant tower with with chopstick

408
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,720
arms

409
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,278
it's like karate kid with the fly but

410
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,278
much bigger

411
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:17,120
i mean pulling this probably

412
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,958
won't work the first time

413
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,879
uh and anyway so this is bananas this is

414
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:24,319
banana stuff so you mentioned that you

415
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,320
doubt well not you doubt but there

416
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,240
there's days or moments when you doubt

417
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,720
that this is even possible

418
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,959
it's so difficult the possible part is

419
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,959
well at this point

420
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,919
we'll i think we will get starship to

421
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,239
work

422
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,240
um

423
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,278
um there's a question of timing how long

424
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,639
will it take us to do this

425
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,320
how long will it take us to actually

426
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,159
achieve a full and rapid reusability

427
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,320
because it will take probably many

428
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,439
launches before we are able to have full

429
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,160
and rapid reusability

430
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:05,440
but i can't say that that the physics

431
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:07,120
pencils out like the like we're not uh

432
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,880
like at this point i'd say we're

433
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,000
confident that that

434
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,480
like let's say

435
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,440
i'm very confident success is in the set

436
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,440
of all possible outcomes

437
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,000
for a while there i was not convinced

438
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,680
that success was in the set of possible

439
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,679
outcomes

440
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:27,838
which is very important actually

441
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,838
but so um

442
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,799
saying there's a chance i'm saying

443
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,800
there's a chance exactly um

444
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,000
uh just not sure how

445
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,000
how how

446
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,600
long it will take uh

447
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
we're very very talented team they're

448
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,360
working night and day to make it happen

449
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,278
um

450
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,639
and uh

451
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,399
and like like i said the the the

452
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,680
critical thing to achieve for the

453
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,278
revolution in space flight and for

454
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,039
humanity to be a space frank

455
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:56,320
civilization is to have a fully and

456
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:58,639
rapidly reusable rocket oval rocket

457
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,240
there's not even been any orbital rocket

458
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,079
that's been fully reusable ever and this

459
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,000
has always been the

460
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,958
the the holy grail of rocketry

461
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,600
and

462
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,599
many smart people very smart people

463
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,759
have tried to do this before and have

464
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,879
not succeeded so

465
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,039
um because it's such a hard problem

466
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,039
what's your source of belief

467
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,719
in situations like this

468
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,519
when the engineering problem is so

469
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,000
difficult there's a lot of experts

470
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,000
many of whom you admire who have failed

471
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,440
in the past yes

472
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,720
and

473
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,880
um

474
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,079
a lot of people

475
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,000
you know

476
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,359
a lot of experts maybe journalists all

477
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,440
the kind of you know the public in

478
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,519
general have a lot of doubt about

479
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,000
whether it's possible

480
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,560
and you yourself know that even if it's

481
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,039
a non-null set not empty set

482
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,599
of success it's still unlikely or very

483
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,039
difficult like where do you go to both

484
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,440
personally

485
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,799
um intellectually as an engineer as a

486
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,959
team

487
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:03,439
like for source of strength needed to

488
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:05,198
sort of persevere through this

489
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,439
and to keep going with the project take

490
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,439
it to completion

491
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,240
a source of strength hmm i i just really

492
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,439
not how i think about things

493
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,120
um

494
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,880
i mean for me it's simply this this is

495
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,000
something that is important to get done

496
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,039
um

497
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,480
and we we should just keep doing it um

498
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:33,440
or die trying

499
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,798
and i

500
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,200
i don't need

501
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,879
a source of strength so quitting is not

502
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,840
even like um

503
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,120
that's not it's not my nature okay and i

504
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,159
i don't

505
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:48,000
care about optimism or pessimism

506
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,480
[ __ ] that we're gonna get it done gonna

507
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
get it done

508
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,400
can you uh then zoom back in to specific

509
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,240
problems with starship or any

510
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,320
engineering problems you work on

511
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,160
can you try to introspect your

512
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,240
particular biological neural network

513
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,279
your thinking process and describe how

514
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
you think

515
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,240
through problems the different

516
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,480
engineering and design problems is there

517
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,079
like a systematic process you've spoken

518
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,720
about first principles thinking but is

519
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,720
there kind of a process to it well um

520
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,839
you know like saying like like physics

521
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,280
is law and everything else is a

522
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,639
recommendation

523
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,558
um like i've met a lot of people who can

524
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,840
break the law but i haven't met anyone

525
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:31,599
who could break physics

526
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:33,678
so uh so first for you know any kind of

527
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,599
technology problem you have to sort of

528
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,038
just make sure you're not

529
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,159
violating

530
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,160
physics um

531
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,038
and you know uh

532
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,038
first principles analysis i think is

533
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,440
something that can be applied to

534
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,960
really any walk of life uh any anything

535
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,640
really it's just it's it's really just

536
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,558
saying um

537
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,640
you know let's let's well something down

538
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,599
to the most fundamental

539
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,600
uh

540
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,439
principles the things that we are most

541
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,319
confident are true at a foundational

542
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,840
level

543
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:05,918
and that sets you at your sets your

544
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,399
axiomatic base and then you reason up

545
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,720
from there and then you cross-check your

546
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,400
conclusion against the the axiomatic

547
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,600
truths

548
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,519
um

549
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,678
so

550
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,038
um you know some basics in physics would

551
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,720
be like are you violating conservation

552
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,798
of energy or momentum or something like

553
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,480
that you know then

554
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:25,679
it's not gonna work

555
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,519
um

556
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,038
so

557
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,879
uh that's

558
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,879
you know so that's just to establish is

559
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,799
it is it possible

560
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,559
and then another good physics tool is

561
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,400
thinking about things in the limit if

562
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,440
you if you take a particular thing and

563
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,240
you

564
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,840
uh

565
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,079
scale it to a very large number or to a

566
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,199
very small number how does how do things

567
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,599
change

568
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
um well it's like tempo like in number

569
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,519
of things you manufacture something like

570
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,440
that and then in time

571
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,960
yeah like let's say say the example of

572
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,720
like um

573
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,319
like manufacturing which i think is just

574
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,319
a very underrated

575
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,079
problem um

576
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:06,639
and and

577
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,678
uh likes it it's it's much harder to

578
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,679
take

579
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,200
an advanced technology product and bring

580
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
it into volume manufacturing than it is

581
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,679
to design it in the first place my

582
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,480
orders magnitude so

583
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,759
um

584
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
so let's say you're trying to figure out

585
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,798
is

586
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,839
like why is this

587
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,119
this uh

588
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,599
part or product

589
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,959
expensive is it um

590
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,480
because of something fundamentally

591
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,440
foolish that we're doing or is it

592
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,400
because our volume is too low and so

593
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,320
then you say okay well what if our

594
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,080
volume was a million units a year is it

595
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,200
still expensive that's what i'm

596
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,960
radically thinking about things to the

597
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,720
limit if it's still expensive at a

598
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,319
million units a year then volume is not

599
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,279
the reason why your thing is expensive

600
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,558
there's something fundamental about

601
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,319
design

602
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:47,759
and then you then can focus on the

603
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,918
reducing complexity or something like

604
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:53,038
that and change the design to change

605
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,159
changes apart to be something that is uh

606
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,240
uh

607
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,400
not fundamentally expensive

608
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,640
but like that's a common thing in

609
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,120
rocketry because the the unit volume is

610
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,960
relatively low and so a common excuse

611
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,199
would be well it's expensive because our

612
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,558
unit volume is low um and if we were in

613
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,319
like automotive or something like that

614
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,839
or consumer electronics then our costs

615
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,678
would be lower and like i'm like okay so

616
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,959
let's say we skip now you're making a

617
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,519
million units a year is it still

618
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,400
expensive if the answer is yes

619
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,679
then

620
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,919
uh

621
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,120
economies of scale are not the issue

622
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,559
do you throw

623
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,119
into manufacturing do you throw like

624
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,480
supply chain you talk about resources

625
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,918
and materials and stuff like that do you

626
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,599
throw that into the calculation of

627
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,880
trying to reason from first principles

628
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,480
like how we're going to make the supply

629
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,799
chain work here

630
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,798
yeah yeah and then the cost of materials

631
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,440
things like that or is that too much

632
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,119
exactly so um like another like a good

633
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,279
example of thinking about things uh in

634
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:48,879
the limit is

635
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:50,960
um if you take any uh

636
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,159
you know any any

637
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,919
product any machine or whatever um

638
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,840
like take a rocket or whatever

639
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,240
and

640
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:01,038
say uh if you've got if you look at the

641
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,720
room

642
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,759
raw materials in the rocket

643
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,038
um so you're gonna have like uh

644
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:12,480
aluminum steel titanium inconel

645
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:15,599
especially specialty alloys um

646
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,558
copper and and you say what are the

647
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,839
how

648
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,839
what what's the weight of the

649
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,359
constituent elements of each of these

650
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,480
elements and what is their raw material

651
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,399
value

652
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,919
and that sets the

653
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,360
asymptotic limit for how

654
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,679
low the cost of the vehicle can be

655
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,639
unless you change the materials

656
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,400
so

657
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,000
and then when you do that i call it like

658
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,840
maybe the magic wand number or something

659
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,119
like that so that would be like if you

660
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,918
had the

661
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,199
you know a like just a pile of these raw

662
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,720
materials here and you could wave magic

663
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,000
wand and rearrange the atoms into the

664
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,960
final shape

665
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,240
um

666
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,319
that would be the

667
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,440
lowest possible cost that you could make

668
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,558
this thing for unless you change the

669
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,640
materials

670
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,720
so then and that is always a you're

671
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,600
almost always a very low number

672
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,240
um

673
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,918
so then the what's actually causing

674
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,759
these to be expensive is how you put the

675
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,759
atoms into the desired shape

676
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,319
yeah actually if you don't mind me

677
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,479
taking a tiny tangent i had uh i often

678
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,678
talked to jim keller who was somebody

679
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,279
that worked with you oh yeah that's a

680
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,679
fantastic job jim was

681
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,480
yeah did great work at tesla

682
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,559
so

683
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,440
um i suppose he carries the flame of the

684
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,359
same kind of thinking that you're you're

685
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,080
talking about now

686
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,439
um and i guess i see that same thing at

687
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,839
tesla

688
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,759
and spacex folks who work there they

689
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,558
kind of learn this way of thinking and

690
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,960
it kind of becomes obvious almost

691
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,399
but anyway i had um argument not

692
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,640
argument

693
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,679
uh he educated me

694
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,520
about

695
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,080
how cheap it might be to manufacture

696
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:50,400
teslabot we just we had an argument what

697
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,038
is how can you reduce the cost of scale

698
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,360
of

699
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,839
producing a robot because i've gotten a

700
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,839
chance to interact quite a bit um

701
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,158
obviously in in the academic circles

702
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,319
with humanoid robots and then boston

703
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,400
dynamics and stuff like that and they're

704
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,960
very expensive to to build

705
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,200
and then uh jim kind of schooled me on

706
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,720
saying like okay like this kind of first

707
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,038
principle is thinking of how can we get

708
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,000
the cost of manufacturing down

709
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,599
um i suppose you do that you have done

710
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
that kind of thinking for teslabot and

711
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,000
for all kinds of

712
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,759
all kinds of complex systems that are

713
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,278
traditionally seen as complex and you

714
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,119
say okay how can we simplify everything

715
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,319
down

716
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,239
yeah

717
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,240
i mean i think if you are really good at

718
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,159
manufacturing

719
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,759
you can basically

720
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,400
make at high volume you can basically

721
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:41,119
make anything for a cost

722
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,798
that asymptotically approaches the real

723
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,639
raw material value of the constituents

724
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,400
plus any intellectual property that you

725
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,278
need to license

726
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,880
anything right

727
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,038
but it's hard it's not like that's a

728
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,559
very hard thing to do but but it is

729
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,879
possible for anything

730
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,038
anything in volume can be made

731
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,559
like i said for a class

732
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,640
that asymptotically approaches raw

733
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,079
material uh constituents

734
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,278
plus intellectual property license

735
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,519
rights

736
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,278
so what will often happen in trying to

737
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,319
design a product is people will start

738
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,400
with the tools and and parts and methods

739
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,519
that they are familiar with

740
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,919
and then

741
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,038
and try to create a product using their

742
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,520
existing tools and methods

743
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,599
the other way to think about it is

744
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:28,879
actually imagine the try to imagine the

745
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:31,278
platonic ideal of the perfect product or

746
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,760
technology whatever it might be

747
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,519
and so what is this what is the perfect

748
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,038
arrangement of atoms

749
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,400
that would be the the best possible

750
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,919
product

751
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,720
and now let us try to figure out how to

752
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,720
get the atoms in that shape

753
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,759
i mean it's it sounds um

754
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,000
it's almost like a rick and morty absurd

755
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,798
until you start to really think about it

756
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,720
and

757
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,720
you really should

758
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,880
think about it in this way because

759
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,038
everything else is kind of uh

760
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,400
if you if you think uh

761
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:03,839
you you might fall victim to the

762
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,840
momentum of the way things are done in

763
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,599
the past unless you think in this way

764
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,879
well just as a function of inertia

765
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,480
people will

766
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,000
want to use the same tools and methods

767
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,120
that they are familiar with

768
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,558
um

769
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,359
they just that's what they'll do by

770
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:19,119
default yeah and then that will lead to

771
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,959
an outcome of things that can be made

772
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,959
with those tools and methods but it is

773
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,120
unlikely to be the

774
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,919
platonic idea of the perfect product

775
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,879
um

776
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,960
so

777
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,159
then so that's why it's good to think of

778
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,360
things in both directions they're like

779
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,400
what can we build with the tools that we

780
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,158
have but then but but also what is the

781
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,320
what is the perfect the theoretical

782
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,760
perfect product look like and that that

783
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,759
theoretical perfect part is going to be

784
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,558
a moving target because as you learn

785
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,679
more

786
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:47,200
the definition of or or for that perfect

787
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,480
product will change because you don't

788
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,840
actually know what the perfect product

789
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,159
is but you can successfully approximate

790
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:56,319
a more perfect product

791
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,720
so the thing about it like that and then

792
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:01,519
saying okay now what tools methods

793
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,839
materials whatever do we need to

794
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:07,839
create in order to get the atoms in that

795
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,918
shape but for people

796
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:12,480
rarely think about it that way

797
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,880
but it's a powerful tool

798
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,038
i should mention that the brilliant

799
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,640
siobhan zillis is hanging on

800
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:20,798
hanging out with us

801
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,840
in case you hear a voice of uh wisdom

802
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,599
from uh

803
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:28,158
from from outside from up above

804
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,319
okay so let me ask you about mars you

805
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,760
mentioned it would be great for science

806
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,839
to put

807
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,879
um a base on the moon to do some

808
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,398
research

809
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,880
but

810
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:40,959
the truly big leap again in this

811
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,679
category of seemingly impossible is to

812
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,440
put a human being on mars

813
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:49,159
when do you think spacex will land a

814
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,159
human being on mars

815
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,240
hmm

816
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,840
best case is about five years

817
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,840
worst case tenures

818
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,038
what are the determining factors would

819
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,839
you say from an engineering perspective

820
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,879
or is that that not the bottlenecks

821
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:31,839
uh you know it's fundamentally um

822
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,840
you know engineering the the vehicle um

823
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,798
i mean starship is the most

824
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,798
complex and advanced rocket that's ever

825
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,240
been made by

826
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:41,918
i don't know order of magnitude or

827
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,120
something like that it's a lot

828
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,240
it's really next level so

829
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,639
um

830
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,720
and the fundamental optimization of

831
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,799
starship is minimizing cost per ton to

832
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,399
orbit and ultimately cost per ton to the

833
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,839
surface of mars

834
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:57,439
um this may seem like a mercantile

835
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,839
objective but it is actually the thing

836
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,000
that needs to be optimized

837
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,000
um like there is a certain

838
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,079
cost per tonne to the surface of mars

839
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,240
where we can afford to establish a

840
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,519
self-sustaining uh city

841
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,120
um and

842
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:14,480
and then above that we cannot afford to

843
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:16,079
do it um so right right now you couldn't

844
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,679
fly to mars for a trillion dollars

845
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,119
doesn't no amount of money could get

846
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,759
your ticket to mars

847
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,519
so we need to get that above

848
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,798
uh you know to get that like something

849
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,599
that is actually possible at all um

850
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,918
um

851
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,918
but but then but that's that's

852
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,759
we don't just want to have

853
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,200
you know with mars flags and footprints

854
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,359
and then not come back for a half

855
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,080
century like we did with the moon

856
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,359
uh

857
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:44,000
in order to pass

858
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,079
a very important great filter i think we

859
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,159
need to be a multi-planet species

860
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:50,639
um

861
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,159
this may sound somewhat esoteric to

862
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,440
to a lot of people but

863
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,159
uh

864
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,120
like eventually given enough time

865
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,480
uh

866
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,398
that's something

867
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,919
the earth is likely to experience

868
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,719
some calamity um that could be

869
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,640
uh

870
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,480
something that humans do to themselves

871
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,759
or an external event like happen to the

872
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,038
dinosaurs

873
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,000
um

874
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,119
and

875
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,839
um but a bit of you know eventually

876
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:21,119
and if nothing if none of that happens

877
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:23,278
and somehow magically we keep going

878
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,479
then the sun will the sun is gradually

879
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,440
expanding

880
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,240
um and will engulf the earth um and

881
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,159
probably earth gets too hot for

882
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,440
uh life in

883
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,278
uh

884
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,399
about 500 million years it's a long time

885
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,200
but that's only

886
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:42,079
10 longer than earth has been around

887
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,440
and so if you think about like the

888
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,199
because the current situation is really

889
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,440
remarkable um and kind of hard to

890
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,159
believe but

891
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,519
uh

892
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,520
it's been around four and a half billion

893
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,639
years and this is the first time if one

894
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,599
half billion years that has been

895
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,000
possible to extend life beyond earth

896
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,759
and that window opportunity may be open

897
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,839
for a long time and i hope it is but it

898
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,398
also may be open for a short time and we

899
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,398
should uh i think it was

900
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,398
wise for us to

901
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,879
uh

902
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:13,599
act quickly while the window is open

903
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,919
just in case it closes

904
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,678
yeah the existence of nuclear weapons

905
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,759
pandemics

906
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,480
all kinds of threats yeah

907
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,960
should uh should kind of um

908
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,200
give us some motivation

909
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,720
i mean civilization could get

910
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,880
um

911
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,798
could die with a bang or a whimper

912
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,039
you know if it's uh

913
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,558
if it dies a demographic collapse then

914
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:37,919
it's more of a whimper

915
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:39,440
obviously

916
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,559
but if it's world war three it's more of

917
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,480
a bang

918
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,079
but but these are all risks

919
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,278
um i mean it's important to think of

920
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,240
these things and just

921
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,558
you know think of things as like

922
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,798
probabilities not certainties um there's

923
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:53,119
a certain probability that

924
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,960
something bad will happen on earth like

925
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,319
i think most likely the future will be

926
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,519
good um

927
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,319
but there's like let's say for

928
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,000
argument's sake um a one percent chance

929
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,759
per century of

930
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,319
of a civilization ending event like that

931
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,519
was stephen hawking's estimate

932
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:09,119
um

933
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,000
i think he's he might be right about

934
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,879
that

935
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,200
uh so

936
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,360
then uh

937
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,880
you know we should basically

938
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,479
think of this like being a multi-planet

939
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,640
species just like taking out insurance

940
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,059
for life itself like life insurance for

941
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,720
life

942
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:28,798
[Laughter]

943
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,960
so it's turned into an infomercial real

944
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:34,000
quick life insurance for life yes

945
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,240
um and you know we we can bring the the

946
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
the creatures from uh you know plants

947
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,038
and animals from earth to mars and

948
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,038
breathe life into the planet um

949
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:44,398
and and have a second planet with with

950
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,398
life um

951
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:48,398
that would be great um they can't bring

952
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,759
themselves there you know so if we don't

953
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,199
bring them to mars

954
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,599
then they will just

955
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,240
for sure all die when the sun expands

956
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,398
anyway and then that'll be it what do

957
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,798
you think is the most difficult aspect

958
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,038
of building a civilization on mars

959
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,599
terraforming mars like from engineering

960
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:10,000
perspective from a financial perspective

961
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:12,879
human perspective to get

962
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,440
get a large number of folks there

963
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,120
who will never return back to earth

964
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,720
uh no they could certainly return some

965
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,319
will return back to earth they will

966
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,600
choose to stay there for the rest of

967
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:27,119
their lives yeah many will um

968
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,558
but uh we you know we

969
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,319
we need the spaceships back like the

970
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,158
ones that go to mars read them back so

971
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,839
you can hop on if you want you know it's

972
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,278
like but we can't just not have the

973
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:37,359
spaceships come back those things are

974
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,960
expensive we need them i'd like to come

975
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,798
back and do another trip i mean do you

976
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,319
think about the terraforming aspect like

977
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,639
actually building are you so focused

978
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,798
right now on the spaceships part that's

979
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,080
so critical yeah tomorrow

980
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:49,519
we absolutely if you can't get there

981
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,480
nothing else matters

982
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,519
so

983
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,960
and like i said

984
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,720
we can't get there with

985
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,079
at some extraordinarily high cost i mean

986
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,839
the current cost of

987
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,398
um let's say

988
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:02,639
one ton to the surface of mars is on the

989
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:03,599
order of a billion dollars

990
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
so

991
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,678
because you don't just need the rocket

992
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,639
and the launch and everything you need

993
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,878
like heat shield you need you know

994
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,200
guidance system you need deep space

995
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:14,960
communications you need some kind of

996
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,638
landing system

997
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,480
so like rough approximation would be

998
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,760
a billion dollars per ton to the surface

999
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,760
of mars right now

1000
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,919
um this is obviously

1001
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,520
um

1002
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,519
way too expensive to create a

1003
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,559
self-sustaining civilization

1004
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:34,079
um

1005
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:36,719
so we need to improve that by

1006
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,320
at least a factor of a thousand

1007
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,239
a million per ton

1008
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,399
yes ideally less than much less than a

1009
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,078
million ton but if it's not

1010
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,799
like it's got to be

1011
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,639
say if i say like what well how much can

1012
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,960
society affords to spend or want to just

1013
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,200
want to spend on a self-sustaining

1014
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,440
city on mars the self-sustaining part is

1015
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,960
important like it's just the key

1016
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,119
threshold

1017
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,280
um the grateful to

1018
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,160
will will have been passed

1019
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,320
when the city on mars

1020
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:08,879
it can survive even if the spaceships

1021
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,079
from earth stop coming for any reason

1022
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,320
doesn't matter what the reason is but if

1023
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,400
they stop coming for any reason will it

1024
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,119
die out will it not and if there's even

1025
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,119
one critical ingredient missing then

1026
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,320
it still doesn't count it's like

1027
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,680
you know if you're on a long sea voyage

1028
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,680
and you've got everything except vitamin

1029
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:24,879
c

1030
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,159
and it's only a matter of time you know

1031
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,880
you're going to die

1032
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:31,358
so so we're going to get mars city to

1033
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,119
the point where it's self-sustaining

1034
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:35,039
um i'm not sure this will really happen

1035
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,200
in my lifetime but i i hope to see it at

1036
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,639
least have a lot of momentum

1037
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:41,439
and and then you could say okay what is

1038
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:44,960
the minimum tonnage necessary to

1039
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,079
have a self-sustaining city um

1040
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,400
and there's a lot of uncertainty about

1041
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,800
this you could say like i don't know

1042
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,838
it's probably at least a million tons

1043
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,960
um

1044
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,199
because you have to set up a lot of

1045
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,920
infrastructure on on mars

1046
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,838
like i said you can't be missing any

1047
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,119
anything that

1048
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:02,480
in order to be self-sustaining you can't

1049
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,920
be missed like you need you know

1050
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,760
semiconductor

1051
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,159
fabs you need

1052
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,800
iron ore refineries like you need lots

1053
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:13,519
of things you know so

1054
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,760
um and mars is not super hospitable it's

1055
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,199
it's the least inhospitable planet but

1056
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,359
it's definitely a fixer-upper of a

1057
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:21,039
planet outside of earth

1058
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:22,000
yeah the earth is pretty earth is like

1059
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,320
easy

1060
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,559
yeah and also we should clarify in the

1061
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,920
solar system yes in the solar system

1062
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,159
there might be nice

1063
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,240
like vacation spots there might be some

1064
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,719
great planets out there but

1065
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,479
it's hard to get there yeah way way way

1066
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:38,639
way too hard

1067
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,320
to say at least let me push back on that

1068
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,319
not really a pushback but a quick

1069
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,079
curveball of a question so you did

1070
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,760
mention physics as the the first

1071
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,920
starting point so

1072
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,040
um

1073
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,200
general relativity allows for wormholes

1074
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,759
uh they technically can exist do you

1075
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,118
think um those can ever be leveraged by

1076
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,359
humans to travel faster than the speed

1077
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,280
of light

1078
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:02,719
well

1079
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,920
are you saying the whole thing is

1080
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:05,919
debatable uh the

1081
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,280
that we currently do not know of any

1082
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,160
means of going faster than the speed of

1083
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,079
light

1084
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:14,799
uh

1085
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,039
there is like

1086
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,039
like

1087
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,838
there are some ideas about

1088
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,839
having space like so so

1089
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,559
you can only move at the speed of light

1090
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,440
through through space but

1091
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,440
if you can make space itself move

1092
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,280
that that's like that that's

1093
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,920
warping space

1094
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,440
um space is is capable of moving faster

1095
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,320
than the speed of light

1096
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,000
right

1097
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,079
uh like the universe in the big bang the

1098
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,838
universe the universe expanded at much

1099
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,839
much more than the speed of light

1100
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:51,679
by a lot yeah um

1101
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:54,400
so um

1102
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,399
but the

1103
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,400
if this is possible the the amount of

1104
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,960
energy required towards space is so

1105
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,320
gigantic it's boggles the mind

1106
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,920
so all the work you've done with

1107
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,480
propulsion how much innovation is

1108
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,519
possible with rocket propulsion is this

1109
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,440
um

1110
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:14,320
i mean you've seen it all and you're

1111
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,000
constantly innovating in every aspect

1112
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,000
how much is possible like how much can

1113
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,519
you get 10x somehow is there something

1114
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,039
in there in physics

1115
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:22,559
that you can get significant improvement

1116
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,480
in terms of efficiency of engines and

1117
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,320
all those kinds of things

1118
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,440
well as i'm saying like the

1119
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,960
really the holy grail is a fully and

1120
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,079
rapidly reusable orbital system um

1121
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,320
so

1122
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,280
uh right now uh

1123
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,400
the

1124
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,400
falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket out

1125
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,480
there that but it but

1126
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,400
the the booster comes back and lands and

1127
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,000
you've seen the videos and we get the

1128
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,680
nose cone or faring back but we do not

1129
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,440
get the upper stage back

1130
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:52,480
so

1131
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,159
uh

1132
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,358
that means that we have a minimum cost

1133
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,519
of

1134
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,199
building up for stage um

1135
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,960
you can think of like a two-stage rocket

1136
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,039
of sort of like two airplanes like a big

1137
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,720
airplane and a smaller airplane

1138
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,719
um and we get big airplane back but not

1139
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,279
the smaller airplane and so it still

1140
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,159
costs a lot you know so that upper stage

1141
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,240
is

1142
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:13,199
you know at least 10 million dollars

1143
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:14,639
um

1144
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:16,639
and then the

1145
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,159
degree of the the booster is not as

1146
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:19,598
reused it's not as rapidly and

1147
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,759
completely reusable as we'd like in

1148
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,359
order of the fairings so

1149
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,520
you know our kind of

1150
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,000
minimum marginal cost not counting

1151
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,440
overhead for per flight is on the order

1152
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,880
of

1153
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,880
15

1154
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,200
to 20 million dollars maybe

1155
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,838
um so

1156
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,358
uh that's that's extremely good for

1157
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:41,519
it's by far better than any rocket ever

1158
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:42,639
in history um

1159
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,440
but

1160
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:46,639
uh

1161
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,000
with full and rapid reusability we can

1162
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:52,879
reduce the cost per ton to orbit by

1163
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,119
uh a factor of a hundred

1164
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,640
but just think of it like um

1165
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,200
like imagine if you had an aircraft or

1166
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:01,759
something or a car

1167
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:04,000
oh yeah and if you had to

1168
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,560
buy a new car every time you went for a

1169
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,159
drive it would be very expensive

1170
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:08,838
it'll be silly frankly

1171
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,358
but

1172
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:13,358
um but you in fact you just refuel the

1173
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:17,119
car or recharge the car

1174
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:18,318
and that's uh makes your trip

1175
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,240
like

1176
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:21,759
i don't know a thousand times cheaper

1177
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,559
so

1178
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,520
it's the same for rockets uh if you

1179
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,799
it's

1180
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:28,559
very difficult to make this complex

1181
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,880
machine that can go to orbit

1182
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,880
and so if you cannot reuse it and if you

1183
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,480
have to throw even any part of any

1184
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,838
significant part of it away that

1185
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,800
massively increases the cost

1186
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:41,679
so

1187
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,240
you know starship in theory could do

1188
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,598
a cost per launch of like a million

1189
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:46,719
maybe two million dollars or something

1190
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,240
like that

1191
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:49,679
um

1192
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,399
and uh

1193
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,399
and put over 100 tons in orbit

1194
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,318
which is crazy yeah

1195
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,240
so that's incredible so you're saying

1196
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,559
like it's uh by far the biggest bang for

1197
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:02,879
the buck is to make it fully reusable

1198
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,719
versus like some kind of

1199
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,680
brilliant breakthrough in theoretical

1200
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:07,358
physics

1201
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,039
no no there's no there's no brilliant

1202
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,480
break no there's no

1203
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:12,159
it just me you're gonna make the rocket

1204
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,358
reusable this is an extremely difficult

1205
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,118
insuring problem

1206
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,440
got it uh but no no new physics is

1207
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,440
required

1208
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:22,078
just brilliant engineering let me ask a

1209
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,838
slightly philosophical fun question

1210
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,160
gotta ask i know you're focused on

1211
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:28,559
getting to mars but once we're there on

1212
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:30,719
mars what do you what form of government

1213
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:33,039
economic system

1214
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:37,039
political system do you think would work

1215
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:38,880
best for an early civilization of humans

1216
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:40,880
is the i mean

1217
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,880
the the interesting reason to talk about

1218
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,720
this stuff it also make helps people

1219
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,318
dream about the future i know you're

1220
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,078
really focused about

1221
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:49,679
the short-term engineering dream but

1222
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,680
it's like i don't know there's something

1223
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,679
about imagining an actual civilization

1224
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,679
on mars that gives people

1225
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,118
it really gives people hope well it

1226
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,719
would be a new frontier and an

1227
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,800
opportunity to rethink the whole nature

1228
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:02,639
of government just as was done in the

1229
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,800
creation of the united states

1230
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,799
so

1231
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,160
i mean i would suggest

1232
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,200
having a

1233
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,639
direct democracy like people vote

1234
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,598
directly on things as opposed to

1235
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:22,000
representative democracy so

1236
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,800
uh representative democracy i think is

1237
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,639
too

1238
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,560
uh subject to a special interest and

1239
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:31,199
you know a coercion of the politicians

1240
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,039
and that kind of thing um

1241
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:35,199
so i i'd recommend

1242
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:37,759
uh

1243
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:40,399
that that there's just

1244
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,560
um direct democracy people vote on laws

1245
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,318
the population votes on laws themselves

1246
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,799
and then the laws must be short enough

1247
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:48,559
that people can understand them

1248
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,480
yeah and then like keeping a

1249
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,078
well-informed populist like really being

1250
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,679
transparent about all the information

1251
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,160
about what they're voting for absolute

1252
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,919
transparency yeah and not make it as

1253
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,039
annoying as those cookies we have to

1254
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:01,358
accept

1255
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,318
cookies like always like

1256
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:04,239
you know there's like always like a

1257
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:06,318
slight amount of trepidation when you

1258
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:07,759
click accept cookies like i feel as

1259
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:09,838
though there's like perhaps like a like

1260
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,319
a very tiny chance that'll open a portal

1261
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:15,279
to hell or something like that that's

1262
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:16,639
exactly how i feel why why do they why

1263
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,880
do they keep wanting to accept that what

1264
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:20,480
do they want with this cookie

1265
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,318
like somebody got upset with accepting

1266
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,920
cookies or something somewhere

1267
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,920
who cares like

1268
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,318
so annoying to keep accepting all these

1269
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,159
cookies to me this is just

1270
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,079
a great exception yes you can have my

1271
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,399
damn cookie i don't care whatever

1272
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,760
you heard it from me on first he accepts

1273
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,079
all your damn cookies yeah

1274
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,280
and start asking me

1275
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,640
annoying

1276
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,119
yeah it's uh it's

1277
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:49,039
one example of um

1278
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,119
implementation of a good idea done

1279
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,838
really horribly yeah it's somebody was

1280
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,280
like there's some good intentions of

1281
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,799
like privacy or whatever but now

1282
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,560
everyone's just has to take accept

1283
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,680
cookies and it's not you know you have

1284
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:00,960
billions of people who have to keep

1285
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,239
clicking except cookie it's super

1286
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,079
annoying

1287
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,039
then we just accept the damn cookie it's

1288
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,800
fine

1289
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,559
there is like um

1290
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,240
i think a fundamental problem that we're

1291
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:11,920
because we've not really had a

1292
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:13,358
a major

1293
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,119
uh like a world war or something like

1294
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:17,759
that in a while and obviously we would

1295
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,358
like to not have world wars um

1296
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,560
the there's not been a cleansing

1297
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:25,279
function for rules and regulations um

1298
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,838
so wars did have uh you know some sort

1299
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,240
of lining in that there would be a a

1300
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,000
reset on rules and regulations uh after

1301
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,598
a war um so world wars one and two there

1302
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,599
were huge resets on rules and

1303
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,559
regulations

1304
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,240
now as

1305
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,279
for if the society society does not have

1306
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:40,879
a war

1307
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,079
and there's no cleansing function or

1308
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,680
garbage collection for rules and

1309
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,119
regulations then rules and regulations

1310
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,838
will accumulate every year because

1311
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:51,519
they're immortal there's no actual

1312
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:53,039
humans die but the laws don't so

1313
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,719
we need a garbage collection function

1314
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:55,759
for rules and regulations they should

1315
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,318
not just

1316
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,920
be immortal um because some of the rules

1317
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,079
and regulations that are put in place

1318
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,599
will be counterproductive uh done with

1319
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,519
good intentions but counterproductive

1320
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,960
sometimes not done with good intentions

1321
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,719
so

1322
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,639
um if you just if rules and regulations

1323
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,480
just accumulate every year

1324
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,000
and you get more and more of them then

1325
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,318
eventually you won't be able to do

1326
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,159
anything you're just like gulliver with

1327
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,440
you know tied down by thousands of

1328
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,598
little strings

1329
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,240
and we had we see that in

1330
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,760
um you know

1331
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,559
us and

1332
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,560
like basically all economies that uh

1333
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:34,318
have been around for for a while

1334
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,920
uh and and regulators and legislators

1335
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:37,759
create new rules and regulations every

1336
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,280
year but they don't put effort into

1337
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,319
removing them and i think that's very

1338
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,319
important that we put effort into

1339
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:43,759
removing rules and regulations

1340
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:44,800
um

1341
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,480
but it gets tough because you get

1342
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,480
special interests that then are

1343
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,760
dependent on like they they have a

1344
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,119
you know a uh

1345
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,880
vested interest in that whatever rule

1346
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,838
and regulation and that they then they

1347
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,160
fight

1348
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,440
to not get it removed

1349
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,199
um

1350
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,599
yeah so it i mean i guess the problem

1351
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:03,039
with the constitution is it's it's kind

1352
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,200
of like c

1353
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,800
versus java because it doesn't have any

1354
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,559
garbage collection built in i think

1355
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,240
there should be i when you first said

1356
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:12,318
the the the metaphor of garbage

1357
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,318
collection from a coding standpoint from

1358
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:15,920
the colony standpoint yeah yeah i it

1359
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:18,559
would be interesting interesting if the

1360
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,240
laws themselves kind of had a built-in

1361
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,000
thing where they kind of die after a

1362
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,838
while unless somebody explicitly

1363
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,440
publicly defends them yeah so that

1364
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:26,838
that's sort of it's not like somebody

1365
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,920
has to kill them they kind of die

1366
00:46:26,838 --> 00:46:32,239
themselves they disappear yeah

1367
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,240
um

1368
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,800
not to defend java or anything but you

1369
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,480
know the c plus plus you know you could

1370
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,839
also have a great garbage collection in

1371
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,240
python and so on

1372
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,599
yeah so yeah something's good something

1373
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,838
needs to happen

1374
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:48,480
or or just the the civilization's

1375
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:50,480
arteries arteries just harden over time

1376
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,400
and and you can just get less and less

1377
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,800
done because there's just a rule against

1378
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,800
everything

1379
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:59,199
so yeah i think like i don't know for

1380
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:00,559
mars order i'd say or even for you

1381
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,639
obviously for earth as well like i think

1382
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:03,920
there should be an active process for

1383
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:05,358
removing

1384
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,960
rules and regulations and questioning

1385
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:08,639
their existence

1386
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,318
just um

1387
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:11,519
like if we've got a function for

1388
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:12,960
creating rules and regulations because

1389
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,199
rules and regulations can also think of

1390
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,039
as like they're like software or lines

1391
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,279
of code for operating

1392
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,039
uh civilization that's the rules and

1393
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,400
regulations um

1394
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:23,920
so it's like we shouldn't have rules and

1395
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,960
regulations but you have code

1396
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,720
accumulation but no code removal

1397
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,358
um and so it just gets

1398
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,879
to become basically archaic bloatware

1399
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:35,519
after a while

1400
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,400
um and and it's just it makes it hard

1401
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,759
for

1402
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,639
things to progress

1403
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,160
so

1404
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:41,598
i don't know maybe mars you'd have like

1405
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,879
an uh

1406
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:46,000
you know any given law must have a

1407
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,760
sunset you know and and and uh and

1408
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,599
require active

1409
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,520
voting to keep

1410
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,920
restoring to keep it up there you know

1411
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:55,039
um and i actually also say like

1412
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,318
and these just i don't know

1413
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:59,679
recommendations or thoughts and

1414
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:01,920
ultimately we'll be up to the people on

1415
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:04,078
mars to decide but

1416
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,720
i think um

1417
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,800
it should be easier to remove a law than

1418
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:10,639
to add one because of the just to

1419
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,599
overcome the inertia of laws

1420
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,239
so

1421
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,400
maybe it's like uh

1422
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:19,598
for argument's sake you need like say 60

1423
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:23,200
percent vote to have a law take effect

1424
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:25,760
but only a 40 vote to remove it

1425
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:27,598
so let me be the guy you posted meme on

1426
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,559
twitter recently where there's

1427
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,960
there's like a row of urinals a guy just

1428
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,760
walks all the way across

1429
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,519
and he tells you about crypto

1430
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,040
listen i mean that's happened to me

1431
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,679
so many times i think maybe even

1432
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:43,358
literally uh yeah

1433
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:45,598
do you think technologically speaking

1434
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,838
there's any room for ideas of smart

1435
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,800
contracts or so on because you mentioned

1436
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:50,799
laws

1437
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,119
um that's an interesting implement use

1438
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,280
of things like smart contracts to

1439
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,280
implement the laws by which governments

1440
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,040
function

1441
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,960
like something built on ethereum or

1442
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,759
maybe

1443
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,079
a dog coin that enables smart contracts

1444
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,240
somehow i never i don't quite understand

1445
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,000
this whole smart contract thing um you

1446
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,159
know

1447
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,599
i mean

1448
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:14,799
so it's two dumb times to have small

1449
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,838
contracts

1450
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,839
it's a good line

1451
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:21,920
i mean my general approach to any kind

1452
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:23,599
of like deal or whatever is just make

1453
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,358
sure there's clarity of understanding

1454
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,160
that's the most important thing

1455
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,838
um and and just keep any kind of deal

1456
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:31,279
very very short and simple plain

1457
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:33,279
language

1458
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,280
and just make sure everyone understands

1459
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,480
this is the deal does everyone is it

1460
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,480
clear

1461
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,079
and uh

1462
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,480
and and what are the consequences if

1463
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,839
various things don't happen um

1464
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,920
but usually deals are um

1465
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:49,920
you know business deals or whatever are

1466
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,639
way too long and complex and overly

1467
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,200
lawyered and pointlessly

1468
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,879
you mentioned that uh doge is the

1469
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,480
people's coin

1470
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,720
yeah and you said that you were

1471
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,519
literally going spacex

1472
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,679
may

1473
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,239
consider literally putting

1474
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:07,358
uh a dosh coin on

1475
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,719
the moon

1476
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:11,838
is this something you're still

1477
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:13,679
considering uh mars perhaps

1478
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,920
do you think there's some chance we've

1479
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:18,558
talked about political systems on mars

1480
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,559
that uh dogecoin is the

1481
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,480
official currency of mars that's coming

1482
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,200
in the future

1483
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,838
well

1484
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:28,000
i think mars itself will need to have a

1485
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:31,039
different currency because you can't

1486
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,119
synchronize due to speed of light

1487
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:36,400
or not easily um so it must be

1488
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,318
completely standalone from earth

1489
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,200
well yeah because the

1490
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:41,599
but

1491
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,598
mars is at closest approach it's four

1492
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,838
light minutes away roughly and then at

1493
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,200
furthest approach uh it's roughly 20

1494
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:49,920
light minutes away

1495
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:51,439
uh maybe a little more um

1496
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,680
so you can't really have something

1497
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,119
synchronizing you know if you could if

1498
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:56,719
if you've got a 20 minute speed light

1499
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,480
issue if it's got a one minute

1500
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,919
blockchain uh it's not going to

1501
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,039
synchronize properly

1502
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,358
um

1503
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:04,719
so mars really would i don't know if

1504
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,440
mars would have a cryptocurrency as a

1505
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:09,118
thing but probably seems likely

1506
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,838
but it would be some kind of localized

1507
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,838
thing on mars

1508
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:15,679
and you let the people decide

1509
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:17,919
yeah

1510
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:19,118
absolutely

1511
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,639
the future of mars should be up to the

1512
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,920
martians

1513
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:25,759
yeah so um

1514
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,920
i mean i think the cryptocurrency thing

1515
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,000
is an interesting

1516
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,519
approach to

1517
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,599
reducing the um

1518
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:38,719
error in the

1519
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,960
the database that is called money

1520
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:40,959
um

1521
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,239
you know i think i have a pretty deep

1522
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,159
understanding of the of what money

1523
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:48,838
actually is on a practical day-to-day

1524
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:51,759
basis because of paypal

1525
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:55,039
um you know i really

1526
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,000
got in deep there um

1527
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:58,318
and

1528
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,838
right now the money system actually for

1529
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:03,279
practical purposes is

1530
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:07,358
is really a bunch of uh heterogeneous uh

1531
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,440
mainframes running uh old cobalt

1532
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:10,880
okay you mean literally that's literally

1533
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,639
that is literally what's happening in

1534
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,358
batch mode

1535
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:17,358
okay in patch mode yeah uh pretty the

1536
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:20,159
poor fastest who have to

1537
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:22,880
maintain that code okay that's a

1538
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:25,920
that's a pain that's pain not even for

1539
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,358
trans cobalt yep it's cobalt it's like

1540
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,800
and they still

1541
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:32,480
banks are still buying mainframes in

1542
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,400
2021 and running ancient global code

1543
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,480
uh and uh

1544
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,318
you know the the federal reserve is like

1545
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,079
probably even older than the what the

1546
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:41,838
banks have and they have an old kobold

1547
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,200
mainframe

1548
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:47,119
and so now and and so the the government

1549
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:49,358
effectively has editing privileges on

1550
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,440
the on the money database

1551
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:53,279
um and they use those editing privileges

1552
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,720
to um

1553
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,319
make more money

1554
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:58,318
whenever they want

1555
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:01,039
and this increases the error in the

1556
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,400
database that is money so i think money

1557
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:04,480
should really be viewed through the lens

1558
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,039
of information theory

1559
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,639
and uh and so it's uh

1560
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:11,358
you're kind of like uh like an internet

1561
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:12,480
connection like what's the bandwidth uh

1562
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,799
you know

1563
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,760
total bit rate uh what is the latency

1564
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,480
judder

1565
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,720
uh packet drop uh you know

1566
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,639
errors in errors in the network uh

1567
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,639
communication

1568
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:26,400
using money like that basically

1569
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:27,440
um i think that's probably why i really

1570
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,000
think of it

1571
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,039
and and then say what what system

1572
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,800
uh

1573
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,358
from an information theory standpoint

1574
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,480
allows an economy to function the best

1575
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:38,159
uh

1576
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,760
and

1577
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:42,719
you know um

1578
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,000
crypto is an attempt to reduce the

1579
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,239
the error

1580
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,440
uh in

1581
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:51,519
uh in money that is contributed by

1582
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,358
uh governments uh

1583
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:56,000
diluting the money supply

1584
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:58,719
as basically a pernicious pernicious

1585
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,039
form of taxation

1586
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:04,719
so both policy in terms of with

1587
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:07,599
inflation and actual like technological

1588
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:10,078
cobalt like cryptocurrency takes us into

1589
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,440
the 21st century in terms of the actual

1590
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,880
systems that allow you to do the

1591
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,358
transaction to store wealth all those

1592
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,358
kinds of things

1593
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:20,318
like i said just think of money as

1594
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,000
information people um often will think

1595
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:26,000
of money as having power in and of

1596
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,559
itself um it does not money is uh is

1597
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:30,239
information and it it does not have

1598
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,040
power in and of itself

1599
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,358
uh

1600
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:34,480
the like the you know again applying the

1601
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:35,838
physics

1602
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,719
tools of thinking about things in the

1603
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:39,039
limit

1604
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,480
is helpful if you are stranded on a

1605
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:43,039
tropical island

1606
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:47,280
um and uh

1607
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:47,279
you have a trillion dollars it's useless

1608
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:50,400
because there's no there's no resource

1609
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:51,519
allocation

1610
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,400
money is a database for resource

1611
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:53,599
allocation

1612
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,880
but there's no resources to allocate

1613
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,640
except yourself

1614
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,960
so money is useless

1615
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:58,960
um

1616
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,079
uh

1617
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,199
if you're surrounded on desert island

1618
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,318
with

1619
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:07,759
no food you'd uh all the bitcoin in the

1620
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:09,679
world

1621
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,319
will

1622
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,598
not stop you from starving yeah

1623
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:15,838
so

1624
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:20,240
um

1625
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:22,480
so like just think of money as as a

1626
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:24,879
database for resource allocation um

1627
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,838
across time and space

1628
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,358
and

1629
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:32,000
um and then what what what system

1630
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:34,480
uh it is what what

1631
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,798
in what form should that that

1632
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,880
database or data system

1633
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:39,679
what what what would be most effective

1634
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,280
now

1635
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:45,598
there's a there is a fundamental issue

1636
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,839
with um say bitcoin in its current form

1637
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,359
uh in that it's the transaction volume

1638
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:50,639
is very limited

1639
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,798
um

1640
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:56,318
and uh the

1641
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:58,000
latency this is the latency for for a

1642
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,079
properly confirmed transaction is to is

1643
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,719
too long much longer than you'd like

1644
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,519
so it's not it's actually not great from

1645
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:05,358
um

1646
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,039
a transaction volume standpoint or a

1647
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:08,719
latency standpoint

1648
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:12,000
um

1649
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:14,558
uh so it is perhaps useful as

1650
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,760
as to search to solve an aspect of the

1651
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:20,000
money database problem uh

1652
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,640
which is the sort of store of wealth or

1653
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,159
an

1654
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:25,440
accounting of

1655
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:28,480
relative obligations i suppose

1656
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,798
but it is not useful as a

1657
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,079
currency as a day-to-day currency but

1658
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,159
people have proposed different

1659
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,000
technological solutions

1660
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:38,159
yeah lightning network and the layer two

1661
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,079
technologies on top of that i mean it's

1662
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:42,318
it's all it seems to be all kind of a

1663
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,839
trade-off but the point is it's kind of

1664
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:45,599
brilliant to say that just think about

1665
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:47,039
information think about what kind of

1666
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,280
database what kind of infrastructure

1667
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:50,318
enables yeah like you're operating an

1668
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,280
economy

1669
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:53,119
um

1670
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,720
and you need to have some

1671
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:57,039
thing that

1672
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:58,480
allows for the efficient

1673
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,400
to have efficient

1674
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,480
uh value ratios between products and

1675
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,000
services so you've got this massive

1676
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,358
number of products and services and you

1677
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,760
need to

1678
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:09,519
you can't just bar barter it's like that

1679
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,480
would be extremely unwieldy

1680
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:13,519
so you need something that gives you the

1681
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,400
the

1682
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:15,599
an

1683
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,318
a

1684
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,400
a

1685
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:19,599
ratio of exchange between goods and

1686
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,480
services

1687
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,559
um

1688
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,280
and and then something that allows you

1689
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,000
to

1690
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,079
uh shift obligations across time like

1691
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,318
debt debt and equity shift obligations

1692
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,760
across time then what does what does the

1693
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:33,119
best job of that

1694
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,280
um

1695
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:38,000
part reason why i think there's some

1696
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,119
um merit to dogecoin even though it was

1697
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,480
obviously created as a joke um

1698
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,358
is that

1699
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,519
it it actually does have a much higher

1700
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,759
uh transaction volume capability than

1701
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,838
bitcoin um

1702
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,400
and the you know the cut like the costs

1703
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:56,558
of doing a transaction the the dogecoin

1704
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,559
fee is is very low like right now if you

1705
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,079
want to do a bitcoin transaction the

1706
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,559
price of doing that transaction is very

1707
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,240
high so you could not use it effectively

1708
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,240
for most things

1709
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:09,199
um and nor could it even scale to a high

1710
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:11,519
volume um

1711
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:11,519
uh

1712
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:15,679
and when bitcoin was you know started i

1713
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,280
guess when around 2008 or something like

1714
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:20,000
that um

1715
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,200
the internet connections were much worse

1716
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,039
than they are today like order of

1717
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:25,598
magnitude cup

1718
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:28,558
i mean there's the way way worse you

1719
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:30,000
know in 2008 so so like having us you

1720
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,640
know a small

1721
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,480
uh block size or whatever is

1722
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,558
you know and a long

1723
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,599
synchronization time is

1724
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:42,640
made sense in 2008 but did you know 2021

1725
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:44,240
or fast forward 10 years it's like it's

1726
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:46,879
it's like

1727
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:48,838
comically low you know it's uh

1728
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,400
so

1729
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:51,759
um

1730
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,960
and i think there's some

1731
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,079
value to

1732
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,480
having

1733
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,160
a linear increase in the amount of

1734
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,838
currency that uh is generated um

1735
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:02,879
so because some amount of the currency

1736
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:06,558
like like

1737
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,880
if a currency is too deflationary or

1738
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,680
like uh or should say if if

1739
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,680
if if a currency is expected to increase

1740
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:14,960
in value over time there's reluctance to

1741
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:16,719
spend it

1742
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,480
because they're like oh i if i

1743
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:20,159
i'll just hold it and not spend it

1744
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,480
because it's scarcity is increasing with

1745
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,719
time so if i spend it now then i will

1746
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,760
regret spending it so i will just you

1747
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:27,759
know total it

1748
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:30,798
but if there's

1749
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:32,318
some dilution of the currency occurring

1750
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:34,798
over time that's that's more of an

1751
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:37,838
incentive to use that as a currency so

1752
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,639
um those coins somewhat randomly has

1753
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:39,838
uh

1754
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:41,118
a

1755
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:43,358
um

1756
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,160
just a fixed a number of

1757
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:47,440
of

1758
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:48,318
sort of coins or hash strings that

1759
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,920
uh

1760
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,759
are generated every year so there's

1761
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,639
there's some inflation but it's not a

1762
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:57,839
percentage base it's a it's so the

1763
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:59,519
it's a fixed number so the percentage of

1764
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:00,719
inflation will necessarily decline over

1765
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:02,559
time

1766
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:04,959
um

1767
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:07,680
so it just i'm not saying that it's like

1768
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,599
the ideal system for a currency but i

1769
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:11,919
think it actually is uh just

1770
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:15,119
fundamentally better than

1771
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:19,680
anything else i've seen just by accident

1772
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:21,760
um so i like how you said um around 2008

1773
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:23,519
so you're not uh

1774
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,440
you know some people suggested you might

1775
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:28,400
be satoshi nakamoto you previously said

1776
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,400
you're not i'm not

1777
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:32,798
would you tell us if you were yes okay

1778
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:38,719
uh do you think it's a feature of bug

1779
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:40,798
that he's anonymous or she or they

1780
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,558
it's an interesting kind of quirk of

1781
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:44,880
human history that there is a particular

1782
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:47,920
technology that is a completely

1783
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,920
anonymous inventor

1784
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,119
or creator

1785
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,480
well i mean you can you can look at the

1786
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:09,039
um

1787
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:12,798
evolution of ideas

1788
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:14,400
um before the launch of bitcoin

1789
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:17,358
and

1790
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,358
see who wrote

1791
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,679
you know about those ideas

1792
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,960
um and then

1793
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:25,199
i like i don't know exactly obviously i

1794
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,798
don't know who created bitcoin for

1795
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:28,960
practical purposes but

1796
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:31,199
the evolution of ideas is is pretty

1797
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,079
clear before that and like it seems as

1798
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:36,239
though like nick zabo uh is probably

1799
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,039
more than anyone else uh responsible for

1800
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:41,199
the evolution of those ideas so

1801
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:42,880
he claims not to be

1802
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:44,239
nakamoto but

1803
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,880
i'm not sure that's that's neither here

1804
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:48,639
nor there uh but he he seems to be the

1805
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,798
one more responsible for the ideas

1806
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:52,879
behind bitcoin than anyone else

1807
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:55,199
so it's not perhaps like singular

1808
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,880
figures aren't even as important as the

1809
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:59,439
the figures involved in the evolution of

1810
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:02,640
ideas that led to a thing so yeah yeah

1811
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,960
it's you know and most perhaps it's sad

1812
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:07,038
to think about history but maybe most

1813
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,960
names will be forgotten anyway what is

1814
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,920
the name anyway it's a name a name

1815
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:13,838
attached to an idea

1816
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,838
what does it even mean really i think

1817
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:17,679
shakespeare had a thing about roses and

1818
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:21,838
stuff whatever he said arose by any

1819
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:21,838
other name it smells sweet

1820
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:26,719
i gotta underquote shakespeare i feel i

1821
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:28,819
feel like i accomplished something today

1822
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:30,639
shall i compare it to a summer's day

1823
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:33,359
[Laughter]

1824
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:33,358
i'm gonna clip that

1825
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:35,440
uh out

1826
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,960
more tempered animal fare

1827
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:40,480
[Laughter]

1828
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,260
autopilot

1829
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,889
tesla

1830
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:45,890
[Laughter]

1831
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,119
tesla autopilot has been through an

1832
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:52,000
incredible journey over the past six

1833
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:54,079
years um or perhaps even longer in the

1834
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,480
minds of in your mind in the minds of

1835
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:58,240
many involved

1836
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,760
uh i think that's where we first like

1837
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:01,759
connected really with the autopilot

1838
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,079
stuff autonomy and

1839
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,119
the whole journey was incredible to me

1840
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,519
to watch

1841
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:09,599
i was um

1842
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:11,920
because i knew well part of as i was at

1843
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,760
mit and i i knew the difficulty of

1844
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,280
computer vision yeah and i knew the

1845
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,880
whole i had a lot of colleagues and

1846
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:18,880
friends about the darpa challenge i knew

1847
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,358
how difficult it is and so there was a

1848
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,838
natural skepticism when i first drove a

1849
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:25,759
tesla with uh the initial system based

1850
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:27,358
on mobile eye yeah i thought there's no

1851
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,440
way

1852
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:32,400
the first one i got in i thought there's

1853
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,400
no way this car could maintain

1854
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,798
um like stay in the lane and create a

1855
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,960
comfortable experience so my intuition

1856
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:41,599
initially was that the lane keeping

1857
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,838
problem is way too difficult to solve

1858
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:46,960
oh thank you yeah that's relatively easy

1859
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:48,719
well yeah but like uh but not this but

1860
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,798
solve in the way that we just we talked

1861
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:53,358
about previous is prototype

1862
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:55,199
versus a thing that actually creates a

1863
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:58,558
pleasant experience over hundreds of

1864
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:58,558
thousands of miles or millions

1865
01:03:59,838 --> 01:04:04,239
a lot of code around the mobile eye

1866
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:05,838
thing it doesn't just work by itself yes

1867
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:07,439
i mean there's part that's part of the

1868
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:08,798
story of how you approach things

1869
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,200
sometimes sometimes you do things from

1870
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:13,119
scratch sometimes at first you kind of

1871
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:15,118
see what's out there and then you decide

1872
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:17,039
to from scratch that was

1873
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,720
one of the boldest decisions i've seen

1874
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,880
is both on the hardware and the software

1875
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:22,879
to decide to eventually go from scratch

1876
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,318
i thought again i was skeptical whether

1877
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,838
that's going to be able to work out

1878
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:26,798
because it's such a such a difficult

1879
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:28,960
problem

1880
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:30,960
and so it was an incredible journey what

1881
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,480
i see now with um

1882
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,318
everything the hardware the compute the

1883
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,440
sensors the

1884
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:37,920
the things i

1885
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,920
maybe care and love about most is the

1886
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,838
the stuff that andre karpathy is leading

1887
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:43,680
with the data set selection the whole

1888
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:46,000
data engine process the neural network

1889
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:47,199
architectures the the way that's in the

1890
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,599
real world

1891
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:51,519
that network is tested validated all the

1892
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,680
different test sets

1893
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:55,358
uh you know versus the image net model

1894
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:58,798
of computer vision like what's in

1895
01:04:55,358 --> 01:05:00,719
academia is like real world artificial

1896
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:01,679
intelligence so

1897
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:03,598
um

1898
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:05,358
andrei's awesome and obviously plays an

1899
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,200
important role but we have

1900
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:08,719
a lot of really talented people driving

1901
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:11,519
things so

1902
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:13,679
um and uh ashok is actually the head of

1903
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:14,639
autopilot engineering um

1904
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:16,960
uh

1905
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:19,279
andre is the director of ai ai stuff

1906
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,519
yeah yeah so yeah there's i'm aware that

1907
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,599
there's an incredible team of just a lot

1908
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:25,440
going on yeah just uh you know as people

1909
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:26,720
people will give off will give me too

1910
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,559
much credit and they'll give andre too

1911
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:30,959
much credit so

1912
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,200
and people should realize how much is

1913
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,400
going on under the yeah it's just a lot

1914
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:39,358
of really talented people um

1915
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,880
the tesla autopilot ai team is extremely

1916
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:43,519
talented it's like

1917
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,119
some of the smartest people in the world

1918
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:47,519
so yeah we're getting it done

1919
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,119
what are some insights you've gained

1920
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:52,159
over those

1921
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:54,960
five six years of autopilot about the

1922
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:56,798
problem of autonomous driving so

1923
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,119
you leaped in

1924
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:02,159
having some sort of first principles

1925
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,838
kinds of intuitions but nobody knows

1926
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,199
how

1927
01:06:02,838 --> 01:06:06,558
difficult the problem yeah like

1928
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,318
i thought the self-driving problem would

1929
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,599
be hard but it's it was harder than i

1930
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:10,880
thought it's not like i thought it'd be

1931
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,599
easy i thought it'd be very hard but it

1932
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,079
was

1933
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:15,440
actually way harder than than even that

1934
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,640
so

1935
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,039
i mean what it comes down to at the end

1936
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:21,440
of the day is to solve self-driving

1937
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,640
uh you have to solve

1938
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,639
uh

1939
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:26,558
you you basically

1940
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,558
need to recreate

1941
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,480
um what you what humans do to drive

1942
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,960
which is humans drive with

1943
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,240
optical sensors eyes and biological

1944
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,720
neural nets

1945
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,558
um and so in order to that that's how

1946
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:40,798
the entire road system is designed to

1947
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:42,720
work with with uh

1948
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:44,239
basically passive optical

1949
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:45,038
and neural nets

1950
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:46,798
um

1951
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:49,119
it biologically um and now that we need

1952
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,880
to it so for actually for full-size

1953
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,480
driving to work we have to recreate that

1954
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,920
in digital form

1955
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:58,400
um so we have to

1956
01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:00,400
um that that means cameras with uh

1957
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,960
advanced uh

1958
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,000
neural nets in silicon form

1959
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,318
uh

1960
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,480
and and then you it will obviously solve

1961
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:10,079
for full self-driving that's the only

1962
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:12,000
way i don't think there's any other way

1963
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,079
but the question is what aspects of

1964
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
human nature do you have to encode into

1965
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:18,720
the machine right so you have to solve

1966
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,920
the perception problem like detect

1967
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:21,199
and then you first

1968
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,639
well realize

1969
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,159
what is the perception problem for

1970
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:26,078
driving like all the kinds of things you

1971
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:28,480
have to be able to see like what what do

1972
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,160
we even look at when we drive there's uh

1973
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,719
i just recently

1974
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:34,399
heard andre talked about at mit about

1975
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:36,239
like car doors i think it was the

1976
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,358
world's greatest talk of all time about

1977
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:41,838
car doors yeah um the the you know the

1978
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:44,318
fine details of car doors like what what

1979
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:46,960
is even an open car door man

1980
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:48,639
so like the the ontology of that that's

1981
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,559
the perception problem we humans solve

1982
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:52,159
that perception problem and tesla has to

1983
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,760
solve that problem and then there's the

1984
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:55,519
control and the planning coupled with

1985
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,640
the perception you have to figure out

1986
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:58,639
like

1987
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,078
what's involved in driving like

1988
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:02,239
especially in all the different edge

1989
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,240
cases

1990
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:06,479
and and then i mean

1991
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:09,038
maybe you can comment on this

1992
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,480
how much game theoretic kind of stuff

1993
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,119
needs to be involved

1994
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:15,679
you know at a four-way stop sign

1995
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:18,880
you know our as humans when we drive our

1996
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:20,960
actions affect the world like sure it

1997
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,359
changes how others behave most

1998
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,439
autonomous driving if you

1999
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:28,560
you're usually just responding

2000
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:31,039
um to the scene as opposed to like

2001
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,960
really um asserting yourself in the

2002
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:34,640
scene do you think

2003
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,838
i think these actually i think i think

2004
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,400
these could these sort of control

2005
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:39,600
control logic conundrums are not are not

2006
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,639
the hard part

2007
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,838
um

2008
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,719
the

2009
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:45,359
you know

2010
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,960
let's see um

2011
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,239
what do you think is the hard part in

2012
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,960
this whole

2013
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:52,879
um beautiful complex problem so it's a

2014
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:56,798
lot of freaking software man

2015
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,798
a lot of smart lines of code um

2016
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:01,358
for sure in order to have

2017
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,920
um

2018
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,199
create an accurate vector space

2019
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,560
so

2020
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:08,479
like you

2021
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,960
you're coming from image space which is

2022
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:13,759
like this this flow of

2023
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,158
um photons you're going to camera

2024
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,679
cameras and

2025
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:20,399
and then uh

2026
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:21,279
so you have this massive bitstream

2027
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,079
um

2028
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:25,199
in

2029
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:29,359
image space and then you have to

2030
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:29,358
effectively compress uh the

2031
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,838
a massive

2032
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:36,079
bit stream

2033
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:37,679
uh corresponding to

2034
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:39,759
photons that

2035
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,039
knocked off an electron in a camera

2036
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,838
sensor

2037
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:47,119
uh and and turn that put stream into

2038
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:49,759
into vector space um

2039
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:51,519
i by by vector space i mean like

2040
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,039
uh

2041
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,400
you know you've got

2042
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:59,439
cars and and humans and uh

2043
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:00,479
lane lines and curves and

2044
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:02,799
uh

2045
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:04,000
traffic lights and that kind of thing

2046
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,800
um

2047
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,319
once you uh have an accurate vector

2048
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,239
space um the control problem is similar

2049
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:14,639
to that of a video game like a grand

2050
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:16,399
theft auto cyberpunk um if you have

2051
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,159
accurate best vector space it's the

2052
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:19,599
control problem is

2053
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:22,639
it's i wouldn't say it's it's trouble

2054
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:25,280
it's not trivial but it's um

2055
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,800
like it's it's it's it's a it's not like

2056
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,880
some

2057
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,880
insurmountable thing it's a it's but

2058
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,119
having accurate vector space

2059
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,319
is very difficult yeah i think we humans

2060
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:35,679
uh

2061
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:37,279
don't give enough respect to how

2062
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,719
incredible the human perception system

2063
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:42,319
is to mapping the raw

2064
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,480
photons to the vector space

2065
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:46,079
representation in our heads

2066
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,158
your brain is doing an incredible amount

2067
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:50,158
of processing um

2068
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:51,839
and and giving you an image that is a

2069
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:54,399
very cleaned up image like when we look

2070
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,920
around here we see like you see color in

2071
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:58,799
the corners of your eyes but actually

2072
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:00,960
your eyes have very few uh

2073
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,440
cones like the cone receptors in the

2074
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,520
peripheral vision your your eyes are

2075
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:07,359
painting color in the peripheral vision

2076
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:08,159
you don't realize it but their eyes are

2077
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:10,000
actually

2078
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:11,679
painting color and

2079
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,359
your eyes also have like this blood

2080
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:15,039
vessels and all sorts of gnarly things

2081
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:17,599
and there's a blind spot but do you see

2082
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:19,920
your blind spot no your

2083
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,840
your brain is painting in the missing

2084
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,719
the blind spot you're gonna do these

2085
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,239
like

2086
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:26,239
see these things online where you look

2087
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:28,479
look here and look at this point and and

2088
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:31,039
then look at this point and it's

2089
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:32,479
if it's in your blind spot it your brain

2090
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:33,519
will just fill in the

2091
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:35,519
the missing version

2092
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,520
the peripheral vision is so cool yes you

2093
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,440
realize all the illusions for vision

2094
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,800
sciences so makes you realize just how

2095
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:42,719
incredible the brain is the brain is

2096
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,119
doing crazy amount of post-processing on

2097
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:47,520
the vision signals from your eyes

2098
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:48,238
um it's insane

2099
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,040
so

2100
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:50,799
um

2101
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:53,198
and then and then even once you get all

2102
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,119
those vision signals uh your

2103
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:58,000
your brain is constantly trying to fig

2104
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:59,359
to forget as much as possible so human

2105
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,479
memory is

2106
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:01,839
perhaps the weakest thing about the

2107
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:03,839
brain is memory

2108
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,480
so because memory is

2109
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,640
so expensive to a brain and so limited

2110
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:10,959
your brain is trying to forget as much

2111
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,119
as possible and distill

2112
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,600
the things that you see into

2113
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:17,198
uh the smallest smallest amounts of

2114
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,280
information possible so your brain is

2115
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:21,839
trying to not just get to a vector space

2116
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:23,920
but get to a vector space that is the

2117
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,679
smallest possible vector space of only

2118
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,480
relevant objects

2119
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,319
um

2120
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:29,759
and i think like

2121
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:30,719
you can sort of look inside your brain

2122
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,039
or at least

2123
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,880
i can like when you drive down the road

2124
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:36,479
and and try to

2125
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,359
think about what your brain is actually

2126
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:38,799
doing

2127
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:40,639
consciously

2128
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,679
and it's conscious it's it's

2129
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,640
it's

2130
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,480
it's like

2131
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,560
you'll see a car that's you could

2132
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:47,839
because you're you don't have cameras

2133
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,199
you i don't have eyes in the back your

2134
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,000
head on the side you know so you say

2135
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:53,359
like but you you basically your your

2136
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,279
head is like a

2137
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:57,198
you know you basically have like

2138
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:58,238
two cameras on a slow gimbal

2139
01:12:57,198 --> 01:13:00,319
um

2140
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:02,000
and and what's your

2141
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:04,559
and i say it's not that great okay you

2142
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,920
and i is uh you know like um and people

2143
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,920
are constantly distracted and thinking

2144
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,880
about things and texting and doing all

2145
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,880
sorts of things they shouldn't do in a

2146
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,719
car changing radio station

2147
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:16,159
so

2148
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,880
having arguments you know is like um

2149
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,000
so

2150
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,880
so then like say like like

2151
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,319
uh

2152
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,199
like when's the last time you look right

2153
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:26,880
and left and you know or and rearward um

2154
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:28,319
or even diagonally

2155
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,039
you know forward

2156
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:32,960
to actually refresh your vector space

2157
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:35,760
so you're glancing around and what your

2158
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,560
mind is doing is is is trying to distill

2159
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,280
um

2160
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:41,360
the relevant vectors basically objects

2161
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:42,800
with a position and motion

2162
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:43,920
uh

2163
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,880
and

2164
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,800
and and and then uh editing that down to

2165
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,840
the least amount that's necessary for

2166
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:54,159
you to drive it does seem to be able to

2167
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,760
uh edit it down or compress it even

2168
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:57,599
further into things like concepts so

2169
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,840
it's not it's like it goes beyond the

2170
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,120
human mind seems to go sometimes beyond

2171
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:03,840
vector space

2172
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:05,679
to sort of space of concepts to where

2173
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,440
you'll see a thing it's no longer

2174
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:09,039
represented spatially somehow it's

2175
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:12,158
almost like a concept that you should be

2176
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:14,960
aware of like if this is a school zone

2177
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,399
you'll remember that as a concept which

2178
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,880
is a weird thing to represent but

2179
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:20,399
perhaps for driving you don't

2180
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,319
need to fully represent those things or

2181
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:24,238
maybe you get those kind of

2182
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:26,639
um

2183
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:29,279
well you indirectly you need to like

2184
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,400
establish vector space and then

2185
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:32,399
actually have

2186
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:35,599
predictions for

2187
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:38,319
uh that those vector spaces so like um

2188
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,079
you know like if uh

2189
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:41,198
you know like you drive past

2190
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:42,719
say say

2191
01:14:41,198 --> 01:14:45,919
a a

2192
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:47,279
a a bus and and you see that there's

2193
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,719
there's people

2194
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:50,238
before you drove past the bus you saw

2195
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,399
people crossing the interstate like or

2196
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:54,559
some just imagine there's like a large

2197
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:55,359
truck or something blocking site

2198
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,280
um

2199
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:59,279
but you before you came out to the truck

2200
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:00,559
you saw that there were some kids about

2201
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:01,840
to cross the road

2202
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,239
in front of the truck now you can no

2203
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,159
longer see the kids but you you need to

2204
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:08,479
be able but you would now know okay

2205
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:10,399
those kids are probably gonna pass by

2206
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:12,238
the truck and cross the road

2207
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:15,119
even though you cannot see them so you

2208
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:17,279
have to have um

2209
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:18,399
memory uh

2210
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:20,800
you need to remember that there were

2211
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:23,198
kids there and you need to have some

2212
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,960
forward prediction of what their

2213
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:27,439
position will be it's a really hard time

2214
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,279
of relevance so with occlusions

2215
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:31,439
and computer vision when you can't see

2216
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:33,519
an object anymore even when it just

2217
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:34,879
walks behind a tree and reappears that's

2218
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,960
a really really

2219
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:39,279
i mean at least in academic literature

2220
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,560
it's tracking through occlusions it's

2221
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:41,759
very difficult

2222
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,360
yeah we're doing it

2223
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,119
i understand this yeah

2224
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:46,479
so some of it it's like object permanent

2225
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:48,719
it's like same thing happens with the

2226
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,039
humans with neural nets like when like a

2227
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,640
toddler grows up like there's a there's

2228
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:53,439
a point in time where

2229
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,440
uh

2230
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:57,439
they develop they have a sense of object

2231
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:58,799
permanence so before a certain age if

2232
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:00,158
you have a ball

2233
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,640
uh or a toy or whatever and you put it

2234
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:04,000
behind your back and you pop it out if

2235
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,440
they don't before they have object

2236
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,600
permanence it's like a new thing every

2237
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:09,279
time it's like whoa this toy went poof

2238
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,400
just faired and now it's back again and

2239
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:12,319
they can't believe it and that they can

2240
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,670
play peekaboo all day long because this

2241
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:16,079
peekaboo is fresh every time

2242
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:18,079
[Laughter]

2243
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:19,760
but then we figure out object permanence

2244
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:21,840
then they realize oh no the object is

2245
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,239
not gone it's just behind your back

2246
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,239
um sometimes i wish we never did figure

2247
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:29,198
out objective permanence

2248
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:31,599
yeah so that's uh

2249
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:32,960
that's an important problem to solve

2250
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,159
yes so so

2251
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,079
like an important evolution of the

2252
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:38,319
neural nets in the car is

2253
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:38,319
uh

2254
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,120
um

2255
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:45,199
memory card

2256
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:46,800
memory across both time and space um so

2257
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:48,000
now you can't remember like you have to

2258
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,920
say like how long do you want to

2259
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,760
remember things for and and it's it

2260
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,760
there's there's a cost to remembering

2261
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,199
things for a long time so you could you

2262
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,039
know like run out of

2263
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:58,399
memory to if you try to remember too

2264
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:00,479
much for too long

2265
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:02,479
um and and then you also have things

2266
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:03,919
that are stale if if they're

2267
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:05,599
remember them for too long and then you

2268
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:08,560
also need things that are

2269
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,480
remembered over time so even if you

2270
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:13,039
like say have like

2271
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:15,519
fragrance like five seconds of memory uh

2272
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:17,760
on a time basis but like let's say you

2273
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,280
you're parked at light and you and you

2274
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,039
saw

2275
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:23,759
you use a pedestrian example that people

2276
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:25,920
were waiting to cross the

2277
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,920
across the road and you can't you can't

2278
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,719
quite see them because of an occlusion

2279
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,719
uh

2280
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:32,480
but they might wait for a minute before

2281
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:34,880
the light changes for them to cross the

2282
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:36,799
road you still need to remember that

2283
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,400
that that's where they were

2284
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,800
um and that they're probably going to

2285
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:43,119
cross the road type of thing um so even

2286
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,960
if that exceeds your

2287
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:46,319
your your time-based memory should not

2288
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,000
exceed your space

2289
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:50,079
memory

2290
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:52,800
and i just think the data engine side of

2291
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:54,960
that so getting the data to learn all

2292
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,480
the concepts that you're saying now is

2293
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,960
an incredible process it's this

2294
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:02,799
iterative process of just it's this this

2295
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,800
hydrogen at many parts

2296
01:18:03,198 --> 01:18:07,519
we're changing the name to something

2297
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:09,760
else okay i'm sure it would be equally

2298
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,520
as yeah rick and morty like there's a

2299
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,480
lot of

2300
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,320
we've re-architected the neural net uh

2301
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:17,759
the neural nets in the cars so many

2302
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,519
times it's crazy

2303
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:21,119
oh so every time there's a new major

2304
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,640
version you'll rename it to something

2305
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:25,119
more ridiculous or

2306
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:27,840
uh or memorable and beautiful sorry not

2307
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:27,840
ridiculous of course

2308
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,198
if you see the full the full like uh

2309
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,800
array of neural nets that that that are

2310
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:37,119
operating in the car it kind of boggles

2311
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,760
the mind there's so there's so many

2312
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:41,279
layers it's crazy um

2313
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,159
so

2314
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:43,840
yeah

2315
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:44,719
um but

2316
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,800
and we

2317
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,920
we started off with

2318
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,640
uh

2319
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,399
simple neural nets that were uh

2320
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,880
basically

2321
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:56,479
image recognition on a single frame

2322
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,400
from a single camera

2323
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:01,279
uh and then

2324
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:03,039
uh trying to knit those together with

2325
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:04,319
it you know it with the

2326
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:05,519
c

2327
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:07,519
i should say we

2328
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,199
we're really primarily running c here

2329
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,560
because c plus plus is

2330
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:11,599
too much overhead and we have our own c

2331
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,600
compiler

2332
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,920
so to get maximum performance we

2333
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,199
actually wrote rotor and c compiler and

2334
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,960
are continuing to optimize our c

2335
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:20,479
compiler uh for

2336
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,520
maximum efficiency in fact we've just

2337
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:24,319
recently

2338
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,080
uh done a new rev on a c compiler that

2339
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:27,599
will compile directly to our autopilot

2340
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:29,439
hardware so you want to compile the

2341
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,480
whole thing down and with your own

2342
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:33,759
compiler yeah like so efficiency here

2343
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:36,079
because there's all kinds of compute

2344
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,280
there's cpu gpu there's like basic types

2345
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:38,479
of things

2346
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:40,079
and you have to somehow figure out the

2347
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:42,079
scheduling across all those things and

2348
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,600
so you're compiling the code down yeah

2349
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,679
it does all okay

2350
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,760
this is so that's why there's a lot of

2351
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:49,600
people involved

2352
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:53,039
there's a lot of hardcore

2353
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:55,280
software engineering at a very sort of

2354
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:57,119
bare metal level uh because

2355
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:59,119
we're trying to do a lot of compute

2356
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:00,719
that's constrained to

2357
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:02,960
the

2358
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:05,279
you know our full self-driving computer

2359
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,039
so and we want to try to have the

2360
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:08,800
highest frames per second

2361
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:09,920
um possible

2362
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,560
um

2363
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:14,480
within a sort of very finite amount of

2364
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,880
compute um

2365
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:20,079
and power so

2366
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:22,000
um we really put a lot of effort into

2367
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:23,600
the efficiency of our compute

2368
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,359
um

2369
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,360
and and uh so there's actually a lot of

2370
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:29,039
work done by

2371
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:30,479
some very talented software engineers at

2372
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:33,119
tesla that

2373
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:35,279
uh at a very foundational level to

2374
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:37,279
improve the efficiency of compute and

2375
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:39,198
how we use the

2376
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:41,519
the trip accelerators uh which are

2377
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:44,319
basically um

2378
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,199
dot you know uh doing matrix math dot

2379
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:47,119
products

2380
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:49,519
like a brazilian dot products

2381
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:50,559
and it's like what what are neural nets

2382
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,320
it's like

2383
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,239
compute wise like 99

2384
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:55,920
dot products

2385
01:20:54,238 --> 01:20:56,879
so

2386
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,719
you know

2387
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,560
and you want to achieve as many

2388
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:03,760
high frame rates like video game you

2389
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:05,840
want yeah full resolution

2390
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,280
high frame rate high frame rate low

2391
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,119
latency

2392
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:12,399
um

2393
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:15,039
low jitter uh so

2394
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:16,960
um

2395
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:20,479
i think one of the things we're um

2396
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,920
moving towards now is no post processing

2397
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:25,359
of the

2398
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:28,880
image through the um

2399
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:30,880
the image signal processor so um

2400
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:33,359
like for what happens for

2401
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,800
cameras is that almost all cameras is

2402
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:35,759
they

2403
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,679
um

2404
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,320
there's a lot of post processing done in

2405
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:41,679
order to make pictures look pretty

2406
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:44,158
and so we don't care about pictures

2407
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:46,960
looking pretty um we we just want the

2408
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:48,638
data we so we're removing just raw

2409
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,800
photon counts

2410
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:52,239
so the system will

2411
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,760
like the

2412
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:55,678
image that

2413
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,280
that the computer sees is actually much

2414
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:58,639
more than what

2415
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,800
you see if you're represented on a

2416
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:02,480
camera it's got much more data

2417
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,320
and even in very low light conditions

2418
01:22:02,479 --> 01:22:06,399
you can see that there's a small photon

2419
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,198
count difference between

2420
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:08,638
you know

2421
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:10,559
this spot here and that's about there

2422
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:12,560
which means that so it can see in the

2423
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,480
dark incredibly well

2424
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,960
um because it can detect these tiny

2425
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:18,879
differences in photon counts

2426
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,319
like much better than you'd

2427
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,440
possibly imagine

2428
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:23,519
um so

2429
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:27,359
and and then we also save

2430
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,480
uh 13 milliseconds on a latency uh

2431
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:30,639
so

2432
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:34,158
um from removing the post processing in

2433
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:35,679
the image yes yeah it's like um

2434
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:38,879
because we've got you know eight cameras

2435
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:40,000
and and then there's uh

2436
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,840
roughly i don't know one and a half

2437
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,198
milliseconds or so

2438
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:47,760
maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency um

2439
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:48,719
for each camera and so

2440
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,440
like

2441
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:50,560
uh

2442
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:53,198
um

2443
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,840
going to just uh

2444
01:22:53,198 --> 01:22:57,759
basically bypassing the image processor

2445
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,840
uh gets us back 13 milliseconds of

2446
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,280
latency which is important

2447
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,039
um

2448
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:04,719
and we track latency all the way from

2449
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:06,399
you know photon hits the

2450
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:07,679
the camera to

2451
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:09,279
you know all the steps that it's got to

2452
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,158
go through to get you know go through

2453
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:11,198
the

2454
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:12,879
um

2455
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:14,559
the various neural nets and the the c

2456
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,760
code and

2457
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,800
there's a little bit of c plus plus

2458
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,600
there as well

2459
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,159
um

2460
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,239
well i can maybe a lot but it the the

2461
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:25,039
core stuff is the heavy duty computers

2462
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:26,799
will see um

2463
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:28,560
and uh

2464
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,360
and so so we track that latency all the

2465
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,360
way to an output command to the um

2466
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:34,719
drive unit to accelerate

2467
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:36,799
the brakes just to

2468
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:38,800
slow down the steering you know turn

2469
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,480
left or right um

2470
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,840
so because you got to output a command

2471
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:43,198
that's going to go to a controller and

2472
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:45,600
like some of these controllers have an

2473
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:47,119
update frequency that's maybe 10 hertz

2474
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,159
or something like that which is slow

2475
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:50,158
that's like now you lose 100

2476
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:51,359
milliseconds potentially

2477
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:54,960
so

2478
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:56,719
um so then we want to update the

2479
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,800
the drivers on the

2480
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,719
like steering and braking control to

2481
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,560
have um

2482
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,920
more like uh 100 hertz instead of 10

2483
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:05,280
hertz and you could have 10 milliseconds

2484
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,359
latency instead of 100 milliseconds

2485
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:09,359
worst case latency and actually jitter

2486
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:10,799
is more of a challenge than than latency

2487
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:12,238
because latency is like you can you can

2488
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,159
you can anticipate and predict but if

2489
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:16,000
you're but if you've got a stack up of

2490
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:17,119
things going from the camera to the to

2491
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,279
the computer

2492
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:22,158
through then a series of other computers

2493
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:24,079
and finally to an actuator on the car if

2494
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:25,119
you have a stack up of

2495
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:26,960
uh

2496
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:28,800
of tolerances of timing tolerances then

2497
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:31,039
you can have quite a variable latency

2498
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,239
which is called jetter and and that

2499
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:35,439
makes it

2500
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:37,359
hard to to anticipate exactly what how

2501
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:38,238
you should turn the car or accelerate

2502
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:39,799
because

2503
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:42,559
you know if you got maybe

2504
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:44,480
150 200 milliseconds of jitter then you

2505
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,239
could be off by you know after 0.2

2506
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,839
seconds and this can make this could

2507
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:50,079
make a big difference so you have to

2508
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,800
interpolate somehow to to

2509
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:54,800
to uh deal with the effects of jitter so

2510
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,760
that you can make like

2511
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,520
robust controlled decisions

2512
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:02,400
the again you have to uh so the jitters

2513
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,960
and the sensor information or the jitter

2514
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:06,879
can occur at any stage in the pipeline

2515
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:10,239
you can if you have just if you have

2516
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:14,000
fixed latency you can anticipate um

2517
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:16,479
and and uh like say okay we know that uh

2518
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,880
our information is for argument's sake

2519
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:21,319
150 milliseconds stale

2520
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,520
like so for um

2521
01:25:21,319 --> 01:25:26,639
145 milliseconds from

2522
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:29,440
photons taking camera to um

2523
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:31,440
where you can measure a change in the

2524
01:25:29,439 --> 01:25:33,678
acceleration of the vehicle

2525
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:34,479
um

2526
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,560
so

2527
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:37,519
then uh then you can say okay well we're

2528
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,360
gonna

2529
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,880
and we know it's 150 milliseconds so

2530
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:42,639
we're going to take that into account

2531
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,480
and uh

2532
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:46,800
and compensate for that latency however

2533
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:49,039
if you've got then 150 milliseconds of

2534
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,560
latency plus 100 milliseconds of jitter

2535
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:52,560
that's which could be anywhere from zero

2536
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,880
to zero to 100 milliseconds on top so

2537
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,080
then your latency could be from 150 to

2538
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,119
150 milliseconds now you got 100

2539
01:25:56,079 --> 01:25:57,920
milliseconds that you don't know what to

2540
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:01,279
do with

2541
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:02,880
and and that's basically random

2542
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:04,079
so getting rid of jitter is extremely

2543
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,679
important

2544
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:07,279
and that affects your control decisions

2545
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:08,639
and all those kinds of things

2546
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:10,079
okay

2547
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:11,440
um yeah the car is just going to

2548
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:14,238
fundamentally maneuver better with lower

2549
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:14,238
jitter um

2550
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:18,319
the cars will maneuver with superhuman

2551
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:20,238
ability and reaction time much faster

2552
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:23,599
than a human

2553
01:26:20,238 --> 01:26:25,519
i mean i think over time the

2554
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:28,079
autopilot full self driving will be

2555
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,120
capable of maneuvers that um

2556
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:31,359
you know

2557
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:31,359
uh

2558
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:35,359
you know are far more than what like

2559
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,119
james bond could do in like the best

2560
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:39,679
movie type of thing that's exactly what

2561
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:41,760
i was imagining in my mind as you said

2562
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:44,880
um it's like an impossible maneuvers

2563
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:47,520
that a human couldn't do you know so

2564
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:49,359
well let me ask sort of uh looking back

2565
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,960
the six years looking out into the

2566
01:26:49,359 --> 01:26:52,880
future based on your current

2567
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,439
understanding how hard do you think this

2568
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:57,920
is this full self-driving problem when

2569
01:26:55,439 --> 01:27:00,399
do you think tesla will solve level four

2570
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,399
fsd

2571
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,360
i mean it's looking quite likely that it

2572
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:07,039
will be next year

2573
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:09,198
and what does the solution look like is

2574
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:11,198
it the current pool of fsd beta

2575
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:12,960
candidates

2576
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:14,399
they start getting greater and greater

2577
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,239
as they have been

2578
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:17,198
degrees of autonomy and then there's a

2579
01:27:16,238 --> 01:27:19,198
certain

2580
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:20,879
level beyond which

2581
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:22,799
they can they can do their own they can

2582
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,159
read a book

2583
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,440
yeah so

2584
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:27,119
uh

2585
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:28,238
i mean you can see anybody who's been

2586
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:30,479
following the

2587
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:33,039
fossil driving beta closely

2588
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:34,079
will see that the um

2589
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:36,158
the

2590
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:37,279
rate of disengagements has been dropping

2591
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:39,439
rapidly

2592
01:27:37,279 --> 01:27:41,279
so like a disengagement b where where

2593
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:43,439
the driver intervenes to prevent the car

2594
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:45,198
from doing something right uh

2595
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:47,839
dangerous potentially so

2596
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:47,839
um

2597
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:53,360
so the interventions

2598
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,679
you know per million miles has been

2599
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:57,599
dropping uh dramatically at some point

2600
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:58,480
the

2601
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,920
and that

2602
01:27:58,479 --> 01:28:03,439
trend looks like it happens next year is

2603
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:08,399
the the the

2604
01:28:03,439 --> 01:28:10,238
probability of an accident on fsd uh is

2605
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:11,759
uh less than that of the average human

2606
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:16,000
and then and then significantly less

2607
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:17,039
than that of the average human um so

2608
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,399
it certainly

2609
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:21,679
appears like we will get there next year

2610
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:23,039
um

2611
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:24,560
then of course

2612
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:26,000
that then there's going to be a case of

2613
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,920
okay we now have to prove this to

2614
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,319
regulators and prove it to you know and

2615
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,800
and we we want a standard that is not

2616
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:34,238
just equivalent to a human but

2617
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,679
uh much better than the average human i

2618
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:37,919
think it's got to be at least two or

2619
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:39,679
three times uh higher

2620
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,440
safety than a human so two or three

2621
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:42,480
times lower probability of injury than a

2622
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:44,719
human

2623
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:46,238
before before we would actually say like

2624
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:47,119
okay it's okay to go it's not going to

2625
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,158
be equivalent it's going to be much

2626
01:28:47,119 --> 01:28:51,198
better

2627
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:54,238
so if you look uh 10 point fsd

2628
01:28:51,198 --> 01:28:55,279
10.6 just came out recently 10.7 is on

2629
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:57,599
the way

2630
01:28:55,279 --> 01:29:00,399
maybe 11 is on the way somewhere in the

2631
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,440
future yeah um we were hoping to get 11

2632
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:06,158
out this year but it's uh

2633
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:08,158
11 actually has a whole bunch of uh

2634
01:29:06,158 --> 01:29:10,638
fundamental rewrites on the neural

2635
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:12,319
neural net architecture

2636
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:14,000
and some

2637
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:15,279
fundamental improvements

2638
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,039
in

2639
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:19,519
creating vector space

2640
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:22,079
uh so

2641
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,000
there is a some fundamental like leap

2642
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:26,800
that really deserves the 11. i mean

2643
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:29,039
that's a pretty cool number yeah yeah

2644
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:31,039
uh 11 would be uh

2645
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:33,679
a single stack for all you know one

2646
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:36,158
stack to rule them all um

2647
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:37,679
and uh

2648
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:38,879
but but there's just some really

2649
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,399
fundamental

2650
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,359
uh

2651
01:29:40,399 --> 01:29:46,319
neural net architecture changes that are

2652
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:49,198
that that will allow for

2653
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:50,479
uh much more capability but but

2654
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:52,960
you know at first they're gonna have

2655
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:54,959
issues so like we have this working on

2656
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:58,239
like sort of alpha software and it's

2657
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:00,480
it's good but it's uh

2658
01:29:58,238 --> 01:30:03,599
it's it it's basically taking a whole

2659
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:05,279
bunch of c c plus code and and deleting

2660
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,800
a massive amount of c plus plus go and

2661
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:08,960
replacing it with the neural net and you

2662
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:10,239
know andre um makes this point a lot

2663
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,079
which is like neural nets like kind of

2664
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:14,079
eating software

2665
01:30:12,079 --> 01:30:15,920
you know over time there's like

2666
01:30:14,079 --> 01:30:17,760
less and less conventional software more

2667
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,600
and more neural net we're just still

2668
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,039
software but it's you know

2669
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,920
still comes out the lines of software

2670
01:30:21,039 --> 01:30:24,880
but

2671
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:26,158
uh let's just more more neural net stuff

2672
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,000
uh and less

2673
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:31,279
uh

2674
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,119
you know heuristics basically um

2675
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:36,238
if you're

2676
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:38,399
more more more uh matrix based

2677
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:42,399
stuff and less uh

2678
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:42,399
heuristics based stuff um

2679
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,199
and um

2680
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:51,759
you know like like like one of the big

2681
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:54,159
changes will be um

2682
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:56,400
like right now the neural nets

2683
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:57,519
uh will

2684
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:01,759
um

2685
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:03,679
deliver a giant bag of points

2686
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,679
to the c plus plus or c and c plus plus

2687
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:08,079
code yeah um

2688
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:10,399
we call the giant bag of points yeah uh

2689
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:11,519
and it's like so you go to pixel and and

2690
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:12,960
and

2691
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,280
something associated with that pixel

2692
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,760
like this pixel is probably car the

2693
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:19,119
pixel is probably lane line

2694
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,320
then you've got to assemble this giant

2695
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:23,679
bag of points

2696
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:26,079
in the c code and turn it into

2697
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:26,079
vectors

2698
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,840
and it does a pretty good job of it but

2699
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,960
it's

2700
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,000
it's a

2701
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,158
it's

2702
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,800
we want to just we need another layer of

2703
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:38,479
neural nets on top of that to take the

2704
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,960
giant bag of points

2705
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:44,158
and distill that down to

2706
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,840
uh vector space in the neural net part

2707
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:46,960
of the software as opposed to the

2708
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:48,560
heuristics

2709
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,399
part of the software

2710
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:52,400
this is a big improvement

2711
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:54,238
um you know that's all the way down it's

2712
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:57,039
what you want it's not even your only

2713
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:59,599
realness but it's it's it's uh this will

2714
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:01,840
be just a ga this is a game changer to

2715
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:04,400
not have the bag of points the giant bag

2716
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:07,760
of points that has to be assembled with

2717
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:09,198
um many lines of cfc plus plus uh and

2718
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,960
and have the

2719
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:13,359
and have a neural net just assemble

2720
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:16,000
those into a vector so so that the

2721
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:17,759
neural net is outputting

2722
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,679
um

2723
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:22,000
much much less data it's it's it's

2724
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,679
outputting this this is a lane line this

2725
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,198
is a curve this is drivable space this

2726
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:28,719
is a card this is a you know a

2727
01:32:27,198 --> 01:32:30,559
pedestrian or a cyclist or something

2728
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:32,000
like that it's outputting

2729
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:34,080
um

2730
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,319
it's really outputting

2731
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:37,359
um profit vectors to

2732
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:39,840
the

2733
01:32:37,359 --> 01:32:42,000
the cc plus less control control code as

2734
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:44,239
opposed to

2735
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,800
this sort of

2736
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:48,879
constructing the the vectors

2737
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,239
uh in c

2738
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,600
um

2739
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:54,638
which we've done i think quite a good

2740
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:56,800
job of but it's it's a it you're kind of

2741
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:58,400
hitting a local maximum on the how well

2742
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,520
the c can do this

2743
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:01,599
um

2744
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,800
so this is this is really this is really

2745
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:04,320
a big deal

2746
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,560
and and just all of the networks in the

2747
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:08,319
car need need to move to surround video

2748
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:11,920
there's still some legacy networks that

2749
01:33:08,319 --> 01:33:13,920
are not surround video

2750
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:15,920
and all of the training needs to move to

2751
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,760
surround video and the efficiency of the

2752
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,800
training uh it needs to get better and

2753
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,840
it is

2754
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:22,880
and then we need to move everything to

2755
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,960
uh raw

2756
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:27,359
uh photon

2757
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:29,760
counts as opposed to um

2758
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:31,279
processed images okay so which is just

2759
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:33,440
quite a big reset on the training

2760
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:35,519
because the system's trained on post

2761
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:37,279
processed image images so we need to

2762
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,239
redo all the training

2763
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:40,800
uh

2764
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:42,399
to train against the the

2765
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,960
raw photon accounts instead of the

2766
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:46,479
post-processed image so ultimately it's

2767
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,679
kind of reducing the complexity of the

2768
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:51,839
whole thing so uh reducing reducing

2769
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:53,600
lines of code will actually go lower

2770
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,520
yeah that's fascinating

2771
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:57,120
um so you're doing fusion of all the

2772
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,520
sensors so reducing the complexity of

2773
01:33:57,119 --> 01:34:02,639
having to deal with these cameras

2774
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,639
cameras really right yes

2775
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:07,520
um same with humans

2776
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:08,639
yeah well i guess we got years too okay

2777
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:11,280
yeah well we'll actually need to

2778
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:13,520
incorporate um sound as well um because

2779
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:15,759
you know you need to like listen for

2780
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,679
ambulance sirens or you know fire trucks

2781
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,360
you know uh

2782
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:20,560
somebody like

2783
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:21,920
you know yelling at you or something i

2784
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,360
don't know just that there's there's a

2785
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,960
little bit of audio that needs to be

2786
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:26,639
incorporated as well do you need a

2787
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,719
cookie bath break yeah we listen to the

2788
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:30,960
trolls take a break okay

2789
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:33,439
honestly frankly

2790
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,880
like the ideas are the easy thing and

2791
01:34:33,439 --> 01:34:36,799
the implementation is the hard thing

2792
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,480
like the idea of going to the moon is is

2793
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,560
the easy part but going to the moon is

2794
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:42,158
the hard part it's the hard part um and

2795
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:44,400
there's a lot of like hardcore

2796
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:46,719
engineering that's got to get done

2797
01:34:44,399 --> 01:34:50,319
at the hardware and software level uh

2798
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:52,560
likes it optimizing the c compiler and

2799
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:54,479
just you know uh

2800
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:55,760
cutting out latency

2801
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:57,039
everywhere

2802
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:58,560
like this is

2803
01:34:57,039 --> 01:35:01,118
if we don't do this the system will not

2804
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,880
work properly um so

2805
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:05,519
the work of the engineers doing this

2806
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,600
they are like the unsung heroes you know

2807
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,960
but they are critical to the success of

2808
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,320
the situation

2809
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,520
i think you made it clear i mean at

2810
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:13,359
least to me it's super exciting

2811
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,960
everything that's going on outside of

2812
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:16,238
what andre is doing

2813
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,760
yeah just the whole infrastructure of

2814
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:19,198
the software

2815
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,679
i mean everything is going on with data

2816
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:24,638
engine uh whatever whatever it's called

2817
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:26,800
the whole process is just

2818
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:28,480
the scale of it is boggle's mind like

2819
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,159
the training the amount of work done

2820
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:32,959
with like we've written all this custom

2821
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:34,960
software for training and labeling

2822
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,719
um and to do order labeling auto

2823
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,158
leveling is essential

2824
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:39,359
um

2825
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:40,960
because especially when you've got like

2826
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:43,759
surround video

2827
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:45,600
it's very difficult to like label

2828
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:48,079
surround video from scratch is extremely

2829
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:49,440
difficult um

2830
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:51,279
like take a human

2831
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:53,599
such a long time to even label one video

2832
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:55,759
clip like several hours

2833
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,840
or the order label it

2834
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,039
basically would just apply like heavy

2835
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:00,400
duty

2836
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:02,158
uh

2837
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:03,839
like a lot of compute to the to the

2838
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:05,920
video clips um

2839
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,440
to pre-assign

2840
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:08,880
and guess what all the things are that

2841
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:11,039
are going on in the surround video and

2842
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,480
then there's like correcting it yeah and

2843
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:14,800
then all the human has to do is like

2844
01:36:12,479 --> 01:36:17,359
tweet like say this you know chan adjust

2845
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,199
what is incorrect this this is like

2846
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:21,198
increasing increases productivity by

2847
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:23,519
effect 100 or more

2848
01:36:21,198 --> 01:36:25,359
yeah uh so you've presented teslabot as

2849
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,360
primarily useful in the factory first of

2850
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:30,158
all i think humanoid robots are

2851
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:30,880
incredible from a fan of robotics i

2852
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:33,759
think

2853
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:36,560
uh the elegance of movement that cuba um

2854
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:39,360
the humanoid robots the bipedal robots

2855
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,560
show are just so cool so it's uh really

2856
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:42,319
interesting that you're working on this

2857
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,639
and also talking about applying the same

2858
01:36:42,319 --> 01:36:46,319
kind of all the ideas of some of which

2859
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:48,079
we've talked about with data engine all

2860
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:50,799
the things that we're talking about with

2861
01:36:48,079 --> 01:36:52,719
tesla autopilot just uh transferring

2862
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,480
that over to the just yet another

2863
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:56,639
robotics problem

2864
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:58,559
i have to ask since i care about human

2865
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:00,560
robot interaction so the human side of

2866
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:03,679
that so you've talked about mostly in

2867
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:05,360
the factory do you see it uh also do you

2868
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:07,359
see part of this problem that tesla bot

2869
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:09,039
has to solve is interacting with humans

2870
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:10,399
and potentially having a place like in

2871
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:12,238
the home

2872
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:14,638
so interacting not just sure not

2873
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:15,678
replacing labor but also like

2874
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:17,039
i don't know

2875
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:19,359
being a friend

2876
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:21,439
or an assistant yeah i think the

2877
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:24,158
possibilities are

2878
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:24,158
you know endless

2879
01:37:27,039 --> 01:37:32,000
yeah i mean it's it's obviously like a

2880
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,440
it's not quite in tesla's primary

2881
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,359
mission direction of accelerating

2882
01:37:33,439 --> 01:37:36,559
sustainable energy but

2883
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:38,238
it is a

2884
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,920
an extremely useful thing that we can do

2885
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:42,000
for the world which is to make a useful

2886
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,359
humanoid robot

2887
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,719
that is capable of

2888
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:46,719
interacting with the world and

2889
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:53,359
helping in in many different ways uh so

2890
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:55,359
certainly in fact reason and really just

2891
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:56,559
just i mean i think if you say like

2892
01:37:55,359 --> 01:37:58,719
uh

2893
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:00,080
extrapolate to you know many years in

2894
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:01,679
the future it's like

2895
01:38:00,079 --> 01:38:04,880
i i think

2896
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:06,079
uh work will become optional

2897
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:07,920
so

2898
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:09,039
like there's a lot of jobs that

2899
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:11,279
if you if

2900
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:12,719
people weren't paid to do it they would

2901
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:15,039
they wouldn't do it like it's not it's

2902
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:16,560
not fun you know necessarily like

2903
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:17,279
if you're washing dishes all day it's

2904
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,239
like

2905
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:19,599
you know

2906
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:20,879
even if you really like washing dishes

2907
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:25,119
you really want to do it for eight hours

2908
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:27,199
a day every day probably not so

2909
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:29,439
um and then there's like dangerous work

2910
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:31,039
and basically if it's dangerous boring

2911
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:32,879
uh has like

2912
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:34,639
potential for repetitive stress injury

2913
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,400
that kind of thing um

2914
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:39,039
then that's really where

2915
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:40,479
humanoid robots would add the most value

2916
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:42,158
initially

2917
01:38:40,479 --> 01:38:46,000
um so that's

2918
01:38:42,158 --> 01:38:47,839
what we're aiming for is is to um

2919
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,679
for the human robots to do jobs that

2920
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:50,880
people don't don't voluntarily want to

2921
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:51,679
do

2922
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,039
um

2923
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,880
and then we'll have to pair that

2924
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:57,039
obviously with some kind of universal

2925
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,400
basic income in the future

2926
01:38:57,039 --> 01:39:00,880
so

2927
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:02,399
i think um

2928
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:06,159
so do you see a world when there's like

2929
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:08,079
hundreds of millions of tesla bots

2930
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:12,158
doing different performing different

2931
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:13,279
tasks throughout the world

2932
01:39:12,158 --> 01:39:14,799
yeah i haven't really thought about it

2933
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:17,599
that far into the future but i guess

2934
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:19,760
that there may be something like that um

2935
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,760
so

2936
01:39:20,238 --> 01:39:24,799
ask a wild question so

2937
01:39:22,479 --> 01:39:26,799
the the number of tesla cars has been

2938
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,960
accelerating there's been close to 2

2939
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:31,039
million produced many of them have

2940
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:32,319
autopilot i think we're over 2 million

2941
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:33,600
now yeah

2942
01:39:32,319 --> 01:39:35,920
do you think there will ever be a time

2943
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:39,480
when there will be more tesla bots

2944
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,480
than tesla cars

2945
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:43,760
yeah i i i i

2946
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:45,118
you know actually it's funny you asked

2947
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,239
this question because normally i do try

2948
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:47,279
to think

2949
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:49,839
pretty far into the future but i haven't

2950
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:51,439
really thought that far into the future

2951
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:55,440
with the with the

2952
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:58,638
tesla bot or it's code named optimus

2953
01:39:55,439 --> 01:39:58,638
i call it optimus subprime

2954
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:04,319
because that's not it's not like a giant

2955
01:40:01,118 --> 01:40:05,359
you know transformer robot um

2956
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:06,880
so

2957
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:08,799
uh

2958
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,400
but it's meant to be a general purpose

2959
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,639
help help robot

2960
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:12,638
um

2961
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:17,039
and and basically like like the things

2962
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:18,399
that were

2963
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:20,000
basically

2964
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:23,198
like tesla

2965
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,880
i think um is the has the most advanced

2966
01:40:23,198 --> 01:40:26,238
real-world ai

2967
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,920
uh for interacting with the real world

2968
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:30,079
which we've developed as a function of

2969
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:32,158
to to make self-driving work

2970
01:40:30,079 --> 01:40:34,319
um and so

2971
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:35,679
along with custom hardware and

2972
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:37,920
like a lot of

2973
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:39,760
you know uh hardcore low-level software

2974
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,600
to have it run efficiently and be you

2975
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:43,440
know power efficient because because you

2976
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,800
know it's one thing to do neural nets if

2977
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:46,960
you've got a gigantic server room with

2978
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,560
10 000 computers but now let's say you

2979
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,439
just you have to now distill that down

2980
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,960
into

2981
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:53,359
one computer that's running at low power

2982
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,639
in a humanoid robot or a car

2983
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:56,079
that's actually very difficult a lot of

2984
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:56,960
hardcore software work is required for

2985
01:40:56,079 --> 01:40:58,960
that

2986
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,679
um

2987
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,719
so

2988
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:05,039
so since we're kind of like solving the

2989
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:07,520
navigate the real world

2990
01:41:05,039 --> 01:41:08,960
with neural nets problem for

2991
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,000
cars which are kind of like robots with

2992
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,600
four wheels

2993
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,600
then it's like kind of a natural

2994
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:17,920
extension of that is to

2995
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:20,320
put it in a robot with arms and legs uh

2996
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:22,560
and actually you know actuators um

2997
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:22,559
so

2998
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:27,759
um

2999
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:29,359
like like the the two

3000
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,440
like the hard things are like you

3001
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:33,118
basically need to make the

3002
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:34,559
have the rower be intelligent enough to

3003
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:35,759
interact in a sensible way with the

3004
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,880
environment

3005
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,039
um

3006
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,000
so you need real real world ai and you

3007
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:43,359
need

3008
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,039
to be very good at um manufacturing

3009
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:46,559
which is a very hard problem tails is

3010
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:50,079
very good at manufacturing

3011
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:52,639
and also uh has the real world ai so

3012
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:55,519
making the humanoid robot work is

3013
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:57,679
uh basically it means developing

3014
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:00,639
custom

3015
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:02,079
motors and sensors

3016
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:03,039
that that are different from what a car

3017
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:04,000
would use

3018
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:06,158
um

3019
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,920
but we also we have

3020
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:11,279
um

3021
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:13,840
i think with the the best expertise in

3022
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:16,319
developing advanced electric motors and

3023
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:18,319
power electronics so

3024
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:21,920
it just has to be for

3025
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:21,920
humanoid robot application on a car

3026
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:27,679
still you do talk about love sometimes

3027
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:29,360
so let me ask this isn't like for like

3028
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:30,719
sex robots or something i love is the

3029
01:42:29,359 --> 01:42:31,839
answer

3030
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:33,279
yes

3031
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:35,039
uh

3032
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:37,599
there is something compelling

3033
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:38,560
to us not compelling but we connect with

3034
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,639
the

3035
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:43,039
humanoid robots or even lego robots like

3036
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:45,760
with the dog and she shapes with dogs

3037
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:48,079
it just it seems like you know there's a

3038
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,079
huge amount of loneliness in this world

3039
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:51,600
all of us seek companionship and with

3040
01:42:50,079 --> 01:42:53,679
other humans friendship and all those

3041
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:56,560
kinds of things we have a lot of here in

3042
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:58,560
austin a lot of people have dogs

3043
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:01,840
there seems to be a huge opportunity to

3044
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:03,600
also have robots that decrease

3045
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:05,440
the uh

3046
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:08,239
the the amount of loneliness in the

3047
01:43:05,439 --> 01:43:09,678
world or help us humans connect with

3048
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:12,000
each with each other

3049
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:14,239
so in a way that dogs can

3050
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,399
um do you think about that we test about

3051
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:17,599
it all or is it really focused on the

3052
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:19,759
problem of

3053
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,760
of performing specific tasks not

3054
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:23,280
connecting with humans

3055
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:25,360
um

3056
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:27,198
i mean to be honest i have not actually

3057
01:43:25,359 --> 01:43:29,198
thought about it from the companionship

3058
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:31,198
standpoint but i think it actually would

3059
01:43:29,198 --> 01:43:32,799
end up being it could be actually a very

3060
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:34,238
good companion

3061
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,039
um

3062
01:43:34,238 --> 01:43:36,959
and

3063
01:43:35,039 --> 01:43:39,920
it could

3064
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:41,198
develop like a personality

3065
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,359
uh

3066
01:43:41,198 --> 01:43:45,359
over time that is that is like

3067
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:47,279
unique like uh you know it's not like

3068
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:49,679
they're just all the robots are the same

3069
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:53,359
and that personality could evolve

3070
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:56,158
to be you know uh

3071
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:58,238
match match the the the owner or the you

3072
01:43:56,158 --> 01:44:00,479
know or i guess

3073
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:02,238
the owner uh well

3074
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:04,399
whatever you want to call it uh the

3075
01:44:02,238 --> 01:44:06,718
other the companion the other half right

3076
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:09,519
uh the same way their friends do see i

3077
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:11,198
think that's a huge opportunity i think

3078
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,679
yeah no that's interesting

3079
01:44:11,198 --> 01:44:14,399
like um

3080
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:16,560
the

3081
01:44:14,399 --> 01:44:18,799
because you know like there's a

3082
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:20,719
japanese phrase i like the uh

3083
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,000
wabi-sabi you know uh the subtle

3084
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:24,000
imperfections

3085
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,158
are what makes something special

3086
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,920
and the subtle imperfections of the

3087
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:29,839
personality of the robot

3088
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:32,480
mapped to the subtle imperfections of

3089
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,480
the robot's

3090
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:37,199
human friend i don't know owner sounds

3091
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:39,280
like maybe the wrong word but

3092
01:44:37,198 --> 01:44:41,359
um

3093
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:44,319
could actually make an incredible buddy

3094
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:46,479
basically and in that way the r2d2 or

3095
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:49,840
like a c-3po sort of thing you know so

3096
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:51,519
from a machine learning perspective

3097
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:54,159
i think the flaws

3098
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:56,239
being a feature is really nice you could

3099
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:57,359
be quite terrible at being a robot for

3100
01:44:56,238 --> 01:44:59,118
quite a while

3101
01:44:57,359 --> 01:45:01,920
in the general home environment or all

3102
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:04,079
the in general world and that's kind of

3103
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:05,920
adorable and that's like those are your

3104
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:07,920
flaws and you fall in love with those

3105
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,679
flaws so it's it's

3106
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,039
very different than autonomous driving

3107
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:13,039
where it's a very high stakes

3108
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:14,079
environment you cannot mess up

3109
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:16,479
and so

3110
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:17,519
yeah it's more fun to be a robot in the

3111
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:19,599
home

3112
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:20,400
yeah in fact if you think of like c-3po

3113
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:22,480
and

3114
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:24,399
r2d2 yeah like they actually had a lot

3115
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:26,319
of like flaws and imperfections and

3116
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:28,479
silly things and they would argue with

3117
01:45:26,319 --> 01:45:30,479
each other

3118
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:31,919
and um were they actually good at doing

3119
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:33,919
anything

3120
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:35,760
i'm not exactly sure

3121
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,079
they definitely added a lot to the story

3122
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,079
um

3123
01:45:38,238 --> 01:45:41,919
but but there's they're sort of quirky

3124
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,960
elements and

3125
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,719
you know

3126
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,880
that they would like make mistakes and

3127
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,480
do things like it was like uh it made

3128
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:50,719
them

3129
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:52,238
relatable i don't know um

3130
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:53,359
endearing

3131
01:45:52,238 --> 01:45:54,718
so

3132
01:45:53,359 --> 01:45:57,198
so yeah i think that that could be

3133
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:58,800
something that uh probably would happen

3134
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:01,039
um

3135
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:04,239
but our initial focus is just to make it

3136
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:05,600
useful uh so that so

3137
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:06,879
um

3138
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,199
i'm confident we'll get it done i'm not

3139
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:11,039
sure what the exact time frame is but uh

3140
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:12,799
like we'll probably have i don't know

3141
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:13,679
a decent prototype

3142
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,360
towards the end of next year or

3143
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:17,118
something like that

3144
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:19,279
and it's cool that it's connected to

3145
01:46:17,118 --> 01:46:20,960
tesla the car

3146
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:23,039
the so so yeah

3147
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:25,840
it's using a lot of you know it would

3148
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:27,760
use the autopilot inference computer and

3149
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:29,679
um a lot of the training that we've done

3150
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:31,199
for the four cars in terms of

3151
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:32,800
recognizing

3152
01:46:31,198 --> 01:46:34,960
real world things could be applied

3153
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:37,279
directly to the

3154
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:39,279
to the robot um

3155
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:40,880
so it but but there's there's a lot of

3156
01:46:39,279 --> 01:46:42,399
custom actuators and sensors that need

3157
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:44,480
to be developed

3158
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:45,359
and an extra module on top of the vector

3159
01:46:44,479 --> 01:46:46,959
space

3160
01:46:45,359 --> 01:46:49,920
uh for love

3161
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:49,920
oh yeah that's missing

3162
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:54,479
okay okay add that to the car too

3163
01:46:53,118 --> 01:46:55,359
that's true

3164
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:57,279
um

3165
01:46:55,359 --> 01:46:58,719
that could be useful in all environments

3166
01:46:57,279 --> 01:47:00,399
like you said a lot of people argue in

3167
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:01,679
the car so maybe people can help them

3168
01:47:00,399 --> 01:47:03,839
out

3169
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:05,920
uh you're a student of history fan of

3170
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:08,400
dan carlin's hardcore history podcast

3171
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:10,560
yeah that's great greatest podcast ever

3172
01:47:08,399 --> 01:47:12,799
yeah i think it is actually

3173
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,639
i i it does it almost doesn't really

3174
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:17,360
count as a podcast yeah it's it's it's

3175
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:18,960
more like a audiobook yeah so you were

3176
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:20,960
on the podcast with dan i just had to

3177
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:22,560
chat with him about it

3178
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,760
he said you guys want military and all

3179
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:27,920
that kind of stuff uh yeah it's

3180
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:29,039
literally uh it was basically um

3181
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:30,880
uh

3182
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:33,519
i think it should be titled engineer

3183
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,440
wars uh essentially like like when

3184
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:36,480
there's a rapid change in the rate of

3185
01:47:35,439 --> 01:47:38,079
technology

3186
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:40,319
then uh

3187
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:42,000
engineering plays a pivotal role in in

3188
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:43,759
victory in battle

3189
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,359
um

3190
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:46,880
how far in back in history did you go

3191
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:48,319
did you go world war ii

3192
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:50,719
uh it was mostly

3193
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:52,960
well it was supposed to be a deep dive

3194
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:55,359
on fighters and bomber

3195
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,800
uh technology in world war ii um but

3196
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:58,399
that ended up being more wide-ranging

3197
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,079
than that um

3198
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:01,679
because i just went down the total rat

3199
01:48:00,079 --> 01:48:03,600
hole of like

3200
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:06,319
studying all of the fighters and bombers

3201
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:09,280
world war ii and like the constant rock

3202
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:10,799
paper scissors game that like you know

3203
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:12,158
uh one country would make this plane

3204
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:13,760
that would make a plane to beat that and

3205
01:48:12,158 --> 01:48:15,359
that try to make plane to beat that and

3206
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,960
then

3207
01:48:15,359 --> 01:48:20,399
and really what matters like the pace of

3208
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:21,840
innovation um and also access to high

3209
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:24,719
quality uh

3210
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:27,039
fuel and uh raw materials

3211
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:28,960
so like germany had like some amazing

3212
01:48:27,039 --> 01:48:30,319
designs but they couldn't make them uh

3213
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,439
because they couldn't get their raw

3214
01:48:30,319 --> 01:48:32,639
materials

3215
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:34,000
and uh

3216
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:37,359
they they had a real problem with the

3217
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,840
oil and and and uh fuel basically the

3218
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:41,439
fuel quality was extremely uh variable

3219
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,920
so the design wasn't the bottom that

3220
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:46,879
goes uh yeah like the us had kick-ass

3221
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:48,158
fuel uh that was like very consistent

3222
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,400
like the problems if you make a very

3223
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:51,679
high performance aircraft engine um in

3224
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:53,198
order to make high performance you have

3225
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:55,600
to um

3226
01:48:53,198 --> 01:48:55,599
the the

3227
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:03,199
the fuel the aviation gas uh

3228
01:48:59,198 --> 01:49:05,678
has to be a consistent mixture and uh

3229
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:07,198
uh it has to have a high high octane

3230
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:08,480
um

3231
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:09,839
like high octane is the most important

3232
01:49:08,479 --> 01:49:12,319
thing but also can't have like

3233
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:14,800
impurities and stuff uh because you'll

3234
01:49:12,319 --> 01:49:16,399
fill up the engine and and and german

3235
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,639
just never had good access oil like they

3236
01:49:16,399 --> 01:49:20,269
tried to get it by invading the caucasus

3237
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:21,679
um but that didn't work too well

3238
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:25,199
[Laughter]

3239
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:25,199
that never works well for him

3240
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:29,598
that's nice for you so they always was

3241
01:49:28,238 --> 01:49:31,598
germany was always struggling with [ __ ]

3242
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:33,599
with basically shitty oil um and then

3243
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:35,679
they could not uh

3244
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:37,440
they couldn't count on a on high quality

3245
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:39,039
fuel for their aircraft so then they had

3246
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:40,479
to add all they have all these additives

3247
01:49:39,039 --> 01:49:43,118
and and stuff

3248
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:45,598
uh so um

3249
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:46,880
uh whereas the u.s had awesome fuel um

3250
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:49,119
and that provided that to britain as

3251
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,639
well um so

3252
01:49:49,118 --> 01:49:52,960
that allowed the british and the

3253
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:54,880
americans to design aircraft engines

3254
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:57,840
that were uh super high performance

3255
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:59,440
better than anything else in the world

3256
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:00,400
and germany germany could could design

3257
01:49:59,439 --> 01:50:03,598
the engines they just didn't have the

3258
01:50:00,399 --> 01:50:05,598
fuel and then also the likes of the the

3259
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:06,800
uh the quality of the aluminum allies

3260
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:09,760
that they were getting was also not that

3261
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:11,440
great and so yeah did you is this like

3262
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:13,520
uh you talked about all this with dan

3263
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:15,598
yep awesome

3264
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:18,400
broadly looking at history when you look

3265
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:20,480
at genghis khan when you look at stalin

3266
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:22,000
hitler the darkest moments of human

3267
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:23,439
history

3268
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,960
uh what do you take away from those

3269
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:26,799
moments does it help you gain insight

3270
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,158
about human nature about human behavior

3271
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:30,320
today

3272
01:50:28,158 --> 01:50:32,399
whether it's the wars or the individuals

3273
01:50:30,319 --> 01:50:35,880
or just the behavior of people any

3274
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:35,879
aspects of history

3275
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:46,239
yeah i find history fascinating

3276
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:46,239
um

3277
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:54,000
there's a lot of incredible things that

3278
01:50:51,198 --> 01:50:56,559
have been done good and bad um

3279
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,560
that they

3280
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,118
help

3281
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:00,719
help you understand

3282
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:03,439
the nature of

3283
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:06,079
civilization um

3284
01:51:03,439 --> 01:51:07,519
and individuals and

3285
01:51:06,079 --> 01:51:09,519
does it make you sad that humans do

3286
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:13,119
these kinds of things to each other you

3287
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:15,679
look at the 20th century world war ii

3288
01:51:13,118 --> 01:51:17,198
the cruelty the abuse of power

3289
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:20,480
talk about

3290
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:22,158
communism marxism and stalin um

3291
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:23,118
i mean some of these things do i mean if

3292
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:25,279
you

3293
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:26,559
like there's a lot of human history um

3294
01:51:25,279 --> 01:51:27,599
most of it is

3295
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,520
actually people just getting on with

3296
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:30,560
their lives uh you know and and it's not

3297
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,320
like

3298
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:34,960
human history is just

3299
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:37,439
uh what nonstop war and

3300
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:39,118
disaster is it's those are actually just

3301
01:51:37,439 --> 01:51:41,039
those are intermittent and rare and if

3302
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:42,639
they weren't then

3303
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:43,519
you know humans would soon cease to

3304
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:45,760
exist

3305
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,760
um

3306
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:49,279
uh but

3307
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:53,359
it's just that wars tend to be written

3308
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:55,039
about a lot and whereas like uh

3309
01:51:53,359 --> 01:51:56,158
something being like well a normal year

3310
01:51:55,039 --> 01:51:57,679
where nothing

3311
01:51:56,158 --> 01:51:59,519
major happened was doesn't get written

3312
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:01,039
about much but that's

3313
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:03,199
you know most people just like farming

3314
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:04,479
and kind of like living their life you

3315
01:52:03,198 --> 01:52:05,919
know

3316
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:08,319
being a villager

3317
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:08,319
somewhere

3318
01:52:09,039 --> 01:52:13,439
and every now and again there's a war

3319
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:13,440
and i think so

3320
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:19,840
um and um you know what i'll say like

3321
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:21,599
that

3322
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:22,960
there aren't very many books that i

3323
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:24,480
where i just had to stop reading because

3324
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:25,840
it was just too

3325
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:27,118
too dark

3326
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:28,960
but uh

3327
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:30,639
the book about stalin the court of the

3328
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,800
reds are

3329
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:34,639
i could have stopped reading it was just

3330
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,840
too too bad

3331
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:37,199
dark

3332
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,800
rough

3333
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:41,198
yeah

3334
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:44,239
um the 30s

3335
01:52:41,198 --> 01:52:47,519
uh there's a lot of lessons there to me

3336
01:52:44,238 --> 01:52:49,919
in particular that it feels like

3337
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:52,320
humans like all of us have that as the

3338
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:54,639
old soldier knits in line

3339
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:56,639
um that the line between good and evil

3340
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:58,239
runs to the heart every man that all of

3341
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:59,920
us are capable of evil all of us are

3342
01:52:58,238 --> 01:53:02,079
capable of good it's almost like this

3343
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:04,399
kind of responsibility that

3344
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:05,599
um all of us have to

3345
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:08,000
to

3346
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:10,079
to tend towards the good and so like to

3347
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,359
me looking at history is almost like an

3348
01:53:10,079 --> 01:53:14,079
example of

3349
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:16,799
look you have some charismatic leader

3350
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:18,319
that uh convinces you of things it's too

3351
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:20,639
easy

3352
01:53:18,319 --> 01:53:23,359
based on that story to do evil onto each

3353
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:25,039
other onto your family and to others and

3354
01:53:23,359 --> 01:53:26,559
so it's like our responsibility to do

3355
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:27,760
good

3356
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,599
it's not like

3357
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,119
now is somehow different from history

3358
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:32,639
that can happen again all of it can

3359
01:53:31,118 --> 01:53:34,960
happen again

3360
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:37,118
and yes most of the time you're right i

3361
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:38,880
mean the optimistic view here is

3362
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:41,920
mostly people are just living life and

3363
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:44,400
as you've often memed about

3364
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:46,719
the quality of life was way worse back

3365
01:53:44,399 --> 01:53:48,799
in the day and keeps improving over time

3366
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:51,439
through innovation to technology but

3367
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:52,960
still it's somehow notable that these

3368
01:53:51,439 --> 01:53:56,399
blimps of

3369
01:53:52,960 --> 01:54:00,239
atrocities happen sure

3370
01:53:56,399 --> 01:54:01,839
yeah i mean life was really tough

3371
01:54:00,238 --> 01:54:05,519
for most of history

3372
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:08,239
i mean really for most of human history

3373
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:10,800
a good year would be one where not that

3374
01:54:08,238 --> 01:54:13,678
many people in your village died of the

3375
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:16,400
plague starvation freezing to death or

3376
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:17,840
being killed by a neighboring village

3377
01:54:16,399 --> 01:54:19,198
it's like well it wasn't that bad you

3378
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,679
know it was only like you know we lost

3379
01:54:19,198 --> 01:54:23,359
five percent this year that was uh

3380
01:54:21,679 --> 01:54:24,880
yeah it was a good year you know that

3381
01:54:23,359 --> 01:54:26,479
would be par for the course

3382
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:28,719
like just just not starving to death

3383
01:54:26,479 --> 01:54:30,399
would have been like the primary goal of

3384
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:32,239
most people in through throughout

3385
01:54:30,399 --> 01:54:33,439
history just making sure we'll have

3386
01:54:32,238 --> 01:54:35,678
enough food to last through the winter

3387
01:54:33,439 --> 01:54:35,929
and not get in our freezer or whatever

3388
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:37,679
so

3389
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:39,920
[Music]

3390
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:42,480
um

3391
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:44,399
now food is is plentiful if i have an

3392
01:54:42,479 --> 01:54:46,000
obesity problem um

3393
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:48,079
you know so

3394
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,399
well yeah the lesson there is to be

3395
01:54:48,079 --> 01:54:52,880
grateful for the way things are now for

3396
01:54:50,399 --> 01:54:55,759
for some of us

3397
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:57,760
we've spoken about this offline

3398
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:59,760
i'd love to get your thought about it

3399
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:02,880
here

3400
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:04,400
if i sat down for a long form in-person

3401
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,800
conversation with the president of

3402
01:55:04,399 --> 01:55:08,638
russia vladimir putin

3403
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:10,159
would you potentially want to call in

3404
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:12,480
for a few minutes

3405
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:15,039
uh to join in on a conversation with him

3406
01:55:12,479 --> 01:55:19,439
moderated translated by me

3407
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:20,880
sure yeah sure i'd be happy to do that

3408
01:55:19,439 --> 01:55:21,919
you've shown interest in the russian

3409
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:23,520
language

3410
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:26,079
is this grounded in your interest in

3411
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:29,599
history of linguistics culture

3412
01:55:26,079 --> 01:55:32,719
general curiosity i think it sounds cool

3413
01:55:29,599 --> 01:55:35,760
sounds cool now it looks cool so uh well

3414
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:38,639
it's it's you know it's it's a

3415
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:39,840
it takes a moment to read cyrillic

3416
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:41,599
um

3417
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:44,000
once you know what the sort like

3418
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:46,560
characters stand for actually

3419
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,840
then reading russian becomes a lot

3420
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,840
easier because there are a lot of words

3421
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,319
that are actually the same like bank is

3422
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:52,319
bank

3423
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:53,920
[Laughter]

3424
01:55:52,319 --> 01:55:55,439
um

3425
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:57,359
and uh

3426
01:55:55,439 --> 01:55:58,638
so find the words that are exactly the

3427
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:00,799
same and now you start to understand

3428
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:03,279
cyrillic yeah if you can if you can

3429
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,480
sound it out then yeah

3430
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:05,840
it's much

3431
01:56:04,479 --> 01:56:09,198
there's at least some commonality of

3432
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:11,360
words what about the culture

3433
01:56:09,198 --> 01:56:13,359
you uh you love great engineering

3434
01:56:11,359 --> 01:56:15,359
physics there's a tradition of the

3435
01:56:13,359 --> 01:56:17,839
sciences there sure you look at the 20th

3436
01:56:15,359 --> 01:56:19,359
century from rocketry so

3437
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:21,679
you know some of the greatest rockets of

3438
01:56:19,359 --> 01:56:23,519
the space exploration has been done in

3439
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:26,399
the soviet in the former soviet union

3440
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:29,360
yeah so do you draw inspiration from

3441
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:31,198
that history just how this culture that

3442
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:33,039
in many ways i mean one of the sad

3443
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:35,519
things is because of the language

3444
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:37,519
a lot of it is lost to history because

3445
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,440
it's not translated all those kinds of

3446
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:41,760
because it it is in some ways an

3447
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:43,759
isolated culture it flourishes within

3448
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:46,800
its within its borders

3449
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:49,599
um yeah so do you draw inspiration from

3450
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:51,279
those folks from from the history of

3451
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:54,960
science engineering there

3452
01:56:51,279 --> 01:56:56,719
i mean the soviet union russia and

3453
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:58,079
ukraine as well

3454
01:56:56,719 --> 01:56:59,599
and uh

3455
01:56:58,079 --> 01:57:02,158
have a really

3456
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:04,159
strong history in space flight like some

3457
01:57:02,158 --> 01:57:07,759
of the most advanced and impressive

3458
01:57:04,158 --> 01:57:11,198
things in history were done uh

3459
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:11,369
you know by the soviet union um

3460
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:13,439
so

3461
01:57:11,369 --> 01:57:14,800
[Music]

3462
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:17,839
um

3463
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:19,119
one can cannot help but admire the

3464
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:20,079
impressive rocket technology that was

3465
01:57:19,118 --> 01:57:22,079
developed

3466
01:57:20,079 --> 01:57:23,118
um

3467
01:57:22,079 --> 01:57:24,639
you know after the sort of fall of

3468
01:57:23,118 --> 01:57:26,079
soviet union the

3469
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:26,960
there there's

3470
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:28,399
the

3471
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:29,279
there's much less that that that

3472
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:30,719
happened

3473
01:57:29,279 --> 01:57:33,359
um

3474
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:33,359
but uh

3475
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:36,879
still things are happening but it's not

3476
01:57:35,118 --> 01:57:40,559
not quite at the

3477
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:40,560
um frenetic piece that was happening

3478
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:46,880
before the soviet union kind of

3479
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:49,279
dissolved into separate republics

3480
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:50,719
yeah i mean i i you know there's ross

3481
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:53,118
cosmos the russian

3482
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:55,279
agency a um

3483
01:57:53,118 --> 01:57:56,559
i look forward to a time when those

3484
01:57:55,279 --> 01:57:58,719
countries with china are working

3485
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:00,560
together uh in the united states they're

3486
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:01,920
all working together maybe a little bit

3487
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:04,719
of friendly competition but i think

3488
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:06,319
friendly competition is good um

3489
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:07,840
you know governments are slow and the

3490
01:58:06,319 --> 01:58:10,639
only thing slower than one government is

3491
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:10,639
a collection of governments

3492
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:12,800
so

3493
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,560
yeah

3494
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:15,760
the olympics would be boring if everyone

3495
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:18,480
just crossed the finishing line at the

3496
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:21,119
same time yeah nobody would watch yeah

3497
01:58:18,479 --> 01:58:23,598
uh and and people wouldn't try hard to

3498
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:26,238
run fast and stuff so i think friendly

3499
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:27,599
competition is a good thing

3500
01:58:26,238 --> 01:58:29,439
uh this is also a good place to give a

3501
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:31,760
shout out to a video titled the entire

3502
01:58:29,439 --> 01:58:34,559
soviet rocket engine family tree by tim

3503
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:36,560
dodd aka everyday astronaut it's like an

3504
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:38,480
hour and a half it gives a full history

3505
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:40,000
of soviet rockets

3506
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:41,759
and people should definitely go check

3507
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,399
out and support tim in general that guy

3508
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:46,320
is super excited about the future super

3509
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:48,000
excited about space flight every time i

3510
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:49,920
see anything by him i just have a stupid

3511
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,039
smile on my face because he's so excited

3512
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:52,800
about stuff

3513
01:58:51,039 --> 01:58:54,319
yeah i love people like dad is real

3514
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:56,960
really great if you're interested in

3515
01:58:54,319 --> 01:58:58,960
anything to do with space um he's in

3516
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:01,198
terms of uh explaining

3517
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:03,599
rocket technology to your average person

3518
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:05,039
he's awesome the best i'd say

3519
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:06,400
um

3520
01:59:05,039 --> 01:59:07,760
and um

3521
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:09,279
i should say like the

3522
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:11,840
part reason like uh

3523
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:13,118
i switched us from

3524
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,480
like rafter at one point was gonna be a

3525
01:59:13,118 --> 01:59:15,679
hydrogen engine

3526
01:59:14,479 --> 01:59:17,279
um

3527
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:19,199
but but hydrogen has a lot of challenges

3528
01:59:17,279 --> 01:59:21,198
it's very low density it's a it's a deep

3529
01:59:19,198 --> 01:59:23,198
cryogen so it's only liquid at a very

3530
01:59:21,198 --> 01:59:26,559
you know very close to absolute zero

3531
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:30,479
requires a lot of insulation it's um

3532
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:31,679
so it is a lot of challenges there

3533
01:59:30,479 --> 01:59:33,359
and um

3534
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:36,480
and i was actually reading a bit about

3535
01:59:33,359 --> 01:59:37,439
uh russian rocket engine development and

3536
01:59:36,479 --> 01:59:38,959
um

3537
01:59:37,439 --> 01:59:40,559
at least the impression i had was that

3538
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:43,039
that uh

3539
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:44,960
soviet union russia and ukraine uh

3540
01:59:43,039 --> 01:59:47,359
primarily were

3541
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:50,319
uh actually in the process of

3542
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:53,118
uh switching to meth methylox

3543
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:54,399
um and there were some interesting tests

3544
01:59:53,118 --> 01:59:57,118
and data for

3545
01:59:54,399 --> 02:00:00,319
isp like they were able to get like

3546
01:59:57,118 --> 02:00:02,079
up to like a 380 second isp with the

3547
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:03,599
meth lux engine and i was like whoa okay

3548
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:06,960
that's

3549
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:08,719
that's actually really impressive so

3550
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:10,079
um

3551
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:12,560
so i think we could you could actually

3552
02:00:10,079 --> 02:00:15,039
get

3553
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:16,480
a much lower cost like in optimizing

3554
02:00:15,039 --> 02:00:18,800
cost per ton to orbit cost per time to

3555
02:00:16,479 --> 02:00:18,799
mars

3556
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:22,159
it's uh

3557
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:22,158
i think

3558
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:27,520
methane auction is the way to go

3559
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:30,079
and i was partly inspired by the russian

3560
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:32,560
work on the test stands uh

3561
02:00:30,079 --> 02:00:33,840
with methodolox engines

3562
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,199
and now for something completely

3563
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:38,319
different

3564
02:00:35,198 --> 02:00:40,158
do you mind doing a bit of a meme review

3565
02:00:38,319 --> 02:00:41,519
in the spirit of the great the powerful

3566
02:00:40,158 --> 02:00:43,359
pewdiepie

3567
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:45,520
let's say one to eleven just go over a

3568
02:00:43,359 --> 02:00:49,198
few documents print it out

3569
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:49,199
we can try let's try this

3570
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:54,920
i present to you document

3571
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:54,920
numero uno

3572
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:01,119
okay

3573
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:03,840
vladimi paler discovers

3574
02:01:01,118 --> 02:01:06,559
marshmallows

3575
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:06,560
that's so bad

3576
02:01:07,039 --> 02:01:10,639
so

3577
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:13,118
you get it because uh yes are you

3578
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:14,560
failing things it's like i know three

3579
02:01:13,118 --> 02:01:17,359
whatever

3580
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:17,360
that's not very good

3581
02:01:19,118 --> 02:01:25,118
this is uh grounded in some engineering

3582
02:01:22,479 --> 02:01:25,118
some history

3583
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:32,960
uh yeah give us an eight out of ten

3584
02:01:31,039 --> 02:01:35,118
what do you think about nuclear power

3585
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:37,439
i'm in favor of nuclear power i think

3586
02:01:35,118 --> 02:01:40,079
it's uh

3587
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:42,638
i i in a place that is not subject to

3588
02:01:40,079 --> 02:01:45,118
extreme natural disasters i think it's a

3589
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:47,440
nuclear power is a great way to generate

3590
02:01:45,118 --> 02:01:49,279
uh electricity

3591
02:01:47,439 --> 02:01:51,759
um i i don't think we should be shutting

3592
02:01:49,279 --> 02:01:54,079
down nuclear power stations

3593
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:55,440
yeah but what about chernobyl

3594
02:01:54,079 --> 02:01:57,198
exactly

3595
02:01:55,439 --> 02:01:57,409
um

3596
02:01:57,198 --> 02:01:58,559
so

3597
02:01:57,409 --> 02:02:00,399
[Music]

3598
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:04,159
uh i think people there's like a lot of

3599
02:02:00,399 --> 02:02:05,198
fear of radiation and stuff um

3600
02:02:04,158 --> 02:02:06,799
and it's

3601
02:02:05,198 --> 02:02:08,319
i guess what the problem is like a lot

3602
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:09,360
of people just don't

3603
02:02:08,319 --> 02:02:11,118
unders

3604
02:02:09,359 --> 02:02:12,799
they didn't study

3605
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:14,880
engineering or physics so they don't

3606
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:16,960
it's just the word radiation just sounds

3607
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:18,560
scary you know so they don't they ha

3608
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,800
they can't calibrate what radiation

3609
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,800
means

3610
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:26,719
but radiation is much less dangerous

3611
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:26,719
than than you'd think

3612
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,960
so

3613
02:02:30,158 --> 02:02:36,238
like for example fukushima you know um

3614
02:02:34,319 --> 02:02:38,479
when the fukushima uh problem happened

3615
02:02:36,238 --> 02:02:41,198
uh

3616
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:43,598
do the tsunami the

3617
02:02:41,198 --> 02:02:45,598
i got people in california asking me if

3618
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:47,679
they should worry about radiation

3619
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:50,400
from fukushima i'm like

3620
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:51,359
definitely not not even slightly not at

3621
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:54,079
all

3622
02:02:51,359 --> 02:02:55,279
that is crazy

3623
02:02:54,079 --> 02:02:57,679
and

3624
02:02:55,279 --> 02:02:57,679
just to

3625
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:01,840
show like look

3626
02:02:59,118 --> 02:03:04,000
this is how

3627
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:05,920
like the dangers is so much overplayed

3628
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:09,039
compared to what what it really

3629
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:11,599
is that i actually flew to fukushima

3630
02:03:09,039 --> 02:03:14,479
and actually i donated a

3631
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:17,360
a solar power system for water treatment

3632
02:03:14,479 --> 02:03:19,198
plant and

3633
02:03:17,359 --> 02:03:22,960
and i made a point of

3634
02:03:19,198 --> 02:03:22,960
eating locally grown vegetables

3635
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:28,039
on tv

3636
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:28,039
in fukushima

3637
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:31,359
like

3638
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:33,119
i'm still alive okay

3639
02:03:31,359 --> 02:03:35,598
so it's not even that the risk of these

3640
02:03:33,118 --> 02:03:38,399
events is low but the impact of them is

3641
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:39,920
the impact is greatly exaggerated it's

3642
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:41,198
just human nature

3643
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:42,639
it's people who don't know what

3644
02:03:41,198 --> 02:03:44,158
radiation is like i've had people ask me

3645
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:46,159
like what about radiation from cell

3646
02:03:44,158 --> 02:03:47,679
phones according to causing brain cancer

3647
02:03:46,158 --> 02:03:49,920
i'm like when you say radiation do you

3648
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:51,359
mean photons or particles then like that

3649
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:53,679
i don't know what what do you mean

3650
02:03:51,359 --> 02:03:54,479
protons particles so do you mean

3651
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:55,279
uh

3652
02:03:54,479 --> 02:03:57,359
if

3653
02:03:55,279 --> 02:03:59,519
let's say photons what

3654
02:03:57,359 --> 02:04:02,000
what frequency or wavelength and they're

3655
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:03,440
like no i have no idea um like do you

3656
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,719
know that everything's radiating all the

3657
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:06,158
time

3658
02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:08,560
like what do you mean like yeah

3659
02:04:06,158 --> 02:04:11,439
everything's radiating all the time

3660
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:13,440
photons are being emitted by all objects

3661
02:04:11,439 --> 02:04:14,399
all the time basically so

3662
02:04:13,439 --> 02:04:16,638
um

3663
02:04:14,399 --> 02:04:18,479
and if you want to know what it's it's

3664
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:20,078
what it means to stand in front of

3665
02:04:18,479 --> 02:04:21,678
nuclear fire

3666
02:04:20,078 --> 02:04:24,238
go outside

3667
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:26,000
the sun is a gigantic

3668
02:04:24,238 --> 02:04:28,718
you know thermonuclear

3669
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:32,399
reactor that you're staring right at it

3670
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:34,078
are you still alive yes okay amazing

3671
02:04:32,399 --> 02:04:37,598
yeah i guess radiation is one of the

3672
02:04:34,078 --> 02:04:40,158
words that can be used as a tool to to

3673
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:41,920
fear monger by certain people that's it

3674
02:04:40,158 --> 02:04:43,439
and i think people just don't understand

3675
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:45,440
so i mean that's the way to fight that

3676
02:04:43,439 --> 02:04:46,559
uh that fear i suppose is to understand

3677
02:04:45,439 --> 02:04:48,158
is to learn

3678
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:49,760
yeah just say like okay how many people

3679
02:04:48,158 --> 02:04:51,519
have actually died from nuclear

3680
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:54,079
accidents it's like practically nothing

3681
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:55,520
and uh say how many people have have

3682
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:56,880
died from

3683
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:59,280
you know coal

3684
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:00,880
plants and it's a very big number

3685
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:03,039
so

3686
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:04,319
like obviously we should not be

3687
02:05:03,039 --> 02:05:05,679
starting up coal plants and shutting

3688
02:05:04,319 --> 02:05:06,799
down nuclear plants just doesn't make

3689
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:08,158
any sense

3690
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:09,679
at all

3691
02:05:08,158 --> 02:05:12,559
coal plants like i don't know a hundred

3692
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:14,800
to a thousand times worse for for health

3693
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:16,719
than nuclear power plants

3694
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:20,000
uh you want to go to the next one

3695
02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:21,760
it's really bad

3696
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,800
it's uh that uh

3697
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:27,840
90 180 and 360 degrees everybody loves

3698
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:29,840
the math nobody gives a [ __ ] about 270.

3699
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:32,400
it's not super funny

3700
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:34,400
yeah i don't like two or three yeah um

3701
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:37,359
this is not a you know

3702
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:37,359
lol situation

3703
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:45,119
[Laughter]

3704
02:05:43,198 --> 02:05:46,719
that's pretty good the united states

3705
02:05:45,118 --> 02:05:49,039
oscillating between establishing and

3706
02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:50,960
destroying dictatorships it's like a

3707
02:05:49,039 --> 02:05:53,198
metro is that a matchup yeah

3708
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:55,760
yeah yeah it's uh on a seven out of ten

3709
02:05:53,198 --> 02:05:58,799
it's kind of true oh yeah this is uh

3710
02:05:55,760 --> 02:06:01,520
this is kind of personal for me next one

3711
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:03,119
oh man this is leica yeah well no is

3712
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:05,440
this or it's like referring to like or

3713
02:06:03,118 --> 02:06:06,319
something as like as like

3714
02:06:05,439 --> 02:06:08,799
a

3715
02:06:06,319 --> 02:06:11,359
husband husband yeah yeah hello yes this

3716
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:12,960
is dog your wife was launched into space

3717
02:06:11,359 --> 02:06:15,198
and then the last one

3718
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:16,399
is him with his eyes closed and a bottle

3719
02:06:15,198 --> 02:06:19,039
of vodka

3720
02:06:16,399 --> 02:06:20,559
yeah like it didn't come back no

3721
02:06:19,039 --> 02:06:21,920
they don't tell you the full story of

3722
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:23,599
you know what

3723
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:26,319
what the love the impact they had on the

3724
02:06:23,599 --> 02:06:28,159
loved ones yeah true that one gets an 11

3725
02:06:26,319 --> 02:06:30,399
for me

3726
02:06:28,158 --> 02:06:32,960
oh yeah it just keeps going

3727
02:06:30,399 --> 02:06:34,719
on the russian theme

3728
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:36,800
first man in space

3729
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:40,560
nobody cares first man on the moon well

3730
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:43,039
i think people do care no i know but um

3731
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:45,679
there is uruguay gardens names will

3732
02:06:43,039 --> 02:06:48,719
will be forever in history i think there

3733
02:06:45,679 --> 02:06:51,279
is something special about placing like

3734
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:52,719
stepping foot onto another totally

3735
02:06:51,279 --> 02:06:54,960
foreign land

3736
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:57,198
it's it's not the journey like uh people

3737
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:58,800
that explore the oceans it's not as

3738
02:06:57,198 --> 02:07:02,479
important to explore the oceans is to

3739
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:03,760
land on a whole new continent

3740
02:07:02,479 --> 02:07:06,078
yeah

3741
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:07,679
this is about you

3742
02:07:06,078 --> 02:07:09,439
oh yeah i'd love to get your comment on

3743
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:11,840
this elon musk

3744
02:07:09,439 --> 02:07:13,759
after sending 6.6 billion dollars to the

3745
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:16,560
u.n to end world hunger

3746
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:17,679
you have three hours

3747
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:19,039
um

3748
02:07:17,679 --> 02:07:20,399
you know i mean obviously six billion

3749
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:22,560
dollars is not going to end with hunger

3750
02:07:20,399 --> 02:07:22,559
so

3751
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:25,199
um

3752
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,880
so

3753
02:07:25,198 --> 02:07:29,279
i mean the reality is at this point the

3754
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:31,679
world is producing uh

3755
02:07:29,279 --> 02:07:33,118
far more food than it can really consume

3756
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:34,800
like we don't have a

3757
02:07:33,118 --> 02:07:36,399
caloric uh

3758
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:38,079
constraint to this point so where there

3759
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:40,638
is hunger it is

3760
02:07:38,078 --> 02:07:42,799
almost always due to um

3761
02:07:40,639 --> 02:07:45,118
it's like like civil war or strife or

3762
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:47,920
some like um

3763
02:07:45,118 --> 02:07:50,719
it's it's not a thing that is

3764
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:52,239
it's extremely rare for it to be just a

3765
02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:54,639
matter of like

3766
02:07:52,238 --> 02:07:56,718
like lack of money it's like

3767
02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:58,400
you know it's like some to the civil war

3768
02:07:56,719 --> 02:07:59,439
in some some country and and like one

3769
02:07:58,399 --> 02:08:00,960
part of the country is literally trying

3770
02:07:59,439 --> 02:08:02,719
to starve the other part of the country

3771
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:04,639
um

3772
02:08:02,719 --> 02:08:06,158
so it's much more complex than something

3773
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:08,880
that money could solve it's politics

3774
02:08:06,158 --> 02:08:10,638
geopolitics it's it's

3775
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:13,279
a lot of things it's human nature it's

3776
02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:14,560
governments it's monies monetary systems

3777
02:08:13,279 --> 02:08:17,118
all that kind of stuff

3778
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,719
yeah food is extremely cheap uh these

3779
02:08:17,118 --> 02:08:20,719
days it's like it's

3780
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:23,279
um

3781
02:08:20,719 --> 02:08:25,439
i mean the u.s at this point um

3782
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:27,920
you know among low-income families

3783
02:08:25,439 --> 02:08:28,960
obesity is actually another problem it's

3784
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:31,679
not

3785
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:34,158
like obviously it's not hunger it's like

3786
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:36,158
too much it's you know too many calories

3787
02:08:34,158 --> 02:08:37,439
uh so

3788
02:08:36,158 --> 02:08:41,279
it's not that nobody's hungry hungry

3789
02:08:37,439 --> 02:08:42,960
anywhere it's just it's just this is uh

3790
02:08:41,279 --> 02:08:45,599
not not a simple matter of adding money

3791
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:45,599
and solving it

3792
02:08:46,238 --> 02:08:51,559
what do you think that one gets

3793
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:51,560
just

3794
02:08:53,679 --> 02:08:57,440
this is going after empires world uh

3795
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,279
where did you get those artifacts the

3796
02:08:57,439 --> 02:09:00,559
british museum

3797
02:08:59,279 --> 02:09:02,840
shout out to

3798
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:05,520
monty python we found them

3799
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:07,520
yeah the british museum is it's pretty

3800
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:09,199
great i mean yeah it admittedly britain

3801
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:10,480
did take uh these historical artifacts

3802
02:09:09,198 --> 02:09:13,519
from all around the world and put them

3803
02:09:10,479 --> 02:09:14,238
in london but uh you know it it's not

3804
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:17,199
like

3805
02:09:14,238 --> 02:09:19,198
people can't go see them uh so it is a

3806
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:22,000
convenient place to see these uh ancient

3807
02:09:19,198 --> 02:09:23,839
artifacts is is london for

3808
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,800
you know for for a large segment of the

3809
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:26,400
world

3810
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:28,800
so i think you know on balance the

3811
02:09:26,399 --> 02:09:30,238
british museum is a net good

3812
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:32,480
although i'm sure a lot of countries

3813
02:09:30,238 --> 02:09:33,439
argue about that yeah

3814
02:09:32,479 --> 02:09:35,359
it's like you want to make these

3815
02:09:33,439 --> 02:09:36,960
historical artifacts accessible to as

3816
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:38,719
many people as possible

3817
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:41,198
and the british museum

3818
02:09:38,719 --> 02:09:43,118
i think does a good job of that

3819
02:09:41,198 --> 02:09:44,719
even if there's a darker aspect to like

3820
02:09:43,118 --> 02:09:46,399
the history of empire in general

3821
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:49,520
whatever the empire is

3822
02:09:46,399 --> 02:09:49,519
however things were done

3823
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,359
this it is the history that happened you

3824
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,800
can't sort of erase that history

3825
02:09:53,359 --> 02:09:56,319
unfortunately you could just become

3826
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:58,400
better in the future

3827
02:09:56,319 --> 02:10:01,039
that's the point

3828
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:01,839
yeah i mean it's like well how are we

3829
02:10:01,039 --> 02:10:03,519
gonna

3830
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:05,199
pass moral judgment on these these

3831
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:06,800
things like it's like if

3832
02:10:05,198 --> 02:10:08,000
uh

3833
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:09,920
you know uh

3834
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,679
if one is gonna judge say the rosh

3835
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:13,359
empire you're gonna judge you know what

3836
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:15,279
everyone was doing at the time

3837
02:10:13,359 --> 02:10:16,639
and how were the british relative to

3838
02:10:15,279 --> 02:10:17,920
everyone

3839
02:10:16,639 --> 02:10:19,520
um

3840
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:21,039
and i think they would british would

3841
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:23,280
actually get like a relatively good

3842
02:10:21,039 --> 02:10:26,319
grade relatively good grade not in

3843
02:10:23,279 --> 02:10:29,679
absolute terms but compared to

3844
02:10:26,319 --> 02:10:31,279
what everyone else was doing um

3845
02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:32,319
they were not the worst

3846
02:10:31,279 --> 02:10:34,000
like i said you gotta look at these

3847
02:10:32,319 --> 02:10:36,238
things in the context of the history at

3848
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,679
the time um and say what what were the

3849
02:10:36,238 --> 02:10:40,000
alternatives and what are you comparing

3850
02:10:37,679 --> 02:10:42,560
it against yes and i

3851
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,439
i do not think it will be the case that

3852
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,280
um

3853
02:10:43,439 --> 02:10:47,439
britain would get a uh

3854
02:10:45,279 --> 02:10:49,279
a bad grade in in when looking at

3855
02:10:47,439 --> 02:10:52,000
history at the time you know if you

3856
02:10:49,279 --> 02:10:53,279
judge history from

3857
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,078
you know

3858
02:10:53,279 --> 02:10:56,158
from

3859
02:10:54,078 --> 02:10:57,359
what is morally acceptable today you

3860
02:10:56,158 --> 02:10:59,439
basically are going to give everyone a

3861
02:10:57,359 --> 02:11:00,639
failing grade yeah i'm not clear it's

3862
02:10:59,439 --> 02:11:02,238
not i don't think anyone would get a

3863
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:04,880
passing grade um

3864
02:11:02,238 --> 02:11:07,118
in in their morality uh of like you go

3865
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:08,480
back 300 years ago like who's getting a

3866
02:11:07,118 --> 02:11:10,479
passing grade

3867
02:11:08,479 --> 02:11:12,959
basically no one

3868
02:11:10,479 --> 02:11:15,198
and we might not get a passing grade

3869
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:16,800
from generations but uh that come after

3870
02:11:15,198 --> 02:11:18,799
us

3871
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:20,079
uh what what does that one get

3872
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:22,239
uh

3873
02:11:20,078 --> 02:11:24,479

02:12:51,118 --> 02:12:55,359
that was versus just like a burger or a

3918
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:57,280
burger i guess a burger in general it's

3919
02:12:55,359 --> 02:12:58,639
like you know um

3920
02:12:57,279 --> 02:13:00,319
then there's like what is a burger

3921
02:12:58,639 --> 02:13:02,159
what's a sandwich and then you start

3922
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:03,359
getting as a pizza sandwich and what is

3923
02:13:02,158 --> 02:13:05,279
the original

3924
02:13:03,359 --> 02:13:06,719
it's it's it gets into an ontology

3925
02:13:05,279 --> 02:13:07,920
argument yeah but everybody knows like

3926
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:09,118
if you order like a burger or

3927
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:10,639
cheeseburger or whatever you like you

3928
02:13:09,118 --> 02:13:12,399
get like you know tomato and some

3929
02:13:10,639 --> 02:13:13,760
lettuce and onions and whatever and you

3930
02:13:12,399 --> 02:13:15,519
know

3931
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:18,000
mayor and ketchup and mustard it's like

3932
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:20,000
epic yeah but i'm sure they've had bread

3933
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,520
and meat separately for a long time and

3934
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,439
it was kind of a burger on the same

3935
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:25,599
plate but somebody who actually combined

3936
02:13:23,439 --> 02:13:27,839
them into the same thing

3937
02:13:25,599 --> 02:13:30,400
and yeah bite and hold it make makes it

3938
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:32,159
convenient it's a materials problem like

3939
02:13:30,399 --> 02:13:35,920
your hands don't get

3940
02:13:32,158 --> 02:13:35,920
dirty and whatever yeah it's brilliant

3941
02:13:38,238 --> 02:13:40,959
well that is not what i would have

3942
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:42,960
guessed

3943
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:43,840
but everyone knows like you you if you

3944
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:45,198
order a cheeseburger you know what

3945
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:47,760
you're getting you know it's not like

3946
02:13:45,198 --> 02:13:49,919
some obtuse like i wonder what i'll get

3947
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,920
you know um

3948
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:52,960
you know uh fries are

3949
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:54,399
i mean

3950
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:56,840
great i mean they were the devil but

3951
02:13:54,399 --> 02:14:00,719
fries are awesome um and

3952
02:13:56,840 --> 02:14:02,400
uh yeah chip pizza is incredible

3953
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:03,359
uh food innovation doesn't get enough

3954
02:14:02,399 --> 02:14:05,519
love

3955
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:07,759
yeah i guess is what we're getting at

3956
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:10,400
it's great um

3957
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:13,280
uh what about the uh matthew mcconaughey

3958
02:14:10,399 --> 02:14:14,799
austinite here uh president kennedy

3959
02:14:13,279 --> 02:14:17,279
do you know how to put men on the moon

3960
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:20,159
yet nasa no president kennedy

3961
02:14:17,279 --> 02:14:21,198
be a lot cooler if you did

3962
02:14:20,158 --> 02:14:25,559
pretty much

3963
02:14:21,198 --> 02:14:25,559
sure six six or seven i suppose

3964
02:14:26,078 --> 02:14:30,479
that's the last one

3965
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:32,960
that's funny

3966
02:14:30,479 --> 02:14:35,439
someone drew a bunch of dicks all over

3967
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:36,880
the walls sistine chapel boys bathroom

3968
02:14:35,439 --> 02:14:39,279
sure i'll give it nine

3969
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:40,880
it's that's really true

3970
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:42,960
all right this is our highest ranking

3971
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:44,480
meme for today i mean it's true like how

3972
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:46,000
do they get away with that

3973
02:14:44,479 --> 02:14:47,519
lots of nakedness

3974
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:49,679
i mean dick pics are

3975
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:50,400
i mean just something throughout history

3976
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:51,840
uh

3977
02:14:50,399 --> 02:14:53,598
as long as people can draw things

3978
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:56,239
there's been a dick pic it's

3979
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:58,639
a staple of human history it's a staple

3980
02:14:56,238 --> 02:15:00,479
consistent throughout human history you

3981
02:14:58,639 --> 02:15:02,319
you tweeted that you aspired to comedy

3982
02:15:00,479 --> 02:15:04,718
you're friends with joe rogan

3983
02:15:02,319 --> 02:15:06,479
might you uh do a short stand-up comedy

3984
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:09,118
set at some point in the future

3985
02:15:06,479 --> 02:15:11,118
maybe um open for joe something like

3986
02:15:09,118 --> 02:15:12,799
that is that is that really stand-up

3987
02:15:11,118 --> 02:15:14,479
actual just blown stand-up full-on

3988
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:16,719
stand-up is that in there or is that

3989
02:15:14,479 --> 02:15:19,839
i've never thought about that

3990
02:15:16,719 --> 02:15:22,000
um it's extremely difficult if

3991
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:24,560
at least that's what the like joe says

3992
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,520
and the comedians say

3993
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:29,360
huh i wonder if i could um i mean only

3994
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:31,199
one way to find out

3995
02:15:29,359 --> 02:15:33,839
you know i i have done

3996
02:15:31,198 --> 02:15:35,598
stand up for friends just uh

3997
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,840
impromptu

3998
02:15:35,599 --> 02:15:39,039
you know i'll get get on like a roof uh

3999
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:42,239
and they

4000
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:43,760
they do laugh but they're friends too so

4001
02:15:42,238 --> 02:15:45,279
i don't know if if you gotta call you

4002
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:47,679
know like a rumor strangers are they

4003
02:15:45,279 --> 02:15:49,679
gonna actually also find it funny but

4004
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:51,279
i could try

4005
02:15:49,679 --> 02:15:53,599
see what happens

4006
02:15:51,279 --> 02:15:56,399
i think you'd learn something either way

4007
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:58,800
um yeah i kind of love um

4008
02:15:56,399 --> 02:16:00,799
both the when you bomb and when when you

4009
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:03,920
do great just watching people how they

4010
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:05,840
deal with it is so difficult it's so

4011
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:08,158
you're so fragile

4012
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:09,599
up there it's just you

4013
02:16:08,158 --> 02:16:11,279
and you you think you're gonna be funny

4014
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:13,360
and when it completely falls flat it's

4015
02:16:11,279 --> 02:16:15,599
just it's beautiful to see people

4016
02:16:13,359 --> 02:16:17,759
deal with like that uh you might have

4017
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:19,840
enough material to do standard

4018
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:23,360
no no i've never thought about but i

4019
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:24,639
might have enough material um

4020
02:16:23,359 --> 02:16:26,960
i don't know like 15 minutes or

4021
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:28,639
something oh yeah yeah do it do a

4022
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:30,840
netflix special

4023
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:33,200
netflix special sure

4024
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:34,960
um what's your favorite rick and morty

4025
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:36,559
concept uh

4026
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:37,919
just to spring that on you is there

4027
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:39,920
there's a lot of sort of scientific

4028
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:42,719
engineering ideas explored there there's

4029
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:44,558
the favorite one that's the butter robot

4030
02:16:42,718 --> 02:16:45,438
it's great uh yeah it's a great show

4031
02:16:44,558 --> 02:16:47,039
yeah

4032
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:48,719
dragon ball is awesome

4033
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:50,719
somebody that's exactly like you from an

4034
02:16:48,718 --> 02:16:51,919
alternate dimension showed up there elon

4035
02:16:50,718 --> 02:16:54,000
tusk

4036
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:55,840
yeah that's right that you voiced yeah

4037
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,239
rick morty suddenly explores a lot of

4038
02:16:55,840 --> 02:17:00,159
interesting concepts

4039
02:16:58,239 --> 02:17:01,840
i so like what's your favorite one i

4040
02:17:00,159 --> 02:17:02,799
know the the butter robot certainly is

4041
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:04,239
uh

4042
02:17:02,799 --> 02:17:06,159
you know it's like it it's certainly

4043
02:17:04,239 --> 02:17:07,119
possible to have too much sentience in a

4044
02:17:06,159 --> 02:17:08,478
device

4045
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:10,079
um like you don't want to have your

4046
02:17:08,478 --> 02:17:12,799
toast to be like

4047
02:17:10,079 --> 02:17:14,318
a super genius toaster it's gonna hate

4048
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:16,318
hate life because well it could just

4049
02:17:14,318 --> 02:17:17,199
make us toast but if you know it's like

4050
02:17:16,318 --> 02:17:18,959
you don't want to have like super

4051
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:21,359
intelligent stuck in a

4052
02:17:18,959 --> 02:17:23,518
a very limited device um do you think

4053
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:25,040
it's too easy from uh if we talk about

4054
02:17:23,519 --> 02:17:27,120
from the engineering perspective of

4055
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:30,479
super intelligence like with marvin the

4056
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:32,399
robot like is it j it seems like it

4057
02:17:30,478 --> 02:17:33,920
might be very easy to engineer just a

4058
02:17:32,398 --> 02:17:35,840
depressed robot

4059
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:38,398
like it sure it's not obvious to

4060
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:40,478
engineer a robot that's going to

4061
02:17:38,398 --> 02:17:42,638
find a fulfilling existence

4062
02:17:40,478 --> 02:17:44,239
same as humans i suppose

4063
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:46,558
but um

4064
02:17:44,239 --> 02:17:48,959
i wonder if that's like the default

4065
02:17:46,558 --> 02:17:52,478
if you don't do a good job on building a

4066
02:17:48,959 --> 02:17:55,119
robot it's going to be sad a lot

4067
02:17:52,478 --> 02:17:57,920
well we can reprogram robots easier than

4068
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:59,760
we can reprogram humans

4069
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:01,760
so

4070
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:02,880
i guess if you let it evolve

4071
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:05,120
without

4072
02:18:02,879 --> 02:18:07,039
tinkering then it might get sad

4073
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:08,000
but you can change the optimization

4074
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,800
function

4075
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:11,840
and

4076
02:18:08,799 --> 02:18:11,840
have it be a cheery robot

4077
02:18:12,799 --> 02:18:17,358
you uh like i mentioned with with spacex

4078
02:18:15,519 --> 02:18:18,639
you give a lot of people hope and a lot

4079
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:20,719
of people look up to you millions of

4080
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:22,638
people look up to you uh if we think

4081
02:18:20,718 --> 02:18:25,279
about young people

4082
02:18:22,638 --> 02:18:27,759
in high school maybe in college

4083
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:29,200
um what advice would you give to them

4084
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:30,960
about

4085
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:32,399
if they want to try to do something big

4086
02:18:30,959 --> 02:18:34,000
in this world they want to really have a

4087
02:18:32,398 --> 02:18:36,318
big positive impact what advice would

4088
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:39,200
you give them about their career maybe

4089
02:18:36,318 --> 02:18:40,879
about life in general

4090
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:41,840
try to be useful

4091
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:43,598
um

4092
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:46,239
you do things that are useful to your

4093
02:18:43,599 --> 02:18:48,398
fellow human beings to the world

4094
02:18:46,239 --> 02:18:50,718
it's very hard to be useful

4095
02:18:48,398 --> 02:18:50,718
um

4096
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:54,880
very hard

4097
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:56,318
um you know are you contributing more

4098
02:18:54,879 --> 02:18:59,279
than you

4099
02:18:56,318 --> 02:19:02,000
consume you know like uh

4100
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:04,479
like can you

4101
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:07,519
try to have a positive net contribution

4102
02:19:04,478 --> 02:19:09,358
to society um

4103
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:11,679
i think that's the thing to aim for you

4104
02:19:09,359 --> 02:19:12,479
know not to try to be sort of a leader

4105
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:14,079
for

4106
02:19:12,478 --> 02:19:16,799
just for the sake of being a leader or

4107
02:19:14,079 --> 02:19:19,439
whatever um

4108
02:19:16,799 --> 02:19:20,879
a lot of time people who

4109
02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:22,318
a lot of times the people you want as

4110
02:19:20,879 --> 02:19:24,239
leaders are other people who don't want

4111
02:19:22,318 --> 02:19:24,409
to be leaders

4112
02:19:24,239 --> 02:19:26,239
so

4113
02:19:24,409 --> 02:19:28,478
[Music]

4114
02:19:26,239 --> 02:19:28,478
um

4115
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:33,679
if you live a useful life

4116
02:19:32,079 --> 02:19:35,280
that is a good life

4117
02:19:33,679 --> 02:19:37,120
a life worth

4118
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:38,239
having lived

4119
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:40,319
um

4120
02:19:38,239 --> 02:19:41,860
you know and i like i said

4121
02:19:40,318 --> 02:19:43,920
i would encourage people to

4122
02:19:41,860 --> 02:19:46,319
[Music]

4123
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:48,558
use the mental tools of physics and

4124
02:19:46,318 --> 02:19:50,318
apply them broadly in life there are the

4125
02:19:48,558 --> 02:19:52,639
best tools when you think about

4126
02:19:50,318 --> 02:19:53,760
education and self-education what do you

4127
02:19:52,639 --> 02:19:56,799
recommend

4128
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:58,719
so there's the university there's

4129
02:19:56,799 --> 02:20:02,000
uh self-study

4130
02:19:58,719 --> 02:20:03,840
there is a hands-on sort of finding a

4131
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,120
company or a place or a set of people

4132
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:06,559
that do the thing you're passionate

4133
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:07,760
about and joining them as early as

4134
02:20:06,559 --> 02:20:08,799
possible

4135
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:10,880
um

4136
02:20:08,799 --> 02:20:12,559
there's uh taking a road trip across

4137
02:20:10,879 --> 02:20:15,119
europe for a few years and writing some

4138
02:20:12,559 --> 02:20:18,000
poetry which uh which which trajectory

4139
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:20,240
do you suggest

4140
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:22,719
for in terms of learning about

4141
02:20:20,239 --> 02:20:24,159
how you can become useful as you

4142
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:27,559
mentioned how you can have the most

4143
02:20:24,159 --> 02:20:27,559
positive impact

4144
02:20:32,478 --> 02:20:35,679
but i encourage people to read a lot of

4145
02:20:34,159 --> 02:20:37,680
books

4146
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:39,439
just re like

4147
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:42,398
basically try to ingest as much

4148
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:43,200
information as you can

4149
02:20:42,398 --> 02:20:44,799
uh

4150
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:47,280
and try to also just develop a good

4151
02:20:44,799 --> 02:20:50,000
general knowledge um

4152
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:51,920
so you at least have like

4153
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,760
a rough lay of the land of the the

4154
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:56,079
knowledge landscape

4155
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:58,719
um like try to learn a little bit about

4156
02:20:56,079 --> 02:20:59,840
a lot of things um because you might not

4157
02:20:58,719 --> 02:21:00,478
know what you're really interested how

4158
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:02,239
would you know what you're really

4159
02:21:00,478 --> 02:21:03,760
interested in if you at least aren't

4160
02:21:02,239 --> 02:21:06,719
like doing it

4161
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:07,760
peripheral exploration of broadly of

4162
02:21:06,719 --> 02:21:10,840
of

4163
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:14,159
the knowledge landscape

4164
02:21:10,840 --> 02:21:16,719
um and you talk to people from different

4165
02:21:14,159 --> 02:21:18,799
walks of life and different uh

4166
02:21:16,719 --> 02:21:21,119
industries and professions and skills

4167
02:21:18,799 --> 02:21:23,358
and like what occupations like just try

4168
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:23,359
you know

4169
02:21:23,439 --> 02:21:27,079
learn as much as possible

4170
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:30,240
man search for meaning

4171
02:21:30,719 --> 02:21:33,599
isn't the whole thing a search for

4172
02:21:32,079 --> 02:21:34,639
meaning

4173
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:36,000
is

4174
02:21:34,639 --> 02:21:36,959
yeah what's the meaning of life and all

4175
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,478
you know

4176
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:40,799
but just generally like i said i would

4177
02:21:38,478 --> 02:21:44,159
encourage people to read broadly

4178
02:21:40,799 --> 02:21:46,559
in many different subject areas um

4179
02:21:44,159 --> 02:21:49,840
and and and then try to find something

4180
02:21:46,559 --> 02:21:50,719
where there's an overlap of your talents

4181
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:52,478
and

4182
02:21:50,719 --> 02:21:54,318
and what you're interested in so people

4183
02:21:52,478 --> 02:21:55,119
may be good at something but or they may

4184
02:21:54,318 --> 02:21:56,478
have

4185
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:58,160
skill at a particular thing but they

4186
02:21:56,478 --> 02:21:59,279
don't like doing it

4187
02:21:58,159 --> 02:22:00,959
um

4188
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:02,640
so you want to try to find a thing where

4189
02:22:00,959 --> 02:22:05,119
you ha you're

4190
02:22:02,639 --> 02:22:06,879
that's a good a good uh combination of

4191
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:09,200
of your of the things that you're

4192
02:22:06,879 --> 02:22:10,318
inherently good at but you also like

4193
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:12,159
doing

4194
02:22:10,318 --> 02:22:14,478
um

4195
02:22:12,159 --> 02:22:17,520
and um and reading is a super fast

4196
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:19,679
shortcut to to figure out which where

4197
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:21,760
are you you're both good at it you like

4198
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:23,760
doing it and it will actually have

4199
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:27,359
positive impact well you've got to learn

4200
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:30,239
about things somehow so re reading

4201
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:31,120
a broad range just really

4202
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:32,478
read it

4203
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:33,840
you know the more important one is that

4204
02:22:32,478 --> 02:22:37,199
kid i i

4205
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:38,478
read through the encyclopedia uh so

4206
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,920
that's pretty helpful

4207
02:22:38,478 --> 02:22:41,279
um

4208
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:42,398
and uh

4209
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:44,560
there's also things i didn't even know

4210
02:22:42,398 --> 02:22:46,799
existed or a lot so obviously it's like

4211
02:22:44,559 --> 02:22:48,478
as broad as it gets encyclopedias were

4212
02:22:46,799 --> 02:22:51,199
digestible i think

4213
02:22:48,478 --> 02:22:52,478
uh you know whatever 40 years ago

4214
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:53,760
um

4215
02:22:52,478 --> 02:22:54,879
so

4216
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:56,478
um

4217
02:22:54,879 --> 02:22:58,239
you know we read through the the

4218
02:22:56,478 --> 02:23:00,478
condensed version of the encyclopedia

4219
02:22:58,239 --> 02:23:02,799
britannica i'd recommend that

4220
02:23:00,478 --> 02:23:04,959
um you can always like skip subjects or

4221
02:23:02,799 --> 02:23:06,079
you read a few paragraphs and you know

4222
02:23:04,959 --> 02:23:07,519
you're not interested just jump to the

4223
02:23:06,079 --> 02:23:09,280
next one

4224
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:10,399
so read the encyclopedia we're just

4225
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:12,000
gonna

4226
02:23:10,398 --> 02:23:14,318
skim through it

4227
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,318
um

4228
02:23:14,879 --> 02:23:18,719
and um

4229
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:20,560
but you know i put a lot of stock and

4230
02:23:18,719 --> 02:23:23,358
certainly have a lot of respect for

4231
02:23:20,559 --> 02:23:25,920
someone who puts in an honest day's work

4232
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:26,640
uh to do useful things

4233
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:28,879
and

4234
02:23:26,639 --> 02:23:31,119
and just generally to have like not a

4235
02:23:28,879 --> 02:23:32,079
zero-sum mindset um

4236
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:34,160
or or

4237
02:23:32,079 --> 02:23:37,920
like have more of a

4238
02:23:34,159 --> 02:23:39,600
grow the pie mindset like the

4239
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:42,478
if you if you sort of say like

4240
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:45,120
when when we see people like perhaps um

4241
02:23:42,478 --> 02:23:47,920
including some very smart people

4242
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:49,520
kind of uh taking an attitude of uh like

4243
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:50,799
like doing things that seem like morally

4244
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:53,359
questionable

4245
02:23:50,799 --> 02:23:55,759
it's often because they have at a base

4246
02:23:53,359 --> 02:23:57,280
sort of axiomatic level a zero-sum

4247
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:59,920
mindset

4248
02:23:57,280 --> 02:24:01,680
um and and they without realizing it

4249
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:03,600
they don't realize they have a

4250
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:05,359
zero-sum mindset or at least that they

4251
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:07,439
don't realize it consciously

4252
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:08,960
um and so if you have a zero-sum mindset

4253
02:24:07,439 --> 02:24:11,359
then the only way to get ahead is by

4254
02:24:08,959 --> 02:24:13,519
taking things from others

4255
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:16,000
if if it's like if if

4256
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:18,000
if the pie is fixed then the only way to

4257
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:19,120
have more pie is to take someone else's

4258
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,040
pie

4259
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:22,640
but but this is false like obviously the

4260
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:24,479
pie has grown dramatically over time the

4261
02:24:22,639 --> 02:24:25,840
economic pie

4262
02:24:24,478 --> 02:24:29,279
so

4263
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:29,280
in reality you can have that

4264
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:35,680
so overuse this analogy if you have a

4265
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:35,680
lot of you can have there's a lot of pi

4266
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:40,559
yeah it's not fixed um

4267
02:24:38,799 --> 02:24:42,799
so you really want to make sure you

4268
02:24:40,559 --> 02:24:44,478
don't you're not operating um

4269
02:24:42,799 --> 02:24:46,239
without realizing it from a zero-sum

4270
02:24:44,478 --> 02:24:47,438
mindset

4271
02:24:46,239 --> 02:24:48,478
where the only way to get ahead is to

4272
02:24:47,439 --> 02:24:49,840
take things from others then that's

4273
02:24:48,478 --> 02:24:51,840
going to result in you trying to take

4274
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:53,680
things from others which is not not good

4275
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:53,960
it's much better to work on

4276
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:55,040
uh

4277
02:24:53,959 --> 02:24:56,719
[Music]

4278
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:59,200
adding to the economic pie maybe you

4279
02:24:56,719 --> 02:24:59,199
know so

4280
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:03,359
uh you know creating

4281
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:05,840
like i said creating more than you

4282
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:07,600
consume uh doing more than you

4283
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:09,439
yeah um

4284
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:11,040
so that that's a big deal um i think

4285
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:12,720
there's like you know a fair number of

4286
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:14,399
people in

4287
02:25:12,719 --> 02:25:17,119
in finance that

4288
02:25:14,398 --> 02:25:19,439
uh do have a bit of a zero-sum mindset

4289
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:22,560
i mean it's all walks of life i've seen

4290
02:25:19,439 --> 02:25:25,439
that one of the one of the reasons

4291
02:25:22,559 --> 02:25:28,159
uh rogan inspires me he celebrates oh

4292
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:29,760
there's a lot there's not not creating a

4293
02:25:28,159 --> 02:25:31,760
constant competition like there's a

4294
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:33,680
scarcity of resources what happens when

4295
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:34,800
you celebrate others and you promote

4296
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:36,559
others

4297
02:25:34,799 --> 02:25:39,119
the ideas of others

4298
02:25:36,559 --> 02:25:42,318
it uh it actually grows that pie i mean

4299
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:44,479
it the every like the uh the resource

4300
02:25:42,318 --> 02:25:46,159
the resources become less scarce

4301
02:25:44,478 --> 02:25:47,840
and that that applies in a lot of kinds

4302
02:25:46,159 --> 02:25:49,439
of domains it applies in academia where

4303
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:51,520
a lot of people are very

4304
02:25:49,439 --> 02:25:54,079
uh see some funding for academic

4305
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:56,079
research is zero sum and it is not if

4306
02:25:54,079 --> 02:25:57,920
you celebrate each other if you make if

4307
02:25:56,079 --> 02:26:00,559
you get everybody to be excited about ai

4308
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:02,318
about physics above mathematics i think

4309
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:04,559
it there'd be more and more funding and

4310
02:26:02,318 --> 02:26:06,559
i think everybody wins yeah that applies

4311
02:26:04,559 --> 02:26:09,439
i think broadly

4312
02:26:06,559 --> 02:26:13,039
yeah yeah exactly so last

4313
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:15,680
last question about love and meaning

4314
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:17,920
uh what is the role of love in the human

4315
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:21,040
condition broadly and more specific to

4316
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:22,879
you how has love romantic love or

4317
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:25,760
otherwise made you a better person a

4318
02:26:22,879 --> 02:26:25,759
better human being

4319
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:30,479
better engineer

4320
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:32,080
now you're asking really perplexing

4321
02:26:30,478 --> 02:26:34,398
questions

4322
02:26:32,079 --> 02:26:36,799
um

4323
02:26:34,398 --> 02:26:38,478
it's hard to give up

4324
02:26:36,799 --> 02:26:41,358
i mean there are many

4325
02:26:38,478 --> 02:26:42,799
books poems and songs written about what

4326
02:26:41,359 --> 02:26:44,800
is love and

4327
02:26:42,799 --> 02:26:47,679
what is what exactly

4328
02:26:44,799 --> 02:26:49,039
you know um

4329
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:51,200
you know what is love people don't hurt

4330
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:51,200
me

4331
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:56,159
um that's one of the great ones yes yeah

4332
02:26:54,398 --> 02:26:59,519
you've you've earlier quoted shakespeare

4333
02:26:56,159 --> 02:27:01,920
but that that's really up there yeah

4334
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:03,520
let me that was the many splendor thing

4335
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:05,200
uh

4336
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:06,560
i mean there's um

4337
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:08,000
it's because we've talked about so many

4338
02:27:06,559 --> 02:27:10,398
inspiring things like be useful in the

4339
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,559
world sort of like solve problems

4340
02:27:10,398 --> 02:27:14,559
alleviate suffering but

4341
02:27:12,559 --> 02:27:17,680
it seems like connection between humans

4342
02:27:14,559 --> 02:27:19,359
is a source you know it's a

4343
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:21,280
it's a source of joy it's a source of

4344
02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:24,000
meaning and that that's what love is

4345
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:26,079
friendship love

4346
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:28,398
i i just wonder if you think about that

4347
02:27:26,079 --> 02:27:29,680
kind of thing when you talk about

4348
02:27:28,398 --> 02:27:31,439
preserving the light of human

4349
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:35,120
consciousness right and thus becoming a

4350
02:27:31,439 --> 02:27:37,840
multiplication multi-planetary species

4351
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:39,600
i mean to me at least

4352
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:42,318
um

4353
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:44,720
that that means like if we're just alone

4354
02:27:42,318 --> 02:27:46,799
and conscious and intelligent it doesn't

4355
02:27:44,719 --> 02:27:48,079
mean nearly as much as if we're with

4356
02:27:46,799 --> 02:27:50,239
others

4357
02:27:48,079 --> 02:27:51,920
right and there's some magic created

4358
02:27:50,239 --> 02:27:53,039
when we're together

4359
02:27:51,920 --> 02:27:55,120
the

4360
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:57,359
uh the friendship of it and i think the

4361
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:59,920
highest form of it is love which i think

4362
02:27:57,359 --> 02:28:02,720
broadly is is much bigger than just sort

4363
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:03,760
of romantic but also yes romantic love

4364
02:28:02,719 --> 02:28:06,239
and

4365
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:08,398
um family and those kinds of things well

4366
02:28:06,239 --> 02:28:10,159
i mean the reason i guess i care about

4367
02:28:08,398 --> 02:28:12,239
us becoming a multi-planet species in a

4368
02:28:10,159 --> 02:28:13,039
space frank civilization

4369
02:28:12,239 --> 02:28:16,239
is

4370
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:18,000
foundationally i love humanity

4371
02:28:16,239 --> 02:28:21,920
um

4372
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:25,040
and and so i wish to see it prosper and

4373
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:27,359
do great things and be happy and

4374
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:30,479
um and if i did not love humanity i

4375
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:30,479
would not care about these things

4376
02:28:31,120 --> 02:28:34,319
so when you look at the whole of it the

4377
02:28:32,799 --> 02:28:37,279
the human history all the people has

4378
02:28:34,318 --> 02:28:38,318
ever lived all the people alive now

4379
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:41,600
it's pretty

4380
02:28:38,318 --> 02:28:43,840
we're we're okay

4381
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:45,200
on the whole we're pretty interesting

4382
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:46,478
uh bunch

4383
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:48,079
yeah

4384
02:28:46,478 --> 02:28:50,000
both things considered

4385
02:28:48,079 --> 02:28:52,639
and i've read a lot of history including

4386
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:55,359
the darkest worst parts of it

4387
02:28:52,639 --> 02:28:56,879
and uh and despite all that i think on

4388
02:28:55,359 --> 02:28:59,359
balance

4389
02:28:56,879 --> 02:29:02,000
i still love humanity

4390
02:28:59,359 --> 02:29:03,280
you joked about it with the 42 uh what

4391
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:05,359
what do you think is the meaning of this

4392
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:08,880
whole thing

4393
02:29:05,359 --> 02:29:10,960
is like is there a non-numerical oh

4394
02:29:08,879 --> 02:29:12,318
yeah well really i think what douglas

4395
02:29:10,959 --> 02:29:14,079
adams was saying in hitchhiker's guide

4396
02:29:12,318 --> 02:29:15,680
to the galaxy is that

4397
02:29:14,079 --> 02:29:17,840
um

4398
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:18,720
the universe is the answer

4399
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:19,920
and

4400
02:29:18,719 --> 02:29:20,719
uh

4401
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:22,398
what

4402
02:29:20,719 --> 02:29:24,559
we really need to figure out are what

4403
02:29:22,398 --> 02:29:26,559
questions to ask about the answer that

4404
02:29:24,559 --> 02:29:28,000
is the universe yeah

4405
02:29:26,559 --> 02:29:29,439
and that the question is the really the

4406
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:31,439
hard part and if you can properly frame

4407
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:33,920
the question then the answer relatively

4408
02:29:31,439 --> 02:29:35,120
speaking is easy

4409
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:38,719
so

4410
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:39,520
so therefore if you want to understand

4411
02:29:38,719 --> 02:29:40,799
what

4412
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:42,159
questions to ask about the universe you

4413
02:29:40,799 --> 02:29:43,358
want to understand the meaning of life

4414
02:29:42,159 --> 02:29:44,559
we need to

4415
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:45,680
expand the scope and scale of

4416
02:29:44,559 --> 02:29:48,239
consciousness

4417
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:49,600
so that we're better able to

4418
02:29:48,239 --> 02:29:50,478
understand the nature of the universe

4419
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:52,318
and

4420
02:29:50,478 --> 02:29:53,519
and understand the meaning of life

4421
02:29:52,318 --> 02:29:55,600
and ultimately

4422
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:57,600
the most important part would be to ask

4423
02:29:55,600 --> 02:29:59,120
the right question

4424
02:29:57,600 --> 02:30:00,880
yes uh

4425
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:02,800
thereby elevating the role of the

4426
02:30:00,879 --> 02:30:05,119
interviewer

4427
02:30:02,799 --> 02:30:07,599
yes exactly as the most important human

4428
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:09,520
in the room

4429
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:11,120
good questions are

4430
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:12,560
you know it's a hot it's hard to come up

4431
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:15,040
with good questions

4432
02:30:12,559 --> 02:30:16,719
uh absolutely um

4433
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:19,520
but yeah like it's like that that is the

4434
02:30:16,719 --> 02:30:21,840
foundation of my philosophy is that

4435
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:23,760
um i i am curious about the nature of

4436
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:25,520
the universe and

4437
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:28,398
uh

4438
02:30:25,520 --> 02:30:30,079
you know and obviously i will die

4439
02:30:28,398 --> 02:30:32,559
i don't know when i'll die but i won't

4440
02:30:30,079 --> 02:30:34,079
live forever um

4441
02:30:32,559 --> 02:30:36,000
but i would like to know that we are on

4442
02:30:34,079 --> 02:30:37,520
a path to understanding the nature of

4443
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,600
the universe and the meaning of life and

4444
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:41,439
what questions to ask about the answer

4445
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:43,600
that is the universe

4446
02:30:41,439 --> 02:30:45,439
and um and so if we expand the scope and

4447
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:47,200
scale of humanity and consciousness in

4448
02:30:45,439 --> 02:30:50,000
general which includes silicon

4449
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:50,000
consciousness then

4450
02:30:50,398 --> 02:30:54,879
that you know there were that that seems

4451
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:54,880
like a fundamentally good thing

4452
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:59,439
