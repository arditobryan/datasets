1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,919
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,080
risto michelinen a computer scientist at

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,240
the university of texas at austin

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,400
and associate vice president of

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,440
evolutionary artificial intelligence at

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,359
cognizant

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,480
he specializes in evolutionary

8
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,879
computation

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,600
but also many other topics in artificial

10
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,079
intelligence

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,840
cognitive science and neuroscience quick

12
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,439
mention of our sponsors

13
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,439
jordan harbinger show grammarly belcampo

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,480
and indeed check them out in the

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,558
description to support this podcast

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,079
as a side note let me say that nature

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,238
inspired algorithms

18
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,280
from ant colony optimization to generic

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,519
algorithms to

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,920
cellular automata to neural networks

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,000
have always captivated my imagination

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,520
not only for their surprising power in

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,679
the face of long odds

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,200
but because they always opened up doors

25
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,640
to new ways of thinking about

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,960
computation

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,160
it does seem that in the long arc of

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,878
computing history

29
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,519
running toward biology not running away

30
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,640
from it

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,120
is what leads to long-term progress this

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,079
is

33
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,959
the lex friedman podcast and here is my

34
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:09,118
conversation

35
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,879
with risto mcelinen if we ran the

36
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,478
earth experiment this fun little

37
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,239
experiment we're on

38
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,478
over and over and over and over a

39
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,039
million times and watch the evolution of

40
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:20,478
life

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,080
as it uh pans out how much variation in

42
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,200
the outcomes of that evolution do you

43
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,158
think we would see

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,359
now we should say that you are a

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,280
computer scientist

46
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,438
that's actually not such a bad question

47
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,599
for computer scientists because

48
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,158
we are building simulations of these

49
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,519
things and we are simulating evolution

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,118
and that's a difficult question to

51
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,719
answer in biology but we can build a

52
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,640
computational model

53
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,319
and run it million times and actually

54
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,640
answer that question how much variation

55
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,279
do we see when we when we simulate it

56
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,200
uh and um you know that's a little bit

57
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,879
beyond what we can do today but

58
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,520
but i think that we will see some

59
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,839
regularities and it took evolution also

60
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,798
a really long time to get started and

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
then things

62
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,079
accelerated really fast uh towards the

63
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,439
end

64
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,438
but there are things that need to be

65
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,478
discovered and they probably will be

66
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:11,840
over and over again like manipulation

67
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,680
uh of objects uh opposable thumbs and

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,680
um and also some way to communicate

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,280
uh maybe orally like whether you have

70
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,719
speech it might be some other kind of

71
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,520
sound

72
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,000
and and decision making but also vision

73
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,800
uh

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
i has evolved many times various vision

75
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,719
systems have evolved

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
so we would see those kinds of solutions

77
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,439
i believe

78
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
emerge over and over again they may look

79
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,560
a little different but they

80
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,238
they get the job done the really

81
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,759
interesting question is would we have

82
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,920
primates would we have

83
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,878
humans or something that resembles

84
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,039
humans

85
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,560
uh and and would that be an apex of

86
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,079
evolution after a while

87
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,560
uh we don't know where we're going from

88
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,200
here but we certainly see a lot of tool

89
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,360
use and

90
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,479
and building our constructing our

91
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,640
environment so

92
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,759
i think that we will get that we get

93
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,079
some

94
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,919
evolution producing some agents that can

95
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,400
do that manipulate the environment and

96
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,518
build

97
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,200
what do you think is special about

98
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,000
humans like if you were running the

99
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,958
simulation

100
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,479
and you observe humans emerge like these

101
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,000
like tool makers they start a fire and

102
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,518
all stuff start running around building

103
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,959
buildings and then running for president

104
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,239
all those kinds of things

105
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,039
uh what would be how would you detect

106
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,560
that

107
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,039
because you're like really busy as the

108
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,598
creator of this evolutionary system

109
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,639
so you don't have much time to observe

110
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,199
like detect if

111
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,119
any cool stuff came up right how would

112
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,079
you detect humans

113
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,280
well you are running the simulation so

114
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,719
you also

115
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,598
put in visualization and measurement

116
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,318
techniques there so if you are looking

117
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,439
for

118
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:47,199
certain things like communication you'll

119
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,719
have detectors to find out whether

120
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,238
that's happening even if it's a lot

121
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,560
simulation

122
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,438
and i think that that's that's what what

123
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,280
we would do

124
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:59,680
we know roughly what we want intelligent

125
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,120
agents that communicate cooperate

126
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
manipulate

127
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,438
and we would build detections and

128
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,399
visualizations of those processes

129
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,840
yeah it and there's a lot of we have to

130
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,000
run it many times and

131
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,438
we have plenty of time to figure out how

132
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,160
we detect the interesting things

133
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,719
but also i think we do have to run it

134
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,359
many times because we don't quite know

135
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,759
what shape those will take and our

136
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,198
detectors may not be perfect for them

137
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,600
to begin with well it seems really

138
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,280
difficult to build the detector of

139
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,720
intelligent or intelligent conv

140
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:37,198
communication sort of uh if we take an

141
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,400
alien perspective observing earth are

142
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,160
you sure

143
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:41,839
that they would be able to detect humans

144
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
as the special thing wouldn't they be

145
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,638
already curious about other things

146
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,759
there's way more insects by body mass i

147
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,879
think than humans

148
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,160
by far and colonies

149
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,399
obviously dolphins is the most

150
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
intelligent uh creature on earth

151
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,239
we all know this so it could be the

152
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,839
dolphins that they detect

153
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,280
it could be the rockets that we seem to

154
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,359
be launching that could be the

155
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,559
intelligent creature they detect

156
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,080
uh it could be some other uh trees

157
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,560
trees have been here a long time i just

158
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,359
learned that sharks have been here

159
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,879
400 million years and that's longer than

160
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,280
trees have been here

161
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,879
so maybe it's the sharks they go by age

162
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,719
like there's a persistent thing

163
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,240
like if you survive long enough

164
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,120
especially through the mass extinctions

165
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
that could be the

166
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,759
the thing your detector is uh detecting

167
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,600
humans have been here for a short time

168
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,919
and we're just creating a lot of

169
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,400
pollution but so is the other creatures

170
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,079
i don't know you do you think you'd be

171
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,599
able to detect humans like how would you

172
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,519
go about detecting

173
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,800
in the computational sense maybe we can

174
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,478
leave humans behind

175
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,079
in the computational sense detect

176
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,758
interesting things

177
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,000
do you basically have to have a strict

178
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,240
objective function by which you measure

179
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
the performance of a system or can you

180
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,478
find curiosities and

181
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,959
interesting things yeah well i think

182
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:01,599
that the first

183
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,038
measurement would be to detect how much

184
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,400
of an effect you can have in your

185
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,519
environment so if you look at

186
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,959
look around we have cities and that is

187
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,038
constructed environments and that's

188
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,918
where a lot of people live most people

189
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,399
live

190
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,560
so that would be a good sign of

191
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,918
intelligence that you

192
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,079
don't just live in an environment but

193
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,839
you construct it to your liking yeah

194
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,079
and that's something pretty unique i

195
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,359
mean certainly birds build nests

196
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,918
but they don't build quite cities

197
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,879
termites build mounds and ice and things

198
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,959
like that

199
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,959
but the complexity of the human

200
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,519
construction cities i think would stand

201
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,120
out

202
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,159
even to an external observer of course

203
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,759
that's what a human would say

204
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
yeah and you know you can certainly say

205
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,439
that sharks are really smart because

206
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,959
they've been around so long and they

207
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,800
haven't destroyed the environment

208
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,318
which humans are about to do which is

209
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,439
not a very smart thing

210
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,319
uh but we'll get over it i believe

211
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,839
uh and and we can get over it by doing

212
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,479
some construction that actually is

213
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,560
benign

214
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:02,879
uh and maybe even enhances uh the um

215
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,038
resilience of nature so you mentioned

216
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,000
that this simulation that we run over

217
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,279
and over might

218
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,079
start so it's a slow start so do you

219
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,799
think uh

220
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,079
how unlikely first of all i don't know

221
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
if you think about this kind of stuff

222
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,079
but

223
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,120
how unlikely is step number zero

224
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,959
which is the springing up like the

225
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,478
origin of life on earth

226
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:29,359
and second how unlikely

227
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,399
is the anything interesting happening

228
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,319
beyond that

229
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:36,079
sort of like the start that that creates

230
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,360
all the rich complexity that we see on

231
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,719
earth today yeah

232
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,639
there are people who are working on

233
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,039
exactly that problem uh

234
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,759
from primordial soup how do you actually

235
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:49,120
get self-replicating yeah molecules

236
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,919
and they are very close uh with a little

237
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,759
bit of help you can make that happen

238
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:57,439
so we of course we know what we want so

239
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,080
they can set up the conditions and try

240
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,439
out conditions

241
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,560
that are conducive to that for evolution

242
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,199
to discover that

243
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,598
that took a long time for us to recreate

244
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,720
it probably won't take that long

245
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,878
and the next steps from there um

246
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,800
i think also with some hand-holding i

247
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,759
think we can make that happen

248
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,240
um but if with evolution what was really

249
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,720
fascinating was eventually the

250
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,439
runaway evolution of the brain that

251
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,840
created

252
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,038
humans and created well also other

253
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,318
higher animals

254
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,560
that that was something that happened

255
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,038
really fast and

256
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,038
that's a big question is that something

257
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,958
replicable is that something that

258
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,120
can happen and if it happens does it go

259
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,278
in the same direction

260
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,479
that is a big question to ask even in

261
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,360
computational

262
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,720
terms i think that it's relatively

263
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,320
possible to

264
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,920
come up here create an experiment where

265
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
we look at the primordial soup and the

266
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,599
first couple of steps

267
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:57,278
of multicellular organisms even but to

268
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,278
get something as complex as the brain

269
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,360
we don't quite know the conditions for

270
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,799
that and how to even get started and

271
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,759
whether we can get this kind of runaway

272
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,759
evolution happening

273
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,040
from a detector perspective

274
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,559
if we're observing this evolution what

275
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,599
do you think is the brain what do you

276
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,319
think is the

277
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,759
let's say what is intelligence so in

278
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,959
terms of the thing that makes humans

279
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,679
special we seem to be able to reason

280
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,518
we seem to be able to communicate but

281
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,079
the core of that is this

282
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,600
something in the broad category we might

283
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,839
call intelligence

284
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,440
so it's uh if you put your computer

285
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,640
scientists add on

286
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,600
uh is their favorite ways you like to

287
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,278
think about

288
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:44,560
that question of what is intelligence

289
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:48,240
well my goal is to create

290
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:51,359
agents that are that are intelligent

291
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,720
not to define what and and that that is

292
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,680
a way of defining it

293
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,040
and that means that it's some kind of an

294
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,559
um

295
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:04,719
object or or a program um

296
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:07,119
that has limited sensory and uh

297
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,160
effective capabilities interacting with

298
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,399
the world

299
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,679
and then also a mechanism for making

300
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,559
decisions

301
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,039
so with limited abilities like that can

302
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,639
it

303
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,278
survive um survival is the simplest goal

304
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,639
but it could

305
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,958
you could also give it other goals can

306
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,000
it multiply can it solve problems that

307
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,239
you give it

308
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,078
uh and that is quite a bit less than

309
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,600
human intelligence there are

310
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:32,319
animals would be intelligent of course

311
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,240
with that definition and you might have

312
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,160
even even some other forms of of life

313
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,240
even so what

314
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,759
so intelligence in that sense is a

315
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,959
survival um

316
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,799
skill uh given resources that you have

317
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,838
and using using your resources so that

318
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,838
you will stay around

319
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,278
do you think death mortality is

320
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,000
fundamental

321
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,200
to an agent so like there's a i don't

322
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,958
know if you're familiar there's a

323
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,759
philosopher named ernest becker who

324
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,359
wrote the

325
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,240
denial of death and his whole idea and

326
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,079
there's folks

327
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,480
psychologists cognitive scientists that

328
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,958
work on terror management theory

329
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,639
and they think that one of the special

330
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,399
things about humans is that we're able

331
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,799
to sort of

332
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,799
foresee our death right we can we can

333
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,159
realize not just as animals do sort of

334
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,078
constantly fear

335
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,519
in an instinctual sense respond to all

336
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:23,679
the dangers that are out there

337
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,120
but like understand that this ride ends

338
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,479
eventually yeah

339
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,639
and that in itself is the most is a

340
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,480
is the force behind all of the creative

341
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,519
efforts of human nature yeah that's

342
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,200
that's the philosophy

343
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,200
i think that makes sense a lot of sense

344
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,480
i mean animals probably don't think of

345
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,079
death the same way

346
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,120
but humans know that your time is

347
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,319
limited and you want to make it count

348
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
and you can make account in many

349
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,240
different ways but i think that has a

350
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,200
lot to do with creativity and the need

351
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,560
for humans

352
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,800
to do something beyond just surviving

353
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,479
and now going from that simple

354
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,159
definition to something that's

355
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,800
the next level i think that that could

356
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,159
be a second decision a second level of

357
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,479
definition that

358
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,360
um intelligence means something and you

359
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,440
do something that

360
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,639
stays behind you that's more than uh

361
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,959
your

362
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,680
existence um something you create

363
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,838
something that

364
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,000
um is useful for others is useful in the

365
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,360
future not just for yourself

366
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,278
and i think that that's a nice

367
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,240
definition of intelligence in a

368
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,360
next level uh and it's also nice because

369
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,278
it doesn't require

370
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,879
that they are humans or biological they

371
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,958
could be artificial

372
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,240
agents that intelligence they could they

373
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,359
could achieve those kind of goals

374
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,320
so particular agent the uh the ripple

375
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,399
effects of

376
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,519
of their existence on the entirety of

377
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,360
the system

378
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,600
is significant so like they leave a

379
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,839
trace where there's like uh

380
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,200
yeah like ripple effects it's the but

381
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,200
see then you go back to the

382
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,440
the butterfly with the flap of a wing

383
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,519
and then you can uh trace a lot of uh

384
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,639
like nuclear wars and all the conflicts

385
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,480
of human history

386
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,680
somehow connected to that one butterfly

387
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,200
that created all the

388
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,759
the chaos so maybe that's not

389
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,519
maybe that's a very poetic way to think

390
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,519
uh that's something we humans in a

391
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,959
human-centric way want to

392
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,959
hope we have this impact

393
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,399
like that is the the the secondary

394
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,399
effect of our intelligence we've

395
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,639
had the long-lasting impact on the world

396
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,320
but maybe the entirety

397
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:24,560
of physics in the universe

398
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,360
has a very long lasting effect sure but

399
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:28,879
you can also think of it what if um like

400
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,000
the wonderful life what if you're not

401
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,838
here will somebody else do this is it

402
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,360
is it something that you actually

403
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,399
contributed because you had something

404
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,800
unique to compute

405
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,159
that contribute that's a pretty high bar

406
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,439
though uniqueness

407
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,439
yeah yeah so you know you have to be

408
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,360
mozart or something to actually reach

409
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,360
that level that nobody would have

410
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,879
developed that but other people might

411
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,919
have solved this equation

412
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:56,958
um if you didn't do it

413
00:13:53,919 --> 00:14:00,319
but but also within limited scope i mean

414
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,759
during your lifetime or next year

415
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,399
you could contribute something that

416
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:07,519
unique that other people did not see

417
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,958
and um and then that could change

418
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,919
the way things move forward for a while

419
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,319
uh so i don't think we have to be mozart

420
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,919
to be

421
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,519
called intelligence but we have this

422
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,278
local effect that is

423
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,720
changing if you weren't there that would

424
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,159
not have happened and it's a positive

425
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,680
effect of course you want it to be a

426
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,919
positive effect do you think it's

427
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,838
possible to engineer in

428
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,479
to uh computational agents a fear of

429
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,480
mortality

430
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,720
like uh does that make any

431
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,079
any sense so there's a very trivial

432
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,839
thing whereas like

433
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,239
you could just code in a parameter which

434
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,360
is how long the life ends but

435
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,079
more of a fear of mortality

436
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,800
like awareness of the the way that

437
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,599
things end

438
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,519
and somehow encoding a complex

439
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,759
representation

440
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,799
of that fear which is like maybe as it

441
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,838
gets closer

442
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,519
you become more terrified i mean there

443
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,199
seems to be something really profound

444
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,679
about this fear that's not

445
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:08,078
currently encodable in a trivial way

446
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,319
into our programs

447
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,319
well i think you're you're referring to

448
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,480
the emotion of fear something

449
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,160
because we are cognitively we know that

450
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,320
we have limited lifespan

451
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,919
and most of us cope with it by just hey

452
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,199
that's what the world is like and i make

453
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,479
the most of it but

454
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,838
sometimes you can have a like a a fear

455
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,879
that's not healthy

456
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,519
that paralyzes you you can't do anything

457
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,919
uh and and uh somewhere in between

458
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,399
they're

459
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,078
not caring at all and and getting

460
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,919
paralyzed because of fear

461
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,359
is a normal response which is a little

462
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,078
bit more than just logic

463
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,000
and and it's emotion so now the question

464
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,039
is what good are emotions i mean they

465
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,720
are quite

466
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,319
uh complex and they are multiple

467
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,680
dimensions of emotions

468
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,759
and they probably do serve as survival

469
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:58,958
function heightened focus for instance

470
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,278
and fear of death might be a really good

471
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,479
emotion when you are in danger that you

472
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,240
recognize it

473
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,639
even even if it's not logically

474
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,759
necessarily easy to derive and you don't

475
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,560
have time for

476
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,000
that logical detection a deduction you

477
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,679
may be able to recognize the situation

478
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,600
is dangerous and this fear

479
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,758
kicks in and you all of a sudden

480
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,519
perceive the facts that are important

481
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,600
for that and i think that's generally is

482
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,399
the role of emotions is it allows you to

483
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,399
focus

484
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,240
what's relevant uh for your situation

485
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,440
and maybe if fear of death plays the

486
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,278
same kind of role

487
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,480
uh but if it consumes you and it's

488
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,919
something that you think

489
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,440
in normal life when you don't have to

490
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,319
then it's not healthy and then it's not

491
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,800
productive

492
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,759
yeah but it's fascinating to think how

493
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,719
to uh

494
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,600
incorporate emotion into a computational

495
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,360
agent

496
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,120
it almost seems like a silly statement

497
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,079
to make

498
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,919
but it perhaps seems silly because we

499
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,120
have such a poor understanding of the

500
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,039
mechanism of

501
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:58,159
emotion of fear of uh

502
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,278
i think at the core of it is another

503
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,360
word that we know

504
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,679
nothing about but say a lot which is

505
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,519
consciousness

506
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:09,838
do you ever in your work or like maybe

507
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:10,798
on a coffee break think about what the

508
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,879
heck is this thing

509
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,879
consciousness and is it at all useful in

510
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,240
our thinking about ai systems

511
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,839
yes it is an important question

512
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,959
you can build representations and

513
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,359
functions

514
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,640
i think into these agents that act like

515
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,959
emotions

516
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,160
and consciousness perhaps so i mentioned

517
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,079
emotions being something that allow you

518
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,679
to focus and pay attention

519
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,399
filter out what's important yeah you can

520
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,919
have that kind of a filter mechanism

521
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,679
and you can it puts you in a different

522
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
state your computation is in a different

523
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,240
state certain things don't really get

524
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,918
through and others

525
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,279
are heightened now you label that box

526
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,640
emotion i don't know if that means it's

527
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,558
an emotion but it acts

528
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,160
very much like we understand what

529
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,079
emotions are

530
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,440
and we actually did some work like that

531
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,399
um modeling

532
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,080
hyenas who were trying to steal a kill

533
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,320
from lions

534
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,119
which happens in africa i mean hyenas

535
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,038
are

536
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,239
quite intelligent but not really

537
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:12,480
intelligent

538
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,000
and they they have this behavior that's

539
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,000
more complex than anything else they do

540
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,798
they can band together if there's

541
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,400
about 30 of them or so uh they can uh

542
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,400
coordinate their effort so that they

543
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,000
push the lions away from a kill

544
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,519
even though the lions are so strong that

545
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,400
they could kill a lion

546
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,839
kill a hyena by by striking with a paw

547
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,000
but when they work together and

548
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,000
precisely time this attack the lions

549
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,160
will leave and they get the kill

550
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,480
and probably there are some

551
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,240
states like emotions that the hyenas go

552
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,919
through the first they

553
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,359
they call for reinforcements they really

554
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,120
want that kill but there's not enough of

555
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,479
them so they vocalize and

556
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,798
there's more peop more people more

557
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,319
hyenas that come around

558
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,240
and then they have two emotions they're

559
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,079
very afraid of the lion

560
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,000
so they want to stay away but they also

561
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,558
have a strong affiliation

562
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,400
between each other and then this is the

563
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,119
balance of the two emotions and

564
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,960
and also yes they also want the kill so

565
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,479
it's both rebelled and attractive and

566
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,720
then but then this

567
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,319
affiliation eventually is so strong that

568
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,360
when they move they move together they

569
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,279
act as a unit

570
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,558
and they they can perform that function

571
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,879
so there's an

572
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,720
interesting behavior that seems to

573
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,039
depend on these emotions

574
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,160
strongly and makes it possible um

575
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,679
important reactions

576
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,759
and i think a cr a critical

577
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,120
aspect of that the way you're describing

578
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,240
is emotion there is

579
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:37,279
a mechanism of social communication

580
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,759
of a social interaction maybe that

581
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,960
maybe humans won't even be that

582
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:42,319
intelligent or most

583
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,160
things we think of as intelligent

584
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,960
wouldn't be that intelligent without

585
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,759
the social component of interaction

586
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,160
maybe most

587
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,798
much of our intelligence is essentially

588
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,720
in our growth of social interaction

589
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,079
and maybe for the creation of

590
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,038
intelligent agents we have to be

591
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,678
creating

592
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,038
yes fundamentally social systems yes i i

593
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,559
strongly believe that's true

594
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,839
and uh yes the uh communication is

595
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,000
multifaceted i mean

596
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,119
they they vocalize and call for friends

597
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,119
but they also

598
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,399
rub against each other and they push and

599
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:15,279
they do all kinds of

600
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,200
gestures and so on so they known act

601
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,519
alone and i don't think people act alone

602
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,038
uh very much either at least normal most

603
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,759
of the time

604
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,960
and social systems are so strong for

605
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,119
humans

606
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,360
that i think we build everything on top

607
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,719
of these kind of structures and

608
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,000
one interesting theory around that

609
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,679
bigger this theory for instance for

610
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,359
language but language origins is

611
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:40,080
that where did language come from and

612
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,759
and it's a plausible theory that first

613
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,119
came social systems that

614
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,279
you have different roles in a society

615
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,479
and then those roles are exchangeable

616
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,319
that you know i scratch

617
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,519
your back you scratch my back you can

618
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,359
exchange roles

619
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,960
and once you have the brain structures

620
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,199
that allow you to understand actions in

621
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,200
terms of roles that can be changed

622
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,120
that's the basis for language for

623
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,759
grammar and now you can start

624
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,719
using symbols to refer to uh objects in

625
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,519
the world

626
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,279
and you have this flexible structure so

627
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,119
there's a social structure

628
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,399
that's fundament fundamental for

629
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:14,239
language to develop

630
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,600
now again then you have language you can

631
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,159
you can refer to things that are not

632
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,119
here

633
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,840
right now and that allows you to then

634
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,079
build all the

635
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,959
all the good stuff about uh planning for

636
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,960
instance and

637
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,240
building things and so on so yeah i

638
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,440
think that very strongly

639
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,798
uh humans are social and that gives us

640
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,038
ability to structure the world

641
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,079
but also as a society we can do so much

642
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:37,519
more because we don't

643
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:39,599
one person does not have to do

644
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,918
everything you can have different roles

645
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,119
and together achieve a lot more and

646
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,880
that's also something we see in

647
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,719
computational simulations today i mean

648
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,039
we have multi-agent systems that

649
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,798
can perform tasks this fascinating uh

650
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,279
demonstration marco dorico i think it

651
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:53,359
was

652
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,720
um these robots little robots that had

653
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,519
to navigate through an environment and

654
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,600
there were

655
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,720
there were things that are dangerous

656
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,519
like maybe a

657
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,079
a big chasm or some kind of groove a

658
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,839
hole

659
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,199
and they could not get across it but if

660
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,678
they grab each other

661
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,120
with their gripper they formed a robot

662
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,200
that was much longer on

663
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,319
the team and this way they could get

664
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,120
across that yeah

665
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,720
so this is a great example of how

666
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,558
together we can achieve things we

667
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,400
couldn't otherwise like the hyenas

668
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,480
you know alone they couldn't but as a

669
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,759
team they could uh and i think humans do

670
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,720
that all the time we're really good at

671
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,240
that

672
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,919
yeah and the way you describe the the

673
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,079
system of hyenas

674
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,520
it almost sounds algorithmic like the

675
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,798
the problem with humans is they're so

676
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,119
complex

677
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,240
it's hard to think of them as algorithms

678
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,439
but with hyenas

679
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,200
there's a it's simple enough to where it

680
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,200
feels like

681
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,720
um at least hopeful that it's possible

682
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,558
to create

683
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:51,440
computational systems that mimic that

684
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:51,839
yeah that's exactly why why we looked at

685
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,558
that

686
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,918
as opposed to humans um like i said they

687
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,038
are intelligent but they are not quite

688
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,080
as intelligent

689
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,519
intelligent as say baboons which would

690
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,119
learn a lot and would be much more

691
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,679
flexible that hyenas

692
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,439
are relatively rigid in what they can do

693
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,519
and therefore you could look at this

694
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,960
behavior like this is a breakthrough in

695
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,798
evolution about to happen

696
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,840
yes that they've discovered something

697
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:18,480
about social structures communication

698
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,000
about cooperation and and it might then

699
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,558
spill over to other things too

700
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,038
yeah in thousands of years in the future

701
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:24,480
yeah

702
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,480
i think the problem with baboons and

703
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,759
humans is probably too much is going on

704
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,360
inside the head

705
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,038
we won't be able to measure it if we're

706
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,399
observing the system with hyenas is

707
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,038
probably

708
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,880
easier to observe the actual decision

709
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,119
making and the various

710
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,919
motivations that are involved yeah they

711
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,038
are visible

712
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,080
and we can even um quantify possibly

713
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:47,119
their

714
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,158
emotional state because they leave

715
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,839
droppings behind

716
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,440
and there are chemicals there that can

717
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,439
be associated with uh

718
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,038
with neurotransmitters and we can

719
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,159
separate what emotions they might have

720
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:03,119
experienced in the last 24 hours yeah

721
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,640
what to use the most beautiful speaking

722
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,719
of hyenas

723
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,840
uh what do you use the most beautiful uh

724
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,919
nature inspired

725
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,119
algorithm in your work that you've come

726
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,120
across something

727
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,639
maybe early on in your work or maybe

728
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,759
today

729
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,640
i i think that evolution computation is

730
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,079
the most amazing method so what

731
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,799
fascinates me

732
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,839
most is that with computers is that you

733
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,599
can

734
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,759
you can get more out than you put in i

735
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,558
mean you can write a piece of code

736
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,119
and your machine does what you told it i

737
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,038
mean

738
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,959
this happened to me in my freshman year

739
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,720
i it did something very simple and i was

740
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,120
just amazed i was blown away that it

741
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,880
would

742
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,639
it would get the number and it would

743
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,000
compute the result and i didn't have to

744
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,400
do it myself

745
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,440
very simple but if you push that a

746
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,600
little further

747
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,440
you can have machines that learn and

748
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,278
they might learn patterns

749
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,919
and already say deep learning neural

750
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:59,440
networks they can learn to recognize

751
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,000
objects sounds um patterns that humans

752
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,840
have trouble

753
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,159
with and sometimes they do it better

754
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,000
than humans and that's so fascinating

755
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,360
and now if you take that one more step

756
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,079
you get something like evolution

757
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,319
algorithms

758
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,158
that discover things they create things

759
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,359
they come up with solutions that you did

760
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,520
not think of

761
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,879
and that just blows me away it's so

762
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,918
great that we can build

763
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,559
systems algorithms that can be in some

764
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,759
sense

765
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,720
smarter than we are that they can

766
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,240
discover solutions that we might miss

767
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,319
a lot of times it is because we have as

768
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,919
humans we have certain biases we expect

769
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,759
the solutions to be a certain way

770
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,120
and you don't put those biases into the

771
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,919
algorithm so they are more free to

772
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,079
explore

773
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,679
and evolution is just absolutely

774
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,278
fantastic explorer

775
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,400
and that's what what really is

776
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:44,000
fascinating yeah i think uh

777
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,840
i get made fun of a bit because i

778
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,200
currently don't have any kids

779
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:51,678
but you mentioned programs i mean

780
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,440
um do you have kids yeah so maybe you

781
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,559
could speak to this but there's a magic

782
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,480
to the creation

783
00:25:54,558 --> 00:26:00,319
creative process like i uh with spot

784
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,319
the boston dynamic spot but really any

785
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,079
robot that i've ever worked on

786
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,558
it just feels like the similar kind of

787
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:08,798
joy i imagine i would have as a father

788
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,960
not the same perhaps level but like the

789
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:14,319
same kind of wonderment like

790
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,759
exactly this which is like you know what

791
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:19,439
you had to do

792
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:21,599
initially uh to get this thing going

793
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,759
let's speak on the computer science side

794
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:27,119
like what the program looks like

795
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:29,679
but something about it uh doing

796
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,879
more than what the program was written

797
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,519
on paper

798
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,559
is like that somehow connects to the

799
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,119
magic

800
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,200
of this entire universe like that's

801
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:42,158
that's like i i feel like i found god

802
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,120
every time i like it's like uh because

803
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,919
you're you've really

804
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,639
created something that's living yeah

805
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,759
even if it's

806
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,520
it has a life of its own has the

807
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,960
intelligence of its own it's beyond what

808
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,879
you actually thought

809
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,120
yeah and that is i think it's exactly

810
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,278
spot on that's exactly what it's about

811
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,479
uh you created something and has a

812
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,880
ability to

813
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,759
uh live its life and and do good things

814
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,440
and um

815
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,119
you just gave it a starting point so in

816
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,679
that sense i think it's that may be part

817
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,519
of the joy actually

818
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,960
uh you see but you mentioned creativity

819
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:12,400
in this context uh

820
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,159
especially in the context of

821
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,720
evolutionary computation

822
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,399
so you know we don't often think of

823
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,278
algorithms as creative

824
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,319
so how do you think about creativity

825
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:24,960
yeah

826
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,480
algorithms absolutely can be creative um

827
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,840
they can

828
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,278
come up with solutions that you don't

829
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:29,759
think about i mean creativity can be

830
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,640
defined

831
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,240
a couple of requirements has to be new

832
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,440
it has to be useful and it has to be

833
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,919
surprising

834
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,759
and those certainly are true with say

835
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,200
evolution computation discovering

836
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,599
solutions so maybe

837
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,600
an example for instance we did this

838
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,000
collaboration with mit media lab kelp

839
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,359
harvest

840
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,558
lab where they had a

841
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,240
hydroponic food computer they called it

842
00:27:54,558 --> 00:27:58,079
environment that was completely computer

843
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,919
controlled nutrients water

844
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:01,359
light temperature everything is

845
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,960
controlled now

846
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,519
um what do you do if you can control

847
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,519
everything

848
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,519
farmers know a lot about how to do how

849
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,158
to make plants grow in their own batch

850
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,158
of land

851
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,240
but if you can control everything it's

852
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,000
too much and it turns out that we don't

853
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,720
actually know very much about it

854
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,240
so we built a system evolution

855
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,319
optimization system

856
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,599
together with a surrogate model of how

857
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:27,439
plants grow

858
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:30,558
and let this system explore recipes

859
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,759
on its own and initially now we were

860
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:34,960
focusing on light

861
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,319
uh how strong what wavelengths how long

862
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,960
the light was on

863
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,158
um and we put some boundaries which we

864
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,038
thought were reasonable

865
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,278
for instance that there was um at least

866
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,200
six hours of darkness like night because

867
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:51,119
that's what we have in the world

868
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:54,159
and very quickly um the system evolution

869
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:55,599
pushed all the recipes to that limit uh

870
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,720
we were trying to grow basil

871
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,158
um and we had initially have some 200

872
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,640
300 recipes

873
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,399
exploration as well as known recipes but

874
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,559
but now we are going beyond that and

875
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,038
everything was like pushed at that limit

876
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:08,480
so

877
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:10,319
we look at it and say well you know we

878
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,960
can easily just change it let's have it

879
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:13,038
your way

880
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,960
and it turns out uh the system

881
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,000
discovered that bazel does not need to

882
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,519
sleep

883
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,679
uh 24 hours lights on and it will thrive

884
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,839
it will be bigger it will be tastier and

885
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,679
this was a big surprise

886
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:26,959
not just to us but also the biologists

887
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,080
in the team

888
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,960
that anticipated that this is some

889
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,038
constraints that

890
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,038
that are in the world for a reason it

891
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,079
turns out that evolution did not have

892
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,919
the same bias

893
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,759
and therefore it discovered something

894
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,440
that was creative it was surprising it

895
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,278
was useful and it was new

896
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,519
that's fascinating to think about like

897
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,398
the things we think that are fundamental

898
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,558
to

899
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:50,158
living systems on earth today whether

900
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,200
they're actually fundamental or they

901
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,000
somehow shape

902
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,278
uh fit the constraints of the system and

903
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,480
all we'll have to do is just remove the

904
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,519
constraints

905
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,960
do you ever think about um

906
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:02,558
i don't know how much you know about

907
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,600
bringing computer interfaces in your

908
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,319
link

909
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,639
the the idea there is you know our

910
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:12,158
brains are very limited

911
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,080
and if we just allow we plug in

912
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,278
we provide a mechanism for a computer to

913
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:17,199
speak with the brain

914
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,519
so you're thereby expanding the

915
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,159
computational power of the brain

916
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,398
the possibilities there sort of from a

917
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:28,640
very high level philosophical

918
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:31,759
perspective is limitless but i wonder

919
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,600
how limitless it is are the constraints

920
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,000
we have like features that are

921
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,759
fundamental to our intelligence

922
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,359
or is this just like this weird

923
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:40,640
constraint in terms of our brain size

924
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,839
and skull

925
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,720
and uh lifespan and the

926
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,720
senses it's just the weird little like

927
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,519
quirk of evolution and if we just open

928
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,558
that up like add much more senses

929
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,639
add much more computational power the uh

930
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,759
intelligence will be will expand

931
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,360
exponentially

932
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:04,158
do you have a do you have a sense about

933
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,158
constraints the relationship of

934
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,240
evolution computation to the constraints

935
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,840
of the environment

936
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,798
um well at first i'd like to comment on

937
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,678
on that like

938
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,319
changing the inputs uh to human brain uh

939
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,559
yes and

940
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,439
flexibility of of the brain i think

941
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:21,599
there's a lot

942
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,759
of that uh there are experiments that

943
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:27,038
are done in animals like megan kasir

944
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:28,319
um the mit is switching the um auditory

945
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,558
and visual

946
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,960
information and going going to the wrong

947
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:35,519
part of the cortex and the animal

948
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,558
was still able to hear and perceive the

949
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,000
visual environment

950
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:42,398
and there are kids that are born with

951
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,038
severe disorders and sometimes they have

952
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:45,278
to remove

953
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:47,038
half of the brain like one half and they

954
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,240
still grow up they have the functions

955
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,319
migrate to the other parts

956
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,759
there's a lot of flexibility like that

957
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:55,599
so i think it's quite possible to

958
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,599
hook up the brain with different kinds

959
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,759
of sensors for instance

960
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:01,199
and something that we don't even quite

961
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,119
understand or have today

962
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,558
on different kind of wavelengths or or

963
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,918
whatever they are um

964
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,319
and then the brain can learn to make

965
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,640
sense of it and that i think

966
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,639
is um this good hope that these

967
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,960
prosthetic devices for instance work

968
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,038
not because we make them so good and so

969
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,519
easy to use but the brain adapts to them

970
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,720
and can

971
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,640
learn to take advantage of them um and

972
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,399
so in that sense if there's a trouble a

973
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,640
problem i think that brain

974
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,398
can be used to correct it now going

975
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,120
beyond what we have today can you get

976
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,518
smarter

977
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,479
that's really much harder to do uh

978
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,798
giving

979
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,000
the brain more more input probably might

980
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,599
overwhelm it it would

981
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,839
have to learn to filter it and focus um

982
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,278
and in order to use the information

983
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,879
effectively

984
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:49,119
and augmenting intelligence with some

985
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,000
kind of external devices like that

986
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,359
might be difficult uh i think but

987
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,480
replacing what's lost

988
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,599
i think is quite possible right so our

989
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,679
intuition

990
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,439
allows us to sort of imagine that we can

991
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,679
replace what's been lost

992
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,278
but expansion beyond what we have i mean

993
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,960
we are already one of the most

994
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:11,278
if not the most intelligent things on

995
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,000
this earth right so it's hard to imagine

996
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,519
um if the brain can hold up with an

997
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,480
order of magnitude greater set of

998
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,519
information

999
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,640
thrown at it if it can do if you can

1000
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,240
reason through that

1001
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,559
part of me this is the russian thing i

1002
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,079
think is uh i tend to think that the

1003
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,119
limitations is where the

1004
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:33,038
the superpower is that

1005
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:36,879
you know immortality and uh

1006
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:39,759
huge increase in bandwidth of uh

1007
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,200
information by connecting computers with

1008
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,558
the brain is not going to produce

1009
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,960
greater intelligence

1010
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,960
it might produce lesser intelligence so

1011
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,038
i don't know there's something about

1012
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:55,120
the scarcity being essential

1013
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:56,798
to uh um fitness or performance

1014
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:58,158
but that could be just because we're so

1015
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,319
uh

1016
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,519
limited no exactly you make do with what

1017
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:03,839
you have but you can

1018
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,519
uh you don't have to pipe it directly to

1019
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,319
the brain i mean we already have

1020
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,679
devices like phones where we can look up

1021
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,599
information at any point

1022
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,599
yeah and that can make us more

1023
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,639
productive you don't have to argue about

1024
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,480
i don't know what happened in that

1025
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,838
baseball game or whatever it is because

1026
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,760
you can look it up right away and i

1027
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,239
think in that sense

1028
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,960
we can learn to utilize tools and that's

1029
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,598
what we

1030
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,240
we have been doing for a long long time

1031
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,240
um

1032
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,559
so and we are already the brain is

1033
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,439
already drinking from the water

1034
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,000
fire hose like vision there's way more

1035
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,599
information

1036
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,119
in the vision that we actually process

1037
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,480
so brain is already good at

1038
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,879
identifying what matters yeah and

1039
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,320
that we can switch that from vision to

1040
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:46,078
some other wavelength or some other kind

1041
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,760
of modality but i think that the same

1042
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,200
processing principles probably still

1043
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,399
apply uh but

1044
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,559
but also indeed this uh ability to

1045
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:55,918
uh have information more accessible and

1046
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,639
more relevant i think

1047
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,358
can enhance what we do i mean kids today

1048
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,838
at school

1049
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:04,559
they learn about dna i mean things that

1050
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:06,719
we discovered just a couple of years ago

1051
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:08,880
and it's already common knowledge and we

1052
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:12,399
are building on it and we don't see

1053
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,160
a problem where um where

1054
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,920
there's too much information that we can

1055
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,039
absorb and learn maybe people become a

1056
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,680
little bit more

1057
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,800
narrow in what they know they are in one

1058
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,960
field

1059
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,039
but this information that we have

1060
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,159
accumulated it is passed on and people

1061
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,000
are picking up on it

1062
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,199
and they are building on it so it's not

1063
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,480
like we have reached the point of

1064
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,879
saturation

1065
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,400
um we have still this process that

1066
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,640
allows us to be selective

1067
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,440
and decide what's interesting um i think

1068
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:39,118
still works

1069
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,358
even even with the more information we

1070
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,039
have today yeah it's fascinating to

1071
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,639
think about

1072
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:48,320
like wikipedia becoming a sensor like uh

1073
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:49,759
so the fire hose of information from

1074
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,760
wikipedia so it's like you

1075
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,040
integrate it directly into the brain to

1076
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,720
where you're thinking like you're

1077
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,719
observing the world with all of

1078
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,759
wikipedia directly piping into your

1079
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,719
brain

1080
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,400
so like when i see a light i immediately

1081
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:06,159
have like the history of

1082
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,960
who invented electricity like integrated

1083
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,319
very quickly into so just the way you

1084
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,119
think about the world might be very

1085
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,240
interesting

1086
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,720
if you can integrate that kind of

1087
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,519
information what are your thoughts if i

1088
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,439
could ask

1089
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:20,880
uh on uh early steps on that on the

1090
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,760
neurolink side i don't know if you got a

1091
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,119
chance to see but

1092
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,800
uh there's a monkey playing pong

1093
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,720
yeah through the brain computer

1094
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,800
interface and uh

1095
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,679
the dream there is sort of you're

1096
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,839
already replacing the thumbs essentially

1097
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:37,759
that you would use to play video game

1098
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:41,599
the dream is to be able to

1099
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,280
increase further the the interface by

1100
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,800
which you interact with the computer

1101
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,720
are you impressed by this are you

1102
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,920
worried about this what are your

1103
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,279
thoughts as a human

1104
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,039
i think it's wonderful i think it's

1105
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,880
great that we could we could do

1106
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,199
something like that i mean you can

1107
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,079
there are devices that read your eeg for

1108
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,118
instance

1109
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,680
and and you and humans can learn um

1110
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,160
to control things using using just their

1111
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,239
thoughts

1112
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,679
in that sense and i i don't think it's

1113
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,199
that different i mean those signals

1114
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:08,000
would go to limbs they would go to

1115
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,719
thumbs

1116
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,760
uh now the same signals go through a

1117
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:15,838
sensor to some computing system

1118
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,119
it still probably has to be built on

1119
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,440
human terms

1120
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,599
uh not to overwhelm them but but utilize

1121
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,800
what's there and sense the right kind of

1122
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,440
um

1123
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,079
patterns that are easy to generate but

1124
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,400
oh that

1125
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,000
i think is really quite possible and and

1126
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,160
wonderful and could be very much more

1127
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,159
efficient

1128
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:36,078
is there so you mentioned surprising

1129
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:38,319
being a characteristic of

1130
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,400
uh creativity is there something you

1131
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,920
already mentioned a few examples but

1132
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,559
is there something that jumps out at you

1133
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,599
as was particularly surprising

1134
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:49,358
from the various evolutionary

1135
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,559
computation systems you've worked on

1136
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:52,559
the solutions that were

1137
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,920
come up along the way not necessarily

1138
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,720
the final solutions but

1139
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,320
maybe things have even discarded is

1140
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,039
there something that just jumps to mind

1141
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,320
it it happens all the time i mean

1142
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:07,440
evolution is so

1143
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,440
creative uh so good at discovering

1144
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,358
uh solutions you don't anticipate a lot

1145
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,960
of times they are

1146
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:14,480
taking advantage of something that you

1147
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,920
didn't think was there like a bug in the

1148
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,599
software for instance

1149
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,039
a lot of there's a great paper uh the

1150
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,359
community put it together

1151
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:22,880
about uh surprising anecdotes about

1152
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,639
evolution computation

1153
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,240
a lot of them are indeed in some

1154
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:29,279
software environment there was an

1155
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:31,439
a loophole or a bug and the system uh

1156
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,040
utilizes that by the way for people who

1157
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,960
want to read it's kind of fun to read

1158
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,960
it's called the surprising creativity of

1159
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,559
digital evolution a collection of

1160
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,679
anecdotes from the evolutionary

1161
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,679
computation and

1162
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,519
artificial life research communities and

1163
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,519
there's just a bunch of stories from all

1164
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,838
the seminal figures in this community

1165
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,960
uh you have a story in there uh that

1166
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,279
released to you at least

1167
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,720
on the tic-tac-toe memory bomb so can

1168
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,880
you can you uh

1169
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,480
i guess uh describe that situation if

1170
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,280
you think that's yeah

1171
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,159
that was that's a quite a bit smaller

1172
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,040
scale than our

1173
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,519
um basil doesn't need to sleep surprised

1174
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:05,358
but

1175
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:06,639
but it was actually done by students in

1176
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,319
my class um

1177
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,960
in a neural net evolution computation

1178
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,160
class uh there was an assignment

1179
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,519
uh it was perhaps a final project where

1180
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:20,319
people built game playing uh ai

1181
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,239
it was an ai class uh and this one and

1182
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,039
and it was for tic-tac-toe or

1183
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,078
five in a row in a large board uh and uh

1184
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,639
this one team

1185
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,519
evolved a neural network to make these

1186
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,559
moves

1187
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,079
uh and um they set it up the evolution

1188
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:35,199
they didn't really know what would come

1189
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,720
out

1190
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:37,919
but it turned out that they did really

1191
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,799
well evolution actually won the

1192
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,880
tournament

1193
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,320
and most of the time when it won it went

1194
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,559
because the other teams

1195
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,599
crashed and then when we look at it like

1196
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:47,199
what was going on

1197
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,519
was that evolution discovered that if it

1198
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,000
makes a move that's really really far

1199
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,358
away

1200
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,239
like millions of squares away

1201
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,759
the other teams the other programs just

1202
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,439
expanded memory

1203
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,200
in order to take that into account until

1204
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,599
they ran out of memory and crashed

1205
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,679
and then you win a tournament by

1206
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,119
crushing all your opponents

1207
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:12,399
i think that's quite a profound example

1208
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,838
which it probably applies to most

1209
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,880
games from even a game theoretic

1210
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:18,799
perspective

1211
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,160
that sometimes to win you don't have to

1212
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,800
be

1213
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:24,399
better within the rules of the game you

1214
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,760
have to come up with ways to

1215
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,720
break your opponent's uh

1216
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,160
brain as a human like not through

1217
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:36,399
violence but through

1218
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:39,199
some hack where the brain just is not um

1219
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,400
you're basically uh how would you put it

1220
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,960
you're

1221
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,480
the you're going outside the constraints

1222
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,920
of where the brain is able to

1223
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,159
to function expectations of your

1224
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,159
opponent i mean yeah this was even

1225
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,838
kasparov pointed that out that when the

1226
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:52,960
blue was playing against kasparov that

1227
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,920
it was not playing

1228
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,199
the same way as kasparov expected uh and

1229
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,800
this has to do with

1230
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:00,719
you know being not having the same

1231
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,800
biases uh

1232
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,719
and that's that's really one of the

1233
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,280
strengths of of the

1234
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,159
ai approach yeah can you at a high level

1235
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,560
say

1236
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,000
what are the basic mechanisms of

1237
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:15,039
evolutionary computation

1238
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,519
algorithms that use something that

1239
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:19,039
could be called an evolutionary approach

1240
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,599
like how does it work

1241
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,358
uh what are the connections to the it's

1242
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,720
what are the echoes of the connection to

1243
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,400
is biological

1244
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,879
a lot of these algorithms really do take

1245
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,200
motivation from biology but they are

1246
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,559
carry catches you try to essentialize it

1247
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,559
and take the elements that

1248
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:35,838
you believe matter so in evolution

1249
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,318
computation

1250
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,199
it is the creation of variation and then

1251
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:41,759
the selection

1252
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,199
upon that so the creation of variation

1253
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,800
you have to have some mechanism that

1254
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,000
allow you to create new individuals that

1255
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,359
are very different from

1256
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,519
what you already have that's the

1257
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:51,199
creativity part and then you have to

1258
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:51,759
have some way of measuring how well they

1259
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,399
are doing

1260
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,200
uh and using the uh that measure to

1261
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,200
select

1262
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,799
uh who goes to the next generation and

1263
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,719
you continue so first you

1264
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,000
also you have to have some kind of

1265
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,759
digital representation

1266
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,838
of an individual that can be then

1267
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,800
modified so i guess humans

1268
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:09,920
i mean biological systems have dna and

1269
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,318
all those kinds of things and so you

1270
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,318
have to have similar kind of encodings

1271
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:16,000
in a computer program yes and that is a

1272
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,400
big question how do you encode

1273
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
these individuals so there's a genotype

1274
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,920
which is that encoding and then

1275
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,318
a decoding mechanism just gives you the

1276
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,960
phenotype which is the actual individual

1277
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:29,279
that then

1278
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,679
performs the task and in an environment

1279
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,359
can be evaluated how good it is so even

1280
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,799
that mapping is a big question and how

1281
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:36,960
do you do it

1282
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,560
but typically the representations are

1283
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,480
either they are strings of numbers or

1284
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:42,159
they are some kind of trees those are

1285
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,318
something we know very well in computer

1286
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,799
science and we try to do that but they

1287
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,519
and you know dna in some sense is also a

1288
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,560
sequence

1289
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:52,880
um and it's a string um

1290
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,719
so it's not that far from it but dna

1291
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,079
also has many other aspects

1292
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:59,118
that we don't take into account

1293
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,280
necessarily like this folding and

1294
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,519
and interactions that are other than

1295
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,160
just the sequence itself

1296
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,838
and lots of that is not yet captured and

1297
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:10,960
we don't know whether they are

1298
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:12,480
really crucial um evolution biological

1299
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,920
evolution has produced

1300
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,760
wonderful things but if you look at them

1301
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,680
it's not necessarily the case that every

1302
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,160
piece is irreplaceable

1303
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,759
and essential there's a lot of baggage

1304
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,519
because you have to construct it and it

1305
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,240
has to go through various stages and we

1306
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,719
still have

1307
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,159
appendiciti appendix and we have

1308
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,279
tailbones and things like that that are

1309
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:33,440
not really that useful

1310
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,400
if you try to explain them now it would

1311
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,200
make no sense

1312
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,639
very hard but if you think of us as

1313
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:40,000
productive evolution you can see where

1314
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,838
they came from they were useful

1315
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,358
at one point perhaps and and no longer

1316
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:46,719
are but they're still there

1317
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:49,199
so um that process is complex

1318
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:50,399
uh and your representation should

1319
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:54,399
support it

1320
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:57,280
uh and that is quite difficult

1321
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,880
if if we are limited with strings or

1322
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,920
trees

1323
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,599
and then we are pretty much limited what

1324
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,519
can be constructed

1325
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,519
and one thing that we are still missing

1326
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,318
in evolution computation in particular

1327
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,358
is

1328
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:14,159
what we saw in biology major transitions

1329
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,838
so that you go from for instance single

1330
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:17,279
cell to multi-cell organisms

1331
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:18,880
and eventually societies there are

1332
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,000
transitions of level of

1333
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,079
selection and level of what a unit is

1334
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,920
and that's something we haven't captured

1335
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,560
in evolution computation yet

1336
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,920
does that require a dramatic expansion

1337
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,960
of the representation

1338
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,920
is that what that that is most likely it

1339
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,440
does but it's

1340
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,599
quite we don't even understand it in

1341
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,599
biology very well where it's coming from

1342
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,200
so it would be really good to look at

1343
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,359
major transitions in biology try to

1344
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:45,358
characterize them a little bit more in

1345
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:48,559
detail what the processes are

1346
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:50,880
how how does a so like a unit a cell

1347
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,440
is no longer evaluated alone it's

1348
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,440
evaluated as part of a community

1349
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,720
organism right even though it could

1350
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,480
reproduce now it can't

1351
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:00,000
alone and it has has to have its

1352
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,480
environment so there's a

1353
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,280
there's a push to another level at least

1354
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,719
the selection

1355
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,319
and how do you make that jump to this

1356
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,199
yes how do you make the jump that's part

1357
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:09,358
of the algorithm

1358
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,118
yeah yeah so we haven't really seen that

1359
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,838
in computation

1360
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,480
um yet and there are certainly attempts

1361
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:17,119
to have

1362
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,358
open-ended evolution things that could

1363
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,838
add more complexity and start

1364
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,039
selecting at a higher level but it is

1365
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:25,599
still not

1366
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,480
um quite the same as going from single

1367
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,760
to multi to

1368
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,240
society for instance in in biology so so

1369
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,359
there essentially would be as opposed to

1370
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:34,879
having one agent

1371
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,480
those agent all of a sudden

1372
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,760
spontaneously decide to

1373
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,960
then be together and then your entire

1374
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,520
system

1375
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,639
would then be treating them as one agent

1376
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,559
something like that

1377
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,239
some kind of weird merger building but

1378
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,759
also so you mentioned i think you

1379
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:50,000
mentioned selection so basically there's

1380
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,200
an

1381
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,639
agent and they don't get to live on

1382
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:56,239
if they don't do well so there's some

1383
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:57,279
kind of measure of what doing well is

1384
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,879
and isn't

1385
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,079
and uh does the mutation come into play

1386
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,519
at all

1387
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,200
in the process and what the world does

1388
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,960
it serve yeah so

1389
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,639
in again back to what the computational

1390
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,440
mechanisms of evolution computation are

1391
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,719
so

1392
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,559
um the way to create variation uh you

1393
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:15,439
can take multiple individuals too

1394
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,358
usually but

1395
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,039
but you could do more and you exchanged

1396
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:22,480
the part of the representation you do

1397
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:25,759
some kind of recombination

1398
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,800
it could be crossover for instance um

1399
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,680
in biology you do have dna strings that

1400
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,400
that are

1401
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,440
cut and put together again we could do

1402
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,480
something like that

1403
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:40,159
um and it seems to be that in biology

1404
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,519
crossover is really the workhorse in in

1405
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:47,118
biological evolution in computation

1406
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:50,239
we tend to rely more on mutation

1407
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,400
and that is making random changes into

1408
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:55,118
parts of the chromosome you try to be

1409
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,680
intelligent and target certain areas of

1410
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,200
it

1411
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,199
and make the mutations also

1412
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,358
follow some principle like you collect

1413
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,480
statistics of performance and

1414
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:06,078
correlations

1415
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,920
and try to make mutations you believe

1416
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,839
are going to be helpful

1417
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,440
that's where evolution computation has

1418
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:12,880
moved in the last

1419
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,559
20 years i mean evolution competition

1420
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,519
has been around for 50 years but a lot

1421
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:17,920
of the recent

1422
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:19,119
um success comes from mutation comes

1423
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,280
from comes from

1424
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,039
using statistics it's like the rest of

1425
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,240
machine learning based on statistics we

1426
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,318
use similar tools

1427
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:28,318
to guide evolutionary computation and in

1428
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:30,639
that sense it has diverged

1429
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,239
a bit from biological evolution and

1430
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:35,519
that's one of the things i think

1431
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:38,479
we could look at again

1432
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,679
having a weaker selection more crossover

1433
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,240
large populations

1434
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:43,838
more time and maybe a different kind of

1435
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,159
creativity would come out of it

1436
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:48,159
we are very impatient in evolution

1437
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,519
competition today we want answers right

1438
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,519
now right quickly

1439
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,719
and every if no somebody doesn't perform

1440
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:55,280
kill it yeah

1441
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:56,078
uh and biological evolution doesn't work

1442
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,400
quite that way

1443
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,920
uh and and it's more patient yes much

1444
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,039
more patient

1445
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,960
so i guess we need to add some kind of

1446
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,358
mating some kind of like dating

1447
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,639
mechanisms like marriage may be in there

1448
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:11,598
so to uh in into our algorithms to

1449
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:13,920
improve the the

1450
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,920
the the combination mechanism as opposed

1451
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,240
to all mutation doing all of the work

1452
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,960
yeah and many ways of being successful

1453
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:20,558
you know

1454
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,800
usually in every competition we have one

1455
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,519
goal you know play

1456
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,318
this game really well uh and compared to

1457
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:28,079
others but

1458
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:30,719
in biology there are many ways of being

1459
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,000
successful you can build niches you can

1460
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,558
be stronger faster larger or smarter

1461
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,358
or you know eat this or eat that or you

1462
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,359
know so

1463
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:40,558
so there are many ways to solve the same

1464
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,759
problem of survival

1465
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,800
and that then breeds creativity um

1466
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,079
and um it allows more exploration and

1467
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,039
eventually you get

1468
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,640
solutions that are perhaps more creative

1469
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,880
rather than trying to go from

1470
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,318
initial population directly or more or

1471
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,200
less directly to your

1472
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,800
maximum fitness which you measure that's

1473
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:03,919
just one metric

1474
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:08,000
so in a broad sense

1475
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,000
before we talk about newer evolution

1476
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:12,799
do you see evolutionary computation as

1477
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,078
more effective than deep learning in

1478
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,800
certain contexts

1479
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,519
machine learning broadly speaking maybe

1480
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
even

1481
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,880
supervised machine learning i don't know

1482
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,559
if you want to draw any kind of lines

1483
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,240
and distinctions and

1484
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,000
borders where they rub up against each

1485
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:27,439
other kind of thing or one is more

1486
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,400
effective than the other in the current

1487
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,159
state of things

1488
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,760
yes of course they are very different

1489
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,118
and they address different kinds of

1490
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,079
problems and

1491
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,760
the deep learning has been really

1492
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,680
successful in domains where we have a

1493
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,760
lot of data

1494
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:43,598
and that means not just data about

1495
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,040
situations but also what the right

1496
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,200
answers were

1497
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:48,800
so labeled examples or they might be

1498
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:50,639
predictions may be weather prediction

1499
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,318
where the data itself

1500
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,239
becomes labels what happened what the

1501
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:58,239
weather was today and what will

1502
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:59,919
be tomorrow so they are very effective

1503
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:01,279
deep learning methods on that kind of

1504
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,519
tasks

1505
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,119
but there are other kinds of tasks where

1506
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:06,000
we don't really know what the right

1507
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,880
answer is

1508
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,519
uh game playing for instance but many

1509
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,519
robotics tasks and

1510
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:18,000
actions in the world decision making um

1511
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,358
and actual practical applications like

1512
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
treatments and healthcare

1513
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:22,639
or investment in stock market many tasks

1514
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,559
are like that

1515
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,558
we will we don't know and we'll never

1516
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,000
know what the optimal answers were

1517
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,760
and there you need different kinds of

1518
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,480
approaches reinforcement learning is one

1519
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,160
of those

1520
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,679
uh reinforcement learning comes from

1521
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,519
biology as well

1522
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:37,519
agents learn during their lifetime they

1523
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,400
eat berries and sometimes they get sick

1524
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,119
and then they don't

1525
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,160
and get stronger and then that's how you

1526
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,200
learn

1527
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:45,920
and evolution is also a mechanism like

1528
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:47,439
that

1529
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,680
at a different time scale because you

1530
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,720
have a population not an individual

1531
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,838
during its lifetime

1532
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,159
but an entire population as a whole can

1533
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:56,719
discover um

1534
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:58,799
what works and there you can afford

1535
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,558
individuals that don't work out

1536
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,400
they will you know everybody dies and

1537
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,079
you have a next generation and it will

1538
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,639
be better than the previous one

1539
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,079
so that's that's the big difference

1540
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:11,199
between these methods they apply

1541
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:14,400
to different kinds of problems um and

1542
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:16,078
um in particular there's often a

1543
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,358
comparison that's kind of interesting

1544
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:20,000
and important between reinforcement

1545
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:23,358
learning and evolution and computation

1546
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,838
and initially um reinforcement learning

1547
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,000
was about

1548
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:27,440
individual learning during the lifetime

1549
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,039
and evolution is more

1550
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,960
engineering you don't care about the

1551
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,880
lifetime you don't care about all the

1552
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,400
individuals that are tested you only

1553
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,599
care about the final result

1554
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,119
the last one the best candidate that

1555
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,640
evolution produced

1556
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,318
in that sense they also apply to

1557
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,199
different kinds of problems

1558
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:45,679
and now that boundary is starting to

1559
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:48,239
blur

1560
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:50,000
a bit you can use evolution as an online

1561
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,239
method and reinforcement learning to

1562
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,039
create engineering solutions but that's

1563
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:57,039
still

1564
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:59,039
roughly the distinction and

1565
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,239
from the point of view what algorithm

1566
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:01,759
you want to use

1567
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:03,838
if you have something where there is a

1568
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,000
cost for every trial reinforcement

1569
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:08,159
learning might be your choice

1570
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,159
now if you have a domain where you can

1571
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,480
use a surrogate perhaps

1572
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:13,519
so you don't have much of a cost for

1573
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,719
trial

1574
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:18,559
and you want to have surprises you want

1575
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:22,159
to explore more broadly

1576
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,160
then this population-based method is

1577
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:26,318
perhaps a better choice because you you

1578
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:28,558
can try things out that you wouldn't

1579
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:31,599
afford when you're doing reinforcement

1580
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,760
there's very few things as entertaining

1581
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,599
as watching either evolution competition

1582
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,160
or reinforcement learning teaching a

1583
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:41,440
simulated robot to walk

1584
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,719
i maybe there's a

1585
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,720
higher level question that could be

1586
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:46,879
asked here but

1587
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:49,199
do you find this whole space in of

1588
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,760
applications in the robotics

1589
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,960
interesting for evolution computation

1590
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,359
yeah yeah very much

1591
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,400
um and indeed that's the fascinating

1592
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:58,318
videos of that

1593
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,559
and that's actually one of the examples

1594
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,639
where you can contrast the difference

1595
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,079
so between reinforcement learning

1596
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:05,519
evolution yes so

1597
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,119
if you have a reinforcement learning

1598
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,599
agent it tries to be

1599
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,760
conservative because it wants to walk as

1600
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,680
long as possible and be stable

1601
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,960
but if you have evolutionary computation

1602
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,000
it can afford

1603
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,240
these agents that go haywire they

1604
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,920
fall flat on their face and they could

1605
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,239
take a step and then they jump and then

1606
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,280
again fall flat yeah and eventually what

1607
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,439
comes out of that

1608
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,960
is something like a falling that's

1609
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,480
controlled yeah

1610
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,318
and you take another step another step

1611
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,719
and you no longer fall

1612
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:36,159
instead you run you go fast so that's a

1613
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:37,838
way of discovering

1614
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,519
something that's hard to discover step

1615
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:42,000
by step incrementally

1616
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:42,880
because you can afford these

1617
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,119
evolutionists

1618
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,318
dead ends although they are not entirely

1619
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,680
dead ends in the sense that they can

1620
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:49,279
serve as stepping stones

1621
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:50,799
when you take two of those put them

1622
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,400
together you get something that works

1623
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,720
even better

1624
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,800
and that is a great example of of this

1625
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:57,279
kind of discovery yeah learning to walk

1626
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,280
is a

1627
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,519
is fascinating i talked quite a bit to

1628
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,040
russ tedron because mit

1629
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,440
there's a there's a community of folks

1630
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:09,279
who who just roboticists who love

1631
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:13,119
the elegance and beauty of uh movement

1632
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:16,480
right and uh walking bipedal

1633
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:18,800
robotics is um

1634
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,800
beautiful but also exceptionally

1635
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,800
dangerous in the sense that like

1636
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,359
you're constantly falling essentially if

1637
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:30,400
you want to do elegant movement

1638
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:30,400
and uh the discovery of that is uh

1639
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:37,358
i mean it it's such a good example of um

1640
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,200
that the discovery of a good solution

1641
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:41,358
sometimes requires a leap of faith and

1642
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:43,358
patience and all those kinds of things

1643
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:44,880
i wonder what other spaces where you

1644
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:46,239
have to discover those kinds of things

1645
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,318
in

1646
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:50,639
yeah yeah yeah and another interesting

1647
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:54,480
direction is um

1648
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:55,838
learning um for for uh virtual creatures

1649
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,358
learning to walk

1650
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,480
uh we did a study in in simulation

1651
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:03,440
obviously that

1652
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,358
um you create those creatures not just

1653
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,240
their controller but also their body so

1654
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:08,239
you have

1655
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,519
cylinders you have muscles you have

1656
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:12,558
joints

1657
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:14,079
and sensors and you're creating

1658
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,760
creatures that look quite different some

1659
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,599
of them have multiple legs some of them

1660
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,520
have no legs at all

1661
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,519
and then the goal was to get them to

1662
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:24,159
move the walk to run

1663
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:25,358
uh and what was interesting is is that

1664
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:28,318
when you evolve

1665
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:29,838
the controller together with the body

1666
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,679
you get movements that look

1667
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:33,519
natural because they're optimized for

1668
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:35,279
that physical setup

1669
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:36,798
and and these creatures you start

1670
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,319
believing them that they're alive

1671
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:39,440
because they walk in a way that you

1672
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,000
would expect somebody

1673
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,200
with that kind of a setup to walk yeah

1674
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,880
there's a

1675
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:46,639
there's something subjective also about

1676
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,960
that right i've been thinking a lot

1677
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:53,039
about that especially in

1678
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:56,079
the human robot interaction context

1679
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:58,318
you know i mentioned spot the boston

1680
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,160
dynamics robot

1681
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:01,358
there is something about human robot

1682
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:03,358
communication

1683
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,480
let's say let's put in another context

1684
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:07,920
something about

1685
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:11,358
human and uh dog context

1686
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,720
like like a living dog where there's uh

1687
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:14,239
there's a there's a dance of

1688
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:16,000
communication first of all the eyes you

1689
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,919
both look at the same thing and you

1690
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,440
dogs communicate with their eyes as well

1691
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,880
like if if the

1692
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:24,639
if you and a dog want to uh

1693
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,079
like deal with a particular object you

1694
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:27,440
will look at the person

1695
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,960
the dog will look at you and then look

1696
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,159
at the object and look back at you all

1697
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,720
those kinds of things

1698
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:33,199
but there's also just a elegance of

1699
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:35,679
movement

1700
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:37,199
i mean there's the of course the tail

1701
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:39,679
and all those kinds of mechanisms of

1702
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:43,279
communication it all seems natural

1703
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:45,118
and often joyful and for robots to

1704
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,720
communicate that

1705
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,559
is it's really difficult how to figure

1706
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:51,039
that out because it's it's almost

1707
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:53,440
seems impossible to hard code in you can

1708
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,358
hard code it for a demo purpose with so

1709
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,000
you know something like that but it's

1710
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,358
essentially choreographed

1711
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,760
like if you watch some of the boston

1712
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:04,239
dynamics videos where they're dancing

1713
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,599
all of that is choreographed by human

1714
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:09,439
beings

1715
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:12,960
but to learn how to with your movement

1716
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,960
demonstrate a naturalness and elegance

1717
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,480
that's fascinating of course in the

1718
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,798
physical space that's very difficult to

1719
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,039
do

1720
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:20,798
to learn the kind of at scale that

1721
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:22,400
you're referring to but

1722
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:24,159
the hope is that you could do that in

1723
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,358
stimulation and then transfer into the

1724
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:26,879
physical space

1725
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:28,639
if you're able to model the robots

1726
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,880
efficiently naturally

1727
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,639
yeah and and sometimes i think that that

1728
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,480
requires a theory of mind

1729
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:36,159
on the yes on the on the side of the

1730
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,400
robot that

1731
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:39,519
that they as they understand what you're

1732
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,440
doing because they

1733
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:43,920
themselves are doing something similar

1734
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,880
and uh that's a big question too

1735
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,358
uh we talked about how intelligence in

1736
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,358
general

1737
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:50,400
and and the social aspect of of

1738
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:52,239
intelligence and

1739
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,000
i think that's what is required that we

1740
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:55,439
humans understand other humans because

1741
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,480
we assume that they are similar

1742
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,838
to us um we have one simulation we did a

1743
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,960
while ago ken stanley

1744
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:06,480
um did that um two robots that were

1745
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,480
uh competing um simulation like you said

1746
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,240
they were foraging for food to gain

1747
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,039
energy and then when they were really

1748
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:13,199
strong they would

1749
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:14,798
bounce into the other robot and win if

1750
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:17,439
they were stronger

1751
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:19,440
and we watched evolution discover more

1752
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,200
and more complex behaviors they

1753
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,200
first went to the nearest food and then

1754
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:25,279
they started to

1755
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:27,439
plot a trajectory so they get more get

1756
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,599
more but then they started to take

1757
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,519
pay attention what the other robot was

1758
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,640
doing and in the end there was a

1759
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:34,400
behavior

1760
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,879
where one of the robots the most

1761
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,440
sophisticated one

1762
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,160
you know sensed where the food pieces

1763
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,240
were

1764
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:43,440
and identified that the other robot was

1765
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:46,159
close to uh

1766
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,280
two of a very far distance uh and there

1767
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:50,879
was one more food

1768
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,960
near by so it faked

1769
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,039
that's now i'm using anthropomorphized

1770
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,838
terms but it made a move towards those

1771
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:57,519
other pieces

1772
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:59,039
in order for the other robot to actually

1773
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:01,280
go and get them

1774
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,440
because it knew that the other the last

1775
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,880
remaining piece of food was close

1776
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,880
and the other robot would have to travel

1777
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:10,318
a long way lose its energy

1778
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,559
and then lose the whole competition

1779
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:13,679
so there was like emergence of something

1780
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,640
like a theory of mind

1781
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:18,798
knowing what the other robot would do

1782
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:19,358
guided towards bad behavior in order to

1783
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:21,599
win

1784
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:23,358
so we can get things like that happen uh

1785
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,240
in in simulation as well but that's a

1786
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:26,000
complete

1787
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:27,679
natural emergence of a theory of mind

1788
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,719
but i feel like if you

1789
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,960
add a little bit of a place for a theory

1790
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:36,959
of mind to emerge

1791
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:38,720
like easier then you can go really far

1792
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,400
i mean some of these things with

1793
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:43,039
evolution

1794
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,838
you know you add a little bit of design

1795
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:46,798
in there

1796
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:47,519
it'll really help and i think i tend to

1797
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,719
think that

1798
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:52,719
a very simple theory of mind

1799
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,798
will go a really long way for

1800
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,480
cooperation between agents

1801
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:58,239
and certainly for human robot

1802
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,039
interaction like it doesn't have to be

1803
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:02,318
super complicated um

1804
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:05,199
i've gotten a chance to in the

1805
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:07,039
autonomous vehicle space to watch

1806
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:08,879
vehicles interact with pedestrians or

1807
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,838
pedestrians interacting with vehicles in

1808
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,680
general

1809
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:12,960
i mean you would think that there's a

1810
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:15,199
very complicated

1811
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,039
theory of mind thing going on but i have

1812
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:19,358
a sense it's not well understood yet but

1813
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:22,880
i have a sense it's pretty dumb

1814
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:23,838
like it's pretty simple there's a social

1815
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,838
contract

1816
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:28,159
there where between humans a human

1817
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:31,599
driver and a human crossing the road

1818
01:00:28,159 --> 01:00:33,039
where um the the human crossing the road

1819
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,480
trusts that the human in the car is not

1820
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:36,400
going to murder them

1821
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,159
and there's something about again back

1822
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,519
to that mortality thing

1823
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:45,519
there's some dance

1824
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:47,519
of ethics and morality that's built in

1825
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:48,559
that you're mapping your own morality

1826
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,639
onto the

1827
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,760
the person in the car and even if

1828
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:54,480
they're driving

1829
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,160
at a speed where you think if they don't

1830
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,838
stop they're going to kill you

1831
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:59,440
you trust that if you step in front of

1832
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:02,159
them they're going to hit the brakes

1833
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,639
and there's that weird dance that we do

1834
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,199
that

1835
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:06,719
i think is a pretty simple model but of

1836
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:09,519
course it's very difficult

1837
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:11,519
to introspect what it is and autonomous

1838
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:12,960
robots in the human robot interaction

1839
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:14,880
context have to

1840
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,280
have to build that current robots are

1841
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,680
much less than what you're describing

1842
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,280
they're

1843
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:21,039
currently just afraid of everything

1844
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,680
they're they're more they're not the

1845
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:24,239
kind that

1846
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:24,879
fall and discover how to run they're

1847
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:27,199
more like

1848
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,079
please don't touch anything don't hurt

1849
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:30,159
anything

1850
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:31,440
stay as far away from humans as possible

1851
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:33,519
treat

1852
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,798
humans as ballistic objects that you

1853
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:37,920
can't

1854
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:38,719
uh that you do uh with a large spatial

1855
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,880
envelope

1856
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:42,798
make sure you do not collide with that's

1857
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,440
how like you mentioned elon

1858
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:46,639
musk thinks about autonomous vehicles i

1859
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,159
tend to think

1860
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:49,759
autonomous vehicles need to have a

1861
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,558
beautiful dance between human and

1862
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,240
machine

1863
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:55,200
where it's not just a collision

1864
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:57,279
avoidance problem but a weird

1865
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:58,639
dance yeah i think that you these

1866
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,640
systems need to be

1867
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:02,239
able to predict what will happen what

1868
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:05,440
the other agent is going to do

1869
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,879
and then have a structure of

1870
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,559
what the goals are and whether those

1871
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,039
predictions actually meet the goals and

1872
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,599
and you

1873
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:13,440
can go probably pretty far with that

1874
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,440
relatively simple setup already

1875
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,720
but to call it a theory of mind i don't

1876
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,240
think you need to i mean it

1877
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:20,000
it doesn't matter whether a pedestrian

1878
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:21,838
has a mind it's an object

1879
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,440
and we can predict what we'll do and

1880
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,880
then we can predict what the states will

1881
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,079
be in the future and whether they are

1882
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,280
desirable states

1883
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,039
stay away from those that are

1884
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,079
undesirable and go towards those that

1885
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,640
are desirable so

1886
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,480
it's a relatively simple functional

1887
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:36,400
approach to that

1888
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,159
where do we really need the theory of

1889
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,880
mind

1890
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:41,440
maybe maybe when you start interacting

1891
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,119
and

1892
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,519
you're trying to get the other agent to

1893
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,400
do something and jointly so that you can

1894
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:48,559
jointly

1895
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,400
collaboratively achieve something then

1896
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,839
then you then it becomes more complex

1897
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,440
well i mean even with the pedestrians

1898
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:54,798
you have to have a sense of where their

1899
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,358
attention

1900
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:58,559
actual attention in terms of their gaze

1901
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,078
is but also like

1902
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,519
a tent i mean there's this vision

1903
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,000
science people talk about this all time

1904
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:03,199
just because

1905
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,039
i'm looking at it doesn't mean i'm

1906
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:07,118
paying attention to it so

1907
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:08,480
figuring out what is the person looking

1908
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,760
at what is the sensory information

1909
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,480
they've taken in

1910
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,200
and the theory of mind piece comes in is

1911
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,400
what are they

1912
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:18,879
actually attending to cognitively

1913
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,400
and also what are they thinking about

1914
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,039
like what is the computation they're

1915
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,200
performing

1916
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:25,440
and you have you have probably maybe a

1917
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:28,239
few options

1918
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,119
you know for the pedestrian crossing it

1919
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:31,038
doesn't have to be

1920
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,640
it's like a variable with a few discrete

1921
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,240
states but you have to have a good

1922
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:35,358
estimation which of the states that

1923
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:37,199
brain is in

1924
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:39,199
for the pedestrian case and the same is

1925
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:40,798
for attending with a robot

1926
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:43,118
if you're collaborating to pick up an

1927
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:46,480
object you have to figure out

1928
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:48,318
is the human like uh like there's a few

1929
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,838
discrete states that the human could be

1930
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:51,358
and you have to

1931
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:53,199
you have to predict that by observing

1932
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:55,199
the human and that seems like a machine

1933
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:58,078
learning problem to figure out

1934
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:59,199
uh what's how the human is uh what's the

1935
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,079
human up to

1936
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:03,358
it's not as simple as sort of planning

1937
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,519
just because they move their

1938
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:06,719
arm means the arm will continue moving

1939
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:08,079
in this direction

1940
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:09,919
you have to you have to really have a

1941
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,559
model of what they're thinking about and

1942
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,798
what's the

1943
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,599
motivation behind the moment and here we

1944
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:16,239
are talking about

1945
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,519
uh relatively simple physical actions

1946
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:20,239
yeah but you can take that

1947
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:22,000
the higher levels also like to predict

1948
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:23,038
what the people are going to do you need

1949
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,239
to know

1950
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:28,000
what uh what their goals are uh what are

1951
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:28,399
they trying to are they exercising are

1952
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,079
they

1953
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,920
starting to get somewhere but even even

1954
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:33,440
higher level i mean you are

1955
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,200
predicting what people will do in their

1956
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,240
career what their life themes are do

1957
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:39,358
they want to be famous

1958
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:40,479
rich or do good and that takes a lot

1959
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:42,318
more information

1960
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,318
but it allows you to then predict their

1961
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:45,679
their actions what choices they might

1962
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:48,558
make

1963
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:49,118
so how does uh evolution computation

1964
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,880
apply

1965
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,400
to the world of neural networks because

1966
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,559
i've seen quite a bit of work

1967
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,480
from you and others on the in the world

1968
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:58,720
of neural evolution so maybe first

1969
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,920
can you say what is this field yeah a

1970
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:02,318
new evolution

1971
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,318
is a combination of of uh neural

1972
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:07,358
networks and evolution computation

1973
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:10,400
in many different forms but the early

1974
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:12,880
versions were simply using evolution

1975
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,920
the way um as a way to construct the

1976
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,720
neural network

1977
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:19,200
instead of say stochastic gradient

1978
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:21,759
descent or back propagation

1979
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:23,519
because evolution can evolve these

1980
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,119
parameters weight values in a neural

1981
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,280
network just like any other string of

1982
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,760
numbers you can you can do that

1983
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,720
and that's useful because some cases you

1984
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,520
don't have

1985
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,639
those targets that you need to um back

1986
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:36,318
propagate from

1987
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:37,920
and it might be an agent that's running

1988
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:40,079
a maze or a robot

1989
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,358
playing a game or something you don't

1990
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,039
again you don't know what the right

1991
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:44,880
answer says you don't have backup

1992
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,400
but this way you can still evolve in

1993
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,920
your own hand and

1994
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,160
neural networks are really good at this

1995
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,559
task because they um

1996
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:53,358
they recognize patterns and they and

1997
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,280
generalize

1998
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:56,719
interpolate between known situations so

1999
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,680
you want to have a neural network in

2000
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:59,519
such a task

2001
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:01,598
even if you don't have the supervised

2002
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:02,719
targets so that's a reason and that's a

2003
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,798
solution

2004
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:06,879
and also more recently now when we have

2005
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,798
all this deep learning literature

2006
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,000
it turns out that we can use evolution

2007
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,119
to optimize

2008
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,838
many aspects of those designs the deep

2009
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,240
learning

2010
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:17,759
architectures have become so complex

2011
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:19,519
that there's little hope for

2012
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,200
as little humans to understand their

2013
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,400
complexity and what actually makes a

2014
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:24,879
good design

2015
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,559
uh and now we can use evolution to give

2016
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,680
that design for you and it might be

2017
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:32,400
mean um optimizing hyper parameters

2018
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:34,078
like the depth of layers and so on uh or

2019
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,400
the topology of the network

2020
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,920
um how many layers how they're connected

2021
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,760
but also other aspects like what

2022
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,200
activation functions you use where

2023
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,760
in the network during the learning

2024
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:46,399
process or what loss function you use

2025
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,319
you could generalize that generate that

2026
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:51,119
even data augmentation all the different

2027
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:53,759
aspects of the design of deep learning

2028
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,838
experiments could be optimized that way

2029
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,880
so that's an inter interaction between

2030
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:00,000
two mechanisms

2031
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,358
but there's also when we get more into

2032
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,559
cognitive science and the topics that

2033
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:04,400
we've been talking about

2034
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,079
you could have learning mechanisms at

2035
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,639
two level time scales

2036
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,200
so you do have an evolution that gives

2037
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:11,598
you

2038
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:12,879
baby neural networks that then learn

2039
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:15,039
during their lifetime

2040
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,559
and you have this interaction of two

2041
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:19,359
time scales and i think that can

2042
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:22,000
potentially be really powerful

2043
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:22,558
now in biology we are not born with all

2044
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,400
our

2045
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:26,079
faculties we have to learn we have a

2046
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,280
developmental period in humans it's

2047
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,839
really long

2048
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,519
and most animals have something and and

2049
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:34,719
probably the reason is that

2050
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:36,798
evolution and dna is not detailed enough

2051
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:38,480
or plentiful enough to describe them we

2052
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:41,519
can't describe how to set the brain

2053
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:45,280
up but we can

2054
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:47,199
evolution can decide on a starting point

2055
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,480
and then have a learning algorithm that

2056
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:51,279
will construct

2057
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,920
the final product and this interaction

2058
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,039
of

2059
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,960
you know intelligent um well

2060
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,400
evolution that has produced a good

2061
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,720
starting point for the

2062
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,838
specific purpose of learning from it

2063
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:03,598
with the interaction of

2064
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:04,719
uh with the environment that can be a

2065
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,240
really powerful mechanism for

2066
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:07,919
constructing brains and construction

2067
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:09,279
behaviors

2068
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,119
i like how you walk back from

2069
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,240
intelligence so optimize

2070
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:17,600
starting point maybe uh yeah

2071
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:19,119
uh okay there's a lot of fascinating

2072
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,600
things to ask here and this is

2073
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:23,759
basically this dance between neural

2074
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,440
networks and evolutionary computations

2075
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,158
could go into the category of automated

2076
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:30,000
machine learning so where you're

2077
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,679
optimizing whether it's hyper parameters

2078
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,640
of the topology or

2079
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,399
hyper parameters taken broadly but the

2080
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,798
topology thing is really interesting i

2081
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:41,358
mean that's not really done that

2082
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:42,880
effectively or throughout the history of

2083
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:44,239
machine learning has not been

2084
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,600
done usually there's a fixed

2085
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:47,198
architecture maybe there's a few

2086
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,000
components you're playing with

2087
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:51,678
but to grow a neural network essentially

2088
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
the way you grow in their organisms

2089
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:54,960
really

2090
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,880
fascinating space how how hard it is it

2091
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,960
do you think

2092
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,798
to grow in your network and maybe what

2093
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,359
kind of neural networks

2094
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:04,479
are more amenable to this kind of idea

2095
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,600
than others

2096
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,519
i've seen quite a bit of work on

2097
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,039
recurrent neural networks is there some

2098
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,520
architectures

2099
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:13,198
that are friendlier than others and is

2100
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,600
is this just a fun

2101
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:16,559
small scale set of experiments or do you

2102
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,039
have hope

2103
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,319
that we can be able to grow powerful

2104
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:23,679
neural networks

2105
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:26,319
i i think we can uh and most of the work

2106
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:28,640
up to now is taking architectures that

2107
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:31,039
already exist that humans have designed

2108
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,119
and tried to optimize them further and

2109
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:34,560
and you can totally do that a few years

2110
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:35,920
ago we did an experiment we took a

2111
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:39,199
winner of the

2112
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:41,679
uh image captioning competition um

2113
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:42,798
and um the architecture and just broke

2114
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:44,399
it into pieces and

2115
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:46,560
took the pieces and and that was our

2116
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:48,238
search effects see if you can do better

2117
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,000
and we indeed could fifteen percent

2118
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:52,879
better performance by just

2119
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,960
searching around the network design that

2120
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,760
humans had come up with oriovenials

2121
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,800
and others uh so but that's starting

2122
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,119
from a point of

2123
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,400
point that humans have produced but we

2124
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:03,679
could

2125
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:05,679
do something more general it doesn't

2126
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:08,239
have to be that kind of network

2127
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:09,760
the the hard part is just a couple of

2128
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:10,639
challenges one of them is to define the

2129
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,960
search space

2130
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,560
what are your elements uh and how you

2131
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:18,560
put them together

2132
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,960
and the space is just really really big

2133
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,800
uh so you have to somehow constrain it

2134
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:24,319
and have some hunch of what will work

2135
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,360
uh because otherwise everything is

2136
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:28,960
possible and another challenge is that

2137
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:30,880
in order to evaluate how good your

2138
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,520
design is

2139
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,880
you have to train it i mean you have to

2140
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,880
actually try it out

2141
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,480
and that's currently very expensive

2142
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,880
right i mean deep learning networks may

2143
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:41,198
they

2144
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,800
take days to train well imagine having a

2145
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:45,519
population of 100 and have to

2146
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,520
run it for 100 generations it's not yet

2147
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,480
quite feasible computationally

2148
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:52,080
um it will be but but also there's a

2149
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,439
large carbon footprint and all that i

2150
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:54,238
mean we're using a lot of computation

2151
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:57,439
for doing it

2152
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:59,198
so intelligent methods and intelligence

2153
01:10:57,439 --> 01:11:00,799
i mean

2154
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:02,079
we have to do some science in order to

2155
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,520
figure out what the right

2156
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:06,000
representations are

2157
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,199
and right operators are and how do we

2158
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,920
evaluate them

2159
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:11,279
without having to fully train them and

2160
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,640
that is where the current research is

2161
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:13,599
and we're making progress on all those

2162
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,280
fronts

2163
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,800
um so so yes there are certain

2164
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:19,439
architectures that are more amenable to

2165
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,760
that

2166
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:22,960
uh approach but also i think we can

2167
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,960
create our own

2168
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,319
architecture and whole representations

2169
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,480
that are even better

2170
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:31,198
do you think it's possible to do like uh

2171
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:32,639
like a tiny baby network that grows into

2172
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:34,238
something that can do state of the art

2173
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,280
and like even the simple data set like

2174
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:38,479
mnist

2175
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:40,158
and just like it uh just grows into a

2176
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:42,000
you know gigantic monster that's the

2177
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:42,479
world's greatest handwriting recognition

2178
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,238
system

2179
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:46,000
yeah there are approaches like that

2180
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,119
esteban rail and cochlear for instance

2181
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,719
have worked on

2182
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:50,880
evolving a smaller network and then

2183
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,600
systematically expanding it to a larger

2184
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,159
one

2185
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,679
uh your elements are already there and

2186
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:56,479
scaling it up will just give you more

2187
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,158
power

2188
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:59,839
so again evolution gives you that

2189
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:00,960
starting point yes and then there's a

2190
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,199
mechanism

2191
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,800
that gives you the final result and a

2192
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:08,799
very powerful approach

2193
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:12,560
um but you know you could you could also

2194
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:14,640
um simulate the actual growth process

2195
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,239
and like i said before evolving a

2196
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,800
starting point and then evolving it

2197
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:20,399
uh or training the network there's not

2198
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,800
that much work that's been done

2199
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:23,599
on that yet uh we need some kind of a

2200
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,960
simulated

2201
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,039
simulation environment so there are

2202
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,719
interactions uh at will

2203
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:30,640
uh the supervised environment doesn't

2204
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:34,158
really it's not as easily

2205
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:36,079
uh usable here sorry the interaction

2206
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:37,279
between neural networks yeah the neural

2207
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:39,760
networks that you are creating

2208
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:41,439
interacting the world uh and learning

2209
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,280
from these uh

2210
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:45,519
sequences of interactions perhaps

2211
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:46,800
communication with others

2212
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,640
[Laughter]

2213
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,199
that's awesome we would like to get

2214
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,840
there but just the task of simulating

2215
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:53,439
something is

2216
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,279
at that level is very hard it's very

2217
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:57,678
difficult i love the idea

2218
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:59,840
i mean one of the powerful things about

2219
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,199
evolution on earth is the predators and

2220
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,679
prey emerged

2221
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:05,839
and like there's just like there's

2222
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,440
bigger fish and smaller fish and

2223
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,039
it's fascinating to think that you could

2224
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:10,639
have neural networks competing against

2225
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:12,158
each other one yellow network being able

2226
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:14,239
to destroy another one

2227
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:15,519
there's like wars of neural networks

2228
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:17,839
competing to solve

2229
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,199
the mnist problem i don't know yeah yeah

2230
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,119
oh totally yeah yeah yeah

2231
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:22,639
and and we actually simulated also that

2232
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:24,238
uh prayer the prey

2233
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,400
and it was interesting what happened

2234
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:26,879
there but budget but minnie roger poland

2235
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:29,759
did this

2236
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,319
and um kay holcomb was a zoologist so we

2237
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,600
had

2238
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:37,359
again um

2239
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:40,400
we had simulated hyenas simulated zebras

2240
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:42,880
nice uh and initially you know

2241
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:43,759
the hyenas just tried to hunt them and

2242
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,239
when they actually

2243
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,119
stumbled upon the zebra they ate it and

2244
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:50,399
we're happy

2245
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:53,599
um and and then the zebras learned to

2246
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:54,238
escape uh and the hyenas learned to team

2247
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,760
up

2248
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:57,919
and actually two of them approached in

2249
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,960
different directions and now the zebras

2250
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:02,239
their next step

2251
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,719
they generated a behavior where they

2252
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:04,559
split

2253
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:06,239
in different directions just like

2254
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,480
actually gazelles do

2255
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:10,000
in in when they are being hunted they

2256
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:10,959
confuse the predator by going in

2257
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,238
different directions

2258
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:17,279
that emerged and then more hyenas joined

2259
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:18,879
and and kind of circled them uh and

2260
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:20,960
and then when they circled them they

2261
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,679
could actually hurt the zebras together

2262
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,719
and and eat

2263
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:24,960
multiple uh zebras so there was a like

2264
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:28,319
an

2265
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:30,319
arms race of predators and prey

2266
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:32,158
and they gradually develop more complex

2267
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:33,439
behaviors some of which we actually do

2268
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:36,639
see in nature

2269
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:38,238
uh and and this kind of co-evolution uh

2270
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,400
that's competitive evolution it's a

2271
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:43,359
fascinating topic because there's a

2272
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:44,719
a promise or possibility that you will

2273
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:46,479
discover something

2274
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,000
uh new that you don't already know you

2275
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:51,119
didn't build it in

2276
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,960
it came from this arms race it's hard to

2277
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,519
keep the arms race going it's hard to

2278
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,920
have

2279
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:58,159
reits enough simulation that that

2280
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,239
supports all of these complex behaviors

2281
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:01,839
but at least for several steps we've

2282
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:03,519
already seen it in the spread of the

2283
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,800
prey scenario yeah

2284
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,840
first of all it's fascinating to think

2285
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,880
about this context in terms of uh

2286
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,640
evolving architectures so i've studied

2287
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:16,480
tesla autopilot for a long time

2288
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:18,239
it's one particular implementation

2289
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:20,079
of an ai system that's operating in the

2290
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:22,000
real world i find it fascinating because

2291
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:23,279
of the scale at which it's used out in

2292
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,198
the real world

2293
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:26,479
and uh i'm not sure if you're familiar

2294
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:28,479
with that system much but

2295
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:30,079
you know andre kapathi leads that team

2296
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:33,119
on the machine learning side

2297
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:35,519
and there's a multitask

2298
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:36,800
network multi-headed network where

2299
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,880
there's a core

2300
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,320
but it's trained on particular tasks and

2301
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,679
there's a bunch of different heads that

2302
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:44,880
are trained on that

2303
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:46,719
is there some lessons from

2304
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,640
evolutionary computation or neural

2305
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,840
evolution that could be applied to this

2306
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,600
kind of

2307
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,279
multi-headed beast that's operating in

2308
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,800
the real world yes

2309
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:56,479
it's a very good problem for new

2310
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,000
revolution

2311
01:15:56,479 --> 01:16:00,559
and the reason is that when you have

2312
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,679
multiple tasks

2313
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,239
they support each other so let's say

2314
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,000
you're

2315
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:10,079
learning to classify x-ray images uh

2316
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,039
different pathologies so you have one

2317
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:14,479
task is to classify

2318
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:16,238
this disease and another one this

2319
01:16:14,479 --> 01:16:17,119
disease another on this one and when

2320
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:20,319
you're learning

2321
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:21,679
from one disease that forces certain

2322
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:23,279
kinds of internal representations and

2323
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,760
embeddings

2324
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:27,519
and they can serve as a helpful starting

2325
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,920
point for the other tasks

2326
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:31,280
so you are combining the wisdom of

2327
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,319
multiple tasks into these

2328
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:34,238
representations

2329
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:35,759
and it turns out that you can do better

2330
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:37,119
in each of these tasks

2331
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,360
when you're learning simultaneously

2332
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:41,039
other tasks than you would by one task

2333
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:41,679
alone which is a fascinating idea in

2334
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:43,679
itself yeah

2335
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,359
yes and and people do that all the time

2336
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,920
i mean you use knowledge of domains that

2337
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,238
you know

2338
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,520
in new domains uh and and certainly

2339
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:52,158
neural networks can do that

2340
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,000
when your evolution comes in is that um

2341
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:56,559
what's the best way to combine

2342
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,960
these tasks now there's architectural

2343
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,679
design that allow you to decide where

2344
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:03,279
and how the the embeddings the internal

2345
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:06,239
representations are combined

2346
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:06,559
and how much you combine uh them uh and

2347
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:07,919
uh

2348
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,159
there's quite a bit of research on that

2349
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,800
and and my team eliot madison has worked

2350
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:13,119
on that

2351
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,719
um in particular like what is a good

2352
01:17:13,119 --> 01:17:17,439
internal representation

2353
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,840
that supports multiple tasks uh and

2354
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,759
we're

2355
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,760
getting to understand how that's

2356
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,239
constructed and what's in it

2357
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,440
uh so that it is in a space that

2358
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:28,639
supports multiple

2359
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:31,839
different heads like you said um and

2360
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:34,079
and that i think is fundamentally how

2361
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:37,119
biological intelligence works as well

2362
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:39,039
uh you don't build a representation just

2363
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:40,000
for one task you try to build something

2364
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:41,679
that's general

2365
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,238
not only so that you can do better in

2366
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:46,239
one task or multiple tasks but also

2367
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:48,559
future tasks and future challenges

2368
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:49,519
so you learn to learn the structure of

2369
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,480
of the world

2370
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,239
um and and that helps you uh in all

2371
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:56,000
kinds of future future challenges and so

2372
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:56,959
you're trying to design a representation

2373
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,560
that will support

2374
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,960
an arbitrary set of tasks in a

2375
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:03,120
particular sort of class of problem

2376
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,279
yeah and and also it turns out and

2377
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:05,920
that's again a surprise that elliot

2378
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:08,800
found

2379
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,319
was that those tasks don't have to be

2380
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,920
very related

2381
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:14,079
you know you can learn to do better

2382
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:16,399
vision by learning language

2383
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:17,840
or better language by learning about dna

2384
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:21,119
structure

2385
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:24,800
no somehow the world

2386
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:26,640
yeah it rhymes the world rhymes even

2387
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:29,760
it's very uh

2388
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:31,360
very desperate fields um i mean

2389
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,880
on that small topic let me ask you

2390
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:35,759
because you've also on the competition

2391
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,760
your science side

2392
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:43,439
you worked on both language and vision

2393
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:44,479
what's what's the connection between the

2394
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:46,000
two uh

2395
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:47,359
what's more maybe there's a bunch of

2396
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
ways to ask this but what's more

2397
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:50,479
difficult

2398
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,238
to build from an engineering perspective

2399
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:55,279
an evolutionary perspective

2400
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:56,479
the human language system or the human

2401
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:59,198
vision system or

2402
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:00,559
the equivalent of in the ai space

2403
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:03,279
language and vision

2404
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:04,080
or is it the the best is the multi-task

2405
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:06,000
idea that you're

2406
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:07,359
speaking to that they they need to be

2407
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,880
deeply integrated

2408
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:11,519
yeah absolutely learning both at the

2409
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,239
same time

2410
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:16,080
i i think is a fascinating direction in

2411
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:17,759
that in the future so you have data sets

2412
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:18,399
where there's visual component as well

2413
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,320
as

2414
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:21,519
verbal descriptions for instance and and

2415
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:23,359
that way you can learn

2416
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,960
a deeper representation a more useful

2417
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,158
representation for both

2418
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,319
uh but it's still an interesting

2419
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:29,920
question of um

2420
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:31,439
which one is easier eventually i mean

2421
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,920
recognizing objects or

2422
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:35,759
even understanding sentences that's

2423
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,039
relatively possible

2424
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,960
but where it becomes where the

2425
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:39,760
challenges are is to understand the

2426
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,719
world

2427
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,320
like the visual world the 3d uh what are

2428
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:45,198
the objects doing and predicting what

2429
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:47,279
will happen

2430
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:49,198
uh the relationships that's what makes

2431
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,960
vision difficult and language obviously

2432
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:52,639
it's it's what's the mean what what is

2433
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,840
being said what the meaning is

2434
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,800
and the meaning doesn't stop at who did

2435
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,679
what to whom

2436
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,000
um there are goals and plans and themes

2437
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:01,760
and

2438
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,560
you eventually have to understand the

2439
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:06,560
entire uh human society and history

2440
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,000
in order to understand the sentence very

2441
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,679
much fully that

2442
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,279
there are plenty of examples of those

2443
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,800
kind of short sentences when you bring

2444
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:14,880
in all the world knowledge

2445
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,840
uh to understand it uh and that's the

2446
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,400
big challenge

2447
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,239
now we are far from that but even just

2448
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:22,559
bringing in the visual world

2449
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:23,599
uh together with the sentence will give

2450
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,840
you

2451
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,719
already a lot deeper understanding of

2452
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,239
what's happening

2453
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:30,079
and i think that that's where we're

2454
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:32,879
going very soon i mean

2455
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:34,000
we've we've had imagenet for a long time

2456
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,400
and now we have

2457
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,679
all these uh text collections but having

2458
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:40,960
both together

2459
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:42,639
uh and then learning a semantic

2460
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,480
understanding of what is happening

2461
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:45,520
i think that that will be the next step

2462
01:20:44,479 --> 01:20:46,479
in the next few years yeah you're

2463
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,960
starting to see that with

2464
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:49,919
all the work with transformers was the

2465
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,520
the community

2466
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,560
the ai community started to dip their

2467
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:58,639
toe into this idea idea of

2468
01:20:54,560 --> 01:21:01,360
having uh language models that are now

2469
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:02,719
doing stuff with images with vision and

2470
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:04,479
then

2471
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,920
connecting the two i mean right now it's

2472
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:07,678
like these little explorations we're

2473
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,000
literally dipping the toe in

2474
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:11,600
but like maybe at some point we'll just

2475
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,198
like dive into the pool

2476
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,520
and it'll just be all seen as the same

2477
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:16,719
thing i i do still wonder what's more

2478
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:20,800
fundamental

2479
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:23,439
well their vision is um whether we

2480
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,960
don't think about vision correctly maybe

2481
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:27,519
the fact because we're humans and we see

2482
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:30,000
things as beautiful and so on

2483
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:32,320
that and because we have cameras that

2484
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,679
taking pixels is a 2d

2485
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:36,158
image that we don't sufficiently think

2486
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:39,359
about

2487
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:41,839
vision as language you know maybe

2488
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:43,519
maybe chomsky is right all along that

2489
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,600
vision is fundamental to

2490
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,639
uh sorry that language is fundamental to

2491
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,719
everything

2492
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:50,560
to even cognition to even consciousness

2493
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,960
like the base layer is all

2494
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,840
language not necessarily like english

2495
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:57,279
but some

2496
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:59,279
weird abstract representation uh the

2497
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:01,599
linguistic representation

2498
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:03,439
yeah well earlier we talked about the

2499
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,480
social structures and that may be what's

2500
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:05,839
underlying

2501
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:07,519
the language and that's the more

2502
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,039
fundamental part and then language has

2503
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,000
been added on top of that language

2504
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:11,840
emerges from the social

2505
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,920
interaction probably yeah that's a very

2506
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,760
good guess um

2507
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,760
via visual animals though a lot of the

2508
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,560
brain is dedicated to vision and

2509
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,199
and also when we think about various

2510
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,320
abstract

2511
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:25,039
concepts uh we usually reduce that to

2512
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:28,559
vision

2513
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:30,399
uh and and images and that's

2514
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:33,039
you know go to a whiteboard you draw

2515
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:35,279
pictures of very abstract concepts

2516
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:36,880
so we tend to tend to resort to that

2517
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:38,719
quite a bit and that's a fundamental

2518
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,960
representation it's probably

2519
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,000
possible that it predated um you know

2520
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,000
language even i mean

2521
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,158
animals a lot of they don't talk but

2522
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:49,600
they certainly do have vision

2523
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:52,799
uh and and language is interesting

2524
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,679
development in um from for mastication

2525
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,920
from eating

2526
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:58,719
you develop an organ that actually can

2527
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,079
produce sound to manipulate them

2528
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:02,158
maybe that was an accident maybe that

2529
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:05,039
was something that was available and

2530
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:06,319
and then allowed us to to do that

2531
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:08,479
communication or maybe it was

2532
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:10,479
gestures sign language could have been

2533
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:12,479
the original proto-language

2534
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:14,079
we don't quite know but they're the

2535
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:14,879
language is more fundamental than the

2536
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:17,600
medium

2537
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,840
in which it's uh communicated and i

2538
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,520
think that it comes from those

2539
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:24,560
representations

2540
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:26,560
now in in current

2541
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:27,760
world they are so strongly integrated

2542
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,639
it's really hard to say which one is

2543
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,719
fundamental

2544
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:32,639
you look at the brain structures and

2545
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,399
even visual cortex

2546
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:36,639
which supposed to be very much just

2547
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:38,079
vision well if you are

2548
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:40,159
thinking of semantic concepts you're

2549
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:41,439
thinking of language visual cortex

2550
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:43,359
lights up

2551
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:44,479
it's still useful even for language

2552
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:46,238
computations

2553
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:48,718
so there are common structures

2554
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:50,638
underlying them so utilize what you need

2555
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,000
yeah and and when you are understanding

2556
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,039
a scene you're understanding

2557
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,800
relationships

2558
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:56,719
well it's not so far from understanding

2559
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,159
relationships between words and concepts

2560
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:01,198
so i think that that's how they are

2561
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:02,799
integrated yeah and there's dreams and

2562
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:04,479
wants to close our eyes there's still a

2563
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,039
world in there somehow operating and

2564
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:07,599
somehow

2565
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:09,840
possibly the visual visual system

2566
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,880
somehow integrated into all of it

2567
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:16,159
i tend to enjoy thinking about aliens

2568
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:18,239
and thinking about uh

2569
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:21,039
the sad thing to me about

2570
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:24,319
extraterrestrial intelligent life

2571
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:24,719
that if it was if it visit us here on

2572
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:27,679
earth

2573
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:29,359
or if we came on mars and or maybe

2574
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,960
another other solar system another

2575
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:33,359
galaxy one day

2576
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,719
that uh us humans would not be able to

2577
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:36,960
detect it

2578
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:38,719
or communicate with it or appreciate

2579
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:42,158
like it'd be right in front of our nose

2580
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:45,439
and we're too self-obsessed

2581
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:48,559
to see it not self-obsessed but

2582
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:51,519
our our our our tools

2583
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,400
our frameworks of thinking would not

2584
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,199
detect it

2585
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:57,039
as a good movie arrival and so on where

2586
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:59,279
stephen wolfram and his son i think were

2587
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:00,800
part of developing this alien language

2588
01:24:59,279 --> 01:25:02,399
of how aliens would communicate with

2589
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,960
humans do you ever think about that kind

2590
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:06,799
of stuff

2591
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:08,719
where if humans and aliens would be able

2592
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:11,360
to communicate with each other

2593
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,079
like if we uh met each other at some

2594
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:14,399
okay we could do

2595
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:15,920
seti which is communicating from across

2596
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:19,279
a very big distance

2597
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,279
but also just us you know

2598
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:23,839
if you did a podcast with an alien do

2599
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:24,559
you think we'd be able to find a common

2600
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,279
language

2601
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:28,400
uh and a common methodology of

2602
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:30,800
communication

2603
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:32,000
i think from a computational perspective

2604
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,679
the way to ask that is

2605
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,520
is you have very fundamentally different

2606
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:38,480
creatures agents that are created would

2607
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:41,120
they be able to find a common language

2608
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:42,399
yes that's i do think about that i mean

2609
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:43,840
i think a lot of people who are in

2610
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:46,158
computing they

2611
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,600
uh and ai in particular they got into it

2612
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:50,238
because they were fascinated with

2613
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,600
science fiction and and all of these

2614
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:54,000
options i mean

2615
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,920
star trek generated all kinds of devices

2616
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,600
that we have now they they envisioned

2617
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,119
it's true first and and it's a great

2618
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:03,600
motivator um

2619
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:06,800
to think about things like that um and i

2620
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,079
so one and again being a computational

2621
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:11,279
scientist and and

2622
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:13,600
trying to build intelligent agents

2623
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:14,479
what i would like to do is have a

2624
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,679
simulation

2625
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:19,198
where the agents actually evolve

2626
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:19,840
communication not just communication

2627
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:21,439
we've done that

2628
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,960
people have done that many times they

2629
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:25,119
communicate they signal

2630
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:27,279
and so on but actually develop a

2631
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:27,920
language and language means grammar it

2632
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:29,679
means all these

2633
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,840
social structures and on top of that

2634
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:35,840
grammatical structures

2635
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:37,199
and we do it in under various conditions

2636
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,360
and actually try to identify what

2637
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:42,479
conditions are necessary for it to

2638
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:44,158
come out and then we can start asking

2639
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:46,638
that kind of questions

2640
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:48,799
are those languages that emerge in that

2641
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:51,279
those different simulated environments

2642
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:53,360
are they understandable to us can we

2643
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:56,399
somehow make a translation

2644
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:58,880
we can make it a concrete question so

2645
01:26:56,399 --> 01:26:59,759
machine translation of evolved languages

2646
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,079
and so like

2647
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,280
languages that evolve come up with can

2648
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:05,359
we translate

2649
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:07,119
like i have a google translate for the

2650
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:10,399
evolved languages

2651
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:13,599
yes and if we do that enough we have

2652
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:15,439
perhaps an idea what an alien

2653
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,039
language might be like the space or

2654
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:18,719
where those languages can be

2655
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:20,560
because we can set up their environment

2656
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:21,279
differently there doesn't need to be

2657
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,120
gravity

2658
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:25,279
you know you can you can have all kinds

2659
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:27,439
of societies can be different they may

2660
01:27:25,279 --> 01:27:28,479
have no predators they may have all

2661
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:31,198
everybody is a predator

2662
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:31,759
all kinds of situations and and then see

2663
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:33,678
what the

2664
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,760
space possibly is where those languages

2665
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,440
are and what the difficulties are

2666
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,440
they'll be really good actually to do

2667
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:42,238
that before the aliens come here

2668
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:43,119
yes it's good practice yeah uh on the

2669
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:46,238
similar

2670
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:46,960
connection you know you can think of ai

2671
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:50,319
systems as

2672
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:51,520
aliens is there uh ways to evolve a

2673
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:53,359
communication scheme

2674
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:55,040
for there's a field you can call like

2675
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:58,880
explainable ai

2676
01:27:55,039 --> 01:28:00,560
for ai systems to be able to communicate

2677
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,920
so you have a but you evolve a bunch of

2678
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,520
agents but

2679
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,359
for some of them to be able to talk to

2680
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,520
you yeah also

2681
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:08,479
so to evolve a way for agents to be able

2682
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:11,280
to communicate

2683
01:28:08,479 --> 01:28:12,319
about their world to us humans do you

2684
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:14,880
think that there's

2685
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:16,238
possible mechanisms for doing that we

2686
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,840
can certainly try

2687
01:28:16,238 --> 01:28:21,039
and if we um if it's an evidence

2688
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,760
competition system for instance you

2689
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:23,198
reward

2690
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,199
those solutions that are actually

2691
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:26,719
functional that that communication makes

2692
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:29,439
sense it allows us to

2693
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:30,800
together again achieve common goals i

2694
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:34,638
think it's possible

2695
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:37,039
but even from that um paper that you

2696
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:38,400
mentioned the the anecdotes it's quite

2697
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:42,800
likely also that the

2698
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:44,638
uh the agents learn to you know lie

2699
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,480
and fake and do all kinds of things like

2700
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:48,319
that yes i mean we see that in in

2701
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:51,119
even very low level like bacterial

2702
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:53,840
evolution there are there are cheaters

2703
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,439
um and who's to say that what they say

2704
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,600
is actually what they think

2705
01:28:55,439 --> 01:29:00,079
it um but but that's what i'm saying

2706
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,800
that there would have to be some common

2707
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:02,158
goal

2708
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,239
so that we can evaluate whether that

2709
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:06,960
communication is at least useful

2710
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:08,959
um you know they may be saying things

2711
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,880
just to make us feel good

2712
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,319
or or get us to do what we want whatever

2713
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:14,639
not turn them off or something

2714
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:16,158
but but uh so we would have to

2715
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:17,440
understand their internal representation

2716
01:29:16,158 --> 01:29:18,559
is much better to really make sure that

2717
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:21,519
that translation is

2718
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:23,920
political um but it can be useful and i

2719
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:27,040
think that it's possible to do that

2720
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:30,480
there are examples where visualizations

2721
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:32,079
um are automatically created so that we

2722
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:35,039
can look into the what

2723
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:36,719
the system uh and the language is not

2724
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:38,560
that far from it i mean it is a way of

2725
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:40,158
communicating and logging

2726
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,000
what you're doing in some inter

2727
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:44,719
interpretable way

2728
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,399
um i think a fascinating topic yeah to

2729
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:49,119
do that

2730
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:51,039
yeah you're making me realize that it's

2731
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:54,319
a good scientific question

2732
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:55,519
whether lying is an effective mechanism

2733
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:57,519
for integrating yourself

2734
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,560
and succeeding in a social network in a

2735
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,880
social

2736
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,920
in a world that is social i tend to

2737
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:05,520
believe

2738
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,319
that honesty and love are evolutionary

2739
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,840
advantages

2740
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:11,599
in us in a in an environment

2741
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,920
where there's a network of intelligent

2742
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,880
agents but it's also very possible that

2743
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:18,239
dishonesty

2744
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:20,800
and manipulation and

2745
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:22,959
uh even you know violence all those

2746
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:24,880
kinds of things might be more beneficial

2747
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:27,039
that's the old open question about uh

2748
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,560
good versus evil but i tend to

2749
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:30,560
there's some i mean i don't know if it's

2750
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:35,039
a hopeful maybe i'm delusional

2751
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:38,080
but it feels like karma is a thing

2752
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:40,399
which is like if

2753
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:42,399
long term the agents that are just kind

2754
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:45,599
to others sometimes for no reason

2755
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:48,399
will do better in a society that's not

2756
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,400
highly constrained on resources it's

2757
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:51,839
like people start getting weird and evil

2758
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:54,559
towards each other and bad

2759
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,600
when the resources are very low relative

2760
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,920
to the needs of the

2761
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,880
the populace especially at the basic

2762
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:02,158
level like

2763
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:05,039
survival shelter uh food all those kinds

2764
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:07,439
of things but um

2765
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:10,238
i i tend to believe that uh once you

2766
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:12,559
have those things established then

2767
01:31:10,238 --> 01:31:14,799
well not to believe i i guess i hope

2768
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:17,920
that ai systems would be honest

2769
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:20,639
but it's fun it's scary to think about

2770
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:21,679
the touring test you know ai systems

2771
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:24,239
that will

2772
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:25,679
eventually pass the touring test will be

2773
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:26,638
ones that are exceptionally good at

2774
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:30,000
lying

2775
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:32,560
that's a terrifying concept yeah i mean

2776
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,319
i i don't know first of all so from uh

2777
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,159
from somebody who studied language and

2778
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:38,000
obviously

2779
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:40,079
are not just the world expert in ai but

2780
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,880
somebody who dreams about

2781
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:43,439
the future of the field do you hope do

2782
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,319
you think

2783
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:48,638
there will be human level or superhuman

2784
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:52,158
level intelligences in the future

2785
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:54,560
that we eventually build

2786
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:56,079
well definitely hope that we can we can

2787
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:59,280
get there

2788
01:31:56,079 --> 01:32:01,920
one i think um important perspective is

2789
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:04,960
that we are building ai to help us

2790
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:08,158
uh that it is a it is tool like cars or

2791
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:11,760
or or language or

2792
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:13,119
communication uh ai will help us be more

2793
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:17,440
productive

2794
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:19,840
uh and that is always a condition

2795
01:32:17,439 --> 01:32:21,198
it's not something that we build and let

2796
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,480
run and it

2797
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:25,039
becomes an entity of its own that

2798
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:27,279
doesn't care about us

2799
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:29,039
now of course really far in the future

2800
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:30,319
maybe that might be possible but not in

2801
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:31,519
the foreseeable future when we are

2802
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:33,679
building it

2803
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,280
uh and therefore we are always in a

2804
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:38,840
position of

2805
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:42,000
limiting what it can or cannot do uh

2806
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:43,840
and the um

2807
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,119
your point about lying is very

2808
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:48,239
interesting

2809
01:32:45,119 --> 01:32:49,198
um even even in these highness societies

2810
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:52,158
for instance

2811
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:53,039
uh when a number of these hyenas band

2812
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:55,198
together and they

2813
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:56,079
they still they take a risk and steal

2814
01:32:55,198 --> 01:32:58,719
the kill

2815
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:00,319
they're always hyenas that hang back and

2816
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:03,359
don't participate in that

2817
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:03,599
uh risky behavior but they walk in later

2818
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:06,000
and

2819
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,800
and join the party after the after the

2820
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,119
kill

2821
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,239
and there are even some that may be

2822
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:13,359
ineffective and

2823
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:15,678
cause others to have harm so and

2824
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:17,198
like i said even bacteria cheat and we

2825
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:19,760
see it in biology

2826
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:21,279
there's always some element an

2827
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,880
opportunity if you have a

2828
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:25,359
i think that is this because if you have

2829
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,719
a society in order for society to be

2830
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:28,238
effective you have to have this

2831
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:31,198
cooperation and you have to have

2832
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:31,919
trust uh and and if you have enough of

2833
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:34,238
agents

2834
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:36,399
who are able to trust each other you can

2835
01:33:34,238 --> 01:33:38,079
achieve a lot more

2836
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:40,479
but if you have trust you also have

2837
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:41,840
opportunity for cheaters and liars

2838
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:43,519
and i don't think that's ever going to

2839
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,279
go away

2840
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,800
there will be hopefully a minority so

2841
01:33:45,279 --> 01:33:48,559
that they don't get in the way and we

2842
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,400
studied in these high-end simulations

2843
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,480
like what the proportion needs to be

2844
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:53,920
before it is no longer functional

2845
01:33:52,479 --> 01:33:56,319
and you can point out that you can

2846
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:59,520
tolerate a few cheaters and a few

2847
01:33:56,319 --> 01:34:02,238
liars and the society can still function

2848
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:04,080
and that's probably going to happen um

2849
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:05,599
when we build these systems that

2850
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:08,719
autonomously learn

2851
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:10,639
um the really successful ones are

2852
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:12,319
honest because that's the best way of

2853
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:14,400
getting things done

2854
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:15,359
um but there probably are also

2855
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:17,279
intelligent

2856
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:18,719
agents that find that they can achieve

2857
01:34:17,279 --> 01:34:20,880
their goals by

2858
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:22,560
by bending the rules of cheating so

2859
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:25,520
there could be a huge benefit to

2860
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:26,320
uh as opposed to having fixed ai systems

2861
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:29,280
say we build an

2862
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:29,840
agi system and deploying millions of

2863
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:32,960
them

2864
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:36,319
it'd be that are exactly the same

2865
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:38,000
uh there might be a huge benefit to um

2866
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:39,840
introducing sort of from like an

2867
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,639
evolution computation perspective a lot

2868
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:44,800
of variation

2869
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:46,480
yeah sort of uh like diversity in all

2870
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,719
its forms is beneficial

2871
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:49,839
even if some people are or some

2872
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:51,679
robots are

2873
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,880
so like it's it's beneficial to have

2874
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:55,279
that because

2875
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,079
i uh because you can't always at

2876
01:34:55,279 --> 01:34:59,279
pre-order i

2877
01:34:56,079 --> 01:35:01,279
know what's good what's bad but

2878
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:03,198
uh there's that that's a fascinating

2879
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:04,719
absolutely diversity

2880
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:07,039
is the bread and butter i mean if you're

2881
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:09,039
running away you see diversity is the

2882
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:11,359
one fundamental thing you have to have

2883
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:12,319
and absolutely it also it's not always

2884
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:13,920
good diversity

2885
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:15,840
right it may be something that can be

2886
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:17,679
destructive we had in these heinous

2887
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:20,000
simulations we have hyenas that just

2888
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,279
are suicidal they just run and get

2889
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,359
killed but they

2890
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:24,319
form the basis of those who actually are

2891
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:26,158
really fast

2892
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:28,319
but stop before they get killed and

2893
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:29,920
eventually turn into this mob uh

2894
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:31,759
so there might be something useful there

2895
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,079
if it's recombined with something else

2896
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,840
right

2897
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:35,840
so i think that as long as we can

2898
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,800
tolerate some of that it may turn into

2899
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,039
something better

2900
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,719
you may change the rules because it's so

2901
01:35:39,039 --> 01:35:42,319
much more efficient to do something that

2902
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,800
was actually against the rules before

2903
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:46,158
yes

2904
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:47,840
uh and we've seen society change uh over

2905
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:48,960
time quite a bit along those lines that

2906
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,719
there were

2907
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,158
rules in society that we don't believe

2908
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:54,239
are fair anymore

2909
01:35:52,158 --> 01:35:55,198
even though they were you know

2910
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:58,238
considered

2911
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:58,960
proper behavior before yes um so things

2912
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:01,118
are changing and

2913
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,880
i think that in that sense i think it's

2914
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:03,920
um it's a good idea to be able to

2915
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,760
tolerate some of that

2916
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,118
some of that cheating because eventually

2917
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,119
we might turn into something

2918
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:10,880
better so yeah i think this is a message

2919
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:12,238
to the trolls and the of the

2920
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,560
internet that you two

2921
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:16,158
have a beautiful purpose in this uh

2922
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,440
human ecosystem so we

2923
01:36:16,158 --> 01:36:20,000
i appreciate you guys watering

2924
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:21,359
quantities yeah moderate quantities

2925
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,039
uh so there's a whole field of

2926
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:24,479
artificial life

2927
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:26,238
i don't know if you're connected to this

2928
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:29,039
field if you uh pay attention

2929
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:29,519
is do you think about this kind of thing

2930
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:31,760
uh

2931
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,000
is there a impressive demonstration to

2932
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:35,600
you of artificial life do you think of

2933
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,520
the agents that you work with in the

2934
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:41,119
evolutionary competition

2935
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:43,520
at perspective as life

2936
01:36:41,118 --> 01:36:45,118
and where do you think this is headed

2937
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,040
like is there interesting systems that

2938
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:50,719
we'll be creating more and more

2939
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:54,000
that uh make us redefine maybe rethink

2940
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:54,960
about the nature of life different

2941
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,359
levels of

2942
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:59,679
definition and goals there then i mean

2943
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:02,238
at some level artificial life

2944
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:04,158
can be considered multi-agent systems

2945
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:04,879
that build a society that again achieves

2946
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:06,559
a goal

2947
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,319
and it might be robots that go into a

2948
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,560
building and clean it up or or

2949
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:12,000
after an earthquake or something you can

2950
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,960
think of that as an artificial life

2951
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,600
problem

2952
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,000
in some sense um or you can really think

2953
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,039
of it

2954
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,399
artificial life as a simulation of life

2955
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:23,679
and a tool to understand what life is

2956
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:25,279
and how life evolved

2957
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:26,719
in on earth and like i said in

2958
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:28,960
artificial life conference

2959
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:30,719
there are branches of that conference

2960
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,520
sessions of people who really worry

2961
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:34,560
about

2962
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,440
molecular designs and and the start of

2963
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,280
life like the

2964
01:37:35,439 --> 01:37:38,399
like i said primordial soup where

2965
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:39,599
eventually you get something

2966
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:41,439
self-replicating

2967
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,119
and they're really trying to build that

2968
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:46,399
um so it's a whole range of

2969
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:49,198
of uh of topics um

2970
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:50,399
and i think that artificial life is a

2971
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:53,359
great tool

2972
01:37:50,399 --> 01:37:55,519
uh to understand life and there are

2973
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:58,880
questions like sustainability

2974
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:02,080
um species we're losing species

2975
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:05,199
uh how bad is it is it natural

2976
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:07,118
uh is there a tipping point um

2977
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:09,118
and where are we going i mean like the

2978
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:11,279
hyena evolution we may have

2979
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:12,960
understood that there's a pivotal point

2980
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:15,920
in their evolution they discovered

2981
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:17,600
cooperation and coordination

2982
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:19,600
you know artificialized simulations can

2983
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:22,800
identify that and

2984
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:26,880
maybe encourage things like that um so

2985
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:28,639
and and also societies can be seen as a

2986
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:30,000
form of life itself i mean we're not

2987
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:32,159
talking about biological evolution we

2988
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,439
have all evolution of societies maybe

2989
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:36,638
some of the same

2990
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:38,799
phenomena emerging in that uh domain and

2991
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:40,480
unders and having artificial life

2992
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,800
simulations and understanding could help

2993
01:38:40,479 --> 01:38:43,759
us

2994
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,560
build better societies yeah and thinking

2995
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:48,239
from a

2996
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:51,280
meme perspective of of uh from

2997
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:53,359
richard dawkins that

2998
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:55,279
maybe the organisms ideas of the

2999
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:58,399
organisms not the humans

3000
01:38:55,279 --> 01:39:00,399
in these societies that from

3001
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:01,839
it's almost like reframing what is

3002
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:03,599
exactly evolving

3003
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,600
maybe the interesting the humans aren't

3004
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:07,360
the interesting thing is the contents of

3005
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,119
our minds is the interesting thing and

3006
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:10,399
that's what's multiplying

3007
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:12,960
and that's actually multiplying and

3008
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:15,359
evolving in a much faster time scale

3009
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,920
and that maybe has more power on the

3010
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:19,759
trajectory of life on earth than

3011
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:21,440
this biological evolution yes the

3012
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,760
evolution of these ideas yes

3013
01:39:21,439 --> 01:39:24,638
and it's fascinating like i said before

3014
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,360
that

3015
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:27,679
we can keep up somehow biologically yeah

3016
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:29,519
we

3017
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:30,719
have we belong to a point where we can

3018
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,679
keep up with this

3019
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:34,319
meme evolution literature you know

3020
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:37,440
internet

3021
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:38,799
um we understand dna and we understand

3022
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:40,638
fundamental particles

3023
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,159
we didn't start that way i mean thousand

3024
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:43,600
years ago and we haven't evolved

3025
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:46,399
biologically very much but

3026
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,880
somehow our minds are able to uh extend

3027
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:49,439
um

3028
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,400
and and therefore ai can be seen also as

3029
01:39:49,439 --> 01:39:53,039
one such

3030
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:54,879
step that we created and it's our tool

3031
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:56,319
uh and it's part of that meme evolution

3032
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:58,079
that that we create

3033
01:39:56,319 --> 01:39:59,599
even if our biological evolution does

3034
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:02,479
not progress as fast

3035
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:04,639
and us humans might only be able to

3036
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:07,039
understand so much we're keeping up

3037
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:08,719
so far or we think we're keeping up so

3038
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:09,439
far but we might need ai systems to

3039
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:12,480
understand

3040
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:13,678
maybe like the physics of the universe

3041
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:15,039
is operating

3042
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:16,800
like a string theory maybe it's

3043
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:19,198
operating in much higher

3044
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:20,400
dimensions maybe we're totally because

3045
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:22,960
of our cognitive

3046
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:24,238
limitations are not able to truly

3047
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,480
internalize

3048
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:28,238
the way this world works and so our

3049
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:29,359
limit we're running up against the

3050
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:30,879
limitation of

3051
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:33,519
our own minds and we have to create

3052
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:34,400
these next level organisms like ai

3053
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,920
systems

3054
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:37,759
that would be able to understand much

3055
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:39,279
deeper like really understand what it

3056
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:41,360
means to live in a

3057
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:42,960
uh multi-dimensional world that's

3058
01:40:41,359 --> 01:40:44,479
outside of the four dimensions the three

3059
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:46,560
of space and

3060
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:48,079
one of them yeah translation and and

3061
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,199
generally we can deal with the world

3062
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:50,800
even if you don't understand all the

3063
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:52,479
details we can use computers

3064
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,920
yes even though we don't most of us

3065
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:55,759
don't know all the

3066
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:57,039
structures underneath or drive a car i

3067
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,719
mean there are many components

3068
01:40:57,039 --> 01:41:01,039
especially new cars that you don't quite

3069
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:02,560
fully know but you have the interface

3070
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:03,920
you have an abstraction of it

3071
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,560
that allows you to operate it and

3072
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:08,480
utilize it and i think that that's

3073
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:10,880
that's perfectly adequate and we can

3074
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:14,399
build on it and ai can be

3075
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:17,279
play a similar role i have to ask

3076
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:18,000
uh about beautiful artificial life

3077
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:20,880
systems

3078
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,479
or evolutionary computation systems uh

3079
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:25,279
cellular automata to me

3080
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:27,678
like i remember it was as a game changer

3081
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:29,920
for me early on in life when i saw

3082
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:33,840
conway's game of life who recently

3083
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,840
passed away unfortunately

3084
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:39,359
it's beautiful how much

3085
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:42,079
complexity can emerge from such simple

3086
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:45,118
rules i i just don't

3087
01:41:42,079 --> 01:41:47,840
somehow that simplicity is

3088
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:49,359
such a powerful illustration and also

3089
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,800
humbling because it feels like

3090
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:53,679
i personally from my perspective

3091
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:56,800
understand almost nothing about

3092
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:58,880
uh this world because because like my

3093
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,320
intuition fails completely how

3094
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,400
complexity can emerge from such

3095
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:02,799
simplicity like my intuition fails i

3096
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:05,839
think is

3097
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:08,400
the biggest problem i have

3098
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,279
do you find systems like that beautiful

3099
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:10,879
is there

3100
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:13,118
do you do you think about cellular

3101
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:15,279
automata because cellular tama don't

3102
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:17,039
really have um

3103
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:18,800
and many other artificial life systems

3104
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:19,198
don't necessarily have an objective

3105
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,079
maybe

3106
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:23,678
maybe that's a wrong way to say it it's

3107
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:28,079
almost like

3108
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:29,600
it's just evolving and creating

3109
01:42:28,079 --> 01:42:31,760
and there's not even a good definition

3110
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:34,480
of what it means to create something

3111
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:36,320
complex and interesting and surprising

3112
01:42:34,479 --> 01:42:39,359
all those words that you said

3113
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:40,960
um is there some some of those systems

3114
01:42:39,359 --> 01:42:43,198
you find uh beautiful

3115
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,639
yeah yeah and uh similarly evolution

3116
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:47,678
does not have a goal

3117
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:50,480
uh it is responding to uh

3118
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:50,880
current situation uh and so survival

3119
01:42:50,479 --> 01:42:52,718
then

3120
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,639
if it creates more complexity and

3121
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:56,800
therefore we have something that we

3122
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:59,440
perceive as progress but that's not what

3123
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:02,320
evolution is inherently

3124
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:03,359
said to do uh and yeah that's that's

3125
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:06,559
really fascinating

3126
01:43:03,359 --> 01:43:10,238
how how a simple set of rules or simple

3127
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:13,360
uh mappings can um from from

3128
01:43:10,238 --> 01:43:14,319
how from such simple mapping complexity

3129
01:43:13,359 --> 01:43:15,839
can emerge

3130
01:43:14,319 --> 01:43:18,000
so it's a question of emergence and

3131
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:20,079
self-organization uh and

3132
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,359
um the game of life is one of the

3133
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:24,880
simplest ones

3134
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:26,799
and very visual and therefore it drives

3135
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:31,118
home the point that it's possible that

3136
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:33,760
non-linear interactions uh and

3137
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:34,639
and this kind of complexity can emerge

3138
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,280
emerge from them

3139
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:38,000
and biology and evolution is along the

3140
01:43:37,279 --> 01:43:40,880
same lines we

3141
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,679
have simple representations dna if you

3142
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:44,639
really think of it

3143
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:46,079
it's not that complex um it's a long

3144
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:48,079
sequence of them there's lots of them

3145
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:49,760
but it's a very simple representation

3146
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:51,920
and similar evolutionary computation

3147
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,480
whatever string or tree representation

3148
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:55,039
we have

3149
01:43:52,479 --> 01:43:55,919
any operations you know the amount of

3150
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:59,198
code

3151
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:01,279
that's required to manipulate those is

3152
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:02,399
really really little and of course came

3153
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:05,279
alive even less

3154
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:06,960
so how complexity emerges from such

3155
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:09,599
simple principles that's that's

3156
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:11,439
absolutely fascinating um the challenge

3157
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:14,159
is to be able to control it

3158
01:44:11,439 --> 01:44:15,439
and guide it and direct it so that it

3159
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:17,439
becomes useful

3160
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:19,678
and like game of life is fascinating to

3161
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:20,000
look at and and evolution all the forms

3162
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:21,920
that come

3163
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,359
out is fascinating but can we actually

3164
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:25,760
make it useful

3165
01:44:23,359 --> 01:44:26,960
for us and efficient because if you

3166
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:28,800
actually think about

3167
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,239
each of the cells in the game of life as

3168
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:32,159
a living organism

3169
01:44:30,238 --> 01:44:33,839
there's a lot of death that has to

3170
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:34,238
happen to create anything interesting

3171
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,000
yeah

3172
01:44:34,238 --> 01:44:37,678
and so i guess the questions for us

3173
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,479
humans that are mortal and then life

3174
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:41,920
ends quickly we want to kind of hurry up

3175
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:45,039
and make sure

3176
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:46,880
we make sure we take evolution uh uh

3177
01:44:45,039 --> 01:44:48,238
the trajectory that is a little bit more

3178
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:50,079
efficient than uh

3179
01:44:48,238 --> 01:44:51,439
the alternatives and that that's one

3180
01:44:50,079 --> 01:44:52,880
something we talked about earlier that

3181
01:44:51,439 --> 01:44:55,198
evolution computation is very

3182
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,239
uh impatient yeah we had we have a goal

3183
01:44:55,198 --> 01:44:58,319
we want it

3184
01:44:56,238 --> 01:44:59,519
right away whereas this biology has a

3185
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:03,039
lot of time and

3186
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:04,320
and deep deep time and weak pressure and

3187
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:07,198
large populations

3188
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:08,479
uh one great example of of this is the

3189
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:11,439
novelty search

3190
01:45:08,479 --> 01:45:11,919
uh so evolutionary computation where you

3191
01:45:11,439 --> 01:45:14,799
don't

3192
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:16,480
actually specify a fitness goal

3193
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,199
something that is your actual thing that

3194
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:19,839
you want

3195
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:20,799
but you just reward solutions that are

3196
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,400
different

3197
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,079
from what you've seen before yeah

3198
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:26,238
nothing else yeah and

3199
01:45:24,079 --> 01:45:27,840
you know what you actually discover

3200
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:28,638
things that are interesting and useful

3201
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,480
that way

3202
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:32,560
um guess danny and joe lemon did this

3203
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:34,399
one study where they actually

3204
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:36,000
tried to evolve walking behavior on

3205
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:36,960
robots and that's actually we talked

3206
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,039
about earlier where

3207
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,560
your robot actually failed in all kinds

3208
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:41,679
of ways and eventually discovered

3209
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:44,639
something that was

3210
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:45,760
a very efficient walk uh and and it was

3211
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:48,639
because they if

3212
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:50,560
they rewarded things that were different

3213
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:52,800
that you were able to discover something

3214
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,880
uh and i think that this is crucial um

3215
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:56,400
because in order to be really different

3216
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,560
from what you already have

3217
01:45:56,399 --> 01:45:59,839
you have to utilize what is there in a

3218
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,639
domain to create something really

3219
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:04,319
different

3220
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:05,600
so you have encoded the uh fundamentals

3221
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:07,279
of your world

3222
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,679
and then you make changes to those

3223
01:46:07,279 --> 01:46:11,599
fundamentals you get further away

3224
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:13,760
so that's probably what's happening in

3225
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:17,199
these systems of emergence

3226
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:18,880
uh that the fundamentals are there

3227
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:21,039
and when you follow those fundamentals

3228
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:23,039
you get into points and some of those

3229
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:25,039
are actually interesting and useful now

3230
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:26,158
even in that robotic walker simulation

3231
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:29,279
there was a large

3232
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:30,158
set of garbage but among them there were

3233
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:32,399
some of these

3234
01:46:30,158 --> 01:46:34,238
you know gems and then those are the

3235
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:37,039
ones that somehow you have to outside

3236
01:46:34,238 --> 01:46:38,559
recognize and make useful but these kind

3237
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:40,000
of productive systems

3238
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:42,719
if you code them the right kind of

3239
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,719
principles i think that they

3240
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:46,560
that encode the structure of the of the

3241
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:49,920
domain then you will get to these

3242
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:51,600
solutions and the discoveries

3243
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:54,639
it feels like that might also be a good

3244
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:57,440
way to live life so let me ask

3245
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:58,000
do you have advice for young people

3246
01:46:57,439 --> 01:47:00,158
today

3247
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,439
about how to live life or how to succeed

3248
01:47:00,158 --> 01:47:06,000
in their career

3249
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:08,158
or forget career just succeed in life

3250
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
form an evolutionary computation

3251
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:13,439
perspective yes

3252
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:16,479
yes definitely explore

3253
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:19,759
diversity exploration yeah and i mean

3254
01:47:16,479 --> 01:47:21,279
individuals take classes in music

3255
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:24,960
history philosophy

3256
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:28,158
yeah you know math engineering uh

3257
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:30,560
see connections between them travel

3258
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:32,319
you know learn a language i mean all

3259
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:33,920
this diversity is fascinating and we

3260
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:36,639
have it at our fingerprint

3261
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:38,079
fingertips today it's possible you have

3262
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:39,600
to make a bit of an effort because it's

3263
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:42,719
not easy

3264
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:43,920
but the rewards are wonderful um

3265
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:47,198
yeah there's something interesting about

3266
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:51,118
an objective function of new experiences

3267
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:53,039
so try to figure out i mean uh

3268
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:54,799
what what is the maximally new

3269
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:58,158
experience that could have

3270
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:00,000
today and that so like that novelty

3271
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:01,759
optimizing for novelty for some period

3272
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,840
of time might be a very interesting way

3273
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:06,480
to sort of uh

3274
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,960
expand the the sets of experiences you

3275
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:10,158
had

3276
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:13,279
and uh then ground from that perspective

3277
01:48:10,158 --> 01:48:15,118
um like what you what would be the most

3278
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:15,759
fulfilling trajectory through life of

3279
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:18,559
course

3280
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:20,320
the flip side of that this is where i

3281
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,880
come from again maybe russian i don't

3282
01:48:20,319 --> 01:48:24,799
know

3283
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,800
but the the choice has a

3284
01:48:25,039 --> 01:48:28,639
choice is a has a detrimental effect i

3285
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:31,679
think

3286
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:35,279
from at least from my mind where

3287
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:39,600
scarcity is has a empowering effect

3288
01:48:35,279 --> 01:48:41,359
so if i sort of

3289
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:42,960
if i have very little of something and

3290
01:48:41,359 --> 01:48:45,759
only one of that something

3291
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,800
i will appreciate it deeply until i came

3292
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:49,679
to

3293
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,079
texas recently and i've been picking out

3294
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:52,079
on

3295
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:53,760
delicious incredible meat i've been

3296
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:54,079
fasting a lot so i need to do that again

3297
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:56,800
but

3298
01:48:54,079 --> 01:48:58,000
when you fast for a few days that the

3299
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:01,920
first taste of

3300
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:06,800
of a food is is incredible so

3301
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:10,800
the downside of exploration is that

3302
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:11,360
uh somehow maybe maybe you can correct

3303
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,440
me but

3304
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:15,118
somehow you don't get to experience

3305
01:49:13,439 --> 01:49:17,519
deeply

3306
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:19,598
any one of the particular moments but

3307
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:23,119
that could be a psychology thing

3308
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:24,960
that could be just a very human peculiar

3309
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:26,158
flaw yeah i didn't mean that you

3310
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,399
superficially

3311
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:29,839
explore i mean you can explore deeply

3312
01:49:28,399 --> 01:49:32,559
yeah so you don't have to

3313
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:34,719
explore 100 things but maybe a few

3314
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:35,360
topics where you can take a deep enough

3315
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:39,520
time

3316
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:42,319
a dive that you gain an understanding

3317
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:44,239
um you yourself have to decide at some

3318
01:49:42,319 --> 01:49:47,039
point that this is deep enough

3319
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:47,839
and i i unders i i've obtained what i

3320
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:50,158
can

3321
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,279
from this topic uh and now it's time to

3322
01:49:50,158 --> 01:49:54,399
move on

3323
01:49:51,279 --> 01:49:57,039
and that might take years um people

3324
01:49:54,399 --> 01:49:58,158
sometimes switch careers and they may

3325
01:49:57,039 --> 01:49:59,840
stay on some

3326
01:49:58,158 --> 01:50:01,679
career for a decade and switch to

3327
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:03,520
another one you can do it

3328
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:05,039
you're not pretty determined to stay

3329
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:08,159
where you are but

3330
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:10,639
you know in order to achieve um

3331
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:11,198
something you know 10 000 hours makes

3332
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:12,480
you need 10

3333
01:50:11,198 --> 01:50:14,799
000 hours to become an expert on

3334
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:15,919
something uh so you don't have to become

3335
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,599
an expert but to even

3336
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:19,359
develop an understanding and gain the

3337
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:20,480
experience that you can use later you

3338
01:50:19,359 --> 01:50:22,158
probably have to spend

3339
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:24,319
like i said it's not easy you got to

3340
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:26,479
spend some effort on it

3341
01:50:24,319 --> 01:50:28,559
now also at some point then when you

3342
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:30,238
have this diversity and you have these

3343
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:33,280
experiences exploration

3344
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:35,359
you may want to um you may find

3345
01:50:33,279 --> 01:50:38,079
something that you can't stay away from

3346
01:50:35,359 --> 01:50:39,039
uh like for as it was computers it was

3347
01:50:38,079 --> 01:50:41,279
ai it was

3348
01:50:39,039 --> 01:50:43,118
you know that you i just have to do it

3349
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:43,439
you know and i uh you know and then

3350
01:50:43,118 --> 01:50:45,598
we'll

3351
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:46,479
it will take decades maybe and you are

3352
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:48,319
pursuing it

3353
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:50,079
because you figured out that this is

3354
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:51,198
really exciting and you can bring in

3355
01:50:50,079 --> 01:50:52,399
your experiences

3356
01:50:51,198 --> 01:50:54,000
and there's nothing wrong with that

3357
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:55,759
either but you asked what's the advice

3358
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,000
for young people

3359
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:59,039
that's the expiration part and then

3360
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,960
beyond that if

3361
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:03,118
after that expiration you actually can

3362
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:04,880
focus and and build a career

3363
01:51:03,118 --> 01:51:06,479
and you know even there you can switch

3364
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,400
multiple times but

3365
01:51:06,479 --> 01:51:09,759
but i think the diversity exploration is

3366
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:13,519
fundamental to having a

3367
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:15,520
successful career as is concentration

3368
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:16,560
and spending an effort where it matters

3369
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,400
and and

3370
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,920
but you're in better position to make

3371
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:20,799
that choice when you have done your

3372
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:23,760
homework

3373
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:25,679
so exploration precedes commitment but

3374
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:27,840
both are beautiful

3375
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:29,359
uh so again from an evolutionary

3376
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:31,920
computation perspective

3377
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:32,399
we look at all the agents that had to

3378
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:33,679
die

3379
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:36,638
in order to come up with different

3380
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:39,199
solutions in simulation

3381
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:41,118
what do you think from that individual

3382
01:51:39,198 --> 01:51:41,759
agent's perspective is the meaning of it

3383
01:51:41,118 --> 01:51:43,759
all

3384
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:44,880
so far as humans you're just one agent

3385
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:48,719
who's going to be dead

3386
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:51,760
unfortunately one day too soon

3387
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:55,118
what do you think is the why

3388
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:58,480
of why that agent came to be

3389
01:51:55,118 --> 01:52:01,039
and uh eventually will be no more

3390
01:51:58,479 --> 01:52:02,479
is there meaning to it all yeah in

3391
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:05,599
evolution there is meaning

3392
01:52:02,479 --> 01:52:08,158
everything is a potential direction

3393
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:09,520
everything is a potential stepping stone

3394
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:11,359
um

3395
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:13,360
not all of them are going to work out

3396
01:52:11,359 --> 01:52:16,799
some of them are foundations for

3397
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:19,439
further um improvement

3398
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:20,719
and even those that are perhaps going to

3399
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:23,678
die out

3400
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:25,439
uh where potential energies potential

3401
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:27,760
solutions

3402
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:29,279
in biology we see a lot of species die

3403
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:30,560
off naturally and you know like the

3404
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:31,759
dinosaurs i mean they have a really good

3405
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:34,080
solution for a while

3406
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:35,199
but then it didn't turn out to be not

3407
01:52:34,079 --> 01:52:37,840
such a

3408
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:38,319
good solution in the long term uh when

3409
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:40,000
there's an

3410
01:52:38,319 --> 01:52:41,840
environmental change you have to have

3411
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,399
diversity some other solutions become

3412
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,319
better

3413
01:52:42,399 --> 01:52:47,039
it doesn't mean that that there was an

3414
01:52:44,319 --> 01:52:48,880
attempt it didn't quite work out or last

3415
01:52:47,039 --> 01:52:50,880
uh but they're still dinosaurs and

3416
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:54,079
mountains at least they're relatives

3417
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:56,480
uh and they may one day again be useful

3418
01:52:54,079 --> 01:52:57,679
who knows so from an individual's

3419
01:52:56,479 --> 01:52:58,959
perspective you've got to think of a

3420
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:02,239
bigger picture

3421
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:05,359
that it is a huge engine

3422
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:06,079
that is innovative and these elements

3423
01:53:05,359 --> 01:53:08,719
are all

3424
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:10,960
part of it potentially innovations on

3425
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:14,319
their own and also as

3426
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:15,679
as raw material perhaps or um stepping

3427
01:53:14,319 --> 01:53:16,238
stones for other things that could come

3428
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:18,000
after

3429
01:53:16,238 --> 01:53:21,039
but it still feels from an individual

3430
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,520
perspective that i i matter a lot

3431
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:24,840
but even if i'm just a little cog in the

3432
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:28,080
giant machine

3433
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:30,079
well is that just a silly human notion

3434
01:53:28,079 --> 01:53:32,719
in uh individualistic society and though

3435
01:53:30,079 --> 01:53:34,719
she'll let go of that

3436
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:36,639
do you find beauty in being part of the

3437
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:39,279
giant machine

3438
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:40,480
yeah i think it's meaningful um i think

3439
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:42,238
it adds

3440
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:43,449
purpose to your life that you are part

3441
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:45,439
of something bigger

3442
01:53:43,449 --> 01:53:48,800
[Laughter]

3443
01:53:45,439 --> 01:53:51,839
that said are you uh do you ponder your

3444
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:54,239
individual agent's mortality do you

3445
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:56,480
do you think about death do you fear

3446
01:53:54,238 --> 01:53:56,479
death

3447
01:53:56,639 --> 01:54:00,159
well certainly more now than when i was

3448
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:01,760
a

3449
01:54:00,158 --> 01:54:03,598
youngster and did skydiving and

3450
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:06,840
paragliding and

3451
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:08,239
you know all these things you've become

3452
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:11,360
wiser

3453
01:54:08,238 --> 01:54:14,559
um there is a reason

3454
01:54:11,359 --> 01:54:16,719
for this uh life arc that

3455
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:19,199
younger folks are more fearless in many

3456
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:20,960
ways it's part of the exploration

3457
01:54:19,198 --> 01:54:22,559
you know they are the they are the

3458
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:25,279
individuals who think hmm

3459
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:27,039
i wonder what's over those mountains or

3460
01:54:25,279 --> 01:54:28,000
what if i go really far in that ocean

3461
01:54:27,039 --> 01:54:30,960
what would i find

3462
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,079
i mean older folks i don't necessarily

3463
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:34,158
think that way

3464
01:54:32,079 --> 01:54:37,118
but younger do and it's kind of

3465
01:54:34,158 --> 01:54:39,198
counterintuitive so yeah this is uh

3466
01:54:37,118 --> 01:54:40,479
and biologically it's like you know you

3467
01:54:39,198 --> 01:54:42,319
have limited amount of time what can you

3468
01:54:40,479 --> 01:54:44,718
do with it that matters

3469
01:54:42,319 --> 01:54:45,759
so you try to you have done your

3470
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:48,480
exploration you

3471
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:50,400
committed to a certain direction and you

3472
01:54:48,479 --> 01:54:53,039
become an expert perhaps in it

3473
01:54:50,399 --> 01:54:53,439
what can i do that matters uh with with

3474
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:55,760
the

3475
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:57,759
limited resources that i have that's

3476
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:00,000
what how you i think

3477
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:02,480
a lot of people myself included start

3478
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:05,198
thinking later on in their career

3479
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:07,039
and uh like you said leave a bit of a

3480
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:09,678
trace and a bit of an impact even though

3481
01:55:07,039 --> 01:55:11,279
after the agent is gone yeah that's the

3482
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:13,520
goal

3483
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:14,719
well this was a fascinating conversation

3484
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,280
i don't think there's a better way to

3485
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:18,480
end it

3486
01:55:15,279 --> 01:55:20,319
uh thank you so much so first of all i'm

3487
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:23,118
very inspired of how vibrant the

3488
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:24,639
community at ut austin in austin is it's

3489
01:55:23,118 --> 01:55:27,759
really exciting for me

3490
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:30,159
uh to see it and this whole field

3491
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:32,480
seems like profound philosophically but

3492
01:55:30,158 --> 01:55:33,920
also the path forward for the artificial

3493
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:35,678
intelligence community so

3494
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,960
thank you so much for explaining so many

3495
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:38,639
cool things to me today

3496
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,319
and for wasting all of your valuable

3497
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:43,118
time with me oh it was a pleasure

3498
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:45,840
thanks i appreciate it thanks for

3499
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:48,079
listening to this conversation with

3500
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:49,520
and thank you to the jordan harbinger

3503
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:57,359
the description to support this podcast

3504
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:59,360
and now let me leave you with some words

3505
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:02,799
from carl sagan

3506
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:05,920
extinction is the rule survival

3507
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:07,119
is the exception thank you for listening

3508
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:15,840
i hope to see you

3509
