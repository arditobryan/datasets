human side of the whole thing

39
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:25,599

do happen to be living through what i

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,439
would think of

56
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,039
as a historic event in in terms of its

57
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,718
impact in terms of

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,399
like almost philosophically thinking

59
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,598
about the role of

60
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,199

118
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159
i said what's that and he said

119
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,680
quantitative

120
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:03,199
analysis and i was like oh yeah i know

121
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,560
about that that's like you guys make

122
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,839
algorithms and then try to beat the

123
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,080
market right he's like yeah i was like

124
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,438
so you're gonna pitch me on a startup

125
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,319
and you're gonna sell your algorithm to

126
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,840
other people

127
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,679
and if it was so good why wouldn't you

128
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,039
just use it yourself and print money

129
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,639
he's like yeah no no that's not our

130
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,000
business our businesses we're going to

131
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,439
create an app to get millennials to

132
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,560
trade stocks

133
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,399
and i said you do realize there's no

134
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,360
retail investors anymore like the dot

135
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,679
com crash plus the 2008 financial crisis

136
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,520
eliminated any individual's belief in

137
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,879
participating in the stock market

138
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,879
and he said that's the opportunity i

139
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,918
said okay i like it tell me more

140
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,680
he said well we're going to get these

141
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,560
millennials to trade i said the same

142
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,720
ones

143
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,079
who live in their mom's basements and

144
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,639
take uber and lyft and

145
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,439
are on their parents have no money got

146
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,918
screwed and

147
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,399
you know went 250k into debt for school

148
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,079
and now can't get a job those people

149
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,719
and he's like yeah i'm like okay they

150
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,839
have no interest in their future but

151
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,800
they're going to trade stocks he said

152
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,000
yeah that's the opportunity i was like

153
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,639
how do you how are you going to make

154
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,918
money

155
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,918
and he said well that's the best part

156
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,279
it's going to be free

157
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,879
and i said so your idea is to get a

158
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,239
group of people who have no interest in

159
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,918
saving for their future

160
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,240
to trade and your business model is free

161
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,799
and he said yes i said i'm in

162
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,400
because in almost all cases the crazy

163
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,160
outlandish ideas

164
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,679
that nobody believes in are the ones

165
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,560
that have the greatest returns i mean

166
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,720
uber

167
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,160
i introduced to about 25 investors and

168
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,160
three of us said yes

169
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,199
so you know a full 12 percent of the

170
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
community

171
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,759
who saw that deal decided to do it so

172
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,720
the your sense about this idea being

173
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,240
good

174
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,880
had to do with the fact that this guy

175
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,478
was just uh crazy and ambitious and bold

176
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,478
thinking or was it that there's

177
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,560
something here in uh

178
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,399
allowing a much larger magnitude of

179
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,600
people to be able to be investors

180
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,038
yeah the way to do really well as an

181
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,919
angel investor or

182
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,439
just in technology or in life is to not

183
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:52,319
say what could go wrong but to say what

184
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,439
could go right

185
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,959
and then to just imagine for a moment if

186
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,680
it does work what would the world look

187
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:02,079
like and so when elon was investing

188
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,720
in tesla and some other guys were

189
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,680
running it

190
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,160
and he was trying to save the company

191
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,800
you know

192
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
it wasn't is this gonna work it was

193
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
almost

194
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,758
positively not gonna work it was and he

195
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,360
knew that um

196
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,280
but if it does work what does the world

197
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,038
look like and so that's really what

198
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,239
you're looking for is

199
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,360
not the chances of success but if it

200
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,038
does succeed

201
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
does succeed what would that look like

202
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:28,159
and

203
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,359
you that's what the world needs more

204
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,039
people doing and so when you looked at

205
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,479
robin hood it was like well if he does

206
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,399
succeed what would the world look like

207
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,800
and now we've seen what it looks like

208
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:39,120
you have a generation who are so

209
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,520
financially sophisticated

210
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,478
that they know how to do puts and calls

211
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,519
and shorts

212
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,399
and research at a level

213
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,399
that dominated the hedge fund industry

214
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,239
so let's pause for a second

215
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,318
these traders sitting there on a

216
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,879
subreddit in a discord server

217
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,319
are able to do analysis and research and

218
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,519
then act in unison

219
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,560
to say we're going to beat in the robin

220
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,639
hood sense

221
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,839
uh you know this group of sophisticated

222
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,918
insiders who have

223
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,879
more access and more access to capital

224
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,279
but we will

225
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,240
figure out how to solve this problem and

226
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,959
you know things

227
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,079
most things don't work it's like the

228
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,839
wikipedia like

229
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,758
there's no way no way the wikipedia

230
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,679
would ever work right

231
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,280
except it did yeah right like you're

232
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,280
like how is this ever going to work

233
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,559
you're not paying anybody but it's both

234
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,399
the largest corpus

235
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,918
of an encyclopedia ever so i think

236
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,000
robinhood actually succeeded and then

237
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,159
what we saw was

238
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,038
this system and a lot of the systems in

239
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,199
our society

240
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,439
whether it's the political system the

241
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,520
constitution of the united states

242
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,800
uh education higher education which

243
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,639
you're involved in

244
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,560
and then even the financial system we

245
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,160
have not stress tested and

246
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,120
stress tested it and we don't actually

247
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,439
know all the edge cases and how it works

248
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,439
so trump was able to just really put

249
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,959
this crazy stress test like

250
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,959
it is the democracy going to hold

251
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,198
are we going to break this two or three

252
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,239
you know 200 someone-year-old experiment

253
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,478
and then we looked at the financial

254
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,160
markets and it turns out there were more

255
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,478
people shorting the stock than stocks

256
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,319
where

257
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,079
the shares were available i don't know

258
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,039
how that's possible and then i'm trying

259
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,240
to uncover

260
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,519
where can i see a list of people who've

261
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,400
shorted the stock and it's like you

262
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,318
can't

263
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,239
but we can tell you sort of how many

264
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,598
every two weeks or maybe twice a week we

265
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,759
can create a report

266
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,639
maybe we know i was surprised that

267
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,160
nobody knows

268
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,598
the list of people who were shorted and

269
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,960
you guys were trying to figure that out

270
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:29,839
yeah there's no transparency on a lot of

271
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,839
these systems

272
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,278
and if you call to try to shorter stock

273
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,639
like it's almost like they'll tell you

274
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,240
on the phone like let me see i think i

275
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,799
might know a guy who has shares to loan

276
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,360
out

277
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,079
so it's like am i calling to like try to

278
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,360
find like a

279
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,879
73 mustang grande in you know gold

280
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,560
you know you're gonna call around it's

281
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,480
like shouldn't this be like on a

282
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,599
ledger somewhere and be completely

283
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,879
transparent so

284
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,240
now we're seeing those things and i

285
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,080
think the investigations will make it

286
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,039
super clear but of course

287
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,639
in a vacuum without information there

288
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,480
are so many investors in these startups

289
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,759
that conflicts can start to appear and

290
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,920
then you know how it is with people in

291
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,559
conspiracy there is

292
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,919
the mind starts to wander right and so

293
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,000
in some cases there is actually a

294
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,919
conspiracy and then in other cases

295
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,278
uh people's mind will fill in like oh my

296
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,039
god there's some grand conspiracy here i

297
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,799
can tell you robin hood's only goal is

298
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,759
to get more people to trade stocks

299
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,399
and to democratize it even more and they

300
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,759
apparently

301
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,759
were on the brink of you know seizing as

302
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,559
an as an entity if they didn't get more

303
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,639
money

304
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,639
to cover all these trades i mean they

305
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,679
were on the brink and they raised three

306
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,958
and a half billion dollars or something

307
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,399
like that in a week

308
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:38,239
yeah so in some sense robin hood enabled

309
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,559
this very like the magic of this

310
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,320
distributed system of wall street bets

311
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,159
right you said wikipedia which is

312
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,560
another which is probably one of my

313
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,559
favorite websites and one of my favorite

314
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,319
examples of like a distributed system

315
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,799
somehow coming together in a way

316
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,879
just like you said at that crappy bar

317
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,278
you i would have guessed it would never

318
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,439
work

319
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,720
but if it does work it changes

320
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,680
everything and it did

321
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,079
and robin hood in that same way probably

322
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,239
enabled or was one of the major enablers

323
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:10,078
of wall street best of giving

324
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,159
power uh like empowering young kids

325
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,759
to learn about how this whole messy

326
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,480
financial system works

327
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:17,600
and take on the big elite centralized

328
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,000
players

329
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,680
yes and you know it's very easy when

330
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,720
these companies get big

331
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:26,319
um one thing that's changed is the

332
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,920
footprint of these startups and the

333
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,360
velocity at which they grow

334
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,799
so something like airbnb is another

335
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,759
perfect example of something that should

336
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,199
really not work

337
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,078
in practice but it does like i'm gonna

338
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,079
rent my

339
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,519
couch or my extra room to somebody like

340
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,199
a serial killer or

341
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,639
i'm gonna stay in somebody's house like

342
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
a serial killer's house and

343
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,159
you know it's like it really sounds

344
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,759
scary but it actually works and

345
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,039
and it has not destroyed the hotel

346
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,399
business

347
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,838
it has added so the best startups induce

348
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,278
a market to exist

349
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,399
if you look at you know uber or airbnb

350
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,799
people replaced their cars and uber was

351
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,360
not

352
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,278
competing ultimately with taxis they

353
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,000
were competing with car ownership

354
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,519
public transportation walking or just

355
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,879
not going out

356
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,639
and then you look at airbnb a lot of

357
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,200
people who stay in an airbnb would not

358
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:17,919
be

359
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,920
taking a trip to kyoto if not for the

360
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,159
fact that they could get a 75

361
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,519
beautiful room with great reviews in

362
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,799
kyoto for

363
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,560
three weeks it inspires people and it

364
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,479
manifests a market because the product

365
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,159
is so transcendent right

366
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,320
and i think that's one of the things

367
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,360
that robin hood did you can't learn how

368
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,200
to do this options

369
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,560
trading and puts and calls and all this

370
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,480
sophistication stuff

371
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,319
unless you actually do it it's just too

372
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,839
hard to learn except in practice

373
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
just like poker if you want to learn how

374
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,519
to play poker or guitar

375
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,120
or tennis or skiing like you could talk

376
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,480
about it you can watch youtube videos

377
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,240
but at a certain point you got to get on

378
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,399
the mountain at a certain point

379
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,519
you got to put some chips in the pot and

380
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,958
it's going to be painful

381
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,000
yeah like poker is going to be painful

382
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,039
you're going to lose a lot of money

383
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
that's why you should play at the small

384
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,439
tables first and

385
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,200
you know even in trading like you look

386
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,120
at people who are doing this

387
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,240
crazy trading and gamestop a company

388
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
that's worth

389
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,639
you know maybe a couple of billion

390
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
dollars but certainly not tens of

391
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,000
billions of dollars of course the people

392
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,039
who are throwing their money in last are

393
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
gonna lose it

394
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,039
i think everybody knew that um and so it

395
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,240
was a momentum play and

396
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,719
you know they're betting against the

397
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,919
hedge funds um so i think it's good for

398
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,519
people to learn

399
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,039
and become financially illiterate and

400
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,440
just always understand

401
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,958
the concept of the risk of ruin yeah um

402
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,399
the good news is for a young person the

403
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,679
risk of ruin might be like they lose

404
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,958
five thousand dollars or something and

405
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,359
then they have to build their stack back

406
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,958
up

407
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,120
right but that's really the the only

408
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,518
thing i am concerned about is

409
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,360
there are people who will play poker or

410
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,879
blackjack or sports betting or whatever

411
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,039
it is and lose control

412
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,480
just like there might be people who try

413
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,120
alcohol and lose control

414
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,399
but we can't build a system based upon

415
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,240
limiting

416
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,480
you know the average person's behavior

417
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
based upon somebody who can't control

418
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,000
you know their ability to drink you know

419
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,079
two glasses of wine instead of 20.

420
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,679
how does this whole thing end uh

421
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,078
probably in tears

422
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,039
for who yeah who's crying is everybody

423
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,039
crying

424
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,399
who's crying when so i think there were

425
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,120
some of the hedge funds that were crying

426
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,480
initially

427
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,879
that maybe some of the wall street bets

428
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,120
people who bought last would be crying

429
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,039
and then eventually there's an probably

430
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,480
another set of hedge funds or even the

431
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,199
wall street bets

432
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,639
mob and you know that army some of them

433
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
might have broke ranks and then shorted

434
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,759
the stock

435
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,759
yeah so nobody knows so everybody has to

436
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,200
be aware of what's happening in the game

437
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,799
so if wall street vets said hey let's

438
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,920
squeeze these hedge funds because they

439
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,719
have too much short interest

440
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,838
let's all buy the stock then some of

441
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,160
them might have said okay you know it's

442
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,240
not

443
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,919
two or three hundred dollars maybe i'll

444
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,839
join the short movement now that they've

445
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,078
covered and they could have shorted

446
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,440
their in been like double agents so

447
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,519
people have to understand like this

448
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,160
stuff is gnarly and it's a it's a

449
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,679
free-for-all

450
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,360
i mean it is a literal free-for-all

451
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,519
there's a kind of morality

452
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,079
like a big statement that wall street

453
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,919
bets made in terms of like the elites

454
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,359
can't just push us around they can't

455
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,439
bully around

456
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,959
but at the same time you know they're

457
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,920
also interested in making money

458
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,399
right yes is uh what's your sense you

459
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,679
said that

460
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,519
some of the people in the wall street

461
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,000
best might have broken off and shorted

462
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,078
the stock

463
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,198
sure are they more interested there was

464
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,879
an emergent

465
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:18,159
like morality that emerged and said like

466
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,639
we're not going to put up with the

467
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,799
centralized elites but

468
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,799
is that going to continue are they going

469
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,159
to fight the power structures that are

470
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,039
bad for society

471
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,559
are they going to now like i mean are

472
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,399
they ultimately going to introduce more

473
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,838
chaos that's going to damage the economy

474
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,600
and damage the world or are they going

475
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,959
to continue being the good guys and

476
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,320
fighting the uh

477
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,198
the the the evils that manipulate uh the

478
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,760
market

479
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,359
what's your sense you know it it really

480
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,399
feels like the dark knight series of

481
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,839
films where like

482
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,000
some people just want to see the world

483
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,880
burn yeah i think there is a contingent

484
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,198
of people who just

485
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,720
literally want to see chaos yeah like

486
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,639
you know that contingent

487
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,000
on some of these you know forums who

488
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,480
just want to create chaos

489
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,159
right um so there's certainly that chaos

490
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,278
contingent but i think overall what the

491
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,198
arc will show is

492
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,278
a group of people getting massively

493
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:10,559
educated you see it in crypto as well

494
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,799
there was like a three-year period where

495
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,239
all of these failed entrepreneurs who i

496
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,879
knew who couldn't

497
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,839
build companies were then coming back to

498
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,360
me

499
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,720
after their companies has failed or

500
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,919
after they gave up or couldn't clear a

501
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,120
market raising money with the venture

502
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,879
capital community

503
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,240
and they were doing icos and i was like

504
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,838
i met you before right and they're like

505
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,919
yeah yeah no i'm doing an ico now i'm

506
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,199
like okay

507
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,198
where's your company at and they're like

508
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,799
here's a white paper and i was like

509
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,958
this white paper with spelling errors in

510
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,198
it that says you're going to destroy

511
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,879
airbnb because everybody's apartment is

512
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,319
going to be on immutable ledger

513
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,078
yeah like wouldn't that be better in a

514
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,959
regular database that was private and

515
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,319
not public

516
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,879
like why does it need to be an immutable

517
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,879
ledger so it can't change i'm like

518
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,320
not changing the database is a feature

519
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,120
that's that does not seem like a good

520
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,160
feature

521
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,198
and they couldn't explain it they're

522
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,600
like well just people are interested in

523
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,198
icos and there was that ico mania

524
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,800
and what it showed was there's a global

525
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,838
appetite for risk people

526
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,439
want to try new things this is one of

527
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,480
the great things about the human spirit

528
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
is one of the great things about

529
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,440
capitalism

530
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
and one of the things that concerns me

531
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,880
most about we're at society is

532
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,720
the sort of socialism communism

533
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,159
you know entrepreneurship is bad

534
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,399
technology is bad

535
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,838
and polarization of wealth and you know

536
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,759
people getting rich is a bad thing when

537
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,759
i grew up i'm 50 now but when i was a

538
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,759
gen xer growing up we kind of

539
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,879
maybe too much idolized bill gates and

540
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,519
people who are doing interesting things

541
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,958
in the world

542
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,720
and we thought capitalism was a force

543
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,518
for good i still believe capitalism

544
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,680
is a force for good because when a group

545
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,000
of people builds a product or service

546
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,679
that changes the world and and it gets

547
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,559
globally distributed whether it's

548
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,719
tesla or spacex or google or airbnb or

549
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,638
uber or robinhood

550
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,399
you know everybody gets to benefit from

551
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,839
that product or service

552
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,078
having to compete and if you look at the

553
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,360
places where there's no competition like

554
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,278
public education or less you know profes

555
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,879
you know uh you know established

556
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,880
you know colleges and stuff like that

557
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,519
less competition for accreditation

558
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,360
degrees

559
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,558
like things tend to get a little weird

560
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,399
don't they yeah

561
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,599
and people tend to be protected and

562
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,079
that's not good you need

563
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,119
you need competition um does it mean

564
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:16,480
that

565
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,000
you know people shouldn't have global

566
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,519
health care it doesn't mean that you

567
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,119
know we shouldn't have a safety net but

568
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,558
we need to keep capitalism vibrant

569
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,719
especially because china

570
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,720
has now co-opted capitalism and created

571
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,960
their own version of capitalism

572
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,720
which is communism with capitalism it's

573
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,558
like this weird operating system like

574
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,798
we still want to keep communism so we

575
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,000
can take any of your gains at any time

576
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,679
yes but we'd like you to be

577
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,880
entrepreneurial yeah and then you have

578
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,840
somebody like

579
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,120
you know um you know the founder of

580
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,119
alibaba jack ma

581
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,319
who disappears for a couple of weeks

582
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,959
who's that

583
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,558
exactly like who's jack he kind of

584
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,160
disappears for a couple of weeks and

585
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,678
then he comes back and he's really sorry

586
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,400
about the things he said and

587
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,160
then he disappears again and like you

588
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,840
know we have to be very careful if china

589
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,759
wins

590
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:05,279
capitalism yeah this is going to be an

591
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:08,079
existential threat for humanity yeah

592
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,839
the chinese are no joke i mean they are

593
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,159
seriously focused

594
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:14,798
and they are picking the winners it's a

595
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,000
very weird system because it is in fact

596
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,240
i don't know what you call it like

597
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,200
communism capitalism in such uh

598
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,240
overloaded terms but they do encourage

599
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,038
entrepreneurship

600
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,120
but they and they do a good job of it oh

601
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,879
yes but but then they're like

602
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,639
they're like the surveillance thing and

603
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,600
they're controlling things in a way yeah

604
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,160
it's it's weird

605
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,119
because it seems to work really well for

606
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,120
them

607
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,239
uh in the short term yes it's definitely

608
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,199
got short-term benefits

609
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,038
so the question is like what what uh how

610
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,160
that gets distorted and becomes worse

611
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,480
and what's worse

612
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,200
what should potentially might be and i i

613
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,519
think on

614
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,919
you know the the entrepreneurial spirit

615
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
which

616
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,160
you have apocalypse all centered around

617
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,159
the entrepreneurial spirit it

618
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,160
is one of the magical things that makes

619
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,080
this country great i don't know if money

620
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,200
is deeply tied into that

621
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,038
i do get bothered by people you know

622
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,400
treating the word billionaires if it's a

623
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:12,000
bad word yeah

624
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,120
but in general like all the hard things

625
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,119
all the difficult things we're going

626
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:19,439
through in this country it seems like

627
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:22,159
the way out is going to be uh

628
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,440
making the the entrepreneur the hero of

629
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,519
society of like

630
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,080
letting that young kid with the big

631
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,839
dream and the guts to take the big risks

632
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,319
and build something totally new

633
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,839
uh make giving them a chance and

634
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,599
whatever that involves

635
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,038
i i don't think it's about taxes i don't

636
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,119
think it's about like

637
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,000
uh regulation all that stuff it's about

638
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,639
us and just public discourse saying

639
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,519
that that kid that guy that girl they're

640
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,919
bad asses

641
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,679
like encourage them to do it we have to

642
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,520
have people buy in

643
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,280
to the fact that they have that

644
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,200
opportunity and i think one of the

645
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,639
problems in society is

646
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,558
there's a group of people who actually

647
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,400
don't believe that they

648
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,599
can succeed or they don't believe even

649
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,919
more perniciously

650
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,599
that other people can and that's the

651
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,679
group of people that i think are

652
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,798
highly vocal but a small group of people

653
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,519
which are

654
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,639
generally people of incredible privilege

655
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,599
rich parents

656
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,400
white city dwellers liberals they kind

657
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,879
of look and say

658
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,519
poor people cannot change a lot and

659
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,679
their they're battling in their minds

660
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,440
to protect poor people and but they have

661
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,720
this very weird patriarchal kind of

662
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,320
approach to it which is

663
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,839
they think that they're not capable of

664
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,359
changing their lot in life and they're

665
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,879
like it's not possible

666
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,399
and then once in a while i'll tweet

667
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,360
something where i say you know it's

668
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,880
really incredible that

669
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,959
every piece of knowledge you could

670
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,720
possibly want is now available for free

671
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,200
on youtube

672
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,038
and every course from mit and harvard

673
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,080
and stanford is available on edx or

674
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:47,919
coursera

675
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,798
and all that information is there freely

676
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,240
available and you can take the lectures

677
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,000
this is amazing and then people will be

678
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,960
like yeah but people don't have access

679
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,519
to it i'm like

680
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,159
they do it's free here's the link and

681
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,359
they're like

682
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,679
yeah but they don't have internet and

683
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,359
i'm like here's the chart of internet

684
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,480
penetration in america like

685
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,439
and they're like well poor people don't

686
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,000
have internet and i'm like really

687
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,038
find me any downtrodden person without a

688
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,558
smartphone

689
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,079
with a high-speed connection that

690
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,480
capitalism provided

691
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,158
for 12 a month or 15 a month like it's

692
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,000
very hard to find that

693
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,720
and and we have it so well in this

694
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,759
country and there's so much opportunity

695
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,960
um but people don't believe it

696
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,319
and that's actually one of the problems

697
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,480
see the average american still watches

698
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,000
four or five hours of television a day

699
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,000
and often i meet people they're like i

700
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,759
need a technical co-founder

701
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,038
and i you know but all i need is a

702
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,240
million dollars and i'm like okay well

703
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:38,720
what is your skill and they don't have a

704
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,798
skill

705
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,839
right and i'm like well are you a

706
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,440

have an idea well

711
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,960
as my friend sam harris i think your

712
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,798
friend as well says like

713
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,640
everybody has like a million ideas an

714
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,079
hour like you don't really get credit

715
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,600
for those even when you're asleep your

716
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,000
idea is spewing ideas

717
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,119
like zero credit for your ideas it's all

718
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,798
about execution

719
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,959
you have to believe that you yourself

720
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,798
can be the core of that execution you

721
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,720
yourself can build the thing and every

722
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,558
no matter what your circumstances are

723
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,919
and you could talk about like structural

724
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,200
racism and all those kinds of things

725
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,280
that very fast

726
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,960
but from the individual perspective when

727
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,639
you just like are coaching or giving

728
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,079
advice to an individual

729
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,759
you can literally change the world i

730
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,519
mean wall street bets is an indication

731
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,000
of that in the financial space that you

732
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,000
yourself

733
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,359
can have can change the world that

734
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,960
that's why this country is

735
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,558
is amazing still the best country in the

736
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,480
world right i mean it still is

737
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,558
amazing the opportunity provided to

738
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,279
people all this educational experience

739
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,519
is online

740
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,879
and the ability what i tell young people

741
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,639
who are looking for advice

742
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,799
i say you know your the skill you need

743
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,840
to refine is the ability to learn new

744
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,759
skills

745
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,199
like if you become good at learning a

746
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,960
new skill

747
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,640
and tim ferriss a friend of mine has

748
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,840
really pioneered this like

749
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,120
he can get to 60 or 70 percent

750
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,399
of like the knowledge in a skill in some

751
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:01,839
incredibly short period time now i'm not

752
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,559
saying he's gonna become a virtuoso

753
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,639
drummer

754
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,319
or a great basketball player but tim and

755
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,759
i were on vacation together in

756
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,439
like a group vacation in italy and there

757
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,200
was a basketball court

758
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,960
and uh i said let's go let's go shoot

759
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,080
some hoops i never shoot shot before and

760
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,880
i was like okay come on

761
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,399
i'll teach you and tim is fabulously

762
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,000
uncoordinated people don't know this

763
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,559
yes like he tried to dribble a

764
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,359
basketball and do a layup yeah and it

765
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,839
looked like

766
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,959
he had a blindfold on i mean you've

767
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,639
never seen something

768
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,880
less elegant than tim ferriss doing a

769
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,559
layup in basketball and then he watched

770
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,600
me do it three or four times

771
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,639
and i watched him study me and i listen

772
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,240
i i've been playing basketball in

773
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
brooklyn since i was a kid

774
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,000
i got a couple of moves and he was just

775
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,359
taking notes and taking notes and taking

776
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,720
notes and by the end of a couple of

777
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,639
hours of doing this

778
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,400
i could just watch him checking his form

779
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,720
and figuring it out

780
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,480
that's every skill in the world now and

781
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,919
what i tell people is like

782
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,679
i'm like have you did you watch game of

783
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,200
thrones and they're like yeah

784
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,278
watch breaking bad like yeah i'm like

785
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,400
okay that's about 400 hours

786
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,880
yeah how about you don't watch the next

787
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,559
two

788
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,320
and you put that 400 hours into learning

789
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,839
how to be a graphic designer

790
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,918
a ux person a developer whatever it is

791
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,199
and learn how to add skills that's what

792
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,759
i did my whole life i was a kid from

793
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,600
brooklyn

794
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,079
went to school at night but i was very

795
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,918
quick to get to maybe 50

796
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,759
of the knowledge base of graphic design

797
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,520
or being a writer or being a sales

798
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,319
executive whatever it was a developer

799
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:28,639
even

800
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,399
and i was just good enough to not have

801
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,278
people be able to [ __ ] me like when

802
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,919
i hired them

803
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:36,000
and that was a big unlock when you know

804
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,278
enough that people can't snow you that's

805
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,480
a really good one and look at yourself

806
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,000
like

807
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,919
you figured out how to set up an entire

808
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,278
podcast people don't know this but

809
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,720
you don't have a team around you i have

810
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,159
a team of like five six people working

811
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,240
in my pocket you see even knowing

812
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,919
enough about to set this up you would

813
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,278
then be able to hire a team

814
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,038
correct and you'll be able to call them

815
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:53,599
on their [ __ ] if they're not doing a

816
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:54,720
good job

817
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,079
and that's really important and i don't

818
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,919
know that much about this whole thing

819
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,918
but i know enough to be able to

820
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,200
see who knows their stuff or not you're

821
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,840
absolutely right and then

822
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,240
the process of learning how to learn is

823
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:06,879
uh

824
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,200
is essential there because uh like i've

825
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,919
uh i did martial arts uh jiu-jitsu and

826
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,600
so on

827
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,520
and it's so funny to watch i did take

828
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,359
one yeah definitely that was awesome

829
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,359
it's funny that there's some people that

830
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,599
do an activity for years

831
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,798
because to sort of elaborate on

832
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,918
something you were saying about

833
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,918
uh hours it's not always the

834
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,400
amount of hours it's the quality that

835
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,159
you put in deliberate practice versus

836
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,519
just doing some behavior i mean

837
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,120
literally i've been playing chess and

838
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:34,319
and trying to get that going again after

839
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,439
watching queen's gambit and i got

840
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,639
chess.com

841
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,600
and i realized i was just playing and

842
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,038
i'm not getting better and then i was

843
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,480
like oh wait there's a little analysis

844
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,000
feature here at jazz.com

845
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,240
where we'll show you your blunders and

846
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,640
mistakes and i'm like oh

847
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,519
i'm spending no time reviewing my losses

848
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,278
in chess

849
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,879
and i just want to play the next game i

850
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,240
should really review these losses and

851
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,440
figure out what mistakes i made when i

852
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,200
started doing that i was like oh

853
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,640
i'm getting better yeah right so some

854
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,080
deliberate practice really well and if

855
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,200
you want to take it all the way uh

856
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,439
magnus carlsen

857
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,120
uh shout out to the guy he has an app

858
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,120
but there's a few other coaching apps

859
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,599
where you like focus on the end game you

860
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,839
focus

861
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,519
drilling a particular it's you basically

862
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,119
don't play the game at all you're just

863
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,720
focused on drilling the

864
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,558
the different apps the openings the

865
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,000
openings yeah yeah and there's different

866
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:16,960
kinds of puzzles so you can really make

867
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,720
it into a

868
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,798
deliberate practice not to make this

869
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,919
episode uh sponsored by chess.com but

870
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:23,759
they literally have puzzles

871
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,200
yeah so i was like oh and it's a hundred

872
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:26,879
dollars a year for this product and i

873
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,278
just thought to myself

874
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,960
this is capitalism they don't need to

875
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,558
charge you a hundred dollars an hour for

876
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,079
a lesson

877
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,678
they can charge you a hundred dollars

878
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,439
and they've created the ability for you

879
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,880
to play chess 24 hours a day

880
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,440
against opponents who are perfectly

881
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,440
matched against you based on your rating

882
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,960
and they analyze every game and they

883
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,240
have puzzles and they have tutorials and

884
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,360
they've got everything else

885
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,079
it's like just think about how

886
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,839
much value is being provided to society

887
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,439
because of capitalism and because

888
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:56,240
competition if you want things to get

889
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,320
better

890
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,079
and you want to step up your game just

891
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,798
make it slightly competitive it is one

892
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,079
of these things

893
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:05,918
in human uh existence that is

894
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,359
so powerful i don't know did you see the

895
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,080
michael jordan documentary the last

896
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,839
dance

897
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,439
like half of it okay i'm still working i

898
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,720
mean he's so

899
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,759
competitive yeah and petty yeah it's so

900
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,798
inspiring that

901
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,038
all he cares about is just winning

902
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,720
to the level of which he literally

903
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,398
there's like this running meme

904
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,360
i took that personally and i took that

905
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:26,398
person i don't know if you've seen the

906
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:28,079
images of him

907
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,678
sitting smoking a cigar looking at like

908
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,798
an ipad or a video clip and it's like i

909
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,240
took that personally

910
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:33,918
and you can make a supercut of every

911
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,359
time he took something personally he

912
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,520
literally takes everything personally to

913
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:40,319
give himself that competitive motivation

914
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,158
to win that's capitalism and when people

915
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:45,200
are competing

916
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,240
man look at what elon did to the the

917
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,679
the space of cars like every they were

918
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,839
literally laughing at him in the first

919
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,360
10 years electric cars ha ha

920
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,439
that company will go out of business and

921
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,479
now every single company is like

922
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,120
we're going fully electric by 2035 and

923
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,159
he

924
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:04,798
kicked their asses so brutally

925
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,760
that they had no choice but then to step

926
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:07,519
up their game

927
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,200
and that's what we want right and this

928
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,158
virus and this pandemic

929
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,679
i think the the the great thing that

930
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,120
will come out of this horrible

931
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,840
experience that we've all had

932
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,519
psychologically death learning just so

933
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,879
many bad things occurred the economy

934
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,639
people losing their jobs

935
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,720
but we also got to see the human spirit

936
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,759
with these mrna vaccines

937
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,360
and and just how if we

938
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,200
took out some of the regulation and

939
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,839
people were super motivated

940
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,120
we might actually be able to eliminate

941
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,319
all

942
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,158
uh pandemics from ever happening again

943
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,480
and before that bill gates was banging

944
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,480
his fist and jeff skull was doing

945
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,599
the movie contagion i mean for two

946
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,200
decades people have been banging their

947
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,558
faces we have to be prepared for this

948
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,440
yes and everybody's like yeah whatever

949
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,759
yolo

950
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,960
it's not gonna happen and now it's

951
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,119
happened and people are like

952
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,240
we need to be able to destroy every you

953
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,278
know

954
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,480
pandemic and virus before it happens and

955
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,720
you're listening you know a lot more

956
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,159
about science than i do but this mr mrna

957
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,319
has been around for a while

958
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,440
we've just never gotten aggressive about

959
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,879
doing it and then you think about

960
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,840
challenge trials

961
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,679
i don't know if you've been following

962
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,439
this but they're doing challenge trials

963
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,240
now in the uk this month

964
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,278
where they're introducing covid into

965
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,038
healthy young patients

966
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,919
and then giving them the vaccine or you

967
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:25,119
know and that is against all

968
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,600
yeah rules and regulations about

969
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,798
you know do no harm but then you think

970
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,639
about it

971
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,960
we kind of celebrate people jumping out

972
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,480
of planes and we got that one guy alex

973
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,919
honnold who's climbing up mountains

974
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,640
without a rope and they give him a north

975
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,600
star

976
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,880
you know back page ad and a a you know

977
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,359
an endorsement deal

978
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,919
yeah and we celebrate that we celebrate

979
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,678
people

980
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,159
surfing with sharks we celebrate people

981
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,798
doing deep welding we pay them extra to

982
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,919
go

983
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:55,038
200 feet underground and weld stuff and

984
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,240
people do dangerous stuff all day long

985
00:29:55,038 --> 00:30:01,359
astronauts yeah but we won't

986
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,000
soldiers firefighters but we won't let

987
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,398
people

988
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,159
get paid to be do a challenge trial yeah

989
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:07,519
we're weirdly risk-averse in certain

990
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,159
areas that completely don't make any

991
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:10,079
sense

992
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,320
and this is where the world needs to be

993
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:14,079
we could have said these thousand people

994
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,759
young people who we know are in all

995
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,240
likelihood not going to have a bad

996
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:17,519
outcome

997
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,120
but there's a possibility this is a

998
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,158
possibility but it's very low and it's

999
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,319
certainly lower than

1000
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,520
riding a motorcycle right it's lower

1001
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:24,798
than riding motorcycles people riding

1002
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:26,000
motorcycles everywhere we have ads for

1003
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:26,879
motorcycles

1004
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,398
we could have just said to those

1005
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,440
thousand people we'll give you a million

1006
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:31,918
dollars each

1007
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,960
to do this okay there's your billion

1008
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,640
dollars

1009
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,919
we we're printing trillions of dollars

1010
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
of money to deal with this if we had

1011
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,720
just done

1012
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,000
a thousand people for a million dollars

1013
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,480
each to do a

1014
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,599
challenge trial in march april may when

1015
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,960
they had the mrna vaccines ready

1016
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,319
we could have deployed the vaccines in

1017
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,880
the summer we would have been done with

1018
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,038
this

1019
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,640
it would have been over by now so we get

1020
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,319
to challenge all of that thinking i

1021
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,000
think that's what the great pause did

1022
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,480
it's letting everybody challenge that

1023
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,359
thinking is why do we have that rule

1024
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,480
okay yeah we don't want to have people

1025
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,558
you know like

1026
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,839
give up their organs for money like we

1027
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:07,918
obviously understand but there's a

1028
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,519
reasonable discussion about

1029
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,120
well maybe there's a level of risk in a

1030
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,240
global pandemic i mean we fought the

1031
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,158
nazis

1032
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,240
right we defeated the nazis that took a

1033
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,799
lot of deaths to do that but we had to

1034
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,000
kill that evil this is another evil

1035
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:22,960
which we must

1036
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,398
fight and it's going to result in it's

1037
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,440
already resulting in thousands of people

1038
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:26,558
dying a day but

1039
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,480
we could have actually stopped it

1040
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,079
earlier if we just had a reasonable

1041
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,440
discussion this is why podcasting as i

1042
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,359
respect what you do

1043
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,200
this is why intelligent people are so

1044
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,678
drawn to podcasts because you and i

1045
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,640
can expand on this yes and not cancel

1046
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,640
each other

1047
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,919
over this very suggestion when i make

1048
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,440
this suggestion that are challenge

1049
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,640
trials reasonable or not

1050
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,120
if i were to do that on twitter they'd

1051
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,919
be like oh calacanis wants to

1052
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,798
give poor people corona virus in order

1053
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,919
to save rich people

1054
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,278
yeah no i didn't say that but

1055
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,960
we you and i could have a reasonable

1056
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,000
discussion about a challenge trial is

1057
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,200
something we should consider

1058
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,480
in a acute situation where millions of

1059
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,519
people are going to lose their lives

1060
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,038
right so you know that's an example of

1061
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,679
capitalism and competition working

1062
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:09,839
really well

1063
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,600
there there's one of the to me sad thing

1064
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,439
to see about coronavirus is that for

1065
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:16,558
example testing

1066
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,558
at scale should have it seems obvious

1067
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,720
i i was a little clueless about it but

1068
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:23,599
because i thought there's no way you

1069
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,480
can have like antigen tests at hundreds

1070
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:26,240
of millions

1071
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,759
like order hundreds of millions of them

1072
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,440
and make them cheap but actually

1073
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,359
i realized recently that there have been

1074
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,440
available since about like may

1075
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,119
yeah you were able to in korea in

1076
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,120
finland all over the place

1077
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,158
you could have done mass manufacture so

1078
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,278
there

1079
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,919
there's a little bit of a failure of uh

1080
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,679
of capitalism to step up yeah and i

1081
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,600
don't know if you agree with this but

1082
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,720
it seems that the blame is to be placed

1083
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,439
at the regulators

1084
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,159
yeah and the the the various

1085
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,240
institutions

1086
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,760
crony capitalism and all likelihood is

1087
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,480
what stopped it here in america

1088
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:00,319
i mean i had friends who had imported

1089
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,000
them from other countries

1090
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:03,439
the testing kits and you've probably

1091
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,558
been to parties where people had these

1092
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,519
kind of testing kits from other

1093
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:06,720
countries

1094
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,519
and we're sitting here and they're just

1095
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,519
approving them now really in february

1096
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,720
month 11 of the pandemic in america

1097
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,599
we're going to have testing online

1098
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,399
really

1099
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,879
i mean even if these tests were 80 you

1100
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,759
know

1101
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,760
effective and they're 95 effective mass

1102
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:24,158
producing them we should have sent them

1103
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,319
you know in every postal anybody with a

1104
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,840
post office box should have

1105
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,038
you know with the mailing address should

1106
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,158
have had 10 of them put in their mailing

1107
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:30,960
address just for free from the

1108
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,640
government

1109
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,159
and then everybody would be testing and

1110
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,919
we would have contained it we don't have

1111
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,440
test and trace here in the united states

1112
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,919
all the countries that

1113
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,200
are on the other side of kovid did it by

1114
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,600
having testing

1115
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,399
tracing and closing their borders and

1116
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,719
masks

1117
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,518
that's the combination that works the

1118
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,159
the problem with

1119
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,919
the coronavirus is uh while there's a

1120
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,559
lot of institutions did not behave their

1121
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,399
best

1122
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,319
it's also the case that there's a lot of

1123
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:57,518
uncertainty so i tend to give a little

1124
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,599
bit of a pass

1125
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,558
to everybody involved for the

1126
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,839
uncertainty

1127
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,519
we were all i give them that until june

1128
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,078
i wonder how history will remember this

1129
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,000
whole period i'd love to ask you

1130
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,599
because you were an early investor in

1131
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,719
robin hood and you're sort of

1132
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:18,159
you're in a very nice place

1133
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,000
of uh being a huge supporter of the sort

1134
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,878
of wall street bets

1135
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,800
kind of distributed power of the people

1136
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:28,319
and at the same time

1137
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,720
uh because of you being an investor like

1138
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,639
intellectually giving a chance to robin

1139
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,678
hood in this kind of chaotic time of

1140
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,919
conversations

1141
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,599
to think about like well what did they

1142
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,279
do right what did they do wrong

1143
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,800
yeah so you have a kind of a balanced

1144
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,200
view on the whole thing which is really

1145
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,039
nice

1146
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,638
is there we've talked about what

1147
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,079
robinhood did

1148
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:51,519
right i think can you uh sort of

1149
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,800
steel man uh charmata's argument

1150
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:56,320
of uh what robin hood did wrong in the

1151
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,640
last few days

1152
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,079
yeah i mean there communication is

1153
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,960
always the number one issue with these

1154
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,680
startups right

1155
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,240
and if you you have to get ahead of any

1156
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:06,159
problem

1157
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:08,319
and you have to put all the bad news out

1158
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:10,000
immediately and in the case of robinhood

1159
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,359
it seems based on what you know has been

1160
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,920
in the papers and what robinhood said

1161
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:13,440
publicly

1162
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,200
is that they had this kind of liquidity

1163
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,200
crisis right where

1164
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,719
they were being uh because of these

1165
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,159
exchanges telling them you have to put

1166
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,239
up this amount of money in collateral

1167
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,598
and them being pinned at number one

1168
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,239
in the app store there were so many

1169
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,559
people trying to buy five shares of this

1170
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:30,399
stock five shares of this meme stock

1171
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,920
that it kind of broke their system and

1172
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,240
then the people who clear the trades for

1173
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,680
them

1174
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:35,598
they said you got to put up a billion

1175
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:36,799
dollars 2 billion 3 billion so you can't

1176
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,440
do that overnight

1177
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,960
and i think that they were an

1178
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,200
uncomfortable situation of

1179
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,480
like going on tv and saying uh we have a

1180
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:46,480
liquidity crisis

1181
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,079
like that could be like a run on the

1182
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,639
bank everybody then logs in at the same

1183
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,079
time to

1184
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:51,118
robinhood and tries to sell every share

1185
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,240
they own because they're afraid that the

1186
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,838
whole thing's going to collapse right so

1187
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,239
i think there was this kind of like

1188
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:58,078
black swan event and they probably

1189
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:59,598
didn't communicate it all that well

1190
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,960
at the center of that this is this is

1191
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,200
really interesting maybe you can comment

1192
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,720
on the nature of communication

1193
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,279
uh vlad the ceo yeah the guy you met at

1194
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:09,439
the bar

1195
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,560
yeah i think at the center of the

1196
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,960
communication right yep

1197
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,400
so elon is an example of a guy who also

1198
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,320
is at the center of the communication

1199
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,160
for his particular set of companies

1200
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,079
and that you know on twitter seems to be

1201
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:22,000
a really powerful way to communicate

1202
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,320
yeah and there was something this is me

1203
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,440
saying it yeah there was something about

1204
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,559
vlad that sounded like he's

1205
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,440
hiding stuff that yeah as opposed to

1206
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,759
elon it doesn't sound like he's hiding

1207
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,400
stuff it could be the nature the the

1208
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,079
the beat the timing of the conversation

1209
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,079
same thing with mark zuckerberg he

1210
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,000
mark zuckerberg for some reason often

1211
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,240
sounds like he's hiding something yeah

1212
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,199
and then there's like jack dorsey is

1213
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:49,199
much less so

1214
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,719
yeah and i don't know what that is about

1215
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,199
the ceos it makes you

1216
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,239
trust them and not it might be the perm

1217
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,439
point in time

1218
00:36:54,239 --> 00:37:00,639
um like in terms of escape velocity uh

1219
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,320
you know there might be non-disclosures

1220
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,679
in place that we're not aware of

1221
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,440
where they're not allowed to talk about

1222
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,759
certain relationships i see and

1223
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,838
and and that results like in vladimir in

1224
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,560
this case and that results in you being

1225
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,519
like

1226
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:14,799
acting weird or nervous or nervous yeah

1227
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,599
it could just be the person is nervous

1228
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,519
you know so

1229
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,039
it's it's really hard to be building one

1230
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,759
of these companies and you're at scale

1231
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,639
and

1232
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,079
you know oh my lord the entire thing's

1233
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,519
coming apart and you're the most hated

1234
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,880
person for that day you know how the

1235
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,079
rage cycle works and the

1236
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,599
the media is just so crazy when they

1237
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,039
get their hooks into something i saw it

1238
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,599
happen with uber we saw it happen with

1239
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:35,199
facebook

1240
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,720
and even tesla you know there were times

1241
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,399
when auto

1242
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,078
people did stupid things with autopilot

1243
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,119
and it's like yeah okay somebody's

1244
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,119
watching a movie

1245
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,880
and sleeping in their car yeah or

1246
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,160
leaving the driver's seat against all

1247
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,760
the rules of autopilot

1248
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:49,598
and somehow tesla's responsible for that

1249
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,119
it's like we have people who stand on

1250
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,119
top of their motorcycles and drive down

1251
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,680
the road on a motorcycle

1252
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,039
and we don't blame yamaha for or harley

1253
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,399
davidson for some idiot

1254
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,838
standing on the seat of their motorcycle

1255
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,320
on a highway going 60 miles an hour we

1256
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:02,400
just say

1257
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,000
that person is an idiot but when new

1258
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,320
technology comes out

1259
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,280
we blame the technology not the person

1260
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,880
operating it

1261
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,040
yeah and if you are going to operate

1262
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,400
uh we basically vilify and demonize i

1263
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:15,358
think that that is part of it like when

1264
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,440
the person at

1265
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,519
i remember airbnb we always thought what

1266
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,960
if somebody trashes your apartment

1267
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:22,880
and then sure enough a bunch of meth

1268
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,320
heads rented this poor woman's apartment

1269
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,960
she left all of her stuff in it and then

1270
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,800
a bunch of meth heads had a drug party

1271
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,119
destroyed her apartment ripped up all

1272
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,320
her photos and went crazy

1273
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,000
and we knew that day would happen but

1274
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,039
nobody remembers it now but it was the

1275
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,199
number one story on

1276
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,400
every news channel because wow that's an

1277
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:40,799
exciting story

1278
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,519
and i just thought to myself i wonder if

1279
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,920
there are

1280
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,199
any parties in hotel rooms where the

1281
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,480
hotel room is being trashed and people

1282
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,480
are doing drugs and

1283
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,480
and crazy things like yes that's

1284
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,480
basically every hotel in los angeles

1285
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,480
right now is being destroyed by some

1286
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,039
rock band that's throwing a tv out the

1287
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,000
window

1288
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,119
like we expected in uh you know a hotel

1289
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,639
we just didn't expect it in somebody's

1290
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,720
house with airbnb and then airbnb

1291
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,319
created rules around you can't rent an

1292
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,239
airbnb for a party

1293
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,599
uh and they learn so i think there's a

1294
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,039
learning curve with these companies and

1295
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,760
they do get to scale

1296
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,159
at a level that is unprecedented it used

1297
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,599
to take

1298
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,519
decades for a company to become an

1299
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,200
international phenomenon now it happens

1300
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,880
in two three four years

1301
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,358
i mean look at clubhouse this thing went

1302
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,960
from being you know a private beta six

1303
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,078
months ago to being the number one app

1304
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,800
in germany

1305
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,760
and in japan and here like just like

1306
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,000
that boom

1307
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,119
and it's because there's an ecosystem

1308
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,320
that has never existed

1309
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,119
the app store then there's uh payments

1310
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,720
online

1311
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,720
everybody and then everybody has a super

1312
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:41,118
computer in their pocket when we

1313
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,519
the thing people got wrong about

1314
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,960
entrepreneurship technology

1315
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,119
uh and business you know over the last

1316
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,920
couple decades was just how big the

1317
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,559
market was

1318
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,358
and then how quickly you could um you

1319
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:55,279
know

1320
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:57,279
achieve relevancy in these markets

1321
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,720
we thought the market was like the 60

1322
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,079
million homes would broadband

1323
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,759
and originally it was like maybe 10 or

1324
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,280
20. then it became 60 million

1325
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,640
then i was like okay well how many how

1326
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,760
many hours are you at your desktop

1327
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:07,440
computer well like probably at our

1328
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,480
computers for five hours a day ten hours

1329
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,559
a day at work

1330
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,000
three hours a day on our own and then i

1331
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,279
was like yeah nobody's on their desktop

1332
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,679
computer everybody's on their mobile

1333
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,040
phone

1334
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:16,318
and oh and by the way they have it with

1335
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,440
them so the people with mobile phones

1336
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,079
are now using

1337
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,760
this high-speed device with an app store

1338
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,599
with their credit card in it yeah

1339
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,960
in the early days of the internet people

1340
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,079
were scared to put their credit card on

1341
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,440
the internet that was considered a

1342
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,440
really dumb thing to do if you put your

1343
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,559
credit card on the internet you're gonna

1344
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,880
lose all your money they're gonna

1345
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:35,279
they're gonna hack you or whatever and

1346
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,119
now it's just amazing to me how quickly

1347
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,640
when a company hits

1348
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,119
how quickly it can get to a million

1349
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,000
subscribers or 10 million or a billion

1350
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,200
users right

1351
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,519
and there's all these networks like

1352
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:48,480
social networks that allow the spread

1353
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,519
of uh the viral spread of like a new

1354
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,480
startup a new

1355
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,800
company uh a new app to be announced i

1356
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,039
mean

1357
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,720
anything was an idea a podcast right

1358
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:58,000
like i mean single thinking just as a

1359
00:40:56,719 --> 00:40:59,759
single meme could change the world

1360
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,358
speaking of clubhouse i mean yeah i just

1361
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,160
wanna we're saying so many interesting

1362
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,920
things but

1363
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,719
there there was a magical moment with

1364
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,440
vlad and elon on clubhouse

1365
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:10,480
yes is there do you have thoughts about

1366
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,400
that

1367
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,318
interaction uh which felt like

1368
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,838
so many uh aspects of this whole

1369
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:20,880
situation feels like

1370
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,440
totally novel surreal like it's defining

1371
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,760
world

1372
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,800
era like it is yes like a billionaire

1373
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,560
the richest

1374
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,280
human on earth is interviewing uh

1375
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,679
the person at the center of one of the

1376
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,359
most

1377
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:38,399
interesting mass scale like uh

1378
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:41,199
power battles in finance ever

1379
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,639
you know perhaps by the way seven movies

1380
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,639
have been sold

1381
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,078
and two weeks just think about how fast

1382
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,799
things are moving

1383
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,480
this thing happens yeah like people had

1384
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,280
the idea to short the stock six months

1385
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,639
ago

1386
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,119
they start doing their research they

1387
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,920
build an army they execute the trade

1388
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,358
the system goes down robin hood raises

1389
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,400
three and a half billion dollars in four

1390
00:41:59,358 --> 00:42:02,559
days

1391
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,920
elon is interviewing them on clubhouse

1392
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:05,519
on sunday after the wednesday it

1393
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,519
happened and now here we are

1394
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:12,239
it's ten days later yeah doesn't it feel

1395
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,199
like it's been 10 months yeah it's been

1396
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,118
10 days lex

1397
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,239
it's been 10 days 10 years there's like

1398
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,358
a new president

1399
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,358
all these things that and everyone

1400
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,639
forgot like it was an insurrection

1401
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:22,400
by the way we also almost had a

1402
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:26,159
revolution at the capitol where

1403
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,480
a bunch of crazy people who have guns

1404
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,879
and body armor and then a bunch of them

1405
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,280
who are just yoloing in cosplay

1406
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,200
yeah took over the capitol well so and

1407
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,560
the other more dramatic thing to me is

1408
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:38,159
that was one month ago that was one

1409
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:39,920
month and the pres the president of the

1410
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:43,358
united states got banned

1411
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:46,400
from every major social network and uh

1412
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:47,039
which i think i'm still uh deeply

1413
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,920
troubled by

1414
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,599
is parlor being removed from aws that

1415
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,760
changed the way

1416
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,240
i that changed a lot of things as

1417
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,160
somebody who's an aspiring entrepreneur

1418
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,679
that changed the way i see the world

1419
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:01,519
that little maybe i'm

1420
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,679
being overdramatic but no you're not i

1421
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:05,519
think you're paranoid for a reason

1422
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,440
you're paranoid for a very good reason

1423
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,719
which is as big as these companies can

1424
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,119
become

1425
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,159
they are beholden to the mob and if the

1426
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,640
mob says

1427
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:16,639
hey this person needs to be canceled

1428
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,400
they're going to get cancelled because

1429
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:19,920
you can't lose your entire audience you

1430
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,599
could lose your whole customer base and

1431
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,760
you can lose all your employees

1432
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,000
i think what's interesting about your

1433
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,839
fear about parlor and aws taking off is

1434
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,480
we went from being like a social network

1435
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:30,799
which is

1436
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,119
you know the software layer and then we

1437
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,440
went to like the infrastructure layer

1438
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,519
you know and they'll even go after like

1439
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,159
cloudflare which is a cdn provider right

1440
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,599
they're just like

1441
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:41,519
a plumbing you know it's like sort of

1442
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,838
like the telephone

1443
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,639
so we're basically holding everybody

1444
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:45,920
responsible

1445
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,318
on the whole chain of events here what

1446
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,079
that's going to do is you know

1447
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,358
i'm not a huge believer in crypto but

1448
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,079
distributed computing

1449
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,119
um where nobody and decentralized and

1450
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,760
distributed

1451
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,680
computing platforms um and open

1452
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,359
standards podcasting's an open standard

1453
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,199
the web is an open standard ftp was an

1454
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:07,000
open standard but twitter

1455
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:10,078
and you know facebook are closed

1456
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,079
captioning not

1457
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,318
where everybody available and i invested

1458
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,439
in a company that tried to do this and

1459
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:29,119
um got sold and it didn't work out but

1460
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,039
take your hard drive on your computer at

1461
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,880
home you give

1462
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,318
you know a terabyte of your 10 terabyte

1463
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,358
drive over to the cloud

1464
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:36,559
and then everybody else does their

1465
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:38,159
terabyte and then all of a sudden you've

1466
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,679
got this virtual cloud

1467
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,199
and anybody can store stuff on it and

1468
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:41,759
it's all encrypted and then nobody can

1469
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:43,039
stop it

1470
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,280
and that could be tweets it could be

1471
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,279
videos and so this idea that

1472
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,040
you know youtube will be able to tell

1473
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,720
people to kick people off because

1474
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:52,480
they're skeptics of

1475
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,759
i don't know the pandemic or the vaccine

1476
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,838
or they've

1477
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,359
you know uh they'll make things that are

1478
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:58,880
more censorship resistant i think

1479
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:00,799
that'll be the reaction to all of this

1480
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,318
what this is my question for you going

1481
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,599
back to that crappy bar and people

1482
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,400
pitching you

1483
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,760
is is there do you like with clubhouse

1484
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,760
do you see

1485
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,119
competitors do you think it's possible

1486
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,520
that another

1487
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,200
perhaps more decentralized or another

1488
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:17,679
kind of social media will emerge

1489
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:19,199
that will take on twitter and facebook

1490
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,440
it might be able to replace something

1491
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,519
if you look at the whole landscape yeah

1492
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,480
uh with clubhouse and everything else do

1493
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:26,639
you think

1494
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,480
some other company might emerge there'll

1495
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:29,679
be ten versions of clubhouse we looked

1496
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,559
at social networking we thought

1497
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:32,879
friendster

1498
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,000
was it like friendster was so good

1499
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,119
nobody be able to compete with that it

1500
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,880
was growing so quickly

1501
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,800
and then myspace was a juggernaut and

1502
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,000
they hit 100 million in revenue and 100

1503
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,839
million users and it was like well

1504
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,400
that's game over and then facebook

1505
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:44,880
and linkedin and snapchat and friend

1506
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,800
feed

1507
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,480
and countless others you know so there's

1508
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,519
usually 20 people

1509
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,358
who will win in a category and

1510
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:54,960
80 of the category will be owned by the

1511
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:56,960
top two or three players

1512
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,559
but will those players change do you

1513
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,280
think what's your sense oh yeah for sure

1514
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:01,358
i mean if we

1515
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,880
if facebook hadn't bought instagram it

1516
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:04,159
would be a company in decline right now

1517
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,838
people would be shorting the stock right

1518
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:08,239
facebook peaked and then was sort of

1519
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:09,759
heading down um and instagram saved them

1520
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:11,358
and whatsapp saved them so

1521
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,040
you know that's another kind of weird

1522
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:14,559
moment in history that they were able to

1523
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:15,679
accumulate that much power

1524
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,119
and consolidate that much power

1525
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:18,159
instagram should have never sold to them

1526
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:20,079
that should have gone public they had

1527
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,078
just raised money from sequoia

1528
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,119
and they had raised 50 million dollars

1529
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,720
at a 500 million

1530
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,880
valuation and they didn't need to sell

1531
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:27,919
and that was a big mistake to sell

1532
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,838
they should have kept going and they

1533
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,358
should have take took on facebook and if

1534
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:32,000
instagram was a standalone company right

1535
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:34,480
now it'd be worth

1536
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,519
500 million do you think 500 billion

1537
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,920
yeah do you think

1538
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,599
uh facebook might buy clubhouse has been

1539
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,639
uh oh they'll probably copy it

1540
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,920
i mean zuckerberg has no moral compass

1541
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:45,118
or ethics or anything i mean he's a

1542
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,920
marauder i mean

1543
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,920
he basically copied snapchat seven times

1544
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,440
yeah like he did poke and he just kept

1545
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,280
trying and trying and trying

1546
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,720
part of the reason why the whatsapp

1547
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,040
founders and the instagram founders left

1548
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,759
is they found zuckerberg so distasteful

1549
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,559
in terms of his ability to copy what do

1550
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,640
you think makes

1551
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:05,199
a great leader in that sense because

1552
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:07,358
okay so when i look at zuckerberg

1553
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,039
he's a great executor is he a great

1554
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:10,000
actor i don't think he's a great leader

1555
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:11,920
i was bullish on

1556
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,280
i was excited about facebook in the very

1557
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,720
early days uh

1558
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,240
i thought it was an exciting opportunity

1559
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:17,039
to connect people and stuff started

1560
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:20,479
going wrong

1561
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,119
in certain kinds of ways and again maybe

1562
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,358
it's

1563
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,200
our human nature but i attribute a lot

1564
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,279
of that to the leadership

1565
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:29,838
absolutely and i mean the guy started it

1566
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,359
because he was unable to ask girls if

1567
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:32,480
they were single and on a date i mean

1568
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:34,159
that was this excuse to be a good

1569
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,960
motivator that could be a good i mean it

1570
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,598
does i mean

1571
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,079
the motivation of 18 19 year old manners

1572
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,640
yeah

1573
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,680
pretty clear um he was just trying he

1574
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:44,078
had no game

1575
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:44,960
he had no game and he needed to know who

1576
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,359
was single so

1577
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,000
he could you know at least have a shot

1578
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:50,000
at getting

1579
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,559
creepy hello creepy yeah you know he he

1580
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,639
i think was so obsessed with

1581
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,920
engagement and winning and he's he's

1582
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:57,199
kind of like one of those friends you

1583
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,000
have who's just really good at playing a

1584
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:59,358
video game

1585
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,599
but maybe doesn't see the bigger picture

1586
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,119
in life and um i mean there's a reason

1587
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,640
why everybody who worked for him hates

1588
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,318
him and doesn't talk to him anymore and

1589
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:08,639
then actively derides them like

1590
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,679
so many this the people who sold

1591
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,558
whatsapp

1592
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,318
to him then backed other projects like

1593
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,280
telegram and said horrible things about

1594
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:16,558
him on the way out these are the people

1595
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,079
he made billionaires

1596
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,599
um and they really don't like him uh so

1597
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,200
i think there is something that he does

1598
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,440
that does not breed loyalty

1599
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:27,279
but he's very successful in his focus

1600
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,000
which is growth is all that matters he's

1601
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,240
a marauder

1602
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,199
and taking friction out of products and

1603
00:48:30,239 --> 00:48:32,719
processes

1604
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,879
is the playbook of silicon valley for

1605
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,318
the last decade or two so whatever the

1606
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,920
friction poetry what you're saying right

1607
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:39,039
outside you're speaking so fast that i

1608
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,599
almost forget that you're

1609
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,480
you're dropping bombs but so removing

1610
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,160
the

1611
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,679
removing friction and you're saying

1612
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:46,799
facebook is exceptionally good he was

1613
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:49,358
the best at it

1614
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,559
i mean at uber they were like we're

1615
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:52,400
going to take out tipping

1616
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,000
we're going to take out the need for you

1617
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,440
to take out your credit card and do

1618
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,159
payment it's just going to be in your

1619
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,880
wallet

1620
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,078
you got picked up you leave that's it

1621
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,119
and i was like we should have tipping

1622
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,480
and they're like

1623
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,720
it adds a step and we're trying to have

1624
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,800
no steps you put your address in

1625
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,719
you click the button and you do nothing

1626
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,880
else and so we've been obsessed here in

1627
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:11,919
silicon valley is how many clicks can we

1628
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,599
take out of the process

1629
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,280
i guess amazon is incredible at that as

1630
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,160
well absolutely one click was the start

1631
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,839
of it and

1632
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:19,679
then you look at clubhouse as an example

1633
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:21,358
you open clubhouse and you see rooms

1634
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:22,799
you click on it you're listening so in

1635
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,799
one click you're listening

1636
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,839
and then in one click if you raise your

1637
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,079
hand you get invited

1638
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:31,119
and you say yes you're speaking so it's

1639
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,559
two clicks to speak one click to listen

1640
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:35,280
i mean the only way they could make that

1641
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:37,119
app work even faster is if you opened it

1642
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,760
up and your microphone was turned on

1643
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,760
and you which is yeah that's kind of

1644
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,760
scary but that is the next evolution

1645
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,839
and what happens when you go that fast

1646
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,599
is you get unintended consequences

1647
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:48,880
and so one this is why facebook has had

1648
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,318
more fines than any company in the

1649
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,079
history of silicon valley just giant

1650
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:53,838
fines for doing stuff like this

1651
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,359
and one of them was i don't know if you

1652
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,119
remember when they created groups or if

1653
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:58,480
you have a group for your podcast

1654
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,200
but you know you can just add people to

1655
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,559
a group without their permission

1656
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:04,719
and there was this famous case when they

1657
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,599
first came out with it um

1658
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:09,519
somebody created a nambla fake group

1659
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,240
national man love boy association or

1660
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:12,400
whatever like

1661
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:14,399
pedophilia association and they added

1662
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,280
zuckerberg mike arrington myself and

1663
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,280
like 20 other

1664
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,480
famous people in silicon valley and i

1665
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,440
was like and then somebody takes a

1666
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,079
screenshot of it and they're like you're

1667
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,519
right

1668
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:25,119
and i'm like no facebook last year and

1669
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,239
then zuckerberg's response was well if

1670
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,599
your friends put you in that

1671
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:29,519
namla group you should get new friends

1672
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:33,280
and it was like you got put in there too

1673
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:35,039
yeah and then the sad part about it was

1674
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,480
there were a group of young men who were

1675
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:37,920
gay and who were in college

1676
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,519
and there was a gay choir in their

1677
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,318
college and the person who was

1678
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:42,719
coordinating

1679
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:44,000
their facebook group added them yeah so

1680
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:45,279
zuckerberg it wasn't enough for

1681
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,719
zuckerberg to

1682
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,519
make it so anybody could add anybody to

1683
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,879
any group because it will grow faster

1684
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:52,880
let alone you have to confirm you want

1685
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,640
to be added to the group what it also

1686
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,039
did was posted it on their walls to

1687
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,078
increase

1688
00:50:55,039 --> 00:51:00,239
engagement and what they inadvertently

1689
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,960
did was they outed a bunch of 18 19 year

1690
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,479
olds in college to their families

1691
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,480
because they joined the gay men's choir

1692
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,480
at some college

1693
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,240
and this is the kind of way you know

1694
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,400
this is where silicon valley needs to

1695
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,959
check itself and to do better

1696
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,720
is you have to really think well there

1697
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,760
is my incentive to grow faster

1698
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:19,279
and then there's what's right for

1699
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,640
society and for the individual you got

1700
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,960
to think it through

1701
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:23,679
think it through it's sometimes very

1702
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,760
difficult

1703
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:26,799
this is where vision is required to

1704
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,359
anticipate the

1705
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,318
uh unintended consequences and let's see

1706
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:32,318
it seems like

1707
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:34,800
mark zuckerberg is not very good at that

1708
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:37,039
i you've talked to

1709
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,000
so many great leaders in this world

1710
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:41,440
privately and

1711
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,280
and publicly what do you think makes

1712
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,200
a great leader of these tech companies

1713
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,760
is uh do you have an exam like

1714
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:49,439
is elon to you a great leader he's also

1715
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,200
a controversial one right there's

1716
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,679
yeah there's a love and hate

1717
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:55,919
controversial in the sense that there is

1718
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:56,960
and i know a lot of people work with him

1719
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,358
for him

1720
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,159
that there's also a love hate uh

1721
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:01,598
relationship

1722
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,480
the the hate comes from the fact that

1723
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:06,640
they get pushed extremely hard

1724
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,480
it's a it's a very competitive

1725
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:11,358
environment but

1726
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,800
it's a positive one because it's on

1727
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:14,880
there's a vision that's underlying it's

1728
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,599
similar to the steve jobs thing

1729
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,000
and it has to do with the back to our

1730
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,160
michael

1731
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,199
jordan discussion as well that there

1732
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,159
seems to be this

1733
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,598
the demons involved in tension and just

1734
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:27,920
and yeah

1735
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,440
anxiety all those kinds of things if you

1736
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,960
want to do great things

1737
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,800
um there will be some suffering and

1738
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,880
you know there'll be some pain and it's

1739
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,160
not easy if you want to change the world

1740
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,119
and then some people have this

1741
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:43,519
expectation that it's going to be easy

1742
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,480
and what you'll typically find for any

1743
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:46,000
great leader

1744
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,480
who's trying to do something super

1745
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
ambitious like if you want to be like

1746
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,280
if you're a rich guy and you start like

1747
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,318
a restaurant and you don't care about

1748
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,000
making money and

1749
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:55,358
people have made restaurants before like

1750
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,800
you could be high fives and everybody

1751
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:58,719
could love you or whatever

1752
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,680
but if you want to change the world you

1753
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,358
want to do something hard driving

1754
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,078
there's going to be sacrifice involved

1755
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:05,279
and so the problem is people are looking

1756
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,318
at something

1757
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,200
that is an olympic caliber sport or

1758
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:12,480
a navy seals like effort in other words

1759
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:14,318
an effort that requires

1760
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,838
massive sacrifice we would not look at

1761
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,400
somebody who wins a gold medal

1762
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,239
like michael phelps and say oh my god he

1763
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,000
had to get up at 4 a.m every day and he

1764
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,318
had to swim and he had to do an ice bath

1765
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,760
yeah oh my god that poor guy he suffered

1766
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:27,838
he was tortured he

1767
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,040
people were super mean to him they put

1768
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,119
him in an ice bath it was like

1769
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,719
no he wanted to be the greatest swimmer

1770
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,079
of all time and he knew what the

1771
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:36,239
sacrifice entailed

1772
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,119
and then what happens in work in

1773
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,000
business

1774
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:41,838
is that people conflate like oh well i

1775
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,119
went to work to make a living to pay my

1776
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:45,920
bills

1777
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,519
versus michael phelps approach to

1778
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,599
getting gold medals

1779
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,280
or michael jordan or pick the person

1780
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,720
elon or jeff bezos and when you look at

1781
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,280
the reviews of like a place like

1782
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:57,118
amazon there was this incredible story

1783
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,640
in the new york times where people were

1784
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,160
i don't know if you remember it

1785
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:01,838
this is the worst place you could ever

1786
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:04,078
work amazon and they

1787
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:06,078
we talked to 200 people and they all

1788
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,039
told us they all described for us in the

1789
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,079
new york times

1790
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:12,159
a culture of cutthroatness and brutality

1791
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,440
that has never before been seen and then

1792
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:15,358
you see all these people who work for

1793
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,318
bezos for 24 years from when they

1794
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:18,318
graduated

1795
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:19,920
with their mbas until today yeah and

1796
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:23,599
they've never left the company

1797
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:26,800
and they are ride or die forever

1798
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,160
and what you're seeing there is there's

1799
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,400
a mismatch of

1800
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:31,598
people going to work in an extreme pla

1801
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,680
sport

1802
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,280
or an extreme endeavor who should not do

1803
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,519
that there are people

1804
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,040
yes who should go out into the rice

1805
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:40,798
fields and pick rice yeah

1806
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,400
and then there's another group of people

1807
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:45,679
who are samurai

1808
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:48,559
and who wield a sword and who take on

1809
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,078
missions that are dangerous but if

1810
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,640
you're a rice picker and that's what you

1811
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,880
do

1812
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:54,400
and you feel safe just you know getting

1813
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,000
a couple grains of rice put them in a

1814
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,920
basket cleaning it and then you know

1815
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,760
whatever that that's valid work

1816
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,159
no big deal i'm not deriding it i'm sort

1817
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,839
of but that is one group

1818
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:05,920
and then there's people who are samurai

1819
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:08,000
and you can you cannot conflate the two

1820
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,159
you cannot compare the two

1821
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,280
and that's what is happening right now

1822
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:12,239
in business whenever you see these

1823
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,079
stories about

1824
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:15,679
this person at this company is like a

1825
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,119
tyrant and they're so horrible and they

1826
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,598
yelled at somebody

1827
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,599
like if you're in the field and you're

1828
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,559
taking the beach at normandy and it's

1829
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,920
d-day or

1830
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,079
you know you got to take the hill or you

1831
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,838
got to whack osama bin laden and you're

1832
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,920
the navy seals and like a rudder

1833
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:31,279
a rotor gets knocked off the back of the

1834
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,760
blackhawk

1835
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,040
like this is serious [ __ ] like don't do

1836
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,960
it if you're not serious

1837
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,400
yeah and if you're not serious about

1838
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,358
changing the world why would you go work

1839
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,798
for bezos

1840
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:43,519
why would you go work for elon musk

1841
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:46,079
don't do it don't go work there

1842
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:47,039
this is this is uh let me just sit back

1843
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,760
and enjoy

1844
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:51,119
the beauty of uh i mean it's all of that

1845
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,280
that's music to my ears but

1846
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,240
i'm not sure what to do with it because

1847
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,880
ah

1848
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,318
it com it's conflicting to a lot of

1849
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,079
things i hear from

1850
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:01,358
the way you're supposed to kind of act

1851
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,839
in uh

1852
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,880
i think in order to do great things you

1853
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,679
have to

1854
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,039
i always admired people that lose their

1855
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,078
[ __ ] a little bit because they're so

1856
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:12,558
passionate

1857
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,318
yeah and and like you know you know and

1858
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,760
apologize and all those kinds of things

1859
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,639
but like there's a tension

1860
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:21,200
there's a drama to the creative process

1861
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:24,159
when especially in the early startup

1862
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,519
you know you're not this is not like the

1863
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:27,598
work-life balance

1864
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,599
idea it doesn't even apply work-life

1865
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,680
balance it's ridiculous

1866
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,200
a ridiculous concept like the idea that

1867
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,719
there's like work-life balance

1868
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:36,558
in a startup is ridiculous if you're

1869
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:38,558
looking for work-life balance

1870
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,599
do not go to a startup or any kind of

1871
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,680
ambitious company

1872
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,720
there is a series of places you can work

1873
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,159
in the world

1874
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:47,759
yes where you do not need to do

1875
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:49,920
anything more than what's put in front

1876
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,319
of you and you just

1877
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,760
put the round peg in the round hole in

1878
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:56,318
the square peg in the square hole

1879
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,280
pole and you go home and you get your

1880
00:56:56,318 --> 00:57:00,000
like you know

1881
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,280
you get your little you know bits and

1882
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,559
grains of rice and

1883
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,798
you go heat them up and eat them that's

1884
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,839
it there's this other thing which is the

1885
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:08,960
extreme pursuit

1886
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:11,519
of changing the world and sacrificing

1887
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,880
and we have a generation of people multi

1888
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:15,759
generations of people

1889
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,280
who are soft they're just soft i mean

1890
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,440
what is the big struggle we've had to

1891
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,440
deal with in america in our lifetimes

1892
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,960
like 9 11 and we didn't have the vietnam

1893
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,760
war and then we had this like weird iraq

1894
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,079
wars and

1895
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,359
middle east wars that were kind of like

1896
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,400
a small number of people went and we

1897
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:31,838
sent drones like

1898
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:33,280
we have not had to sacrifice gen xers

1899
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:35,599
you know maybe the talented boomers

1900
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,798
experienced the vietnam war regrettably

1901
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,798
but you know we've had a couple of

1902
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:40,719
generations now three i guess

1903
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:42,639
that just haven't had to suffer yeah and

1904
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,318
so we're soft as americans we're soft

1905
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:45,440
and then you look at people in china

1906
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:47,599
and we're like oh my god these poor

1907
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,039
chinese people are living in these tiny

1908
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,920
cramped apartments like

1909
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,639
they were living in like essentially

1910
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,079
lean to's

1911
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:57,759
in northern china with no running water

1912
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,280
or like one spigot of ice cold water for

1913
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,799
the entire village like

1914
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,798
they're thrilled to be joining the

1915
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:04,400
middle class even if it's the bottom of

1916
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:05,759
the middle class right

1917
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,119
they've taken hundreds of millions of

1918
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,559
people in china and moved them into the

1919
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,838
middle class

1920
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,280
and we're like oh my god these people

1921
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:12,719
are suffering it's like you know they're

1922
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,480
up to four dollars an hour three or four

1923
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:17,118
dollars an hour in the factories there

1924
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,920
and they were just two decades ago at

1925
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,400
you know

1926
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,559
i don't know it was probably 50 cents an

1927
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,480
hour something crazy like that

1928
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,240
and now they've improved the quality of

1929
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,000
life there so much

1930
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:30,000
just like america did 200 years ago or

1931
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,119
100 years ago they've improved it so

1932
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,719
much in china

1933
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,480
that now they're getting out price for

1934
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:37,519
factories from vietnam

1935
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,000
sri lanka pakistan india and people are

1936
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:39,440
moving

1937
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,440
and people in china are moving the

1938
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,480
factories out of china into other

1939
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,079
countries

1940
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,079
yeah because the chinese are now

1941
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:48,000
outsourcing to vietnam

1942
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,839
and other countries so this is the way

1943
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,280
of the world you know people move up and

1944
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:52,798
they get a better lot in life for their

1945
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,359
families and just in america we've

1946
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:57,920
gotten soft and there's a generation

1947
00:58:55,358 --> 00:59:00,000
how do people die in america now suicide

1948
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,480
obesity

1949
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,079
heart attacks anxiety i mean we're

1950
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,838
suffering from things

1951
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:07,440
that if you told people 100 years ago

1952
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:09,279
that the number

1953
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,039
the top ways americans would die would

1954
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,599
be overeating

1955
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:14,880
and suicide they'd be like what you're

1956
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,000
literally killing yourself or eating

1957
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,960
yourself to death that's what's

1958
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,920
happening in america

1959
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,280
and and when everybody not everybody uh

1960
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,599
unmasked there's a large number of

1961
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,440
people who become softer and softer

1962
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,599
uh capitalism creates an environment

1963
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,519
where there is people that still step up

1964
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,440
amidst that with a big dream and

1965
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,199
challenge the conventions

1966
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,280
that human spirit just to rise above

1967
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:36,798
that as elon's example that uh jeff

1968
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,240
based as an example

1969
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:43,199
countless examples and and they push

1970
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:45,118
you know the limits of those of human

1971
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:48,078
beings that are willing to step up

1972
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,559
and you know i i you know i think about

1973
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,680
sort of

1974
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:54,559
how to create a company that uh that

1975
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:56,000
emits all of the softness yeah still

1976
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,480
creates a revolution

1977
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,199
it's not it doesn't seem trivial it

1978
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,559
seems like

1979
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:05,919
how do you build a culture that's once

1980
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:07,760
healthy but also

1981
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,960
unhealthy in the way that it's all the

1982
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,599
olympic pursuit is

1983
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,880
it's all top down everybody just you

1984
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:14,480
asked earlier what leadership was and i

1985
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,838
never answered the question i think

1986
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,599
you know what leaders do is they set the

1987
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:19,440
example they set the bar

1988
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,920
and if you look at someone like elon you

1989
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:25,039
know we're personal friends for 20 years

1990
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,000
um and he is into fatigable like i mean

1991
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:28,880
the guy

1992
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,880
has a stamina that is just phenomenal

1993
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,240
like he does not get tired he works

1994
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,960
relentlessly

1995
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:35,919
and he sets that standard for the rest

1996
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,400
of the team

1997
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,079
and and i i think you know bezos is very

1998
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,559
sharp and likes to debate stuff and is

1999
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,680
very con

2000
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:44,319
you know and jobs was just incredible at

2001
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:46,000
design

2002
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:48,798
and figuring out how to bridge that gap

2003
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,039
so they just leaders set the standard

2004
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,559
they set the standard and you know that

2005
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:53,679
your time is over as a leader when you

2006
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,720
can't set the standard

2007
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:57,039
and that's when you have to pass the

2008
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:58,719
baton right and bezos did that brilliant

2009
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,079
and bezos now is saying you know what

2010
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,558
i'm 57

2011
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:03,920
i'm the richest guy on the planet uh

2012
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,760
depending on the week

2013
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,838
and uh i would like to do some other

2014
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,079
challenges but i don't want to grind it

2015
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:11,599
out at amazon for another 25 years

2016
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,839
i want to do other things and so he

2017
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:15,200
passed the baton and that's the healthy

2018
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:17,119
thing to do in that regard

2019
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:18,719
i do think there is a time period in

2020
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,920
which you can run that hot

2021
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,759
and then at a certain point you have to

2022
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,480
then change just like an athlete

2023
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,520
might go to be a coach right and you or

2024
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,480
a commentator

2025
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:29,280
and so you know being an entrepreneur is

2026
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,358
brutal

2027
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,798
it's you know seven days a week 12 hours

2028
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,480
a day anybody who says anything

2029
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:36,400
differently is kidding themselves

2030
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,159
you're going to have to sacrifice if you

2031
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,880
and this competition

2032
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:41,279
and america has to fight if america does

2033
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,599
not

2034
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:47,760
win capitalism and china does it is

2035
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,680
literally the end of the human species

2036
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,839
it's it's over for humanity

2037
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:53,358
right now everything has been going

2038
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:55,119
really well in terms of the number of

2039
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:58,239
people living in poverty is

2040
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,119
plummeting a life uh you know lifespans

2041
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,679
have been rising

2042
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,798
science is booming the economy is

2043
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:03,679
booming all these things are incredible

2044
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:05,199
the one thing

2045
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,038
that's kind of stagnant right now is the

2046
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:08,000
number of people living in democracy

2047
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,160
versus

2048
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,519
under authoritarian rule it's flat so

2049
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,879
when you look at all steve pinker's

2050
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,159
charts and he's really excited

2051
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,838
yeah there's one you're going to see

2052
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,399
that's flat and i think we peaked with

2053
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:20,239
53 or 54 percent of people

2054
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,318
on the planet earth being in a democracy

2055
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:24,318
and now it's going below 50.

2056
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:25,920
and it's because some of the democratic

2057
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:27,519
you know western countries

2058
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,079
don't have the population growth of some

2059
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:32,079
of the communist and socialist countries

2060
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,440
uh in authoritarian countries and we

2061
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:36,880
have to make sure that

2062
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:39,440
we're pa we win capitalism we must

2063
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,280
win economically that is the battlefield

2064
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,280
the battlefield the science technology

2065
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,240
and money and economy finance

2066
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:48,880
that's the battlefield china wins

2067
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:51,199
authoritarians win and at any time

2068
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,160
xi jinping can pull jack ma into a room

2069
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:54,239
and say

2070
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:55,679
it's time for you to be re-educated or

2071
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:56,239
they can put three or four million

2072
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:58,239
people

2073
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:00,558
uyghurs into prison camps and say you

2074
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:02,879
know what this religious thing

2075
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,640
that's counter to what is productive for

2076
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,358
us therefore we're going to shave your

2077
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:06,879
heads

2078
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:08,880
and we're going to have you literally

2079
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:12,798
pick cotton in the fields they have

2080
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:15,119
uyghurs with no sense of any kind of

2081
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,159
arc of history in the fields picking

2082
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,599
cottons as

2083
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:21,279
slaves in what can only be described by

2084
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:22,720
every humanitarian organization as a

2085
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,839
concentration camp and every jewish

2086
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:25,279
person i know

2087
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:27,199
takes great offense when somebody uses

2088
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,880
the holocaust as a metaphor

2089
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:30,879
except in the case of the uyghurs right

2090
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,280
now and every jewish person i've talked

2091
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,599
to

2092
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,400
has said to me that is a holocaust that

2093
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,960
is

2094
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,480
millions of people going to genocide

2095
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,039
because of their religious beliefs

2096
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,400
and i'm an atheist but if people want to

2097
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,799
believe a certain religion

2098
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:47,039
fine but you know china's approach is we

2099
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:48,798
need to win capitalism so bad

2100
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:50,480
we need to win on the global stage so

2101
01:03:48,798 --> 01:03:52,000
bad we can't have

2102
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,760
any of this religious stuff going on

2103
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,199
here that is a distraction from winning

2104
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,039
and beating america

2105
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:57,838
and then in america the people who are

2106
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,960
going to make us win are the

2107
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:00,400
entrepreneurs

2108
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,159
and the scientists and the technology

2109
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,079
and our education system and finance

2110
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:05,279
and we're vilifying those things so it's

2111
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,760
pretty dark

2112
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,920
it's dark but i i still believe that the

2113
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,359
uh the vilification is just in the space

2114
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,000
of twitter and the space of ideas i

2115
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:14,078
think that's probably

2116
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,599
good and entrepreneurs win out in the

2117
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,000
end they they don't listen i believe in

2118
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:17,599
that

2119
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,798
and they'll build we'll get the right

2120
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,400
some of them do actually in their

2121
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:22,239
darkest moments i can tell you that they

2122
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,680
turn off their twitter accounts and they

2123
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:26,399
i've had to sit down with a number of

2124
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:28,798
entrepreneurs and say turn off twitter

2125
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,240
this is not healthy for you this is not

2126
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:31,759
a healthy pursuit because

2127
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:33,199
don't read the comments if you do it's

2128
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,640
like a full contact sport you should

2129
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:36,159
just take it as like

2130
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:38,798
professional wrestling or something but

2131
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:41,598
stay focused on building companies

2132
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:43,038
and you know advancing the human species

2133
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:44,960
through science and technology

2134
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,039
i mean as you're describing you've

2135
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:50,079
hosted uh this week in startups

2136
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:52,720
for uh how many episodes 11 years

2137
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:54,000
almost 1200 now 1200. yeah so you've

2138
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:56,318
talked to some of the great

2139
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,199
leaders in business saying general is

2140
01:04:56,318 --> 01:05:00,798
there a

2141
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:02,798
common thing that you see or

2142
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:04,559
uh really relationship with their

2143
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:07,199
parents like just

2144
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,319
find me a great entrepreneur i will show

2145
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:10,159
me the trauma

2146
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:12,719
their dad was like you're not good

2147
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:14,078
enough in the teenage years is that is

2148
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:16,159
that truly is there something

2149
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,920
there is definitely something hardship

2150
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:19,598
of at some point in the life yeah

2151
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,400
i think so i mean and there's definitely

2152
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:24,480
something uh with immigrant parents

2153
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:26,160
um that is a a bit of a stereotype out

2154
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,679
here but i've heard from many investors

2155
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:29,358
like that's like their

2156
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:31,440
oh did you were your parents immigrants

2157
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:32,798
and that they beat into you that you

2158
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,318
have to succeed and

2159
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:35,838
you feel the need to succeed because

2160
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:36,239
they suffered to get you to this country

2161
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:38,639
like

2162
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,159
there is an archetype there that i hear

2163
01:05:38,639 --> 01:05:41,279
when i started investing i heard from a

2164
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:42,558
lot of people was like

2165
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,920
yeah you want to find those immigrant

2166
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,680
founders who are coming out of stanford

2167
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,920
because they had to fight to get there

2168
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:49,199
and their parents had to fight right so

2169
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,480
it's like two huge

2170
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:51,679
fights and there's so much at stake as

2171
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,960
opposed to somebody who's fifth

2172
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:54,078
generation and like

2173
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,599
had everything handed to them and they

2174
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,480
were legacy and got into schools for

2175
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:59,519
free but

2176
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,599
i think in general the ability to get

2177
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:04,318
people to join you on that journey yes

2178
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:06,240
is so critical so you have to be

2179
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:07,679
charismatic and it doesn't mean like

2180
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,399
you're an extrovert there are

2181
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:11,598
introverts who are super charismatic uh

2182
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,880
and there are soft spoken people they

2183
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,400
don't have to be like

2184
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,318
super vivacious or rambunctious people

2185
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,838
they could be just quiet assassins but

2186
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:21,199
you need to be able to get people to

2187
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:22,558
come on the journey with you you have to

2188
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:23,838
be that storyteller

2189
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,839
and you have to have that passion and

2190
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:28,400
you have to transfer that enthusiasm

2191
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:29,759
to investors the press to customers to

2192
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,838
all the stakeholders

2193
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,039
and if you're enthusiastic about it and

2194
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:34,400
you're engaged

2195
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,559
then it's easier for people to come on

2196
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,079
that journey yeah and that's why people

2197
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,680
really start to think about what is the

2198
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,599
purpose of what i'm doing

2199
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:42,960
and it sounds corny and i when i first

2200
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:44,640
heard that i was like it's kind of corny

2201
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,519
but then i read this book by

2202
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:48,558
i've got his name rick something um he

2203
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:50,639
wrote the purpose

2204
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,839
driven church and he had spoken out of

2205
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:54,000
ted or something and

2206
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:56,480
everybody went crazy about it and he's

2207
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
like a church should have one purpose

2208
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,599
one single thing they do and like his

2209
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
church which was like one of these mega

2210
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,000
churches

2211
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,159
in san diego just wanted to do education

2212
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,440
for this specific country and that's all

2213
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:08,798
they did and they just

2214
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,159
they benchmark those i think it's very

2215
01:07:08,798 --> 01:07:12,079
important to have a purpose and a

2216
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:15,199
mission not everything

2217
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:16,798
uh but you know a specific purpose of

2218
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:18,239
some kind of joy that you want to put

2219
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:18,960
into the world you want to solve some

2220
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:21,919
kind of big

2221
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,679
hard problem and then everybody knows

2222
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,920
why you're coming to work every day

2223
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:27,358
and then for the founder when you dread

2224
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,559
going to work that day

2225
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:30,639
and you don't feel like solving that

2226
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,920
problem anymore that's the that's the

2227
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:33,118
tell and a lot of times i meet young

2228
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,838
founders i'm like why are you doing this

2229
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,400
and they're like

2230
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:37,440
well i was looking for an idea and this

2231
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,400
is the one i came up with because i

2232
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,880
think i'll make a lot of money

2233
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,000
and it's like you're going to quit

2234
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,358
you're going to get to month 9

2235
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,838
or 10 of this and you're going to run

2236
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:47,519
out of money or like your cto is going

2237
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:48,480
to quit then your cfo is going to quit

2238
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:49,519
and you're going to lose your biggest

2239
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,639
customer and

2240
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:53,199
you're just going to say this is not

2241
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:56,239
worth it you know and

2242
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:59,919
if you know using you know bezos

2243
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:02,078
or um you know ilana's examples they

2244
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,240
they just needed to see this the world

2245
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,839
change first in very specific ways

2246
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:07,759
and steve jobs you know they needed to

2247
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:09,358
see a change and it doesn't matter if

2248
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,039
they made money or they were losing or

2249
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:12,239
winning they just went to work every day

2250
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,520
and they had to change it

2251
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:15,279
it's almost like they didn't have a

2252
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:17,198
choice no choice you know that makes it

2253
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,199
sound like his torture his whole journey

2254
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:21,919
but he can't help but

2255
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:22,879
having been a witness to it um you know

2256
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,520
just as friends for

2257
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,119
for that long i have never seen an

2258
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,560
entrepreneur suffer more than him

2259
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:30,479
and uh you know he's been public about

2260
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,960
that like you do not want to be me

2261
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:34,399
um he has suffered to for those

2262
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,039
companies he has suffered to get them

2263
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:37,599
where they are

2264
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:38,158
it has not been easy can you analyze

2265
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,880
elon

2266
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:41,920
in that aspect like is there is it just

2267
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,960
he can't help but

2268
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,319
he must see the change that he uh hopes

2269
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,279
for in the world

2270
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,279
he's just incredibly hard working and uh

2271
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,120
he's very talented as well

2272
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:55,440
uh and i don't think people understand

2273
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,798
that he actually is a really brilliant

2274
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:59,278
engineer at the end of the day

2275
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:00,880
he actually knows what he's doing um and

2276
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,359
he asked the right questions i mean

2277
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,960
people were kind of aghast that he was

2278
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,640
asking vlad such good questions

2279
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,000
and they're like oh my god elon's the

2280
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,159
best journalist on the planet

2281
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,520
and it was like that's what he's anybody

2282
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:13,198
who knows elon knows he has great

2283
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:17,199
questions i mean i've been i used to

2284
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:20,879
have dinner in la and my book agent also

2285
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:22,798
was sam harris's agent sam and i met um

2286
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,920
through john brockman and we became

2287
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:25,439
friends because we lived near each other

2288
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,880
and i was friends with elon

2289
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,639
and then i used to invite them to both

2290
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,079
dinner in brentwood because one lived in

2291
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,520
bel air one lived in santa monica and i

2292
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:33,439
lived in brentwood and we go to this

2293
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,759
place popone this italian restaurant

2294
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:37,599
and every tuesday for years we would

2295
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:39,039
just the three of us every other tuesday

2296
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,199
or so we'd have dinner

2297
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:42,880
and uh i'd sit there and sam wanted to

2298
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:44,079
know about ai and elon's talking about

2299
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,319
artificial intelligence because he's on

2300
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:48,399
the board of deep mind and

2301
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:49,679
elon wanted to know about atheism and

2302
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:51,599
meditation and

2303
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,119
all this other stuff that uh you know

2304
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,920
sam was an expert on i got to sit there

2305
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:56,479
and like

2306
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:57,119
just listen to these two guys and they

2307
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:00,319
have both

2308
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,800
piercing intelligences but elon he goes

2309
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:03,840
straight

2310
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,079
to the to the gut like the the the

2311
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:09,039
questions that no engineer wants to hear

2312
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:11,279
it's like just the basic stuff that like

2313
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:13,279
why the hell are you doing it this way

2314
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:14,479
yeah when the obvious solution is like

2315
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:16,319
much easier or

2316
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:17,919
or this or that like why haven't you

2317
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,198
tried this you can figure things out i

2318
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,719
mean he's a problem solver

2319
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:22,238
i mean and that's another thing like

2320
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,439
that i think the great entrepreneurs can

2321
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:24,959
look at a problem

2322
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:26,879
with very fresh eyes like almost

2323
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,439
consistently and

2324
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,279
bezos described that as day one thinking

2325
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:31,919
right like just pretend this is day one

2326
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:33,840
every day

2327
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,119
yeah um and then other people use the

2328
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,119
term first principles

2329
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:38,238
yeah but it basically means like when

2330
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:40,640
you see a problem

2331
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:41,599
pause for a second and really think

2332
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,199
through

2333
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,719
what is the best possible solution here

2334
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:46,399
what are some alternative solutions and

2335
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,840
get from everybody like how do we solve

2336
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:48,879
this problem what people do sometimes

2337
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,560
they get in a rut

2338
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,319
they just come to work and they just go

2339
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,039
through their email they do whatever

2340
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:54,479
they did the

2341
01:10:53,039 --> 01:10:56,079
day before they don't think why are we

2342
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:56,799
doing this yes and is there a better way

2343
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:58,640
to do it

2344
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,960
now you can get so obsessive about that

2345
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,560
that you can over engineer stuff

2346
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,079
and you can never actually ship a

2347
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,120
product so there have to be some

2348
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:07,840
pragmatism

2349
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:08,640
and some goals and some dates associated

2350
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,960
with that but

2351
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,079
it is a very cool thing to really think

2352
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,439
like

2353
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:15,039
i wonder if we actually made the

2354
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:15,678
batteries ourselves what that would look

2355
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:17,439
like or

2356
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:18,719
i wonder if we could get to two-day

2357
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:20,319
shipping you know

2358
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,239
or i wonder if we could do same-day

2359
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,599
shipping like you need to have somebody

2360
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:24,079
who's willing to say you know what [ __ ]

2361
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,320
it

2362
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:27,198
let's set a crazy audacious goal uh

2363
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:28,880
two-day shipping

2364
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:30,559
of any product anywhere in the united

2365
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,000
states and once you throw the gauntlet

2366
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,560
down like that now everybody knows

2367
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,319
they're

2368
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,760
rolling in the right direction two-day

2369
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:36,799
shipping amazon prime

2370
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,800
and that's what people didn't realize

2371
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,159
about amazon the business wasn't

2372
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,279
the shipping of those products it was

2373
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:44,799
getting you to sign up for amazon prime

2374
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:46,319
they have you know hundreds of millions

2375
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,199
of people doing amazon prime for 10

2376
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:48,799
bucks a month

2377
01:11:47,198 --> 01:11:51,678
i think globally it's probably cheaper

2378
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,079
but that was the driver of that business

2379
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:54,079
was

2380
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:55,760
all of those people because they would

2381
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:58,800
you're an amazon prime subscriber

2382
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,719
do you know how much you pay no exactly

2383
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,320
it started at 50 and i think they even

2384
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:03,760
had like 40 50 60

2385
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:06,639
was like the testing in the early days

2386
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:09,039
and now it's i think 149.12

2387
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,480
wow 13 a month if you pay for the year i

2388
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:11,679
think it goes down to 10 bucks a month

2389
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:13,359
120.

2390
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,039
and you're like wow and it's like yeah

2391
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:16,960
you're paying 13 a month for the

2392
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:19,840
privilege of shopping

2393
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,880
at amazon yeah but you wouldn't you say

2394
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,560
it's the greatest

2395
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,079
thing in the world because anything i

2396
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,679
need you know if you forgot a microphone

2397
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:27,198
or a cable goes better a camera goes bad

2398
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,000
you get it here you know within a day or

2399
01:12:27,198 --> 01:12:30,000
less

2400
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,158
yeah it's pretty amazing you've already

2401
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,520
been dropping bombs incredible advice

2402
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:36,559
on startups in general but let me maybe

2403
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,840
uh

2404
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,760
go straight in and ask is there advice

2405
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,840
for somebody that wants to go big

2406
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,960
to build the big startup to help them

2407
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,640
succeed yeah

2408
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,319
it's very similar to the advice i give

2409
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,159
to investors because now i

2410
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:51,599
i teach angel investing because so many

2411
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:53,839
people want to invest

2412
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,280
and so i wrote a book on that angel and

2413
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,279
then i do a course called angel

2414
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:58,479
university that i teach six times a year

2415
01:12:57,279 --> 01:12:59,759
and then i have a syndicate called the

2416
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:01,759
syndicate.com where i invest in

2417
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,719
companies there's 6 500 people who are

2418
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,560
members of that it's the largest

2419
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,560
syndicate in the world in fact the first

2420
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,640
deal we ever did was com.com

2421
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,000
the meditation app we put 378 thousand

2422
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,039
dollars into it when it was a 5 million

2423
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,119
dollar product

2424
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:14,880
a 5 million company so we bought 6 or 7

2425
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:16,079
of the company it's now worth 2 billion

2426
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,159
so you can do the math on that we still

2427
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:18,960
own 5 percent what year was it uh six

2428
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:22,079
years ago so

2429
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:24,480
probably seven yeah maybe 2015

2430
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:25,439
uh 2014 and nobody else would invest in

2431
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,959
calm yeah

2432
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:29,439
but sam harris was the reason i did

2433
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,800
because i asked sam

2434
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:32,000
tell me about meditation and he's

2435
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,039
explaining it to me and i said what

2436
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,719
about this like do you have to have like

2437
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,000
a mantra how does it work exactly i know

2438
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,520
possibilities like well you know you

2439
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,238
should just go to ucla and talk to diana

2440
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,000
winston and like

2441
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:42,079
there's this whole project there and i'm

2442
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,198
like ucla does meditation

2443
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:44,880
it's like yeah there's a mindful

2444
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:45,439
institute there like teaching people to

2445
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,760
be

2446
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:49,198
tahiti meditation and they're doing ptsd

2447
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,520
and i'm doing brain scans

2448
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:53,198
and i was like oh and then i talked to

2449
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,080
the ucla people and they're like it's

2450
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:56,719
real yeah like we

2451
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:59,279
we taught phil jackson and kobe bryant

2452
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,480
and shaquille o'neal did

2453
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:02,399
you know that's how they won their

2454
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:03,279
championships they meditated and i was

2455
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:06,319
like

2456
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:06,719
hmm if ucla is doing it sam says it's

2457
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:08,799
cool

2458
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,239
well [ __ ] it i'll put money into that

2459
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,800
and that's the second biggest investment

2460
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:12,959
in my career

2461
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:14,320
after uber and it will in all likelihood

2462
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,800
become the biggest i mean it's between

2463
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:17,840
uber

2464
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,440
robin hood and calm

2465
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,800
and long story short when i'm teaching

2466
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:22,719
people to angel invest there's really

2467
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:25,199
two things that you cannot

2468
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,719
cannot fake one is a product that is

2469
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:28,799
built really well

2470
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,000
so if you look at com robin hood uber

2471
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,039
tesla amazon

2472
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,238
these products are transcendent

2473
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:36,000
they're well constructed there's

2474
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:36,959
craftsmanship to them they're they're

2475
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,640
great products

2476
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,520
so you're saying not fundamentally like

2477
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,760
the idea but the execution of the actual

2478
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,199
of the construction the actual product

2479
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,719
is amazing

2480
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:50,879
then um there's customers

2481
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,239
and that every business has ultimately a

2482
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,560
customer and that

2483
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:56,079
customer if they are in fact delighted

2484
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,840
by that product

2485
01:14:56,079 --> 01:15:02,640
that's the magic because

2486
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,400
you need a team to build the product and

2487
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,280
then you need customers to use the

2488
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,359
product

2489
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:09,759
and really those three vectors are

2490
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:11,279
undeniable now

2491
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,679
you can have great teams that build a

2492
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:15,359
bad product doesn't happen too often

2493
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:18,000
um or you have customers who don't like

2494
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:20,799
the product but generally speaking

2495
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,800
a great team will build a great product

2496
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:25,199
or a good product and iterate

2497
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,000
and then eventually delight customers

2498
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:27,678
and so

2499
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,319
most people say the team is the most

2500
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:32,000
important but

2501
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:34,399
there's a lot of smart people out there

2502
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,800
and let's assume that you can have

2503
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:38,079
you can raise money for your idea or you

2504
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,360
have money or you can just convince

2505
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:40,559
people to do it for free

2506
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:42,000
if you make a great product and it

2507
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,520
connects with users that's the magic you

2508
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,520
look at clubhouse it's actually a really

2509
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,040
well designed product

2510
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,400
and that product is connecting with

2511
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:50,079
customers and if you were to talk to the

2512
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:51,759
customers or look at the product

2513
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,359
you would see a well-constructed product

2514
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,800
and a delighted customer

2515
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:56,479
and you can tell the delighted customer

2516
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,920
by just the amount of time they use it

2517
01:15:56,479 --> 01:15:59,599
that's called engagement

2518
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,679
just a fancy word for how much they use

2519
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,640
it and snapchat when that was going

2520
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,480
around

2521
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,119
and they were trying to raise money they

2522
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:10,559
had a fraction of the number of users

2523
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:11,198
but the top maybe third were opening the

2524
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,400
app

2525
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:15,919
every hour and that nobody had ever seen

2526
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:17,359
that before people were using facebook

2527
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:17,920
you know a couple times a day the top

2528
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:21,279
users

2529
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:23,920
but nobody had ever seen people using it

2530
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:25,198
every day for a hundred days in a row

2531
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,399
every hour

2532
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:28,719
and i was like what's going on here it's

2533
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:30,399
like oh the ephemeral messaging

2534
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,158
and then the streaks they had created

2535
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:33,599
these streaks between people where

2536
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:34,879
you know every day and then people would

2537
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,320
be like on vacation like i just have to

2538
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,400
open my streak and keep my street with

2539
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:39,679
lex that we chatted every day going

2540
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:40,960
and so they had this like addictive

2541
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:43,119
nature to it and that's why clubhouse

2542
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:45,039
was able to garner so much investment

2543
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:46,319
is the number of hours people were using

2544
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:49,439
it every month

2545
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:51,039
uh was just unbelievably off the charts

2546
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:53,439
some of that is execution but some of it

2547
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:55,679
is the weird little magic of the

2548
01:16:53,439 --> 01:16:57,039
product market fit yeah so there's

2549
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,440
something i mean clubhouse

2550
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:01,519
there's a it's still a mystery to me

2551
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:04,479
because i also use discord voice

2552
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,199
there's an intimacy to voice oh for sure

2553
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:08,639
you have people's

2554
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:10,399
yeah tent well but like the

2555
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,719
video gets in the way actually in a

2556
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:14,559
weird way there's a privacy

2557
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,158
when you just use voice people are not

2558
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,800
taking showers now lex i mean yeah this

2559
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:18,238
is

2560
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,920
a pandemic and people just roll out of

2561
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:21,198
bed and the hair thing nobody's getting

2562
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,319
it nobody's hair is good nobody's

2563
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:24,639
getting haircuts

2564
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:25,759
people are wearing gym clothes i mean

2565
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,679
zoom is just

2566
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,199
horrific to be on zoom for five hours a

2567
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,359
day it is exhausting

2568
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:33,039
well it does make me wonder what the

2569
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:34,319
what uh once when we emerge from the

2570
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:36,479
pandemic or their

2571
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:38,158
uh pr product market fit how that

2572
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:39,439
evolves with the uh with clubhouse and

2573
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:41,039
all those kinds of things yeah i know

2574
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:42,079
clubhouse is a beneficiary of the

2575
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:44,079
pandemic for sure

2576
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:45,600
when do you think uh depend when do you

2577
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:48,399
think

2578
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,800
debts will be under let's say 200 a day

2579
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:50,319
and

2580
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,679
we'll have 200 million people on the

2581
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:52,880
other side of this because that's kind

2582
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,960
of what it takes right you got to get to

2583
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,119
150 200 million people on the other side

2584
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,560
in america i haven't you know i

2585
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,559
personally stopped

2586
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:03,039
deeply thinking about this because i've

2587
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:05,280
been frustrated for so long

2588
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:06,238
that you checked out i almost checked

2589
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,119
out because

2590
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:09,919
it uh psychologically allows me to carry

2591
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:14,079
on

2592
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:16,399
because i thought for many months now

2593
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:17,600
that testing needs to be done at scale

2594
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:19,920
and it still hasn't gotten done

2595
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,199
it has so we gave up basically and

2596
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,719
testing we gave up

2597
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:25,439
because we're and we're all sitting

2598
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:28,319
there waiting for vaccine to come along

2599
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:28,879
and the distribution of the vaccine is

2600
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:30,479
not

2601
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,920
you know it's struggling from the same

2602
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:32,799
kind of things as the testing it's going

2603
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,199
to take

2604
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,800
quite a bit of time so it does if

2605
01:18:35,198 --> 01:18:39,119
everything goes great

2606
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,000
meaning there's not a second strand of

2607
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:44,000
the virus that's

2608
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:46,560
going to create a second major wave

2609
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
that i i'm cynical enough to think that

2610
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,440
it won't be until

2611
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,039
mid-summer that we start opening back up

2612
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:54,559
yeah i think it's going to be may june

2613
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:56,158
i'm a little bit earlier than you i've

2614
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,600
been tracking it's like 1.5 million

2615
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:59,839
shots at arms a day

2616
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,880
i think this vaccine has been undersold

2617
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:02,640
i mean it's a miracle

2618
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,400
not one person who was in the trials

2619
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,840
died who took it

2620
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:07,920
and only one went to the hospital and

2621
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,000
they weren't even put on a ventilator so

2622
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:12,319
and the hospitalizations are plummeting

2623
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,560
and we're at 10 now in the united states

2624
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:15,920
at the pace we're going at 1.5 a day

2625
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,199
i think when the johnson johnson one

2626
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,600
comes out next month it'll be three

2627
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:20,960
million a day maybe two and a half

2628
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,400
and we already have 100 million people

2629
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,079
who've likely had it so i've been doing

2630
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:26,399
the math i think we're like

2631
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:28,000
60 days away february march yeah

2632
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:29,839
sometime in april i think

2633
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,439
anybody's gonna be able to get a shot

2634
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,199
and the number of deaths is going to go

2635
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:34,879
below 200 a day

2636
01:19:33,198 --> 01:19:36,399
and once that happens i think people

2637
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,480
have had enough of this they're just

2638
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:41,519
going to go yolo

2639
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:43,279
i but see the the crucial piece for me

2640
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,640
that i've been focusing on is the

2641
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:48,880
the social media aspect of how the

2642
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,480
it's not just about the reality of

2643
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,960
deaths it's about

2644
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:54,959
the state of the uh collective

2645
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,319
intelligence of the human species which

2646
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,719
is determined by

2647
01:19:56,319 --> 01:20:00,158
our communication on social media so we

2648
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,960
could yeah we can be

2649
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:04,000
collectively afraid the fear can spread

2650
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,439
or it could be

2651
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,119
yolo can spread or it could be

2652
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:10,799
like all different kinds of

2653
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:13,359
misinformation and of course

2654
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,079
during the election year the politics

2655
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:17,279
influences

2656
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:20,559
our perception of what is true and not

2657
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:22,158
but you know having real rigorous

2658
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,920
nuanced conversation about this kind of

2659
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:26,079
stuff is the way

2660
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,760
is the way out of this and that's where

2661
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:29,198
social media really comes in because

2662
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:32,000
social media has drives

2663
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:32,799
division where the people form tribes

2664
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,399
and so on and

2665
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,119
it feels like it's honestly a technology

2666
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:39,198
problem

2667
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,639
you know people say it's a human problem

2668
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:43,039
but it just feels like

2669
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:44,000
i believe people are good technology can

2670
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:47,439
enable them to be

2671
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,039
thoughtful we talked earlier about um

2672
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:51,119
you know this the magic of silicon

2673
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:53,519
valley and then maybe going too far

2674
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:55,519
with the facebook groups example where

2675
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,159
you know you take out all that friction

2676
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:59,360
what happened was we used to have

2677
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:01,439
something called arcron

2678
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:02,880
reverse chronological order that's how

2679
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:05,119
you consumed a feed

2680
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,639
so any kind of social feed like twitter

2681
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:07,920
was in reverse chronological order the

2682
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:09,600
newest thing was up top and you would

2683
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,199
just work your way backwards

2684
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,679
and so it gave this a really fresh

2685
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:14,000
feeling and then a guy named dave morin

2686
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,480
and

2687
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,238
the team over at facebook realized you

2688
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:20,399
know there are some things

2689
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:21,519
that got a lot of attention two hours

2690
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:23,359
ago and the stuff

2691
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,719
since then has not been as important but

2692
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:25,599
if you missed that there was a really

2693
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,880
good tweet

2694
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,199
where there was a really good update

2695
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,679
like somebody had a baby

2696
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:32,719
let's that's kind of can we get the baby

2697
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,158
one at the top

2698
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,198
and i was like well how would we do that

2699
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:36,079
how would we know that that's the

2700
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:38,719
important one it's like

2701
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:40,000
well it's let's put a like button on it

2702
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:41,359
and let's see how many comments there

2703
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,639
are so if it gets a lot of likes or

2704
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:44,719
comments or retweets

2705
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:47,119
let's show those first and then we'll

2706
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:49,279
kind of mix in the most recent stuff

2707
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:50,719
and so when you're on twit and then when

2708
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:52,639
facebook did that

2709
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:54,000
facebook became so addicting because

2710
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,760
facebook was on

2711
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,039
what has got the most engagement put

2712
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,480
that first so

2713
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:00,800
every time you open up facebook get the

2714
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:01,519
dopamine hit and then what happens when

2715
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:04,560
you see the

2716
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:07,280
bar mitzvah photo or you know the

2717
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,840
enraging story about some injustice in

2718
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:10,158
the world

2719
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,840
you retweet it you write a comment you

2720
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:14,960
share it on your wall

2721
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,719
and thus this addiction to the

2722
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,679
outrageous the outlandish

2723
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:21,760
the inspiring occurred and it used to be

2724
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:25,119
like inspiring stuff puppies or some

2725
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:27,280
heartwarming story and then it got dark

2726
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:28,719
and then people started to realize if i

2727
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:30,000
want to show up on the top of my

2728
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:32,000
friend's feeds

2729
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,279
if i say something controversial or i'm

2730
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,439
outraged

2731
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:37,039
i get to the top and then that's when

2732
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:38,559
outrage culture came in and then that's

2733
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:39,600
when cancer culture came in everybody

2734
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,600
started to realize

2735
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,719
if i try to cancel that person for being

2736
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:46,079
a racist

2737
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:48,560
or a sexist or a horrible human being or

2738
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:49,519
whatever they did that's wrong i get to

2739
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,120
the top of the feed

2740
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:52,639
and we all collectively started playing

2741
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:54,960
a very weird video game

2742
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:56,480
which is how outraged can we all be and

2743
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,399
to get to the top of the list

2744
01:22:56,479 --> 01:22:59,519
and then of course with trump he

2745
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:01,279
realized it he's like

2746
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,360
okay yeah i'm just gonna make fun of a

2747
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:04,559
celebrity and i get more retweets

2748
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:06,079
okay i'm gonna make fun of rosie

2749
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,520
o'donnell for being overweight or

2750
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:08,079
something and he just starts attacking

2751
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,840
people

2752
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:11,279
yeah and people like oh my god what did

2753
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:12,239
he say and he copied that from howard

2754
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:13,519
stern

2755
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:14,799
because he was in new york and he used

2756
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,480
to be on howard stern and howard stern

2757
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,480
took over all the dialogue in the 80s

2758
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:20,158
and 90s because he was outrageous

2759
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:22,399
and then trump did that and then social

2760
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:24,399
media incorporated that

2761
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:26,399
into the operating system it became the

2762
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:28,879
actual device of social media

2763
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:30,158
was the ding ding ding ding we've got

2764
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,239
something incredible for you everybody

2765
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:34,719
salivates like pavlov's dog you know

2766
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:36,000
oh my god i can be outraged that's

2767
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,279
what's got to be undone

2768
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,880
and the only way for that to be undone

2769
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:40,639
is these things can't be billions of

2770
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,319
people where

2771
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,239
uh the most outrageous thing that

2772
01:23:42,319 --> 01:23:46,399
happened in the world today

2773
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:47,919
in the last five minutes is now in front

2774
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:48,559
of you and that's why people have

2775
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,800
anxiety

2776
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,280
they don't sleep and they do scroll all

2777
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,279
night it's because the human mind was

2778
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:55,759
not meant to process this much suffering

2779
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:57,599
pain

2780
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,039
anger and that's why we have all this

2781
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,560
mental health issues

2782
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:04,560
also you know young girls or even adults

2783
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,719
watching other people post their private

2784
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,199
jets and their vacations

2785
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:10,079
and you know yolo adventures on their

2786
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:11,759
instagram

2787
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:13,600
to the point at which young people are

2788
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:16,320
now faking

2789
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,280
being on private jets to put on their

2790
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:21,519
instagram

2791
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:23,920
and creating like this crazy fomo around

2792
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,880
their instagrams like now we wonder why

2793
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,319
people are unhappy

2794
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,639
like if you think everybody's on a

2795
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:30,000
private jet going to some michelin star

2796
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,039
restaurant or whatever the coolest thing

2797
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,600
in the world is today

2798
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:34,238
yeah like going to the grammys going to

2799
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,639
whatever

2800
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:39,439
coachella burning man like you're like

2801
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:42,239
oh but i'm home

2802
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:42,960
i'm in my house yeah and i'm not at

2803
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:45,198
burning man

2804
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,359
getting inadequate exactly so this whole

2805
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:48,158
system is is uh creating the wrong set

2806
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:51,039
of incentives

2807
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:52,719
i tend to believe it's possible to still

2808
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:54,479
have extremely high engagement

2809
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:56,079
and create a successful profitable

2810
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:58,959
business while

2811
01:24:56,079 --> 01:25:00,319
encouraging personal growth like

2812
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,520
encouraging people to be the best

2813
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:04,079
version of themselves i just

2814
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:05,840
think we haven't we got the first

2815
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:07,600
generation of social networks i think a

2816
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,039
new generation needs to absolutely

2817
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,760
is that your plan for a business to do

2818
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:12,560
so well i have a longer-term plan in

2819
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:16,880
terms of

2820
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:19,520
ambition which is uh i believe in

2821
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,480
being able to have deep connection

2822
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,760
between human

2823
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:25,279
and ai systems like partners friends

2824
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,920
there is a connection to their with

2825
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:31,599
social media i do think

2826
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:34,960
ai ai has a strong role to play

2827
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,679
in representing us in guiding us in how

2828
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,158
we

2829
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:40,960
consume social media so this algorithm

2830
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:44,319
that controls the feed for facebook

2831
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:47,119
is a somewhat centralized algorithm but

2832
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:49,039
instead to give more power to the people

2833
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:50,719
individuals to where each one of us have

2834
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:55,198
our own algorithm bring it

2835
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:55,198
together making your own ioa byo

2836
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,239
well i mean if you thought about it if

2837
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:02,238
we came and said i want

2838
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:04,319
when i look at my twitter feed i would

2839
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:06,319
like to see the people with

2840
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:07,439
who are the most helpful in the world

2841
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:11,198
generous kind

2842
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:13,919
intelligent considered you know

2843
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:14,960
commenting on things that i don't

2844
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,199
already know about

2845
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,560
because i want to open my world view

2846
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:20,238
that could be a beautiful thing for

2847
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,440
society and actually jack was talking

2848
01:26:20,238 --> 01:26:23,439
about

2849
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:24,960
potentially on twitter letting people

2850
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:26,238
bring their own algorithms and sort

2851
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,359
their feeds themselves

2852
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:28,638
this would be a wonderful thing i think

2853
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:30,238
it's one of the reasons clubhouse has

2854
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:32,400
resonated

2855
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:34,000
is it's such a diverse group of people

2856
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:36,158
that i've been able to drop in

2857
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,039
on conversations with people who are

2858
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:39,439
nothing like me

2859
01:26:37,039 --> 01:26:40,719
yes and listen in and and hear

2860
01:26:39,439 --> 01:26:43,279
conversations that i wouldn't

2861
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:44,158
normally be privy to and i my

2862
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:45,679
everybody's like oh

2863
01:26:44,158 --> 01:26:47,119
come join as a speaker i want to do a

2864
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:48,560
room with you i get asked every day can

2865
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:50,479
we do a room can we do a room ask an

2866
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:54,560
angel investor talk about startups

2867
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:56,879
and i'm like my usage of clubhouse

2868
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,920
is going on my peloton treadmill putting

2869
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,840
clubhouse on

2870
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,399
taking a room and just listening yeah

2871
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:05,520
it's so delightful for me as a podcaster

2872
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:07,279
where my job is to talk to sit back and

2873
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,000
just put in a couple of miles and play

2874
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:09,920
chess

2875
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,158
and listen to a clubhouse discussion

2876
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:15,840
that is about relationships

2877
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:17,599
and or you know some fashion or hip-hop

2878
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,199
or whatever it is that i'm not part of i

2879
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,560
just sit there and i listen

2880
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:21,678
and you learn it's like such a

2881
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,360
delightful thing i always think about

2882
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,960
these kids to go to college

2883
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:26,158
and always been so jealous of these ivy

2884
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,000
league kids they go and they're like i

2885
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:29,359
gotta go to class and i'm like

2886
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,238
i would just love to sit there and

2887
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:32,960
listen to professor lex talked yeah you

2888
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:35,599
know like

2889
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:37,520
what a privilege to sit there and let

2890
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,079
somebody else drive and talk and listen

2891
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,000
and learn

2892
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:41,519
yeah that's the beauty of podcasting but

2893
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,479
of course clubhouse creates a whole

2894
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,080
nother experience where it's

2895
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:45,919
conversations is different

2896
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:47,359
i think it's gonna be the in-between i i

2897
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,279
like it as a

2898
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:50,880
you release your podcast like you and i

2899
01:27:49,279 --> 01:27:51,920
are gonna release this podcast right

2900
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:53,359
and then at some point i'll have you on

2901
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,319
my pod when you launch your startup and

2902
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:56,479
then

2903
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:57,599
some point somebody's gonna be like uh

2904
01:27:56,479 --> 01:27:59,359
you and i were running

2905
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,520
and i ran into you i saw you were on

2906
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:03,119
clubhouse the other night and i

2907
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,639
i was busy but i was almost going to

2908
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:05,119
click on you and say let's start a room

2909
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:06,319
together

2910
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:07,760
but you and i will start a room together

2911
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:09,198
with eric weinstein or somebody or sam

2912
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,719
harris will jump in or ela

2913
01:28:09,198 --> 01:28:12,479
and we'll have a different experience

2914
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:15,840
which will just shoot the [ __ ] and

2915
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:16,238
it'll act as like a fabric uh and a

2916
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,520
little

2917
01:28:16,238 --> 01:28:21,039
filler between the tent pole podcasts

2918
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,400
right like you and eric you've done

2919
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:22,800
three i think with eric yeah was your

2920
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:24,158
four

2921
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,400
yeah i haven't released the fourth year

2922
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:26,799
okay so i i watched all three uh because

2923
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:29,198
i

2924
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,840
i really thought your you way and him

2925
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:31,359
like

2926
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,480
giving you advice is very interesting

2927
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:33,839
dynamic i thought it was a very

2928
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:36,399
interesting dynamic

2929
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,719
um and i find him like a fascinating cat

2930
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:39,359
we know everybody in common except we've

2931
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:40,800
never met

2932
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:42,158
it's very weird because you know you you

2933
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,119
think about the social graph in the real

2934
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:46,399
world this is why i think

2935
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:47,279
augmented reality is going to be such an

2936
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:49,759
amazing

2937
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:52,158
product i just have one killer feature i

2938
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,880
want for augmented reality

2939
01:28:52,158 --> 01:28:55,519
we wear our glasses and when i look at

2940
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,400
you

2941
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:59,360
above your head i see the relationships

2942
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:01,279
we have

2943
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:02,559
and the things we've done together yes

2944
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:04,559
right so i see

2945
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,000
oh you both know sam harris or you had

2946
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,719
elon on the podcast

2947
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,238
on this date or you and i were both at

2948
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:12,880
burning man in

2949
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:13,599
2006 the most meaningful element of our

2950
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,359
connection

2951
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,880
network yeah and then because we would

2952
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:18,639
discover that through small talk but

2953
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:22,639
imagine you're like at a party

2954
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:24,159
and you look and it just people glow

2955
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:25,840
and you just see a glow around a person

2956
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:27,519
and like green means you have some

2957
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,639
financial relationship blue means you

2958
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,159
have some friendship one

2959
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:31,840
yeah or yellow means you have friendship

2960
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:33,279
one blue means you

2961
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:34,800
know nothing about each other you have

2962
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:36,479
no connections you're like wow these

2963
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,639
blue people have no connection to

2964
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:40,559
yeah these people that one's glowing red

2965
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,159
we know seven or more people in common

2966
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,679
yeah and those are the seven people oh

2967
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:45,039
we should go talk about how we know each

2968
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:46,560
other yeah

2969
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:48,000
that could and that sort of happened

2970
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,280
with facebook remember or myspace where

2971
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,319
you were like oh you know that person

2972
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:52,000
friend of a friend

2973
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:53,359
yeah but that's what there's going to be

2974
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,279
ars like

2975
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:56,399
this is why i think if apple figures out

2976
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:57,840
ar

2977
01:29:56,399 --> 01:29:59,759
or snapchat and they just have those

2978
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:03,440
glasses you know forget about vr

2979
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:04,719
it's just nauseating and whatever but ar

2980
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:06,799
where you put the glasses on you see the

2981
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,319
real world but you augmented

2982
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:10,480
well you make uh just like you were

2983
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:13,198
saying you make it frictionless

2984
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:14,799
a very low friction to make a deep human

2985
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:16,960
connection because you you have all the

2986
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,920
basic elements there already

2987
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:20,319
now think about the unintended

2988
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,840
consequences of what i just described

2989
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:23,519
it could get creepy and weird the

2990
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,840
privacy thing yeah

2991
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,960
i mean people will opt here's the thing

2992
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:29,360
people

2993
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:32,880
your privacy is an illusion like all

2994
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:32,880
this information is there and then

2995
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:36,960
people are more than willing to give up

2996
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:39,039
privacy in exchange for

2997
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,800
some value you know it's a value trade

2998
01:30:39,039 --> 01:30:44,399
yeah and giving if

2999
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:45,920
if my tesla when i'm driving in the

3000
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:47,679
direction of my house just starts the

3001
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,199
navigation and saves me three clicks and

3002
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:51,600
that friction's gone

3003
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:52,719
i'm willing to give tesla my location

3004
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,159
and my home address

3005
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:55,520
right yeah i'm not willing to give

3006
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:56,000
zuckerberg anything i don't trust him

3007
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,440
but

3008
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,119
you get the idea i mean it will be that

3009
01:30:57,439 --> 01:31:00,319
way with like dna and other things at

3010
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:01,760
some point we'll just be like yeah just

3011
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:03,198
take my dna like i don't

3012
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,760
yeah sure people can look and see that

3013
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:06,559
i'm a mental [ __ ] and my iq is like

3014
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,920
lower than

3015
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,679
i don't want to bring the bell curve up

3016
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,600
or whatever but but

3017
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:13,279
you could you could figure out like if

3018
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,960
we all put our dna in the sequence

3019
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:17,759
online and like oh yeah you know

3020
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:18,319
lex has got 10 more iq points than j-cal

3021
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,159
and yeah

3022
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:21,679
you know sam's got 10 more than lex and

3023
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:23,198
all of a sudden people are like all bent

3024
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:24,480
out of shape about it but what if they

3025
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:26,238
we did that and they were like and by

3026
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,399
the way you also all three of you are

3027
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:28,879
gonna get parkinson's unless you do x y

3028
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:30,479
and z

3029
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,319
yeah unless you eat more blueberries or

3030
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:33,839
whatever we figure out they're going to

3031
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:37,119
accept it pretty quickly yeah that's

3032
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:39,199
brave new world brave new world i i

3033
01:31:37,119 --> 01:31:40,880
have to ask you you're just like you

3034
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:43,439
were saying you're one of the

3035
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:44,000
world experts in investing in in uh

3036
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:47,839
instruments

3037
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:50,560
in startups uh yeah uh the vc and so on

3038
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,960
from the perspective of the startup i

3039
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,960
was

3040
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:54,319
always kind of skeptical of raising

3041
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,000
money

3042
01:31:54,319 --> 01:31:57,439
it feels like people do it too quickly

3043
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,800
too easily

3044
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:00,479
but i don't know what the hell i'm

3045
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:03,520
talking about

3046
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:05,919
when is the when should a startup

3047
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:07,040
raise money and from the perspective of

3048
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,199
the investor

3049
01:32:07,039 --> 01:32:10,079
when should the investor invest in a

3050
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:12,079
startup

3051
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:13,600
like is there a timing thing here is

3052
01:32:12,079 --> 01:32:16,079
there um

3053
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,360
what yeah it's a it's a very important

3054
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:20,319
question because

3055
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:21,759
the venture capital community is only

3056
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:24,000
going to fund

3057
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,960
you know sub one percent of enterprises

3058
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,039
started in the in

3059
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,880
the united states every year like maybe

3060
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:29,679
10 basis points of them like one in a

3061
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:33,279
thousand

3062
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:35,359
and the reason is it's jet fuel

3063
01:32:33,279 --> 01:32:36,800
you only want to take that money if you

3064
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:38,158
really want to build something big and

3065
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,480
you want to build it fast

3066
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:41,920
and when you put jet fuel behind a

3067
01:32:40,479 --> 01:32:43,759
startup

3068
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:46,000
as we've seen with other rockets things

3069
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:47,520
can blow up and people can die you know

3070
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,960
it's not people literally dying but the

3071
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,280
business can go up in smoke

3072
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,719
right like rockets get blown up all the

3073
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:54,238
time at spacex

3074
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:56,079
as part of their ambitious plans and

3075
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:57,039
startups seven out of ten startups we

3076
01:32:56,079 --> 01:32:59,679
invest in

3077
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:01,279
go to zero now if you were to start the

3078
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:03,119
business and only build it off customer

3079
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:04,719
revenue and use your own money and go

3080
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:05,439
nice and slow and grow ten percent a

3081
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:08,560
year

3082
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:10,158
the chances of you blowing up the rocket

3083
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,239
are very low because you're riding a

3084
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:13,439
bicycle

3085
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:15,439
you can go a little faster but the

3086
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:18,319
bicycle can only go so fast

3087
01:33:15,439 --> 01:33:19,519
and once you start taking that money the

3088
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:21,759
way the portfol

3089
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,719
the way venture capital is constructed

3090
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:26,560
as

3091
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:27,920
a um in the mix of like mit or harvard's

3092
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,840
endowments is

3093
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:31,760
you know we're gonna put some money into

3094
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:33,760
uh safe things and then we're gonna have

3095
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:36,960
these really binary things over here

3096
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:38,800
and they probably put five percent uh in

3097
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,760
venture capital traditionally it's grown

3098
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,360
to twenty percent

3099
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,960
just as a function of how successful

3100
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:44,479
it's been so

3101
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,239
you know the harvards of the world and

3102
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:48,718
mit is probably one five or

3103
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:49,359
ten percent in venture but it's grown to

3104
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:51,039
25

3105
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:53,439
because you know companies like airbnb

3106
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:56,560
and uber have grown so big in tesla

3107
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:58,559
but the goal is in these venture funds

3108
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:00,560
we're going to invest in 30 names

3109
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,159
and one or two of them are going to

3110
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,800
return three times the capital we've

3111
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:04,399
deployed

3112
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:06,239
so it's a 300 million dollar fund and

3113
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:08,399
there's 30 names and each got 10 million

3114
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:09,599
that means one of the 10 million is

3115
01:34:08,399 --> 01:34:12,079
going to return

3116
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,120
the fund plus so that means it has to

3117
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:16,960
grow

3118
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:18,079
30x and then 60x to double the fund and

3119
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,000
you're really supposed to be

3120
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:21,679
doing three times cash on cash so that

3121
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,520
300 million dollar funds

3122
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:24,960
the expectation is in 10 years to return

3123
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,400
900 million

3124
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,920
triple the person's money as opposed to

3125
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:29,198
the stock market which doubles your

3126
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:31,440
money in the same period

3127
01:34:29,198 --> 01:34:33,919
so you're supposed to do 25 percent

3128
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:36,238
annualized returns in order to

3129
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:37,679
triple the money and maybe i have an

3130
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:38,959
outlying chance of four or five times

3131
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,920
the money which does happen sometimes

3132
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,639
when you have an outlier in your

3133
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:45,440
portfolio like uber or facebook was

3134
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:46,000
and what that means is the venture

3135
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:47,439
capitalist

3136
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,118
behavior on the game they're playing is

3137
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:50,638
different than you as the founder you as

3138
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:51,359
the founder you may really care about

3139
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,679
this

3140
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:54,880
and it dying really matters to you and

3141
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,319
then you got a venture capitalist who's

3142
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,520
like we're betting on 30 names we need

3143
01:34:56,319 --> 01:34:59,519
two of them

3144
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:02,320
to hit it out of the park maybe three

3145
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:04,320
and nothing else is meaningful

3146
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:05,920
so now you start thinking about the game

3147
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:08,639
theory there

3148
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:09,679
you're dealing with you know money that

3149
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:13,600
is coming in

3150
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:17,039
that only cares about you going 100x

3151
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:18,480
yes it's a whole different ball game

3152
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:19,519
whereas if you build off revenue you

3153
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,678
don't have to do that and if you look at

3154
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,199
a company like com.com we invested at 5

3155
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:25,039
million the next round they did was 250

3156
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:27,279
they were so capital efficient

3157
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:29,118
that they grew from 10 000 a month in

3158
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:30,079
revenue to millions of dollars a month

3159
01:35:29,118 --> 01:35:32,158
in revenue

3160
01:35:30,079 --> 01:35:33,760
over those four years since we invested

3161
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:36,399
and they didn't raise money in between

3162
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:37,760
wow it was unbelievable and i've only

3163
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:39,198
seen this happen three or four times so

3164
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,400
it doesn't happen all this capital

3165
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:43,839
efficient meaning

3166
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:44,238
uh based on customer revenue alone plus

3167
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,400
some

3168
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:47,359
small amount of fundraising you're able

3169
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:50,559
to go like

3170
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:52,799
how hard is it to do that it takes

3171
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,400
extreme product market fit you have to

3172
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,800
have a great price for your product that

3173
01:35:54,399 --> 01:35:58,399
has a great margin um

3174
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,159
yeah and if you're doing something in

3175
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:01,679
hardware it's probably impossible

3176
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:02,799
because it's super capital intensive so

3177
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:03,199
it's probably got to be a software

3178
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,039
business

3179
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:07,519
software hardware businesses take a lot

3180
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:09,118
more do venture capitals get in the way

3181
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,440
at all of the business or do

3182
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:12,799
so it depends to get out of the way yeah

3183
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:14,079
if you if you get young venture

3184
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,639
capitalists who are starting their

3185
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:16,880
career

3186
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:18,400
they're very nervous and scared because

3187
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,719
they're putting all these bets

3188
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:21,759
yeah and then there's a very weird thing

3189
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:24,800
that happens

3190
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:27,039
the bad news comes first so yeah

3191
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,000
companies that don't work out go out of

3192
01:36:27,039 --> 01:36:30,158
business immediately

3193
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,760
yes so if it's not going to be com or

3194
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:34,079
robinhood or uber

3195
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:35,679
those take sev you know you have a one

3196
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:38,399
of those great successes somewhere in

3197
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:40,239
your five six seven eight as an investor

3198
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:42,000
what is the first five years like the

3199
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:44,879
first five years you feel like an idiot

3200
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,439
because you let's say you make these uh

3201
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,440
10 bets

3202
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:50,399
in year two two or three of them come

3203
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:51,679
back and they don't have product market

3204
01:36:50,399 --> 01:36:52,960
fit and they're out of money yeah and

3205
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:54,239
they say can we have more money you say

3206
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,279
no we have to go get it from somebody

3207
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:56,559
else because you have to prove that

3208
01:36:55,279 --> 01:36:58,800
there's still a market for it

3209
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,159
we may keep our pro rata we may put a

3210
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,800
little bit in to maintain our percentage

3211
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:02,479
ownership

3212
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:04,800
but we're not going to give you another

3213
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:07,118
big chunk of money yes

3214
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:09,039
and that company dies so now you've got

3215
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:10,000
10 million poof up in smoke boom 10

3216
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:12,319
million up smoke

3217
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,238
so this is called the j curve where your

3218
01:37:12,319 --> 01:37:15,920
performance goes down

3219
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:17,359
and then it's only in years four five

3220
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,639
and six it starts going up and what

3221
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:20,799
you're seeing right now is the people

3222
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:23,440
who started like i did in 2000

3223
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,400
you know just 11 12 years ago in 2009 i

3224
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:27,519
started investing

3225
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:28,879
we all look like geniuses why we're at

3226
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:31,760
the end of the cycle

3227
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:33,039
we invested after when the stock market

3228
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:35,600
was on the floor after the financial

3229
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:36,800
crisis and it's gone straight up since

3230
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,920
so everybody look there's a couple

3231
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,880
little blips in there but

3232
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,719
generally speaking there hasn't been

3233
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,920
like a major crash uh with the exception

3234
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:42,719
of the pandemic crash but that bounced

3235
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:45,279
right back

3236
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:47,198
and so you know it takes a decade to

3237
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:48,639
figure out if you're good at it

3238
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:49,839
and then if the market crashes again

3239
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:52,159
everybody feels like an in again the

3240
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:54,880
cycle starts again so you are now

3241
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:56,399
as a founder you are now inserting

3242
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:58,000
yourself into that casino

3243
01:37:56,399 --> 01:37:59,759
yes and now you've got all these other

3244
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,198
forces pushing and pulling

3245
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,039
and you're growing let's say your

3246
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:04,479
company was growing 50 percent

3247
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:05,679
you feel like wow i'm successful i made

3248
01:38:04,479 --> 01:38:07,279
a million dollars last year now i'm

3249
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,880
doing a million and a half

3250
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:10,399
and and the first thing that vc's going

3251
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,400
to say is how do we triple we're

3252
01:38:10,399 --> 01:38:14,319
we're growing too slow see but that's

3253
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:15,279
like you said that beautifully uh is a

3254
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,238
rocket fuel

3255
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:19,920
it's uh in in the sense it's a kind of

3256
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:22,638
motivation it's a drive i mean

3257
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:23,600
it's a positive so if you want that yes

3258
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:25,199
if you want that

3259
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,960
if you want that if you want to go to

3260
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:28,158
navy seal school

3261
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:29,679
you're going to be in pain and they're

3262
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:31,279
going to put that hose in your face

3263
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:32,639
while you're underwater with your hands

3264
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:33,840
tied behind your back in the pool and

3265
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:35,520
you're gonna be choking

3266
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,960
and you may have to do cpr and you in

3267
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:39,760
like every couple of years

3268
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,158
tragically somebody dies in navy sales

3269
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,679
school

3270
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:43,359
yeah well it doesn't mean we're getting

3271
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:44,399
rid of the navy seals rocky if he dies

3272
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:46,319
he dies i don't know if you know what

3273
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:47,519
david goggins is by any chance i do

3274
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:50,639
i mean i don't know him personally but

3275
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:52,159
oh my lord so i'm i'm running 48 miles

3276
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:54,480
together with him in person

3277
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:55,359
in a month you're doing an ultra

3278
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:58,399
marathon

3279
01:38:55,359 --> 01:38:59,679
with him and probably other stuff

3280
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:01,920
because he enjoys

3281
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:03,039
just breaking people making them cry so

3282
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,679
my god i'm so jelly

3283
01:39:03,039 --> 01:39:08,158
so you know i well i offered we we

3284
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:10,158
agreed a while ago to do a podcast

3285
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:12,479
and he's like oh yeah come we'll do it

3286
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:14,399
this day and this is all the bay area

3287
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:15,678
uh i don't know where the hell he is but

3288
01:39:14,399 --> 01:39:17,039
we're doing it and

3289
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:18,639
uh i don't think i'm supposed to say

3290
01:39:17,039 --> 01:39:19,439
where it is it's not anywhere close to

3291
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:21,600
anywhere

3292
01:39:19,439 --> 01:39:23,279
it's in the middle of nowhere but he

3293
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:24,079
seems to be in a bunch of different

3294
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:26,639
locations

3295
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:28,158
like he he's uh in oregon or something

3296
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,440
like that like what does he do for

3297
01:39:28,158 --> 01:39:30,638
outside of writing books and being

yeah beautiful so uh you guys went

3360
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:32,960
pretty

3361
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:35,440
heated uh yesterday against each other

3362
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:37,520
versus rob uh on robinhood yes maybe

3363
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:38,638
uh there's just two things i want to ask

3364
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,960
first

3365
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:42,719
on the actual robinhood discussion and

3366
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:44,480
the wall street best discussion

3367
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:46,480
can you steal manna's argument what was

3368
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:48,879
the nature of the disagreement where

3369
01:41:46,479 --> 01:41:50,799
so where yeah what what is the littlest

3370
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:54,079
because i don't think it's as big as

3371
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:55,440
spaces it came off as sounding what is

3372
01:41:54,079 --> 01:41:58,559
the nature of the disagreement

3373
01:41:55,439 --> 01:42:02,719
he felt that robin hood

3374
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:04,400
turned off trading because

3375
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:07,039
the hedge funds told them to and that

3376
01:42:04,399 --> 01:42:08,238
they were bowing down

3377
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:10,399
to the pressure of the hedge funds

3378
01:42:08,238 --> 01:42:11,839
that's not true but in a vacuum of

3379
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:13,359
information

3380
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:15,279
you know what happens to people's minds

3381
01:42:13,359 --> 01:42:16,880
conspiracy theories abound and

3382
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:18,800
sometimes there is a conspiracy theory

3383
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:21,920
and sometimes there's just

3384
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:24,560
the appearance of impropriety or

3385
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:26,719
a bunch of related things like when you

3386
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,760
look at the trump situation with russia

3387
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:29,439
like

3388
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:31,520
was trump trying to coordinate with

3389
01:42:29,439 --> 01:42:34,319
russia or were the russians just

3390
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:35,440
screwing with a bunch of like neophyte

3391
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:37,679
idiotic

3392
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:38,960
[ __ ] like you know donald trump jr

3393
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:40,319
who don't know any better

3394
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,000
and they don't know that you shouldn't

3395
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:43,920
meet with the russians

3396
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,439
and if you do meet with the russians you

3397
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,560
are probably a useful idiot you probably

3398
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:48,238
should tell the fbi

3399
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:49,600
like they're just a bunch of idiots in

3400
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:51,279
all likelihood who knows

3401
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,560
and it's a vacuum of information and

3402
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:53,118
there's a vacuum of information we don't

3403
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,560
know and

3404
01:42:53,118 --> 01:42:56,799
the russians are trying to compromise

3405
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:58,560
everybody so would you call it a

3406
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,760
conspiracy or would you call it an

3407
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:02,480
attempted

3408
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:04,480
you know uh conspiracy there was no

3409
01:43:02,479 --> 01:43:07,198
conspiracy here what it was was

3410
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:08,638
robin hood needed to raise billions of

3411
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:11,678
dollars to say solvent

3412
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:13,279
in all likelihood uh and they weren't

3413
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:15,359
allowed to talk about it

3414
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:16,639
so they were forced into not talking

3415
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:18,399
about it in all likelihood

3416
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:20,400
and had to come up with that money or

3417
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:20,879
shut down and then what got me upset

3418
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:24,238
with

3419
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:25,520
chamoth and we had a talk afterwards

3420
01:43:24,238 --> 01:43:27,359
that people don't know about i'll talk

3421
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,560
about it here for the first time on

3422
01:43:27,359 --> 01:43:30,639
sunday

3423
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,480
we had to have a little we had to air it

3424
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:35,118
out yeah in the episode after you guys

3425
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:36,799
sound like you've had a private you made

3426
01:43:35,118 --> 01:43:37,359
up we had a private discussion just one

3427
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,560
on one

3428
01:43:37,359 --> 01:43:40,319
and we said listen we love each other

3429
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,280
we're besties we've always been there

3430
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:43,118
for each other

3431
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:46,079
what happened here and what happened

3432
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:47,599
there is i'm fiercely loyal to my folks

3433
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:50,238
whether it's chamath or

3434
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:51,280
travis from uber or sax or whoever i'm

3435
01:43:50,238 --> 01:43:53,599
just a loyal guy

3436
01:43:51,279 --> 01:43:55,198
yes and i'm always ride or die with my

3437
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,719
founders if i invest in them even if

3438
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:58,879
they make a mistake and uber made plenty

3439
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,239
of mistakes i always went on cnbc

3440
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,079
on my podcast and said hey we're going

3441
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:03,279
to fix these things i'm in touch with

3442
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:05,198
the team

3443
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:07,359
mistakes were made we're going to solve

3444
01:44:05,198 --> 01:44:08,238
them this is a group of people with

3445
01:44:07,359 --> 01:44:09,599
great intent

3446
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:11,759
who want to make the world a better

3447
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,119
place and you know what i was hated for

3448
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:15,039
for a period of time with uber

3449
01:44:13,118 --> 01:44:16,719
i was hated for it last week with robin

3450
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:19,519
hood i got a lot of

3451
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:20,880
blow back but i think in both of those

3452
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,080
cases eventually i was right uber's

3453
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,199
doing great stuff in the world

3454
01:44:22,079 --> 01:44:25,279
robin hood's doing great stuff in the

3455
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:27,519
world and i like to be loyal to my

3456
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:29,039
investments and my partners to to just

3457
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,119
i feel like if you invest and you're on

3458
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:32,399
the team

3459
01:44:31,118 --> 01:44:34,079
you know you have really three choices

3460
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:35,279
you can either fight for your team you

3461
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:36,399
can go silent

3462
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:38,719
uh or you can throw your team under the

3463
01:44:36,399 --> 01:44:40,000
bus and i've watched investors throw the

3464
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:40,960
team that they invested in that made

3465
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,880
them a bunch of money

3466
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,399
under the bus not acceptable to me and

3467
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:45,679
being quiet it's not acceptable to me so

3468
01:44:44,399 --> 01:44:46,000
i always ask the founder do you want me

3469
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:47,760
to

3470
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,840
is it okay if i go out and defend you

3471
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:51,119
publicly if they say yes i do it

3472
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,560
and then beautiful by the way because

3473
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,519
what else do we have in this world if

3474
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,880
not friendship it's

3475
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,760
loyalty means everything i grew up in

3476
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:59,679
brooklyn where if you were not loyal

3477
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,760
and you you know and you were not loyal

3478
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:04,880
to your crew then

3479
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:06,800
you were a ronin you were you know out

3480
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,480
there on your own flailing in the

3481
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:11,199
you know trust me you do not want to be

3482
01:45:08,479 --> 01:45:12,959
on your own in 1970s 80s brooklyn

3483
01:45:11,198 --> 01:45:14,319
manhattan like you need to have a crew

3484
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,439
with you i've gotten into

3485
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:17,599
you know you don't want to get into a

3486
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:19,039
fight with 10 guys and be alone

3487
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:20,800
or just be with you you need a crew to

3488
01:45:19,039 --> 01:45:23,920
survive so i just learned or

3489
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,279
earlier my dad who owned a bar um just

3490
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,960
drilled into me being loyal

3491
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:28,639
and so for whatever reason i'm a bulldog

3492
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,439
when it comes to loyalty and chamoth

3493
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:31,359
came out and said

3494
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:32,799
you know these guys need to go to jail

3495
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:34,479
and they're scumbags

3496
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:36,000
and i and i'm trying to defend them and

3497
01:45:34,479 --> 01:45:36,479
i'm in a position where i can't defend

3498
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,600
them

3499
01:45:36,479 --> 01:45:38,799
because i don't have complete

3500
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:40,000
information there is no complete

3501
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,639
information it's in the heat of the

3502
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,719
moment

3503
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:45,118
and then it becomes the number one story

3504
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:47,520
yeah and it's my number three investment

3505
01:45:45,118 --> 01:45:48,238
yeah and chamath has a competing company

3506
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,199
sophie

3507
01:45:48,238 --> 01:45:52,559
yeah and he's killing my guys and then i

3508
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:54,079
started killing his guys

3509
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,760
yes and then all of a sudden we're like

3510
01:45:54,079 --> 01:45:59,600
wait a second we're best friends

3511
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:00,320
yes and we're swinging our swords at

3512
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,400
each other

3513
01:46:00,319 --> 01:46:04,559
and we're a group of the seven samurai

3514
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:06,799
who fight together

3515
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:08,159
when did we turn on each other and then

3516
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,800
everybody else who's on the pod the two

3517
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:10,559
davids

3518
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:12,800
who you know both on the spectrum a bit

3519
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:16,400
like a little aspergers or whatever

3520
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:18,880
no effects left none taken

3521
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:20,719
i'm not saying you know yeah there is a

3522
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:22,560
yeah if you're into a.i

3523
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:24,000
you know you might be somewhere not a

3524
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,360
coincidence yeah might not be

3525
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,560
coincidence anyway we upgraded the two

3526
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:28,399
david's firmware we're going to upgrade

3527
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,639
your firmware after this i'll give you

3528
01:46:28,399 --> 01:46:32,238
yeah you haven't you're on the 1.5 you

3529
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:33,840
have the three emotions now or should we

3530
01:46:32,238 --> 01:46:35,359
add fourth no you want to go with joy

3531
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,480
yeah i'm going to play 2.0 or you're the

3532
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:39,198
2.0 you got the joy

3533
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:40,879
yeah how's it working difficult it's

3534
01:46:39,198 --> 01:46:42,960
difficult you'll get there

3535
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:44,800
just let it happen lex just let the let

3536
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:46,158
the joy happen

3537
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,360
so anyway we just talked about it

3538
01:46:46,158 --> 01:46:52,079
offline and we decided like listen

3539
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:53,679
we didn't pre-game that episode and i

3540
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:55,279
would happen to be skiing with my family

3541
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:55,679
i had taken the first like vacation

3542
01:46:55,279 --> 01:46:57,679
since

3543
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:58,960
goddamn pandemic started and i was

3544
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:00,399
having a wonderful time and then this

3545
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:01,679
whole thing blows up i'm coming off the

3546
01:47:00,399 --> 01:47:03,039
mountain

3547
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,960
just you know having a great time with

3548
01:47:03,039 --> 01:47:06,238
my daughter skiing and you know and then

3549
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:07,760
i'm mixing it up with him and

3550
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:09,198
you know he had a short fuse about it

3551
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,480
because he was triggered he told me

3552
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:12,238
because

3553
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:14,559
he really feels like he's fighting to

3554
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:14,959
defend you know the everyman and i was

3555
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,800
like

3556
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:18,319
that's what my team's doing that's why

3557
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,279
they named the company robin hood

3558
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:22,719
yeah we're on the same side here and

3559
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:24,238
then over time we've started to see the

3560
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:26,719
explanation come out and

3561
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:28,000
you know people who are friends are

3562
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:29,600
going to have disagreements

3563
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,439
in the podcast it happened to happen

3564
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:33,760
very publicly and we didn't know it was

3565
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:35,839
going to become the number one story

3566
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,800
in the world if trump still had his

3567
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:39,279
twitter handle

3568
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:40,480
this would not have been a story trump

3569
01:47:39,279 --> 01:47:42,238
would have said something

3570
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:44,000
about gamestop and he would have

3571
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:46,319
co-opted the entire conversation

3572
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,439
so in a way going back to our censorship

3573
01:47:46,319 --> 01:47:49,359
discussion

3574
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:51,039
i might actually be in favor of trump

3575
01:47:49,359 --> 01:47:54,880
being censored

3576
01:47:51,039 --> 01:47:57,118
only because only because how delightful

3577
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:59,359
has it been since january 20th

3578
01:47:57,118 --> 01:48:00,799
that we can all focus on something other

3579
01:47:59,359 --> 01:48:04,079
than him

3580
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:08,239
yeah he was exhausting i mean the amount

3581
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:08,238
of cycles he took on our processors

3582
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:12,800
and now this is a little bit more of a

3583
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:14,399
distributed like this yeah everybody

3584
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,800
gets a chance to be the number one news

3585
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:17,039
story

3586
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:19,119
everybody gets a chance to discuss it

3587
01:48:17,039 --> 01:48:20,000
but so on a scale of one to ten how much

3588
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:22,639
do you love uh

3589
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,079
chamath oh it's eleven i mean i love

3590
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:24,639
chamoth i mean we played cards last

3591
01:48:24,079 --> 01:48:26,399
night

3592
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:28,159
we're besties and you know i would i

3593
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:29,439
would i would literally jump in front of

3594
01:48:28,158 --> 01:48:30,559
a bullet for him

3595
01:48:29,439 --> 01:48:32,158
i mean what's the lesson in that

3596
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:32,800
discussion because it was super i

3597
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:34,319
wouldn't

3598
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:35,840
i think the love was felt and the

3599
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:37,279
respect was felt throughout even when

3600
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,920
you guys are going pretty vicious on

3601
01:48:37,279 --> 01:48:40,079
each other

3602
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,000
i uh is there a lesson to be learned do

3603
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:42,800
you regret any of that conversation i

3604
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,198
mean i think

3605
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,400
he he he told me that he regretted some

3606
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:48,000
things he said he said publicly on the

3607
01:48:46,399 --> 01:48:49,118
podcast like listen i was a little hot i

3608
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,359
may have said things

3609
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:52,639
in the heat of the moment but i don't

3610
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:54,000
live with too much regret because i

3611
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:56,159
always think about intent

3612
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,079
it's one of the new nuance and intent

3613
01:48:56,158 --> 01:49:00,000
have been totally lost

3614
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:01,760
the idea that we could have any of kind

3615
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,198
of a nuanced discussion about things

3616
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:05,600
seems to have been

3617
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:07,359
forgotten and the fact that people don't

3618
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:09,440
look at people's intent

3619
01:49:07,359 --> 01:49:11,039
if you hurt somebody's feelings or you

3620
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:14,399
disrespect somebody

3621
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:16,960
or you you do something mean or whatever

3622
01:49:14,399 --> 01:49:18,238
i always look at the intent you know and

3623
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:20,560
i've had people

3624
01:49:18,238 --> 01:49:21,439
attack me and i look at the intent and

3625
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:23,199
i'm like

3626
01:49:21,439 --> 01:49:25,439
that person feels bad about themselves

3627
01:49:23,198 --> 01:49:26,799
or maybe i said something and i insulted

3628
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:28,158
them and that's why their blowbacks

3629
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:29,760
there so i was trying to think what's

3630
01:49:28,158 --> 01:49:32,158
the intent of the person and then

3631
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:33,520
almost universally you talk to somebody

3632
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:36,638
and you find out

3633
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:37,119
you ascribe some crazy intent that's not

3634
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:38,159
there

3635
01:49:37,118 --> 01:49:39,759
and they're like oh yeah you know what

3636
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:40,319
happened i got in a fight with my spouse

3637
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:42,159
and i

3638
01:49:40,319 --> 01:49:43,359
didn't sleep last night and i've had a

3639
01:49:42,158 --> 01:49:45,679
lot of anxiety about

3640
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:46,399
my business and i i just snapped and

3641
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:48,639
said something

3642
01:49:46,399 --> 01:49:50,960
about you and it's like oh okay like i

3643
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:54,319
literally had somebody on twitter

3644
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:55,840
um this past summer i had said something

3645
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:57,599
um i was complaining about a new york

3646
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,719
times journalist uh

3647
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:00,800
and something i thought was wrong and

3648
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:03,039
this person was a fan of that journalist

3649
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:04,320
and they went i kid you not onto my

3650
01:50:03,039 --> 01:50:06,399
social media account

3651
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:08,719
found a picture i'd taken about the how

3652
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:11,598
blue the sky was one day

3653
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:12,239
they reverse image search the tree line

3654
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:15,199
found

3655
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:16,238
the tree line on google image or somehow

3656
01:50:15,198 --> 01:50:20,000
the reverse image search

3657
01:50:16,238 --> 01:50:21,198
found a an old listing that some broker

3658
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,760
had listed on their like

3659
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:26,079

01:52:29,198 --> 01:52:32,799
the same thing to me all the time

3730
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:33,840
welcome to the club it's totally fine

3731
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:36,480
this this this

3732
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,920
the intent nuance it matters right and

3733
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:39,439
the person could be having a bad day and

3734
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:41,279
they do something stupid they regret and

3735
01:52:39,439 --> 01:52:43,678
what am i gonna do cancel the guy

3736
01:52:41,279 --> 01:52:44,960
or if i had called his boss he would

3737
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:46,399
have been fired immediately

3738
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:48,800
yeah and then i got to live with this

3739
01:52:46,399 --> 01:52:50,960
guy got fired and he's a

3740
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,320
got a kid and what is this personal

3741
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,880
destruction why are we doing this to

3742
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:55,679
each other

3743
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:57,039
life's hard enough yeah life's hard

3744
01:52:55,679 --> 01:52:57,679
right like just getting through the days

3745
01:52:57,039 --> 01:53:00,158
hard

3746
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:01,520
yeah and and that little bit of empathy

3747
01:53:00,158 --> 01:53:02,638
uh thinking about the intent of the

3748
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,639
person

3749
01:53:02,639 --> 01:53:06,079
allows you to then sort of de-escalate

3750
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:08,800
this kind of conversation that

3751
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:09,519
social media wants to escalate yes so

3752
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:12,400
social media

3753
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:12,880
what we were saying yeah if if this in

3754
01:53:12,399 --> 01:53:14,799
in

3755
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:16,079
my younger years i would have retweeted

3756
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:17,679
the guy's homepage

3757
01:53:16,079 --> 01:53:18,880
and my address and would have called his

3758
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:19,359
boss and tried to get him fired or

3759
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:22,239
whatever

3760
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:24,158
and it's like now i'm just like what why

3761
01:53:22,238 --> 01:53:25,519
are we attacking each other life is so

3762
01:53:24,158 --> 01:53:26,799
hard i mean this is what the pandemic i

3763
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,440
think should make everybody realize is

3764
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,480
like

3765
01:53:27,439 --> 01:53:31,839
look at that how hard it is life is hard

3766
01:53:30,479 --> 01:53:33,279
and then just think about all the people

3767
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:34,719
suffering right now who are at home the

3768
01:53:33,279 --> 01:53:37,759
single mom or dad

3769
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:38,480
with two or three kids at home in public

3770
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,400
school

3771
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:41,919
maybe they've been laid off and their

3772
01:53:40,399 --> 01:53:44,799
kids aren't learning

3773
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:46,319
and they're in a tiny apartment i mean

3774
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,639
this has been brutal for a lot of people

3775
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:48,399
and

3776
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:50,079
not to mention people losing loved ones

3777
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:52,000
or maybe some people got corona and now

3778
01:53:50,079 --> 01:53:55,198
their lungs are still not right

3779
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,679
i can ask you about love oh sure

3780
01:53:55,198 --> 01:53:58,479

3781
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:00,000

if it's eric weinstein level but i feel

3787
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:12,239
like it's close

3788
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:14,719
yeah i'm feeling the love but you we

3789
01:54:12,238 --> 01:54:14,718
talked about the

3790
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:18,320
there's music to my ears your whole rant

3791
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:23,439
on the

3792
01:54:18,319 --> 01:54:26,960
the olympic nature of a startup

3793
01:54:23,439 --> 01:54:30,960
is there a role like what role does love

3794
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:35,118
family friendship play in that

3795
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:37,039
brutal pursuit of excellence that is

3796
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:39,039
building a startup building a company or

3797
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:40,479
building any creating anything new in

3798
01:54:39,039 --> 01:54:43,279
this world

3799
01:54:40,479 --> 01:54:44,559
such a great question um and and totally

3800
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:46,399
unprepared for it

3801
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:48,000
uh because i no one would ever ask me

3802
01:54:46,399 --> 01:54:50,799
about that so i think it's why you've

3803
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,399
you've got quite a following uh on your

3804
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,360
podcast is that you're able to ask these

3805
01:54:52,399 --> 01:54:56,479
questions and

3806
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:57,439
um i could tell one story because uh you

3807
01:54:56,479 --> 01:54:58,799
know i don't talk about

3808
01:54:57,439 --> 01:55:01,839
i try not to talk about relationship

3809
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:03,679
with elon that often because

3810
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:05,760
you know he's so famous now yeah i mean

3811
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:06,239
when we met i used to go out to parties

3812
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,360
with him

3813
01:55:06,238 --> 01:55:08,638
and people like oh my god you're jason

3814
01:55:07,359 --> 01:55:09,920
calacas yeah and like who's your friend

3815
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:11,039
i'm like how's my friend elon he's

3816
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:12,719
and they'd be like what he's doing

3817
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:13,359
rocket ships but he's told this story

3818
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:15,039
publicly

3819
01:55:13,359 --> 01:55:16,158
so i can tell it and it would never talk

3820
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:17,519
about anything that he hasn't already

3821
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:18,559
talked about publicly especially since

3822
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:19,920
he saw a high profile but it was a

3823
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:22,880
pretty funny moment

3824
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:24,319
um he there there was a moment in time

3825
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,239
when tesla almost went out of business

3826
01:55:24,319 --> 01:55:27,679
and you've probably heard the story uh

3827
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:29,678
many times but it was during the

3828
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:32,480
financial crisis and

3829
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:34,399
uh they were running out of money and i

3830
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:36,718
said uh

3831
01:55:34,399 --> 01:55:38,319
uh you know let's go get a steak and

3832
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:40,319
we're in la and we drove to boa

3833
01:55:38,319 --> 01:55:43,519
and i had my orange tesla roadster and

3834
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:45,039
he had his p1 or p2 like the red one

3835
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:47,760
that i think is in space now

3836
01:55:45,039 --> 01:55:49,679
um and we drove to the valet and we had

3837
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:51,679
a stake together and we're sitting there

3838
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:52,719

3895
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:33,679
beings standing around

3896
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:34,959

3907
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:53,760
i said what is it going to cost he says

3908
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:57,598
i think this could cost eventually 50

3909
01:57:53,760 --> 01:58:00,079
60 000 i said elon if you make that car

3910
01:57:57,599 --> 01:58:03,039

that's yours yeah it's like well i got

3966
01:59:44,319 --> 01:59:48,079

3967
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:49,359
first person to ordered it

3968
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:50,960
and i was the first person who had seen

3969
01:59:49,359 --> 01:59:51,439
you gonna give me the deterioration and

3970
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:53,439
then i

3971
01:59:51,439 --> 01:59:54,960
know it was a very beautiful moment it

3972
01:59:53,439 --> 01:59:56,319
was an incredible moment for both of us

3973
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:58,079
and we talk about it sometimes

3974
01:59:56,319 --> 01:59:59,759
uh you know those moments in time and

3975
01:59:58,079 --> 02:00:01,599
when you to your point about love

3976
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,280
the darkest moment but one of the

3977
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:04,800
darkest moments in his life probably

3978
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:06,158
that i think it was i could tell you it

3979
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:07,360
was the darkest period of his life for

3980
02:00:06,158 --> 02:00:09,279
sure

3981
02:00:07,359 --> 02:00:11,039
and he's been very public about how dark

3982
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:12,479
that was and i think you know

3983
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:14,158
this is why i have great sympathy for

3984
02:00:12,479 --> 02:00:15,359
the entrepreneurs of the world like the

3985
02:00:14,158 --> 02:00:16,479
suffering and the pain

3986
02:00:15,359 --> 02:00:18,319
and when he talks about the suffering

3987
02:00:16,479 --> 02:00:19,678
and the pain that all of these founders

3988
02:00:18,319 --> 02:00:21,439
have felt and then we we're throwing

3989
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:22,719
rocks at them we're criticizing them as

3990
02:00:21,439 --> 02:00:23,359
they try to change the world and save

3991
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:25,920
humanity

3992
02:00:23,359 --> 02:00:26,399
and in tesla's case i mean they weren't

3993
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:28,480
you know

3994
02:00:26,399 --> 02:00:30,479
they weren't like delivering pizza i

3995
02:00:28,479 --> 02:00:32,319
mean they were trying to get us off of

3996
02:00:30,479 --> 02:00:34,718
fossil fuels like this was a big

3997
02:00:32,319 --> 02:00:36,799
heady mission to literally save the

3998
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:38,560
environment the planet humanity

3999
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:40,079
and the way they shorted that stock and

4000
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:43,119
they attacked him

4001
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:46,319
it was always perplexing to me why

4002
02:00:43,118 --> 02:00:47,198
any human being who is standing on god's

4003
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:50,399
green earth

4004
02:00:47,198 --> 02:00:52,158
would want to throw rocks at the guy who

4005
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:54,479
is trying to stem

4006
02:00:52,158 --> 02:00:55,198
the dam of global warming that is about

4007
02:00:54,479 --> 02:00:58,638
to engulf

4008
02:00:55,198 --> 02:00:59,439
all of us how dare they throw rocks at

4009
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:01,279
that guy

4010
02:00:59,439 --> 02:01:03,279
yeah there's so many people you throw

4011
02:01:01,279 --> 02:01:04,319
rocks at there's somebody who's making

4012
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:06,719
the jewel

4013
02:01:04,319 --> 02:01:07,759
vaporizer throw rocks at that scumbag no

4014
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:09,279
offense

4015
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:11,760
but like whoever's making the jewel

4016
02:01:09,279 --> 02:01:13,679
things and you know selling pina colada

4017
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:16,400
flavor to 12 year olds

4018
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:18,158
like throw rocks at them somebody's

4019
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:18,879
doing something you know abhorrent but

4020
02:01:18,158 --> 02:01:22,079
not e

4021
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:25,359
i mean and uh yeah anyway

4022
02:01:22,079 --> 02:01:27,760
that car is you know up the road here

4023
02:01:25,359 --> 02:01:29,679
sitting under a cover yeah with 20 000

4024
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:31,360
miles on it in my garage

4025
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:33,199
and then the roadster number 16 is in

4026
02:01:31,359 --> 02:01:34,319
the garage next to it and every day i

4027
02:01:33,198 --> 02:01:35,839
walk by the two of them

4028
02:01:34,319 --> 02:01:37,920
and i get a warm feeling in my heart

4029
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:41,279
because i know he did it yeah

4030
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:44,719
against all odds against all odds he

4031
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:47,599
pulled it off uh and it was

4032
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:48,079
that moment that month in that 2000 it

4033
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:49,440
was ja

4034
02:01:48,079 --> 02:01:51,679
it was probably december january

4035
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:52,960
december of 2008 i think

4036
02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:55,118
you know it's just 12 years ago when you

4037
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:56,800
think about 13 years ago it was dark

4038
02:01:55,118 --> 02:01:58,238
i mean it was dark and they they almost

4039
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:00,159
had the same thing happen

4040
02:01:58,238 --> 02:02:02,238
uh you know in the model 3 production in

4041
02:02:00,158 --> 02:02:04,638
june of two years three years ago

4042
02:02:02,238 --> 02:02:06,238
and i remember him just trying to get

4043
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:07,520
the model 3 out the door and the company

4044
02:02:06,238 --> 02:02:08,799
almost crashed then

4045
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:10,560
most of these companies have you know

4046
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:13,360
these kind of moments um

4047
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:14,719
and i think friendship is you get what

4048
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:17,359
you give

4049
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:18,719
you get what you give and if you are

4050
02:02:17,359 --> 02:02:20,079
there for people

4051
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:22,158
you're going to feel so good about

4052
02:02:20,079 --> 02:02:26,079
having done that

4053
02:02:22,158 --> 02:02:27,759
and then the the

4054
02:02:26,079 --> 02:02:29,279
the reciprocation effect which you

4055
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:31,360
probably know very well

4056
02:02:29,279 --> 02:02:33,039
is so great in the world that anytime

4057
02:02:31,359 --> 02:02:34,639
you're kind to people

4058
02:02:33,039 --> 02:02:36,399
you build this incredible bond and then

4059
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:39,520
what what are we at the end of the day

4060
02:02:36,399 --> 02:02:41,118
lex besides a series of memories with

4061
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:43,840
the people we love

4062
02:02:41,118 --> 02:02:44,559
that's all it is it's just a series of

4063
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:47,520
memories

4064
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:48,639
and moments it's just moments you ever

4065
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:50,800
see blade runner

4066
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:52,159
yes of course do you remember what

4067
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:54,159
rucker harrah says at the end

4068
02:02:52,158 --> 02:02:55,679
all of these memories gone like tears in

4069
02:02:54,158 --> 02:02:56,799
the rain yeah i mean that's our

4070
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:59,520
existence

4071
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:00,000
it just all goes away at some point it's

4072
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,840
just these

4073
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,158
drops of rain each each of those

4074
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:05,119
memories just like one snowflake or one

4075
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:06,559
drop of rain

4076
02:03:05,118 --> 02:03:08,158
and they're all lost at some point but

4077
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:09,840
they're here now

4078
02:03:08,158 --> 02:03:11,439
and that's why we have to be there for

4079
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:13,440
each other that's why

4080
02:03:11,439 --> 02:03:14,559
i feel like what i do is so important in

4081
02:03:13,439 --> 02:03:16,158
this world

4082
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,840
and i get such great meaning out of it

4083
02:03:16,158 --> 02:03:18,799
just being a friend just having these

4084
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:21,440
conversations

4085
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:23,199
what you're doing on your podcast just

4086
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:25,678
talking to intelligent people

4087
02:03:23,198 --> 02:03:27,279
and spreading the word and the disciple

4088
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:29,279
the gospel of what they're saying

4089
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:31,118
and amplifying it you're inspiring so

4090
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:32,639
many people every podcast you get 500

4091
02:03:31,118 --> 02:03:33,598
000 people a million people watch these

4092
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:35,679
videos

4093
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:37,440
and there's some kid in sri lanka or

4094
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:39,679
some little girl in afghanistan who's

4095
02:03:37,439 --> 02:03:41,279
going to stumble upon this on youtube

4096
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:42,719
and they're going to change the world in

4097
02:03:41,279 --> 02:03:46,079
the next century

4098
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:48,078
because it's not just about america

4099
02:03:46,079 --> 02:03:49,359
our story is almost over right like we

4100
02:03:48,078 --> 02:03:50,559
we were the story of the last two or

4101
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:50,960
three hundred years i hope it keeps

4102
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,239
going

4103
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,880
but there's all these other places in

4104
02:03:52,238 --> 02:03:57,839
the world sao paulo and and africa

4105
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:59,039
where people now have access to these

4106
02:03:57,840 --> 02:04:00,719
videos

4107
02:03:59,039 --> 02:04:02,960
and somebody will have this video and go

4108
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:03,760

4113
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,319
amidst the suffering with elon

4114
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:15,679
because you've talked about it you'll

4115
02:04:14,319 --> 02:04:16,960
have these ripple effects it's

4116
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:19,679
fascinating to think about it

4117
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:20,480
so weird to come in new entrepreneurs

4118
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:23,279
being born

4119
02:04:20,479 --> 02:04:24,078

more support through these rough times

4122
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:29,439
when you're

4123
02:04:27,118 --> 02:04:31,118
people are trying to create new things i

4124
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:32,638

i'm

4128
02:04:36,399 --> 02:04:40,559
deeply uh grateful that you're loyal

4129
02:04:39,359 --> 02:04:43,118
every time you invest

4130
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:45,280
you are here's the thing it costs you

4131
02:04:43,118 --> 02:04:47,279
nothing to make this investment either

4132
02:04:45,279 --> 02:04:49,439
the the amount of time it takes to be

4133
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:53,679
bitter or angry

4134
02:04:49,439 --> 02:04:55,039
uh sitting at home uh to be disappointed

4135
02:04:53,679 --> 02:04:56,880
you could just channel that same amount

4136
02:04:55,039 --> 02:05:00,078
of energy into being loyal

4137
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:02,480
loving kind and there for people it just

4138
02:05:00,078 --> 02:05:04,639
only takes the intention right the water

4139
02:05:02,479 --> 02:05:06,078
is gonna those emotions are gonna flow

4140
02:05:04,639 --> 02:05:08,078
right like sam would always tell me when

4141
02:05:06,078 --> 02:05:09,759
i was struggling in my life

4142
02:05:08,078 --> 02:05:11,279
and i talked to him he'd say you know

4143
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,560
jason your brain is spewing all these

4144
02:05:11,279 --> 02:05:14,399
ideas

4145
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:17,039
imagine you're standing sitting by a

4146
02:05:14,399 --> 02:05:18,479
river and the river is all your ideas

4147
02:05:17,039 --> 02:05:20,479
you are not a slave to any one of these

4148
02:05:18,479 --> 02:05:22,158
ideas they're just whipping by like each

4149
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:24,000
of those little waves in the river

4150
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:25,519
you can pick one of those ideas out and

4151
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,198
look at it and examine it

4152
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:28,719
and either keep it or throw it back in

4153
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:31,198
the river and let it go

4154
02:05:28,719 --> 02:05:32,719
and i was like wow sam that was like of

4155
02:05:31,198 --> 02:05:34,158
my entire friendship with sam harris

4156
02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:36,078
that was like the one moment where i was

4157
02:05:34,158 --> 02:05:37,759
just like oh my god

4158
02:05:36,078 --> 02:05:39,599
all my life i've wondered about all

4159
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:43,280
these thoughts in my head

4160
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:46,560

4220
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:32,639
we added this other

4221
02:07:29,118 --> 02:07:35,598

them die we talked about that j

4229
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:50,880
curve early imagine it's like um

4230
02:07:49,039 --> 02:07:52,399
it's like all these baby turtles going

4231
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:54,480
out to the ocean and the seagulls are

4232
02:07:52,399 --> 02:07:56,719
ripping them to shreds and then their

4233
02:07:54,479 --> 02:07:58,559
sharks are eating them but then like a

4234
02:07:56,719 --> 02:08:00,719
couple of the turtles make it

4235
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:01,840
and they become wise old 100 year old

4236
02:08:00,719 --> 02:08:04,078
turtles yeah

4237
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:06,000
you know and you're like yep i remember

4238
02:08:04,078 --> 02:08:07,679
when you catched

4239
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,198
and like all of your brothers and

4240
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:11,279
sisters were ripped to shreds by the

4241
02:08:09,198 --> 02:08:12,638
seagulls and you made it into the water

4242
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:14,559
and then you made it out into the deep

4243
02:08:12,639 --> 02:08:17,118
water it's a pretty great feeling

4244
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,000
i think there's no better way to end it

4245
02:08:17,118 --> 02:08:20,479
there it is

4246
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,078
the talk of the cruelty of life that's

4247
02:08:20,479 --> 02:08:24,238
suffering that is life

4248
02:08:22,078 --> 02:08:26,000

thinks that they got there alone

4261
02:08:45,039 --> 02:08:48,399
is delusional and kidding themselves and

4262
02:08:47,039 --> 02:08:50,639

02:08:48,399 --> 02:08:52,000

jason kilikanis the number one reason a

4333
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:00,960

4334
02:10:58,399 --> 02:11:01,759

4335
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:04,639
one reason

4336
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:05,440
a startup fails is that the founder

4337
02:11:04,639 --> 02:11:08,159

4338
02:11:05,439 --> 02:11:08,559
