00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
the following is a conversation with rob

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,278
reed entrepreneur

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:10,000
author and host of the after on podcast

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:11,120
sam harris recommended that i absolutely

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,599
must talk to rob

6
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,119
about his recent work on the future of

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,118
engineer pandemics

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,320
i then listened to the four hours

9
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,960
special episode

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,600
of sam's making sense podcast with rob

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,080
titled

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,960
engineering the apocalypse and i was

13
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,278
floored

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,719
and knew i had to talk to him quick

15
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,079
mention of our sponsors

16
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:34,320
athletic greens volcano fund rise

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,719
and netsuite check them out in the

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,799
description to support this podcast

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,480
as a side note let me say a few words

20
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,039
about the lab leak hypothesis

21
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,679
which proposes that covet 19 is a

22
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,439
product

23
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,079
of gain of function research on

24
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,359
coronaviruses conducted at the wuhan

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,520
institute of virology

26
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,878
that was then accidentally leaked due to

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
human error

28
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:56,558
for context this lab is biosafety level

29
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,078
4 bsl4

30
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,679
and it investigates coronaviruses bsl4

31
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,439
is the highest level of safety

32
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,040
but if you look at all the human in the

33
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,000
loop pieces required to achieve this

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
level of safety

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,359
it becomes clear that even bsl4 labs are

36
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,200
highly susceptible to human error

37
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,280
to me whether the virus leaked from the

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,759
lab or not getting to the bottom of what

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,759
happened

40
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,118
is about much more than this particular

41
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,840
catastrophic case

42
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,400
it is a test for our scientific

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,880
political

44
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
journalistic and social institutions of

45
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,000
how well

46
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,039
we can prepare and respond to threats

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,519
that can [ __ ]

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,118
or destroy human civilization if we

49
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,000
continue to gain a function research on

50
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,959
viruses

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,478
eventually these viruses will leak and

52
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,039
they will be more deadly

53
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,159
and more contagious we can pretend that

54
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,240
won't happen

55
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
or we can openly and honestly talk about

56
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,158
the risks involved

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,079
this research can both save and destroy

58
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,640
human life on earth as we know it

59
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,559
it's a powerful double-edged sword if

60
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,718
youtube and other platforms

61
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,759
censor conversations about this if

62
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,919
scientists

63
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,759
self-censored conversations about this

64
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,640
would become merely victims

65
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,759
of our brief homo sapiens story not its

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,479
heroes

67
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,959
as i said before too carelessly labeling

68
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,520
ideas

69
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,640
as misinformation and dismissing them

70
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,719
because of that

71
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,238
will eventually destroy our ability to

72
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,479
discover the truth

73
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,599
and without truth we don't have a

74
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,639
fighting chance

75
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,878
against the great filter before us

76
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,479
this is the lex friedman podcast and

77
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:30,159
here is my conversation

78
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:32,000
with rob reed i have seen evidence on

79
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,479
the internet that you have a sense of

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
humor

81
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,878
allegedly but you also talk and think

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,080
about the destruction of human

83
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,919
civilization

84
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,120
what do you think of the elon musk

85
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,878
hypothesis that

86
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,319
the most entertaining outcome is the

87
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,639
most likely

88
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,598
and he i think followed on to say a

89
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,279
scene from

90
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,719
an external observer like if somebody

91
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,159
was watching us

92
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:56,639
it seems we come up with creative ways

93
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,519
of progressing our civilization that's

94
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,238
fun to watch

95
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,680
yeah so he exactly he said from the

96
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,560
standpoint of the observer not the

97
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,879
participant

98
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,080
right and so what's interesting about

99
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:07,598
that this were

100
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,760
i think just a couple of freestanding

101
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,518
tweets and and delivered

102
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,959
without a whole lot of rapper of context

103
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,439
so it's left to the mind of the

104
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,719
the reader of the tweets yes to infer

105
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,439
what he was talking about but

106
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,959
so that's kind of like it provokes some

107
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,639
interesting thoughts like first of all

108
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,158
it presupposes the existence

109
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:28,000
of an observer and it also presupposes

110
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,560
that the observer wishes to be

111
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
entertained and has some mechanism

112
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,759
of enforcing their desire to be

113
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,039
entertained so there's like a lot

114
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,359
underpinning that

115
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,719
and to me that suggests particularly

116
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,319
coming from elon

117
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,919
that it's a reference to simulation

118
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,079
theory that you know

119
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,919
somebody is out there and has far

120
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,879
greater insights and a far greater

121
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,719
ability

122
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,079
to let's say peer into a single

123
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,000
individual life

124
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,159
and find that entertaining and full of

125
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,039
plot twists and surprises and

126
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,679
either a happier tragic ending or they

127
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,318
have a

128
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,920
incredible meta view and they can watch

129
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,158
the arc of civilization

130
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,079
unfolding in a way that is entertaining

131
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,000
and full of plot twists and surprises

132
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,400
and a happy or unhappy ending

133
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,759
so okay so we're presupposing an

134
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,760
observer

135
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,120
then on top of that when you think about

136
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:20,478
it you're also presupposing a producer

137
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,720
because the act of observation is

138
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,240
mostly fun if there are plot twists and

139
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,759
surprises and other developments that

140
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,800
you weren't foreseeing

141
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,360
i have re-read my own novels and that's

142
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,040
fun

143
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,960
because it's something i worked hard on

144
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,639
and i slaved over and i love

145
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,079
but there aren't a lot of surprises in

146
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,199
there so now i'm thinking

147
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:41,279
we need a producer and an observer for

148
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,680
that to be true and on top of that

149
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,279
it's got to be a very competent producer

150
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,680
because elon said the most

151
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,679
entertaining outcome is the most likely

152
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,199
one so there's lots of layers for

153
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,360
thinking about that

154
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,960
and when you've got a producer who's

155
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,319
trying to make it entertaining it makes

156
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,120
me think of there was a south park

157
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,879
episode

158
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,399
in which earth turned out to be a

159
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,199
reality show yeah

160
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,519
and somehow we had failed to entertain

161
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,720
the audience as much as we used to so

162
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,959
the earth show was going to get

163
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,639
cancelled et cetera

164
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,399
so taking all that together and i'm

165
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,918
obviously being a little bit playful and

166
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,038
laying this out

167
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:19,599
what is the evidence that we have that

168
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,599
there we are in a reality that is

169
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
intended to be most entertaining

170
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,879
now you could look at that reality on

171
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
the level of individual

172
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,038
lives or the whole arc of civilization

173
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,840
other lives you know levels as well i'm

174
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,159
sure

175
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,319
but just looking from my own life i

176
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,199
think i'd make a pretty lousy show

177
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,800
i spend an inordinate amount of time

178
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,400
just looking at a computer

179
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,560
i don't think that's very entertaining

180
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,198
and there's just a completely

181
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,759
inadequate level of shootouts and car

182
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,680
chases

183
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,439
in my life i mean i'll go weeks even

184
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,918
months without a single shootout or car

185
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,199
chase

186
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:52,879
that just means that you're one of the

187
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,038
non-player characters in this game

188
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,279
you're just waiting

189
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,800
you're an extra that waiting for you one

190
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,559
opportunity for a brief moment to

191
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
actually interact with one of the main

192
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,759
um one of the main characters in the

193
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,239
play just saying okay that's

194
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,439
that's good so okay so we'll rule out me

195
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,879
being the star of the show which i

196
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,079
probably could have guessed at

197
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,079
anyway but then even the arc of

198
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,680
civilization yeah i mean there have been

199
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,120
a lot of really intriguing things that

200
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,319
have happened and a lot of astounding

201
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,478
things that have happened

202
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,879
but you know i would have some

203
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,639
werewolves i'd have some zombies

204
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,719
you know i would have some really

205
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,079
improbable developments like

206
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,319
maybe canada absorbing the united states

207
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,399
you know so i don't know i'm not sure if

208
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,800
we're necessarily designed for maximum

209
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,679
entertainment but if we are

210
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,560
uh that will mean that 2020 is just a

211
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,600
prequel

212
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,839
for even more bizarre years ahead so

213
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,439
i i kind of hope that we're not designed

214
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,119
for maximum entertainment

215
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,879
well the night is still young in terms

216
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,639
of canada but do you think it's possible

217
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,120
for the observer and the producer to be

218
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,478
kind of

219
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,160
emergent so meaning

220
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,159
it does seem when you kind of watch

221
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,400
memes on the internet

222
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,639
the funny ones the entertaining ones

223
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,399
spread more efficiently they do i mean i

224
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,280
don't know what it is about the human

225
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,279
mind

226
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:12,799
that soaks up on mass funny

227
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,239
things much more sort of aggressively

228
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,960
it's more viral like

229
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,160
in in the full sense of that word is is

230
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,719
there some sense that

231
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,520
whatever this the evolutionary process

232
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,080
that created our cognitive capabilities

233
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,439
is the same process that's going to in

234
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,519
an emergent way

235
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,560
create the most entertaining outcome the

236
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:35,758
most memorable outcome

237
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,199
the most viral outcome if we were to

238
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,840
share it on twitter yeah that's

239
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,520
interesting

240
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,959
um yeah we do have an incredible ability

241
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,560
like i mean how many memes are created

242
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,399
in a given day and the ones that go

243
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,759
viral are almost uniformly funny at

244
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,638
least to somebody with a particular

245
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,439
sense of humor

246
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:57,038
right um yeah i have to think about that

247
00:07:53,439 --> 00:08:00,000
we are definitely great at creating

248
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,598
atomized units of funny like in the

249
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,079
example that you used

250
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,199
there are going to be x million brains

251
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,038
parsing and judging

252
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,960
whether this meme is retweetable or not

253
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:12,000
yes and so that sort of atomic

254
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,878
universe atomic element a funniness

255
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,240
of entertainingness etc we definitely

256
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,280
have an environment that's

257
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,639
good at selecting for that and selective

258
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,598
pressure and everything else that's

259
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
going on

260
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:28,159
but in terms of the entire

261
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,280
ecosystem of conscious systems here on

262
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,360
the earth

263
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,958
driving through for a level of

264
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,080
entertainment

265
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,799
that is on such a much higher level that

266
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,278
i don't know if that would necessarily

267
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,759
follow directly from the fact that you

268
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,919
know atomic units of entertainment are

269
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,480
very very aptly selected for us

270
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,120
i don't know do you find it compelling

271
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,879
or

272
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,600
useful to think about human civilization

273
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,278
from the perspective of the ideas versus

274
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,000
the perspective

275
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:02,320
of the individual human brains so almost

276
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,399
thinking about the ideas or the memes

277
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,680
this is the dawkins thing as the

278
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,879
organisms

279
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:11,599
and then the humans as just like uh

280
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:14,000
vehicles for briefly carrying those

281
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,320
organisms as they jump around and spread

282
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,559
yeah for propagating them mutating them

283
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,080
putting selective pressure on them etc

284
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:24,719
yeah um i mean i found um dawkins

285
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,000
interpret or his his launching of the

286
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,080
idea of memes is just

287
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
kind of an afterthought to his

288
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,839
unbelievably brilliant book about the

289
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,559
selfish gene like

290
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,360
what a ps to put at the end of a long

291
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,079
chunk of writing profoundly interesting

292
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,639
i view the relationship though between

293
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
human and

294
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,159
humans and memes is probably an

295
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,920
oversimplification but maybe a little

296
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,319
bit like the relationship between

297
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,439
flowers and bees right do flowers have

298
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,080
bees or do

299
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,680
bees in a sense have flowers and the

300
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,080
answer is

301
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,039
it is a very very symbiotic relationship

302
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,278
in which both

303
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,319
have semi-independent roles that they

304
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,120
play and

305
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,760
both are highly dependent upon the other

306
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,600
and so

307
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,200
in the case of bees obviously you know

308
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,879
you could see the flower as being this

309
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,440
monolithic structure

310
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,039
physically in relation to any given bee

311
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,959
and it's the source of

312
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,879
food and sustenance so you could kind of

313
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,199
say well flowers have bees

314
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,639
but on the other hand the flowers would

315
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,160
obviously be doomed

316
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,078
they weren't being pollinated by the

317
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,958
bees so you could kind of say well you

318
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,399
know bees

319
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,000
you know flowers are really expression

320
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,879
of what the bees need

321
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,360
and the truth is a symbiosis so with

322
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,958
with memes and human minds

323
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,919
our brains are are clearly the petri

324
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:40,559
dishes

325
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:43,039
in which memes are either propagated or

326
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,159
not propagated get mutated or don't get

327
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,599
mutated if

328
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,240
they are the venue in which competition

329
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,278
selective competition plays out between

330
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,120
different memes

331
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,958
so all of that is very true and you

332
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,078
could look at that and say

333
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,639
really the human mind is a production of

334
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,799
memes

335
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,838
and ideas have us rather than us having

336
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,958
ideas but at the same time let's take

337
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,000
a catchy tune as an example of a meme um

338
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,879
that catchy tune did originate in a

339
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,958
human mind

340
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,039
somebody had to structure that thing and

341
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,239
as much as i like elizabeth gilbert's

342
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,000
ted talk about how the universe i'm

343
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,759
simplifying but you know kind of

344
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
the ideas find their way in this

345
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,039
beautiful ted talk it's very lyrical she

346
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,399
talked about

347
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,799
you know ideas and prose kind of

348
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,159
beaming into our minds and you know she

349
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,519
talked about needing to pull over the

350
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,958
side of the road when she got

351
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,039
inspiration for

352
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,719
a particular paragraph or a particular

353
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,078
idea and a burning need to write that

354
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,879
down

355
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,399
i love that i find that beautiful as a

356
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,120
as a writer as a novelist

357
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,759
uh myself i've never had that experience

358
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,560
and

359
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,919
i think that really most things that do

360
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:54,319
become memes

361
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,439
are the product of a great deal of

362
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,360
deliberate

363
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,639
and willful exertion of a conscious mind

364
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,240
and so like the bees

365
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,959
and the flowers i think there's a great

366
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,200
symbiosis and they both kind of have one

367
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,838
another ideas have us but we have ideas

368
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
for real

369
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,920
if we could take a little bit of a

370
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,399
tangent stephen king on writing

371
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,679
you as a great writer you you're

372
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,159
dropping a hint here

373
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,199
that the ideas don't come to you that

374
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,719
it's a grind

375
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
of sort of it's almost like you're

376
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,839
mining for gold

377
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:29,119
it's more of a very uh deliberate

378
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,639
rigorous daily process so maybe can you

379
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,919
talk about

380
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:37,839
the writing process how do you

381
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,360
write well and maybe if you want to step

382
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,959
outside of yourself almost like give

383
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,278
advice to

384
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,239
an aspiring writer what does it take to

385
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,639
write

386
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,639
the best work of your life well it would

387
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,519
be very different if it's fiction versus

388
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,600
nonfiction

389
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,639
and i've done both i've written two

390
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,399
works of not two

391
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,639
non-fiction books and two works of

392
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,399
fiction two works of fiction being more

393
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,600
recent i'm gonna focus on that right now

394
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,399
because that's more

395
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,600
toweringly on my mind there are amongst

396
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,440
novelists

397
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,680
again this is an oversimplification but

398
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,000
there's kind of two schools of thought

399
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,278
um some people really like to fly by the

400
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,759
seat of their pants

401
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,320
and some people really really like to to

402
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,639
outline

403
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,000
to plot you know so there's plotters and

404
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,720
pantsers i guess is

405
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,240
one way that people look at it and you

406
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,079
know as with most things

407
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,680
there is a great continuum in between

408
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,199
and i'm somewhere on that continuum but

409
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,919
i lean i guess a little bit

410
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,560
a little bit more toward the plotter and

411
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,360
so

412
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,000
when i do start a novel i have a pretty

413
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,079
strong point

414
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
of view about how it's going to end and

415
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,120
i have a very strong point of view about

416
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,759
how it's going to begin

417
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,679
and i do try to make an effort of making

418
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,159
an outline that i know i'm going to be

419
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,198
extremely unfaithful to in the actual

420
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,120
execution

421
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,799
of the story but trying to make an

422
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,278
outline that gets us from here to there

423
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,359
and

424
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,799
notion of subplots and beats and rhythm

425
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,199
and different characters and

426
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,879
and so forth but then when i get into

427
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,039
the process

428
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,078
that outline particularly the center of

429
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,838
it ultimately

430
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,439
inevitably morphs a great deal and i

431
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,079
think if i were personally

432
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,880
a rigorous outliner i would not allow

433
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,919
that to happen

434
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:14,480
i also would make a much more

435
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:17,039
vigorous skeleton before i start so i

436
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,560
think people who are really in that

437
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:23,039
plotting outlining mode are people who

438
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,479
write page turners people who write you

439
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,599
know spy novels

440
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,600
or you know supernatural adventures

441
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:35,360
where you really want a relentless pace

442
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,560
of events action plot twists

443
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,039
conspiracy etc and that is

444
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,638
really the bone that's that's really the

445
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,719
you know the skeletal structure

446
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,399
so i think folks who write that kind of

447
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,240
book are really very much on

448
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,600
the outlining side and i think people

449
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,278
who write um

450
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,519
what's often referred to as literary

451
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:56,720
fiction for lack of a better term

452
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,959
where it's more about you know sort of

453
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,879
aura and ambiance and character

454
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:03,039
development and experience and

455
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,919
inner experience and inner journey and

456
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,559
so forth

457
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,919
i think that group is more likely to fly

458
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,679
by the seat of their pants and i know

459
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,198
people who start with a blank page and

460
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,879
just see where it's going to go

461
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,319
i'm a little bit more on the plotting

462
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,159
side

463
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,240
now you asked what makes something

464
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,679
at least in the mind of the writer as

465
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,159
great as it can be

466
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,078
for me it's an astonishingly high

467
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,519
percentage of it is editing as opposed

468
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:31,359
to the initial writing

469
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,839
for every hour that i spend writing

470
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,919
new pros you know like new pages new

471
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,240
paragraphs stuff that you know

472
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:42,399
new bits of the book i probably spend

473
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,919
i mean i wish i i wish i kept a count

474
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,159
like i wish i had like one of those

475
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,439
pieces of software that lawyers use to

476
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,480
decide how much time i've been doing

477
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,040
this that but

478
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,879
i would say it's at least four or five

479
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,159
hours and maybe as many as 10 that i

480
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,958
spend editing

481
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,319
and so it's relentless for me for each

482
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,039
one hour of writing

483
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,639
i'd say that for wow i mean i i write

484
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,719
because i edit and i spend

485
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,039
just relentlessly polishing and pruning

486
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,320
and sometimes on the micro level of just

487
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,879
like did the does the

488
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,800
rhythm of the sentence feel right do i

489
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:15,600
need to carve a syllable or something so

490
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,559
it can land

491
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,879
like as micro as that to his macro as

492
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,518
like okay i'm done but the book is 750

493
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,120
pages

494
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,720
long and it's way too bloated i need to

495
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,639
lop a third out of it

496
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,440
problems on you know those two orders of

497
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,680
magnitude and everything in between

498
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,880
that is an enormous amount of my time

499
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,758
and i also

500
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,879
um i also write music write record and

501
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,839
produce music

502
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,078
and there the the ratio is even higher

503
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,440
of

504
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,559
every minute that i spend or my band

505
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,360
spends

506
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,359
laying down that original audio it's a

507
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,079
very high proportion of hours that go

508
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,079
into just

509
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,078
making it all hang together and sound

510
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,679
just right so i think that's true of a

511
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,719
lot of creative processes i

512
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,239
i know it's true of sculpture um i

513
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,839
believe it's true of woodwork my dad was

514
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,440
an amateur woodworker and

515
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,199
he spent a huge amount of time on

516
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,279
sanding and polishing at the end

517
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
so i think a great deal of the sparkle

518
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,918
comes from that part of the process any

519
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,079
creative process

520
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,319
can i ask about the psychological the

521
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,399
demon side of that picture

522
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,000
in the editing process you're ultimately

523
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,360
judging the initial piece of work

524
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,640
and you're judging and judging and

525
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,759
judging how much of your time

526
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,919
do you spend hating your work

527
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:33,200
how much time do you spend in gratitude

528
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,240
impressed thankful for how good the work

529
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,519
that you will put

530
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,160
together is um i spend almost

531
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,918
all the time in a place that's

532
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
intermediate between those but leaning

533
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,440
toward gratitude

534
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,880
i spend almost all the time in a state

535
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,759
of optimism

536
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,200
that this thing that i have i like i

537
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,480
like quite a bit

538
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,558
and i can make it better and better

539
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,519
and better with every time i go through

540
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,519
it so

541
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:01,599
i spend most of my time in a state of

542
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,160
optimism

543
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,759
i think i i personally oscillate much

544
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,200
more aggressively between those two

545
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,759
where i wouldn't be able to find the

546
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,120
average i i go pretty deep

547
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:16,640
um marvin minsky from mit

548
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:19,839
had this advice i guess

549
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,759
to uh what it takes to be successful

550
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,038
in science and research is to hate

551
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,240
everything you do

552
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,679
you've ever done in the past i mean

553
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,880
at least he was speaking about himself

554
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,120
that the key to his success was to uh

555
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,799
hate everything he's ever done i have a

556
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,319
little marvin minsky

557
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,759
there in me too to sort of uh always be

558
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,839
exceptionally self-critical

559
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:44,000
but almost like self-critical about the

560
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,639
work but grateful

561
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,599
for the chance to be able to do the work

562
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,360
yeah that makes sense

563
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,119
it makes perfect sense but that you know

564
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,119
each one of us have

565
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,839
have to strike a certain kind of a

566
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,079
certain kind of balance

567
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,159
but back to the uh destruction of human

568
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,960
civilization

569
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,720
if humans destroy ourselves in the next

570
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,319
hundred years

571
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,839
what will be the most likely source

572
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,319
the the most like the reason that we

573
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:15,678
destroy ourselves well let's see

574
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:18,159
100 years it's hard for me

575
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,200
to comfortably predict out that far and

576
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,679
it's something to give

577
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,640
a lot more thought to i think than you

578
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,000
know

579
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,240
normal folks simply because i am a

580
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,319
science fiction writer and

581
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,558
you know i feel with the acceleration of

582
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,798
technological progress

583
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,558
it's really hard to foresee out more

584
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,119
than just a few decades i mean comparing

585
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,119
today's world to that of

586
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:41,519
1921 where we are right now a century

587
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,759
later it's been so unforeseeable

588
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,759
and i just don't know what's going to

589
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,558
happen particularly with exponential

590
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,440
technologies

591
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:51,200
i mean our intuitions reliably defeat

592
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,679
ourselves with exponential technologies

593
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,919
like computing and synthetic biology and

594
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,320
you know how we might destroy ourselves

595
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,400
in the 100 year time frame

596
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,558
might have everything to do with

597
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,000
breakthroughs in nanotechnology 40 years

598
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,359
from now and then how rapidly those

599
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,798
breakthroughs accelerate

600
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,479
but in the nearer term that i'm

601
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:09,359
comfortable predicting let's say 30

602
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,640
years

603
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:15,119
i would say the most likely route to

604
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,240
self-destruction would be synthetic

605
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,639
biology

606
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,519
and i always say that with the gigantic

607
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,000
caveat

608
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,839
and very important one that i find and

609
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
i'll abbreviate synthetic biology to sin

610
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,720
bio just to save us some syllables

611
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,359
i believe synbio offers us simply

612
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,640
stunning

613
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:35,439
promise that we would be fools

614
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,240
to deny ourselves so i'm not an anti-sin

615
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,798
bio person

616
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,640
by any stretch i mean sin bio has

617
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:41,440
unbelievable odds of helping us beat

618
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,280
cancer

619
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,798
helping us rescue the environment

620
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,639
helping us do things that we would

621
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,319
currently find imponderable so it's

622
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,640
electrifying the field

623
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,359
but in the wrong hands those hands

624
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,720
either being

625
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,038
incompetent or being malevolent

626
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,839
in the wrong hand synthetic biology to

627
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,558
me

628
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,678
has a much much greater odds has much

629
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,960
greater odds

630
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,720
of leading to our self-destruction

631
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,798
than something running amok with super

632
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,159
ai which i believe is a real possibility

633
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:11,759
and one we need to be concerned about

634
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,360
but in the 30-year time frame i think

635
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,359
it's a lesser one

636
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,639
or nuclear weapons or anything else that

637
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,000
i can think of

638
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,640
can you explain that a little bit

639
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,679
further so your concern

640
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,640
is on the man-made versus the natural

641
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,440
side of the pandemic front here so we

642
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,240
humans

643
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,200
engineering pathogens engineering

644
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,240
viruses

645
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,960
is the concern here yeah and

646
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,960
maybe how do you see the possible

647
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,840
trajectories happening here

648
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,319
in terms of mo is it malevolent or is it

649
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:48,158
um

650
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:51,038
accidents oops little mistakes

651
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,559
or unintended consequences of particular

652
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,000
actions that are ultimately lead to

653
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,918
unexpected mistakes

654
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,079
well both of them are in danger and i

655
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,600
think the question of which is more

656
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:04,480
likely has to do with two things one

657
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,599
do we take a lot of methodical

658
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,240
affordable

659
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,519
four-sided steps that we are absolutely

660
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,558
capable of taking

661
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,359
right now to first all the risk of a bad

662
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:14,879
actor

663
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:16,959
infecting us with something that could

664
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
have annihilating impacts

665
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,360
and in the the episode you referenced

666
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,400
with sam we talked a great deal about

667
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,639
that

668
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,240
so do we take those steps and if we take

669
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,200
those steps i think the danger

670
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,159
of malevolent rogue actors doing us in

671
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,880
with sin bio

672
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,480
couldn't plummet but you know it's

673
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,280
always a question of if and we have a

674
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,880
bad bad

675
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,639
and very long track record of hitting

676
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,080
the snooze bar after

677
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,759
different natural pandemics have

678
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,359
attacked have attacked us so that's

679
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,000
variable number one

680
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:50,879
variable number two is how much

681
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,679
experimentation and pathogen development

682
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,000
do we as a society decide is acceptable

683
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,280
in the realms of academia

684
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,759
government or private industry and

685
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,359
if we decide as a society that it's

686
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,158
perfectly okay

687
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,119
for people with varying research agendas

688
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,159
to create

689
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,399
pathogens that if released could wipe

690
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,840
out humanity if we think that's fine

691
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,919
and if that kind of work starts

692
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,959
happening in you know one lab

693
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,600
five labs 50 labs 500 labs

694
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,079
in one country than 10 countries then 70

695
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:26,079
countries

696
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:29,038
or whatever that risk of a boo-boo

697
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,639
starts rising astronomically and this

698
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,158
won't be a spoiler alert

699
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,080
based on the way that i presented those

700
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,400
two things but i think it's

701
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,439
unbelievably important to manage both of

702
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,519
those risks

703
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,480
the easier one to manage although it

704
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,240
wouldn't be

705
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,000
simple by any stretch because it would

706
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,960
have to be something that all nations

707
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,679
agree on

708
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,558
but the easiest way the easier risk to

709
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,519
manage

710
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,319
is that of hey guys let's not develop

711
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,720
pathogens

712
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,079
that if they escape from a lab could

713
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,759
annihilate us

714
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,599
there's no line of research that

715
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,200
justifies that and in my view

716
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,319
i mean that's the point of perspective

717
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,159
we need to have we'd have to

718
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,000
collectively agree that there's no line

719
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,760
of research that justifies that

720
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,679
the reason why i believe that would be a

721
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,079
highly rational conclusion

722
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,240
is even the highest level of biosafety

723
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,960
lab in the world biosafety lab

724
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,159
level four and they're not a lot of bsl4

725
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,960
labs in the world

726
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,600
there have there are things can can and

727
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,000
have leaked out of bsl4 labs

728
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,399
and some of the work that's been done

729
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,679
with potentially annihilating pathogens

730
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,640
which we can talk about

731
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,919
is actually done at bsl3 and so

732
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,200
fundamentally

733
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,880
any lab can leak we have proven

734
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,720
ourselves to be incapable

735
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,400
of creating a lab that is utterly

736
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,480
impervious to leaks

737
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,960
so why in the world would we create

738
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,599
something where if god forbid it leaked

739
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,880
could annihilate us all and by the way

740
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,639
almost all of the measures that are

741
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,600
taken in biosafety level

742
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,038
anything labs are designed to prevent

743
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,879
accidental leaks

744
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,640
what happens if you have a malevolent

745
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,559
insider and we could talk about the

746
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,320
psychology and the motivations

747
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,918
of what would make a malevolent insider

748
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:06,960
who wants to release something and not

749
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,038
annihilating

750
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,360
in a bit i'm sure that we will but what

751
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,919
if you have a malevolent insider

752
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,519
virtually none of the standards that go

753
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,919
into biosafety level

754
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,679
one two three and four are about

755
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,278
preventing somebody hijacking the

756
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
process i mean some of them are

757
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:24,720
but they're mainly designed against

758
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,559
accidents they're imperfect against

759
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,079
accidents and if this kind of work

760
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,558
starts happening in lots and lots

761
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,399
of labs with every lab you add the odds

762
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,240
of there being a malevolent insider

763
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,919
naturally increase arithmetically as the

764
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,519
number of labs goes up

765
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,559
now on the front of somebody

766
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,519
outside of a government academic or

767
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,119
scientific

768
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,639
traditional government science academic

769
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,719
scientific

770
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,080
environment creating something

771
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,919
malevolent

772
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,519
again there's protections that we can

773
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,320
take both at the level

774
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,839
of sin bio architecture the sin

775
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,960
hardening the entire

776
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:03,278
sin bio ecosystem against

777
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,840
terrible things being made that we don't

778
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:08,400
want to have out there by rogue actors

779
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,918
to early detection to lots and lots of

780
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,919
other things that we can do to

781
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,600
dramatically mitigate that risk

782
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,440
and i think we do both of those things

783
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,199
decide that no we're not going to

784
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,278
experimentally make annihilating

785
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,440
pathogens in leaky labs

786
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,720
and b yes we are going to take counter

787
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,798
measures that

788
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,720
are costs going to cost a fraction of

789
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,200
our annual defense budget

790
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,919
to to preclude their creation then i

791
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,840
think both that

792
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,679
both both risks get managed down but if

793
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,720
you take one set of precautions and not

794
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,720
the other

795
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,400
then the the thing that you have not

796
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,000
taken precautions against

797
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,000
immediately becomes the more likely

798
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,079
outcome so can we talk about

799
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,278
this kind of research and what's

800
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,960
actually done and

801
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,558
what are the positives and negatives of

802
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,240
it so

803
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,918
if we look at gain of function research

804
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,679
and the kind of stuff that's happening

805
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,640
level three and level four

806
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,400
bsl labs what's the whole idea here is

807
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,360
it trying to engineer

808
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,798
viruses to understand how they behave

809
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,278
you want to understand the dangerous

810
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,679
ones

811
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,440
yeah so that that would be the logic

812
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,360
behind doing it and so gain a function

813
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,840
can mean a lot of different things

814
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,879
um viewed through a certain lens

815
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,798
gain-to-function

816
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,720
research could be what you do when you

817
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,038
create you know gmos

818
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,278
when you create you know hearty strains

819
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,480
of corn that are resistant to pesticides

820
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:23,200
i mean you could view that as gain of

821
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
function

822
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,319
so i'm going to refer to gain of

823
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,440
function in a relatively narrow sense

824
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,158
which is actually the sense

825
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,600
that the term is usually used which is

826
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,440
in some way

827
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,079
magnifying capabilities of

828
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,679
microorganisms

829
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,158
to make them more dangerous whether it's

830
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,960
more transmissible or more deadly

831
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,399
and in that line of research i'll use an

832
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,640
example from 2011

833
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,158
because it's very illustrative and it's

834
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,440
also very chilling

835
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,278
back in 2011 two separate

836
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,159
labs independently of one another i

837
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:55,599
assumed there was some kind of

838
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,278
communication between them but they were

839
00:27:55,599 --> 00:28:00,079
basically independent projects one in

840
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,519
holland and one in wisconsin

841
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,960
did gain a function research on

842
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:07,679
something called h5n1 flu

843
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:10,720
h5n1 is you know something that

844
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,080
at least on a lethality basis makes

845
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,360
kovad look like a kitten

846
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,119
you know coveted according to the world

847
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,079
health organization has a case fatality

848
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,038
rate somewhere between

849
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,319
half a percent and one percent h5n1 is

850
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:22,960
closer to sixty percent

851
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,480
six zero and so that's actually even

852
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,519
slightly more lethal than ebola

853
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,839
it's a very very very scary pathogen the

854
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,879
good news about h5n1 it is

855
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:35,439
that it is barely barely contagious

856
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,520
and i believe it is in no way contagious

857
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:41,360
human to human it requires

858
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:44,720
um you know very very very deep contact

859
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:47,199
uh with birds in most cases chickens

860
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,640
and so if you're a chicken farmer and

861
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,720
you spend an enormous amount of time

862
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,399
around them and perhaps you get into

863
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,960
situations in which you get a break in

864
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:58,079
your skin and you're interacting

865
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,480
intensely with with fowl who

866
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,439
as it turns out have h5n1 that's when

867
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
the jump comes

868
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,880
um but it's not there's no airborne

869
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,080
transmission that we're aware of human

870
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,120
human i mean they're

871
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,000
not that way it just doesn't exist um i

872
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,759
think the

873
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,798
world health organization did a

874
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,879
relentless survey of the number of h5n1

875
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,038
cases i think they do it every year i

876
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,440
saw one 10-year series

877
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,879
where i think it was like 500 fatalities

878
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,880
over the course of a decade

879
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
and that's a drop in the bucket kind of

880
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,120
fun fun fact

881
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,679
i believe the typical lethality from

882
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,398
lightning

883
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,840
over 10 years is 70 000 deaths so we

884
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,199
think getting struck by lightning pretty

885
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,759
low risk h5n1

886
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,278
much much lower than that what happened

887
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,640
in these experiments

888
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:45,038
is the experimenters in both cases um

889
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,759
set out to make h5n1 that would be

890
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,158
contagious

891
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:50,079
that could create airborne transmission

892
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,559
and so they basically passed it i think

893
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:54,960
in both cases they passed it through

894
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,918
a large number of ferrets and so this

895
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,519
wasn't like

896
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,278
crispr there wasn't even a crisper back

897
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,519
in those days this was relatively

898
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,960
straightforward you know selecting for a

899
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,278
particular outcome

900
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,079
and after guiding the path and passing

901
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:07,278
them through

902
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,000
again i believe it was a series of

903
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,960
ferrets they did in fact come up with

904
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,558
a version of h5n1 that is capable of

905
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,798
airborne transmission

906
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,079
now they didn't unleash it into the

907
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:19,759
world they didn't

908
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:22,000
inject it into humans to see what would

909
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,480
happen and so for those two reasons we

910
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,558
don't

911
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,519
really know how contagious it might have

912
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,079
been

913
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,200
but you know if it was as contagious as

914
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:31,839
covid

915
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,038
that could be a civilization threatening

916
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,119
pathogen

917
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,640
and why would you do it well the people

918
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:39,038
who did it were good guys

919
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,880
they were virologists i believe their

920
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,599
agendas they explained it was

921
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,880
much as you said let's figure out what a

922
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,719
worst case scenario

923
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,799
might look like so we can understand it

924
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,480
better but

925
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,639
my understanding is in both cases it was

926
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,679
done in by bsl3 labs

927
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,000
and so potential of leak uh

928
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,840
significantly non-zero hopefully way

929
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,798
below one percent but significantly

930
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:02,480
non-zero

931
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,440
and when you look at the consequences of

932
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,880
an escape in terms of human lives

933
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,679
destruction of a large portion of the

934
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,480
economy etc and you do an expected value

935
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,240
calculation

936
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,640
on whatever fraction of one percent that

937
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,159
was you would come up with

938
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,159
a staggering cost staggering expected

939
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,840
cost for this work so it should never

940
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,399
it should never have been carried out

941
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:28,398
now you might make an argument

942
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:32,000
if you said if you believed that h5n1

943
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:34,719
in nature is on an inevitable path

944
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,398
to airborne transmission and it's only

945
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,319
going to be a small number of years

946
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:43,199
a and b if it makes that transition

947
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,798
there is you know one set of changes to

948
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,960
its metabolic pathways

949
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,000
and you know it's genomic code and so

950
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,000
forth one

951
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,839
that we have discovered so it is going

952
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,519
to go from point a which is where it is

953
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,398
right now to point b

954
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,919
we have reliably engineered point b that

955
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:59,678
is the destination

956
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,679
and we need to start fighting that right

957
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,240
now because this is five years or less

958
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,278
away

959
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,798
now that'd be very different world

960
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,240
that'd be like spotting an asteroid

961
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,000
that's coming toward the earth and is

962
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,240
five years off and yes you marshal

963
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,440
everything you can to resist that but

964
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,480
there's two problems with that

965
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,038
perspective

966
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,640
the first is in however many thousands

967
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,558
of generations that humans have been

968
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,200
inhabiting this planet there has never

969
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,639
been a transmissible form of h5n1 and

970
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,519
influenza has been around for a very

971
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,278
long time

972
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,440
so there is no case for inevitability

973
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,960
of this kind of a jump to airborne

974
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,558
transmission so

975
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,120
we're not on a freight train to that

976
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,000
outcome and if there was inevitability

977
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,918
around that

978
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,759
it's not like there's just one set of

979
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,080
genetic code that would get there

980
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,599
they're just there's there's all kinds

981
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,079
of different mutations

982
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,119
that could conceivably result in that

983
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,839
kind of an outcome

984
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,678
unbelievable diversity of mutations and

985
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,599
so we're not actually creating something

986
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,080
we're inevitably going to face

987
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,038
uh but we are creating something we are

988
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,199
creating

989
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,919
a very powerful and unbelievably

990
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,798
negative card and injecting in the deck

991
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,320
that nature never put into the deck so

992
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,960
in that case

993
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,759
um i just don't see any moral or

994
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,558
scientific

995
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,919
justification for that kind of work and

996
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:17,119
interestingly

997
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,559
there was quite a bit of excitement and

998
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:19,599
concern about this when the work came

999
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:21,200
out one of the teams was going to

1000
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:22,398
publish their results in science the

1001
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,278
other in nature

1002
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:25,759
and there were a lot of editorials and a

1003
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:27,839
lot of

1004
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,038
scientists are saying this is crazy and

1005
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,678
publication of those

1006
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,839
papers did get suspended and not long

1007
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,399
after that there was a pause put on

1008
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,158
u.s government funding nih funding on

1009
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:39,759
gain of function research

1010
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,600
but both of those speed bumps were

1011
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,960
ultimately removed

1012
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,759
those papers did ultimately get

1013
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,079
published and that pause on funding

1014
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:50,158
you know ceased long ago and in fact

1015
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,720
those two very projects my understanding

1016
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,080
has

1017
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,079
resumed their funding got their

1018
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,759
government funding back i don't know why

1019
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,119
a dutch project's getting nih funding

1020
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,079
but whatever

1021
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,759
about a year and a half ago so as far as

1022
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,879
the us government and regulators are

1023
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:04,558
concerned

1024
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,320
it's also systems go for gain of

1025
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:07,519
function at this point which i i find

1026
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,119
very troubling

1027
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,280
now i'm a little bit of an outsider from

1028
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,480
this field but it has echoes of the same

1029
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,040
kind of problem i see

1030
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,240
in the ai world with autonomous weapon

1031
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:20,000
systems

1032
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:23,039
nobody in my colleagues

1033
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,358
my colleagues friends as far as i can

1034
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,599
tell

1035
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,519
people in the ai community are not

1036
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,480
really talking about autonomous weapons

1037
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,440
systems

1038
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,719
as now us and china are full steam ahead

1039
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,559
on the development of both

1040
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:37,039
right and that seems to be a similar

1041
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,440
kind of thing on getting a function

1042
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,800
i've uh you know have friends in the

1043
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,960
biology space

1044
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,399
and they don't want to talk about gain

1045
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,199
of function

1046
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,799
publicly it and i don't that makes me

1047
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,398
very uncomfortable

1048
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,879
from an outsider perspective in terms of

1049
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,559
gain of function it makes me

1050
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,799
very uncomfortable from the insider

1051
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,799
perspective on autonomous weapon systems

1052
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,400
i'm not sure how to communicate exactly

1053
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,839
about autonomous weapon systems and i

1054
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,880
certainly don't know how to communicate

1055
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,719
effectively about

1056
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,000
getting a function what is the right

1057
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,239
path forward here

1058
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,358
should we seize all gain of function

1059
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,439
research is that

1060
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:12,960
is that really the solution here well

1061
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,079
again i'm going to use gain of function

1062
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,159
in the relatively narrow

1063
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,760
context of overview because you could

1064
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,279
say almost you know anything

1065
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,800
that you do to make biology more

1066
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,079
effective is gain a function so within

1067
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,359
the narrow confines of what we're

1068
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,039
discussing

1069
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:29,838
i think it would be easy enough

1070
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,199
for level-headed people in all of the

1071
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:32,639
countries level had any governmental

1072
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,159
people in all the countries that

1073
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,078
realistically could support such a

1074
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:39,519
program to agree

1075
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,160
we don't want this to happen because all

1076
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:42,639
labs leak i mean and you know an example

1077
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:45,039
that i

1078
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,199
i use i actually didn't use it in the

1079
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:50,079
piece i did with sam harris as well

1080
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,078
um is the anthrax attacks in the united

1081
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:55,039
states in 2001 i mean talk about an

1082
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,160
example of the least likely lab

1083
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:59,838
leaking into the least likely place

1084
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,519
shortly after 9 11 for folks who don't

1085
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:03,440
remember it and

1086
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,280
it was a very very lethal strand of

1087
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,119
anthrax that

1088
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,800
as it turned out based on the for

1089
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,760
forensic genomic work that was done and

1090
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,000
so forth

1091
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,200
absolutely leaked from a high-security

1092
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,639
u.s army lab

1093
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,559
probably the one at fort detrick in

1094
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,358
maryland it might have been another one

1095
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:19,358
but who cares

1096
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,279
it absolutely leaked from a high

1097
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,679
security u.s army lab

1098
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,079
and where did it leak to this highly

1099
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,078
dangerous substance that was kept under

1100
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,359
lock and key by a very security-minded

1101
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,119
organization

1102
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,719
well it leaked to places including the

1103
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,760
senate majority leader's office tom

1104
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:35,199
daschle's office

1105
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,880
i think it was senator leahy's office

1106
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,199
certain publications including

1107
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,960
bizarrely the national enquirer but

1108
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,759
let's go to the senate majority leader's

1109
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,480
office

1110
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,640
it is hard to imagine a more

1111
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,480
security-minded country than the united

1112
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,400
states two weeks after the 911

1113
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,159
attack i mean you it doesn't get more

1114
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,200
security-minded than that

1115
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,000
and it's also hard to imagine a more

1116
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,239
security

1117
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,199
capable organization than the united

1118
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,039
states military

1119
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,960
we can joke all we want about

1120
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:03,759
inefficiencies in the military and you

1121
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,720
know

1122
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,000
24 000 wrenches and so forth but pretty

1123
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,199
capable when it comes to that

1124
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,559
despite that level of focus and concern

1125
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:16,719
and competence just a

1126
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:17,679
days after the 9 11 attacks something

1127
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:19,598
comes from the

1128
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:21,440
inside of our military industrial

1129
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,720
compacts and ends up

1130
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,079
you know in the office of someone i

1131
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:25,279
believe the senate majority leader

1132
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,320
somewhere in the line of presidential

1133
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,480
succession

1134
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,880
it tells us everything can leak so again

1135
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,358
think of a level-headed conversation

1136
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,960
between powerful leaders in a diversity

1137
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,199
of countries

1138
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,358
thinking through like i can imagine a

1139
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,199
very simple powerpoint revealing

1140
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,719
you know just discussing briefly things

1141
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,960
like the anthrax leak

1142
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,078
um things like uh this this foot and

1143
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,480
mouth disease

1144
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,240
outbreak that or leaking that came out

1145
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,960
of a bsl four-level lab

1146
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,679
in the uk several other things talking

1147
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,358
about

1148
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,960
the utter virulence that could result

1149
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,759
from gain of function and say

1150
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,039
folks can we agree that this just

1151
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,960
shouldn't happen

1152
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,039
i mean if we were able to agree on the

1153
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,000
nuclear non-proliferation treaty which

1154
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,079
we were

1155
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,519
by a weapons convention which we did

1156
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,839
agree on we the world

1157
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,039
for the most part i believe agreement

1158
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:16,000
could be found

1159
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,639
there but it's going to take people in

1160
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,800
leadership

1161
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,799
of a couple of very powerful countries

1162
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,079
to get to consensus amongst them

1163
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,599
and then to decide we're going to get

1164
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,960
everybody together and browbeat them

1165
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,640
into banning this stuff now that doesn't

1166
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,400
make it entirely impossible that

1167
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,440
somebody might do this

1168
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,838
but in well-regulated you know

1169
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,960
carefully watched over fiduciary

1170
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:36,880
environments

1171
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,159
like federally funded academic research

1172
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,039
anything going on in the government

1173
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:41,440
itself

1174
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,639
you know things going on in you know

1175
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,400
companies that have

1176
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,960
investors who don't want to go to jail

1177
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,559
for the rest of their lives

1178
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,079
i think that would have a major major

1179
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,119
dampening impact on it

1180
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,760
but there is a particular possible

1181
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,880
catalyst

1182
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,119
in this time we live in which is

1183
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,800
uh for really kind of raising the

1184
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,640
question of gain of function research

1185
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,119
for the application of virus making

1186
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:08,719
viruses more dangerous

1187
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:12,800
is the question of whether covid

1188
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:14,399
leaked from a lab sort of

1189
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,960
not even answering that question but

1190
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,760
even asking that question is a very

1191
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,119
it seems like a very important question

1192
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,599
to ask

1193
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,119
to uh catalyze the conversation about

1194
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,119
the whether we should be doing

1195
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,640
gain of function research i mean from a

1196
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,838
high level

1197
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,199
uh why do you think people

1198
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,119
even colleagues of mine are not

1199
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,519
comfortable asking that question

1200
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,960
and two do you think that the answer

1201
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,679
could be that it did

1202
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,960
leak from a lab i i think the mere

1203
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,000
possibility

1204
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,519
that it did leak from a lab is

1205
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,320
evidence enough again for the

1206
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:54,400
hypothetical rational national leaders

1207
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,640
watching this simple powerpoint

1208
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,599
if you could put the possibility at one

1209
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,358
percent

1210
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,000
and you look at the unbelievable

1211
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:03,598
destructive power that covet had

1212
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,079
that should be an overwhelmingly

1213
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,599
powerful argument for excluding it

1214
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,680
now as to whether or not that was a leak

1215
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,039
some very very level i don't i don't

1216
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:14,719
know enough about

1217
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,440
all of the factors in the bayesian

1218
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,439
analysis and so forth that has gone into

1219
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,358
people making the pro argument of that

1220
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,200
so i don't pretend to be an expert on

1221
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,838
that and i i don't have

1222
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:26,639
a point of view i i just don't know but

1223
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,159
what i

1224
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:32,318
what we can say is it is entirely

1225
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:35,440
possible for a couple of reasons

1226
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:37,440
one is that there is a bsl4 lab in wuhan

1227
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,079
the wahan institute of virology i

1228
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,599
believe it's the the only bsl4 in china

1229
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,920
i could be wrong about that

1230
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:49,280
but it definitely had a history

1231
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,960
that alarmed very sophisticated uh u.s

1232
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,040
diplomats and others

1233
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,039
who were in contact with the lab and

1234
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,079
were aware of what it was doing

1235
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:00,880
uh long before covid uh coveted

1236
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,160
um hit the world and so there are

1237
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,519
diplomatic cables that have been

1238
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,318
declassified

1239
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:07,519
i believe one sophisticated scientist or

1240
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,960
other observer said

1241
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:12,639
that wiv is a ticking time bomb and

1242
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,920
i believe it's also been pretty

1243
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,199
reasonably established that

1244
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,159
coronaviruses

1245
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,919
were a topic of great interest at wiv

1246
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:21,598
sars obviously came out of china and

1247
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,119
that's a that's a coronavirus that would

1248
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,559
make an enormous amount of sense for it

1249
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,400
to be studied there

1250
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:30,318
um and there is so much opacity

1251
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,599
about what happened in the early days

1252
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:34,318
and weeks

1253
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,318
after the outbreak that's basically been

1254
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:39,838
imposed by the chinese government that

1255
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:41,279
we just don't know so it feels like a

1256
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:42,880
substantially or greater than one

1257
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,680
percent possibility to me

1258
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,599
looking at it from the outside and

1259
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,719
that's something that one could imagine

1260
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,680
now we're going to the realm of thought

1261
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:51,598
experiment not

1262
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,679
me decreeing this is what happened but

1263
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,079
you know if they're studying coronavirus

1264
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:58,480
at the wuhan institute of virology

1265
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,079
um and there is this precedent of gain

1266
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,000
of function research that's been done

1267
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,519
on something that is remarkably

1268
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,599
uncontagious to humans whereas we know

1269
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,679
coronavirus is contagious to humans

1270
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,440
i could definitely and there is this

1271
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,440
global consensus

1272
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,800
you know certainly was the case you know

1273
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,920
two or three years ago when this work

1274
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,760
might have started this

1275
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,440
seems to be this global consensus that

1276
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,280
gain a function is fine

1277
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,280
the u.s paused funding for a little

1278
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,119
while but paused funding they never said

1279
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,599
private actors couldn't do it

1280
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,200
it was just the pause of nih funding and

1281
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,880
then that pause was lifted so

1282
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,719
again none of this is irrational you

1283
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,800
could certainly see the folks at wiv

1284
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,239
saying gain a function interesting

1285
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,519
vector coronovice

1286
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:40,879
virus unlike h5n1 very contagious

1287
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,800
uh we are in a a nation that has had

1288
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,079
terrible run-ins with coronavirus why

1289
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,560
don't we do a little getting function on

1290
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,240
this

1291
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:50,719
and then like all labs at all levels

1292
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,799
one can imagine this lab leaking so it's

1293
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:53,519
not an impossibility and very very

1294
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,039
level-headed

1295
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:56,719
people have said that you know who've

1296
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,358
looked at it much more deeply

1297
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,399
do believe in that outcome uh why is it

1298
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,440
such a threat

1299
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,358
to power the idea that leaked from a lab

1300
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,119
why is it so threatening i don't maybe

1301
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,239
understand this point exactly

1302
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,559
like is it just that

1303
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,078
as governments and especially the

1304
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,920
chinese government is really afraid of

1305
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,640
admitting

1306
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,838
mistakes that everybody makes so this is

1307
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,000
a horrible mystery like

1308
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:24,400
uh chernobyl is a good example i come

1309
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,239
from the soviet union

1310
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,280
i mean well major mistakes were made in

1311
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:33,199
chernobyl

1312
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:37,200
i would argue for a lab league to happen

1313
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,919
the the the scale of the mistake is much

1314
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,759
smaller

1315
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,880
um right there the the depth and the

1316
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,960
breadth of rot

1317
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,000
that in bureaucracy that led to

1318
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,960
chernobyl

1319
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,519
is much bigger than anything that could

1320
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,240
lead to

1321
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,800
a lab leak because it could literally

1322
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,479
just be

1323
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,160
i mean i'm sure there's security very

1324
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,639
careful security procedures even in

1325
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:03,598
level three labs but

1326
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,239
it uh i i imagine maybe you can correct

1327
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,640
me it's

1328
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,318
all it takes is the incompetence of a

1329
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:11,279
small number of individuals or even

1330
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:13,199
one yeah one individual on a particular

1331
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,160
a couple weeks three weeks

1332
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,279
period as opposed to a multi-year

1333
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,679
bureaucratic

1334
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,880
failure of the entire government right

1335
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:22,960
well certainly the

1336
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,400
magnitude of mistakes and compounding

1337
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
mistakes that went into chernobyl was

1338
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,000
far far

1339
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,960
far greater but the consequence of

1340
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,719
kovitt

1341
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,440
outweighs that the consequence of

1342
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:36,480
chernobyl to a tremendous degree

1343
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,358
and you know i think that that

1344
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,159
particularly um authoritarian

1345
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,598
governments

1346
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:46,399
are unbelievably uh reluctant to

1347
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,039
admit to any fallibility whatsoever

1348
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,200
there's a

1349
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,079
long long history of that across dozens

1350
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,519
and dozens

1351
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,560
of authoritarian governments and to be

1352
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:56,400
transparent

1353
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,838
again this is in the hypothetical world

1354
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,240
in which this was a leak which

1355
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:01,759
again i don't have i don't personally

1356
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,479
have enough sophistication to have an

1357
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,839
opinion on the

1358
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,358
on the likelihood but in the

1359
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:06,400
hypothetical world in which it was a

1360
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:09,759
league

1361
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,119
the global reaction

1362
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:16,319
and the amount of global animus

1363
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,760
and the amount of you know

1364
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:22,480
the decline in global respect that would

1365
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,599
happen toward china because every

1366
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,800
country suffered

1367
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,559
massively from this unbelievable damages

1368
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,800
in terms of human lives and economic

1369
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,559
activity disrupted

1370
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,560
the world would in some way present

1371
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,838
china with that bill

1372
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:40,078
and when you take on top of that

1373
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,759
the natural disinclination for any

1374
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,599
authoritarian government to admit any

1375
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,800
fallibility and tolerate the possibility

1376
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:49,280
of any fallibility whatsoever

1377
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,480
and you look at the relative opacity

1378
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,280
even though they let a world

1379
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,519
health organization group in you know a

1380
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,200
couple months ago to run around

1381
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,639
they didn't give that who group anywhere

1382
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:01,039
near the level of access it would be

1383
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,279
necessary to definitively say

1384
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,960
x happened versus y the level of opacity

1385
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,839
that surrounds those opening weeks and

1386
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,240
months

1387
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:14,719
of covet in china we just don't know

1388
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:16,959
if you were to kind of look back at 2020

1389
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:17,838
and maybe broadening it out to future

1390
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,960
pandemics

1391
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:22,960
that could be much more dangerous what

1392
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,760
kind of response

1393
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,358
how do we fail in the response and how

1394
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,920
could we do better

1395
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,358
so the gain of function research is

1396
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,519
discussing

1397
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,119
which you know the the question of we

1398
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:37,358
should not be

1399
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,640
creating viruses that are both

1400
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,039
exceptionally contagious and

1401
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,358
exceptionally deadly to humans

1402
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:44,159
but if it does happen perhaps the

1403
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:47,679
natural

1404
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:51,358
evolution natural mutation is there

1405
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:54,000
interesting technological responses

1406
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:55,199
on the testing side on the vaccine

1407
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,760
development side

1408
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:00,159
on the collection of data or on the

1409
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,480
basic sort of policy response side

1410
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,358
or the sociological the psychological

1411
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,639
side

1412
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,159
yeah there's all kinds of things and

1413
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,239
most of what i've thought about and

1414
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,118
written about and again discussed in

1415
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,799
that long

1416
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:17,358
bit with with sam is dual use

1417
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,599
so most of the countermeasures that i've

1418
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:22,000
been thinking about and advocating for

1419
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,720
would be every bit as effective against

1420
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,838
zoonotic

1421
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,279
disease a natural pandemic of some sort

1422
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:29,279
as an artificial one

1423
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,680
the the risk of an artificial one even

1424
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,000
the near-term risk of an artificial one

1425
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:34,799
ups the urgency around these measures

1426
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,880
immensely but

1427
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,880
but most of them would be broadly

1428
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,480
applicable and so i think

1429
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,079
the first thing that we really want to

1430
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,119
do on a global scale

1431
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,920
is have a far far far more robust

1432
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,200
and globally transparent system of

1433
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,119
detection

1434
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,279
and that can happen on a number of

1435
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,559
levels the most obvious one

1436
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,760
is you know just in the blood of people

1437
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,200
who come into clinics

1438
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:04,160
exhibiting signs of illness and there

1439
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:05,199
we are certainly at a point now with

1440
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,679
we're at with

1441
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:08,239
relatively minimal investment we could

1442
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,480
develop

1443
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:12,639
in clinic diagnostics that would be

1444
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,920
unbelievably effective at pinpointing

1445
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,318
what's going on

1446
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,720
in almost any disease when somebody

1447
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:22,239
walks into a doctor's office or a clinic

1448
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:23,039
and better than that um this is a little

1449
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,959
bit further off

1450
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,800
further off but it wouldn't cost tens of

1451
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,079
billions in research dollars it would be

1452
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,680
you know a relatively modest and

1453
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,559
affordable budget in relation to the

1454
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:33,039
threat

1455
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,400
at home diagnostics that can really

1456
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,159
really pinpoint

1457
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,760
you know okay particularly with

1458
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,679
respiratory infections

1459
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,800
because that is generally almost

1460
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,039
universally

1461
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,480
the mechanism of transmission for any

1462
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,880
serious pandemic

1463
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,079
so somebody has a respiratory infection

1464
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,039
is it one of the

1465
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,880
you know significantly large handful of

1466
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,800
rhinoviruses coronaviruses and other

1467
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,119
things that cause common cold

1468
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,280
uh or is it influenza if it's influenza

1469
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,800
is it influenza a versus b

1470
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,960
um or is it you know a small handful of

1471
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,599
other more exotic but nonetheless

1472
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,800
sort of common respiratory infections

1473
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,640
that are out there

1474
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,240
developing a diagnostic panel to

1475
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:13,279
pinpoint all of that stuff that's

1476
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,358
something that's well within our

1477
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,839
capabilities that's much less

1478
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,598
a lift than creating mrna vaccines which

1479
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:21,039
obviously we proved capable of when we

1480
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:24,079
put our minds to it

1481
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:25,599
so do that on a global basis

1482
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,599
and i don't think that's irrational

1483
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,760
because the best prototype

1484
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,880
for this than i'm aware of isn't

1485
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,680
currently rolling out

1486
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:35,440
in atherton california or fairfield

1487
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,078
county connecticut or some other wealthy

1488
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,679
place

1489
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,839
the best prototype that i'm aware of

1490
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,440
this is rolling out right now in nigeria

1491
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,119
and it's a project that came out of the

1492
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,358
broad institute

1493
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,960
which as as i'm sure you know but uh

1494
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,960
some listeners may not is

1495
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,800
kind of like an academic joint venture

1496
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,838
between harvard and mit

1497
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,960
the program is called sentinel and their

1498
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,039
objective

1499
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,199
is and their plan and is a very well

1500
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:02,079
conceived plan a methodical plan

1501
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:03,759
is to do just that in areas of nigeria

1502
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,720
that are particularly vulnerable to

1503
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,040
zoonotic

1504
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,759
diseases making the jump from animals to

1505
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,838
humans

1506
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,760
but also there's just an unbelievable

1507
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:13,440
public health benefit from that

1508
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,920
and it's sort of a three-tier system

1509
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,119
where clinicians in the field

1510
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,280
could very rapidly determine do you have

1511
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,960
one of the infections of acute interest

1512
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,680
here either because it's very common in

1513
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,760
this region

1514
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,440
so we want to diagnose as many as things

1515
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,119
as we can at the front line

1516
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,200
or because it's uncommon but

1517
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,960
unbelievably threatening like ebola

1518
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:35,279
so frontline worker can make that

1519
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,240
determination very very rapidly

1520
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,079
if it comes up as a we don't know they

1521
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:40,959
bump it up to a level that's more like

1522
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,960
at a fully

1523
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,800
configured doctor's office or local

1524
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,159
hospital and if it's still it

1525
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,240
we don't know it gets bumped up to a

1526
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,078
national level and

1527
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:51,838
that and it gets bumped very very

1528
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,400
rapidly so

1529
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,400
if this can be done in nigeria and it

1530
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,240
seems that it can be

1531
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,559
there shouldn't be any inhibition for it

1532
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,919
to happen in most other places

1533
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,760
and it should be affordable from a

1534
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,838
budgetary standpoint and based on

1535
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,440
sentinel's budget and adjusting things

1536
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:10,558
for things like you know very different

1537
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,880
cost of living larger population etc

1538
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,240
i did a back of the envelope calculation

1539
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,079
that doing something like sentinel in

1540
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:16,719
the u.s would be in the low billions of

1541
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,200
dollars

1542
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,799
and you know wealthy countries

1543
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,199
middle-income countries can't afford

1544
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,640
such a thing lower income companies in

1545
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:25,439
income countries should certainly be

1546
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,598
helped with that

1547
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,358
but start with that level of detection

1548
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,640
and then layer on top of that other

1549
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:32,960
interesting things

1550
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,199
like you know monitoring search engine

1551
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,760
traffic search engine queries

1552
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,639
for evidence that strange clusters of

1553
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,800
symptoms

1554
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,318
are starting to rise in different places

1555
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,119
there's been a lot of work done with

1556
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:44,880
that

1557
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,800
most of it kind of like academic and

1558
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,400
experimental but some of it has been

1559
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,640
powerful enough to suggest that this

1560
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,240
could be a very powerful early warning

1561
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:54,719
system there's a guy named bill lampos

1562
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:57,759
at university college london

1563
00:51:54,719 --> 00:52:00,879
who basically did a very rigorous

1564
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:04,319
analysis that showed that symptom

1565
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,599
searches reliably predicted coveted

1566
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:07,679
outbreaks in the early days of the

1567
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,760
pandemic in given countries

1568
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:11,279
by as much as 16 days before the

1569
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,319
evidence started to crew at a public

1570
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,119
health level

1571
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:16,558
16 days of forewarning can be

1572
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,119
monumentally important

1573
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,680
in the early days of an outbreak and

1574
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,640
this is

1575
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:25,118
you know a very very talented but

1576
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:27,039
nonetheless very resource constrained

1577
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,240
academic project imagine if that was

1578
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:31,119
something that was done

1579
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:31,598
with a norad like budget yeah yeah so i

1580
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,280
mean

1581
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,359
starting with detection that's something

1582
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,440
we could do radically radically better

1583
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:38,880
so aggregating multiple data sources in

1584
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,559
order to create something

1585
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,160
i mean this is really exciting to me the

1586
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,480
possibility that i've heard

1587
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,440
inklings of of creating almost like a

1588
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,920
weather map

1589
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:52,480
of pathogens like basically

1590
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,519
aggregating all of these data sources

1591
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,440
scaling

1592
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:56,800
many orders of magnitude up at home

1593
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,760
testing and all kinds of

1594
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,440
testing that doesn't just try to test

1595
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,280
for the particular pathogen

1596
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,800
of worry now but everything like a full

1597
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,720
spectrum of things that could be

1598
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,400
dangerous to the human body

1599
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:14,558
and thereby be able to create these maps

1600
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,920
like that are dynamically updated on an

1601
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,400
hourly basis

1602
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,280
of the of how viruses travel throughout

1603
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,680
the world

1604
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,200
and so you can respond like you can then

1605
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:24,399
integrate just like you do when you

1606
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,199
check your weather map

1607
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,000
and it's raining or not of course not

1608
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:29,838
perfect but it's

1609
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,280
very good predictor whether it's going

1610
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:34,000
to rain or not

1611
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,040
uh and use that to then make decisions

1612
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,440
about your own life

1613
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,960
ultimately give the power information to

1614
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,200
individuals to respond

1615
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,599
and if it's a super dangerous like if

1616
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,679
it's acid rain versus regular rain

1617
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,119
you might want to really stay inside as

1618
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:50,879
opposed to risking it

1619
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,960
i mean that um just like you said if

1620
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,240
i think it's not very expensive relative

1621
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,960
to all the things

1622
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:57,759
that we do in this world but it does

1623
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,039
require

1624
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,720
bold leadership and there's another

1625
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:05,358
dark thing which really is bothering me

1626
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:10,078
about 2020 which it requires

1627
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:12,159
is it requires trust in institutions to

1628
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,559
carry out these kinds of programs

1629
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:15,920
and it requires trust and science and

1630
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:19,119
engineers

1631
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,960
and uh sort of centralized organizations

1632
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,880
that would operate at scale here

1633
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:27,679
and much of that trust has been um

1634
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,039
at least in the united states diminished

1635
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:30,799
it feels like

1636
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:33,440
not exactly sure where to place the

1637
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,480
blame but i do place quite a bit of the

1638
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,358
blame into

1639
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,880
the scientific community and again my

1640
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:42,159
fellow colleagues

1641
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,798
in speaking down to people at times

1642
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,960
speaking from authority it sounded like

1643
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,358
it dismissed the basic human experience

1644
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,559
or the

1645
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:50,960
the basic common humanity of people in a

1646
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,119
way

1647
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,798
like it almost sounded like there's an

1648
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,880
agenda

1649
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:58,000
that's hidden behind the words the

1650
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,760
scientists spoke

1651
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,199
like they're trying to in a

1652
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,960
self-preserving way

1653
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,358
control the population or something like

1654
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,720
that i don't think any of that is true

1655
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:08,639
from the majority of the scientific

1656
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:11,279
community but it sounded that way

1657
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:12,000
and so the trust began to diminish and

1658
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,599
i'm not

1659
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:18,239
sure how to fix that except to

1660
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,680
be more authentic be more real

1661
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:20,879
acknowledge the uncertainties under

1662
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:23,118
which we operate

1663
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,160
acknowledge the mistakes we've that

1664
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,280
scientists make

1665
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:29,519
that institutions make the leak

1666
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,319
from the lab is a perfect example where

1667
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:32,400
we have

1668
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,000
imperfect systems that make all the

1669
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,720
progress you see seeing the world and

1670
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,798
that

1671
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:39,279
being honest about that imperfection i

1672
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:40,798
think is essential for forming trust

1673
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,599
but i don't know what to make of it it's

1674
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:45,519
been uh it's been deeply disappointing

1675
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,119
because i do think just like you

1676
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:50,960
mentioned the solutions

1677
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:54,160
require people to trust the

1678
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:57,199
institutions with their data

1679
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:59,039
yeah and i think part of the problem is

1680
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:00,879
it seems to me as an outsider that there

1681
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:02,558
was a bizarre unwillingness

1682
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,000
on the part of the cdc and other

1683
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,359
institutions

1684
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,679
to admit to

1685
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:10,960
to frame and to contextualize

1686
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:13,838
uncertainty

1687
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,960
maybe they had a patronizing idea that

1688
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:17,039
these people need to be

1689
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,720
told and when they're told they need to

1690
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:20,719
be told with authority

1691
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,480
and a level of definitiveness and

1692
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:23,439
certain certitude that doesn't actually

1693
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,679
exist

1694
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,119
and so when they whip saw on

1695
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:29,199
recommendations like

1696
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,798
what you should do about masks you know

1697
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:32,558
when the cdc

1698
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,639
is kind of at the very beginning of the

1699
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,280
pandemic saying masks don't do

1700
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:39,199
anything don't wear them when the real

1701
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,200
driver for that was

1702
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:44,078
we don't want these clowns going out and

1703
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:45,439
depleting amazon of masks because they

1704
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,720
may be needed

1705
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,679
in medical settings and we just don't

1706
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:52,000
know yet

1707
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,759
i think a message that actually

1708
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,838
respected people and said this is why

1709
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,400
we're asking you not to do masks yet

1710
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:59,759
and there's more to be seen would be

1711
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,318
less whip sawing

1712
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,440
and would bring people like they feel

1713
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,960
more like they're part of the

1714
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,000
conversation and they're being treated

1715
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,480
like adults

1716
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,280
than saying one day definitively masks

1717
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,440
suck

1718
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,798
and then x days later saying nope damn

1719
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,119
it wear masks

1720
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:16,559
and so i think framing things in terms

1721
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,920
of the probabilities which most people

1722
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,720
are easy to parse i mean

1723
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,200
a more recent example which i just

1724
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:24,239
thought was

1725
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:27,519
batty was suspending the johnson johnson

1726
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:29,118
vaccine for a you know a very low single

1727
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:31,519
digit number of days

1728
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,400
in the united states based on the fact

1729
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,280
that i believe

1730
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,400
there had been uh seven-ish clotting

1731
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,440
incidents

1732
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:42,160
um in roughly seven million people who

1733
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,920
had had the the vaccine administered

1734
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:45,519
i believe one of which resulted in a

1735
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,599
fatality and

1736
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:49,199
there was definitely suggestive data

1737
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,559
that indicated that there was a

1738
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,480
relationship this wasn't just

1739
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,240
coincidental because i think all of the

1740
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,358
clotting incidents happened in women as

1741
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:57,358
opposed to men

1742
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:58,558
and kind of clustered in a certain age

1743
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:01,279
group but

1744
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,640
does that call for shutting off the

1745
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,960
vaccine

1746
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,798
or does it call for leveling with the

1747
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,280
american public and saying

1748
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,318
we've had one fatality out of seven

1749
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,280
million

1750
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:14,318
this is let's just assume substantially

1751
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,839
less than the

1752
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:18,318
likelihood of getting struck by

1753
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:20,798
lightning um

1754
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,000
based on that information you know and

1755
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:23,440
we're going to keep you posted

1756
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,760
because you can trust us to keep you

1757
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,200
posted based on that information please

1758
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,119
decide whether you're comfortable with a

1759
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:31,118
johnson johnson vaccine

1760
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,318
that would have been one response and i

1761
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,000
think people would have been able to

1762
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:35,039
parse those simple bits of data and make

1763
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
their own judgment

1764
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:39,279
by turning it off all of a sudden

1765
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,639
there's this dramatic

1766
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:44,240
signal to people who don't read all 900

1767
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:45,920
words in the new york times piece that

1768
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:47,199
explains why it's being turned off but

1769
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,480
just see the headline which is a

1770
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:51,598
majority of people

1771
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:55,199
there's a sudden like oh my god yikes

1772
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:57,119
vaccine being shut off and then all the

1773
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,960
people who sat on the fence or sitting

1774
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,599
on the fence about whether or not they

1775
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,358
trust vaccines that is going to push an

1776
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,798
incalculable number of people that's

1777
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:06,239
going to be the last straw

1778
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:07,679
for we don't know how many hundreds of

1779
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:08,959
thousands or more likely millions of

1780
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:10,879
people to say okay

1781
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,720
tipping point here i don't trust these

1782
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,559
vaccines so by pausing that for

1783
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,078
whatever it was 10 or 12 days and then

1784
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,240
flipping the switch

1785
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,119
as everybody who knew much about the

1786
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:21,679
situation

1787
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,798
knew was inevitable by switching

1788
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:25,919
flipping the on switch

1789
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:29,280
12 days later you're conveying certitude

1790
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,599
j and j bad to certitude j and j good

1791
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,040
in a period of just a few days and

1792
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,880
people just feel whipsawed and they're

1793
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,400
not part of the analysis but it's not

1794
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,920
just the the whipsawing

1795
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,680
and i think about this quite a bit i

1796
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,119
don't think i have good answers

1797
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,039
it's something about the way the

1798
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:45,440
communication actually happens

1799
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:47,519
just i don't know what it is about

1800
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,480
anthony fauci for example

1801
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:50,798
but i don't trust him and i think that

1802
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,920
has

1803
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:56,239
to do i mean he's he did he's

1804
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,200
he has an incredible background i'm sure

1805
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:59,838
he's a brilliant

1806
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:02,000
scientist and researcher i'm sure he's

1807
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:04,159
also a great

1808
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,079
like inside the room policy maker and

1809
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:09,759
deliberator and so on

1810
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:10,240
but you know uh what makes a great

1811
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,160
leader

1812
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:14,000
is something about that thing that you

1813
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:18,159
can't quite describe

1814
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:21,519
but being a communicator that

1815
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:23,519
you know you can trust that there's an

1816
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:24,880
authenticity that's required and i'm not

1817
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:27,119
sure

1818
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,000
maybe i'm being a bit too judgmental but

1819
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,760
i'm a huge fan

1820
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,880
of a lot of great leaders throughout

1821
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,880
history they've they've communicated

1822
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,640
exceptionally well in the way that fauci

1823
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,720
does not

1824
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:40,480
and i think about that i think about

1825
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:40,959
what has affected science communication

1826
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,880
so

1827
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,480
you know great leaders throughout

1828
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,039
history did not necessarily

1829
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,559
need to be great science communicators

1830
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:49,920
their leadership wasn't

1831
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,760
in other domains but when you're

1832
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,000
fighting the virus you also have to be

1833
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,079
a great science communicator you have to

1834
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,760
be able to communicate uncertainties

1835
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,359
you have to be able to communicate

1836
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,520
something like a vaccine

1837
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:03,119
that you you're allowing inside your

1838
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:05,280
body into the messiness into the

1839
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,880
complexity of the biology system

1840
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,559
that if we're being honest it's so

1841
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,720
complex we'll never be able to really

1842
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,400
understand we have

1843
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:13,759
we can only desperately hope that

1844
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,880
science can

1845
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:18,000
give us sort of a high likelihood that

1846
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,640
there's no

1847
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,559
short-term negative consequences and

1848
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:24,000
that kind of intuition about long-term

1849
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,079
negative consequences

1850
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,039
and doing our best in this battle

1851
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,599
against

1852
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:30,960
trillions of things that are trying to

1853
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,440
kill us

1854
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,720
i mean being being an effective

1855
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,079
communicator in that space is very

1856
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:39,118
difficult but

1857
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,480
i think about what it takes because i

1858
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,079
think there should be more science

1859
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,519
communicators that are effective at that

1860
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:45,039
kind of thing

1861
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:48,000
let me ask you about something that's

1862
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:51,199
sort of more in the ai space that

1863
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,920
i i think about that kind of goes along

1864
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:55,879
this thread that you're

1865
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,680
that you've spoken about about

1866
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,519
democratizing

1867
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:00,719
the technology that could destroy human

1868
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:04,159
civilization

1869
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:08,399
is uh from amazing work from deep mind

1870
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:10,000
alpha fold to which achieved uh

1871
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,000
incredible performance on the protein

1872
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
folding problem single protein fold

1873
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,199
folding problem do you think about the

1874
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,798
use of ai

1875
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:21,919
in the syn biospace of uh

1876
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:23,440
i think the the gain of function

1877
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,680
in the virus-based research that you

1878
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:28,880
refer to i think

1879
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:31,598
is natural mutations and sort of

1880
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,680
aggressively mutating the virus until

1881
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:36,880
you get one that like uh

1882
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:40,078
that has this both contagious and um

1883
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:44,000
deadly but what about then using

1884
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:47,680
ai to through simulation

1885
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,679
be able to compute deadly viruses or

1886
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,199
any kind of biological systems is this

1887
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:52,719
something you're worried about

1888
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:54,960
or again is this something you're more

1889
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:55,919
excited about i think computational

1890
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,920
biology is

1891
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,358
unbelievably exciting and promising

1892
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,920
field and i think when you're doing

1893
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,719
things in silico as opposed to in vivo

1894
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:05,920
um

1895
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:07,439
you know that the dangers plummet you

1896
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,159
don't have a critter

1897
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,720
that can leak from a leaky lab yes so i

1898
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:14,879
don't see any problem with that except

1899
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,000
um i do worry about the data security

1900
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,240
dimension of it

1901
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,079
because if you were doing really really

1902
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:20,959
interesting and silico gain of function

1903
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:23,280
research

1904
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,119
and you hit upon you know through a

1905
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,160
level sophistication we don't currently

1906
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:27,920
have but you know

1907
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:30,239
synthetic biology is an exponential

1908
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,559
technology so capabilities that are

1909
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,558
utterly out of reach today will be

1910
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:38,720
attainable in five or six years

1911
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:41,920
um i think if you conjured up

1912
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:44,159
worst-case genomes of viruses that

1913
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,440
don't exist in vivo anywhere they're

1914
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:46,558
just in they're just in the computer

1915
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,639
space but like

1916
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,480
hey guys this is the genetic sequence

1917
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:54,159
that would end the world let's say

1918
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:56,559
um then you have to worry about the

1919
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:58,078
utter hackability of every computer

1920
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:01,039
network we can imagine

1921
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,839
i mean data leaks from the least likely

1922
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:04,319
places

1923
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:06,400
on the grandest possible scales have

1924
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:08,239
happened and continue to happen and will

1925
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,838
probably always continue to happen and

1926
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:11,598
so that would be the danger of doing the

1927
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:13,440
work in silico

1928
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,519
if you end up with a list of like boy

1929
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,480
these are things we never want to see

1930
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:19,920
that list leaks and after the passage of

1931
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,960
some time certainly couldn't be done

1932
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,760
today but after the passage of some time

1933
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,798
lots and lots of people in academic labs

1934
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,760
going all the way down to the high

1935
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:30,159
school level

1936
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,440
are in a position to you know to make it

1937
01:04:30,159 --> 01:04:35,038
overly simplistic

1938
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:36,798
hit print on a genome and have the virus

1939
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,079
bearing that genome pop out on the other

1940
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:38,480
end then you got something to worry

1941
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,960
about

1942
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,240
but in general computational biology i

1943
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,679
think is incredibly important

1944
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,519
particularly because

1945
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:46,879
the crushing majority of work that

1946
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:48,798
people are doing with the protein

1947
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,119
folding problem and other things

1948
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:52,239
are about creating therapeutics about

1949
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,160
creating things

1950
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:56,879
that will help us you know live better

1951
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:59,118
live longer thrive be bit more well

1952
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,318
and so forth and the protein folding

1953
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:02,798
problem is a

1954
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:03,759
monstrous computational challenge that

1955
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:06,000
we seem to make

1956
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,160
just the most glacial project on i'm

1957
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,358
sorry progress on for years and years

1958
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:11,519
but i think there's like a there's a

1959
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:14,239
bi-annual competition i think

1960
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:16,318
uh for for at which people tackle the

1961
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:19,439
protein folding uh problem

1962
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:22,159
and um deepmind's entrant uh both

1963
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,440
two years ago like in 2018 and 2020

1964
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:25,920
ruled the field

1965
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,599
and so you know protein folding is an

1966
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,880
unbelievably important thing if you want

1967
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,280
to start thinking about

1968
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,720
therapeutics because you know it's the

1969
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,119
folding of the protein that tells us

1970
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:34,719
where the

1971
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,200
where the channels and the receptors and

1972
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:37,838
everything else are on that protein and

1973
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,078
it's

1974
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:41,279
from that precise model if we can get to

1975
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,359
a precise model

1976
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,480
that you can start barraging it again in

1977
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:46,960
silicon

1978
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,519
with you know thousands tens of

1979
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,440
thousands

1980
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:51,679
millions of potential therapeutics and

1981
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,760
see what resolves the problems

1982
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:55,279
the shortcomings that a you know about a

1983
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,200
misshapen uh pro

1984
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,400
protein for instance somebody with

1985
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:00,239
cystic fibrosis

1986
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,680
how might we treat that so i see nothing

1987
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:04,399
but good in that

1988
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:06,078
well let me ask you about fear and hope

1989
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,519
in this world

1990
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,519
i tend to believe that um

1991
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:13,679
that uh in terms of competence and

1992
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:15,920
malevolence

1993
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,199
that people who are maybe it's in my

1994
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,039
interactions

1995
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,960
i tend to see that first of all i

1996
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:24,160
believe that most people are good

1997
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:27,039
and want to do good and are just

1998
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:27,598
better doing good and more inclined to

1999
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,880
do good

2000
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:34,240
on this world and more than that

2001
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:37,838
people who are malevolent are usually

2002
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:40,399
incompetent at uh building technology

2003
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:42,078
so like i i've seen this in my life that

2004
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,720
people who are exceptionally good at

2005
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,760
stuff

2006
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:48,719
no matter what the stuff is tend to

2007
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,280
maybe they discover joy in life in a way

2008
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,318
that

2009
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:54,000
gives them fulfillment and thereby does

2010
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:54,880
not result in them wanting to destroy

2011
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,039
the world

2012
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,880
so like the better you are at stuff

2013
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,760
whether that's building nuclear weapons

2014
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,838
or plumbing

2015
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,599
it doesn't matter they're both the less

2016
01:07:01,838 --> 01:07:07,679
likely you are to destroy the world

2017
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:12,240
so in that sense with many technologies

2018
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:15,440
the ai especially i always think that uh

2019
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:16,639
the the the malevolent would be far

2020
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,440
outnumbered

2021
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:20,960
by the ultra competent and in that sense

2022
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,000
the defenses

2023
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:27,440
will always be stronger than the

2024
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,480
offense in terms of the people trying to

2025
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:32,159
destroy the world

2026
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:33,599
now there's a few spaces where them

2027
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:35,279
that might not be the case and that's an

2028
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,200
interesting conversation where

2029
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,319
is this one person who's not very

2030
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,480
competent

2031
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:42,798
can destroy the whole world perhaps

2032
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,838
synbio is one such space

2033
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:47,199
because of the uh exponential effects of

2034
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:49,519
the technology

2035
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:50,719
i tend to believe ai's is not one of

2036
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:54,838
those such spaces

2037
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:57,838
but do you share this kind of view that

2038
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:58,558
uh the ultra competent are usually also

2039
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:00,960
the good

2040
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:02,319
yeah absolutely i absolutely share that

2041
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,400
and that gives me

2042
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:05,838
a great deal of optimism that we will be

2043
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,200
able to short circuit

2044
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:11,279
the threat that malevolent synbio

2045
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:13,199
could pose to us but we need to start

2046
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,960
creating those defensive systems

2047
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:16,798
or defensive layers one of which we

2048
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,719
talked about far far far better

2049
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:22,560
surveillance in order to prevail

2050
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:24,798
so the good guys will almost inevitably

2051
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,000
outsmart and definitely outnumber the

2052
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:28,560
bad guys

2053
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,439
in most sort of smackdowns that we can

2054
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,120
imagine

2055
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,479
but the good guys aren't going to be

2056
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:35,039
able to exert

2057
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:36,399
their advantages unless they have the

2058
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:38,399
imagination

2059
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:39,599
necessary to think about what the worst

2060
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,439
possible thing

2061
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,600
can be done by somebody whose own

2062
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:45,678
psychology is completely

2063
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,440
alien to their own so that's a tricky

2064
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:51,119
tricky thing to solve for

2065
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:51,599
now in terms of whether the asymmetric

2066
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,238
power

2067
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,279
that a bad guy might have in the face of

2068
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:57,198
the overwhelming

2069
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:59,199
numerical advantage and competence

2070
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:00,399
advantage that the good guys have

2071
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:02,639
you know unfortunately i look at

2072
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:03,599
something like mass shootings as an

2073
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,000
example

2074
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,679
you know i'm sure the guy who who was

2075
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,279
responsible for the vegas shooting or

2076
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,279
the orlando shooting or any other

2077
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:14,000
shooting that we can imagine

2078
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,520
didn't know a whole lot about ballistics

2079
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,319
and the number of

2080
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:20,319
you know good guy citizens in the united

2081
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,279
states with guns compared to bad guys

2082
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:24,480
citizens i'm sure is a crushingly

2083
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:25,600
overwhelmingly high ratio in favor of

2084
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:27,919
the good guys

2085
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,239
but that doesn't make it possible for us

2086
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:33,600
to stop mass shootings

2087
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:36,959
an example is fort hood

2088
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,880
45 000 trained soldiers on that base

2089
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,480
yet there have been two mass shootings

2090
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,838
there and

2091
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:47,119
so there is an asymmetry when you have

2092
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:50,798
powerful and lethal technology that gets

2093
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:54,399
so democratized and so proliferated

2094
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:56,800
in tools that are very very easy to use

2095
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:58,719
even by a knucklehead when those tools

2096
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,640
get really easy to use by a knucklehead

2097
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:03,198
and they're really widespread

2098
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,560
it becomes very very hard to defend

2099
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:07,119
against all instances in

2100
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,880
instances of usage now the good news

2101
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:10,719
quote unquote about mass shootings if

2102
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,840
there is any and there is some

2103
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:16,480
is even the most brutal and

2104
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,199
carefully planning and well-armed mass

2105
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:20,559
shooter

2106
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:22,719
can only take so many victims and

2107
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,400
same is true as there's been four

2108
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,480
instances that i'm aware of

2109
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:27,839
of commercial pilots committing suicide

2110
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:29,279
by downing their planes and taking all

2111
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,440
their passengers with them

2112
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:33,119
these weren't boeing engineers you know

2113
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:34,639
but like an army of boeing engineers

2114
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:35,920
ultimately were not capable of

2115
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,920
preventing that

2116
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,399
but even in their case and i'm actually

2117
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,079
not counting 911 and that 911 is a

2118
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:43,759
different category in my mind these are

2119
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:46,238
these are just personally suicidal

2120
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,920
pilots in in those cases

2121
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:50,158
they only have a plain load of people

2122
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,880
that they're able to take with them

2123
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:54,479
if we imagine a highly plausible and

2124
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,960
imaginable future

2125
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:58,319
in which some biotools they could be

2126
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,760
that are amoral that could be used for

2127
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,479
good or for ill

2128
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,840
start embodying unbelievable

2129
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:07,678
sophistication

2130
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:08,719
and genius in the tool in the easier and

2131
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,000
easier and easier

2132
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:13,679
to make tool all those thousands

2133
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,119
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands

2134
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:17,600
of scientist years

2135
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:19,039
start getting embodied in something that

2136
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,400
you know maybe as simple as hitting a

2137
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:24,238
print button

2138
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:27,839
um then that good guy technology

2139
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:29,839
can be hijacked by a bad person

2140
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,279
and used in a very asymmetric way yeah i

2141
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:33,600
think what happens though

2142
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:35,119
as because you go to the high school

2143
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,239
student from the current like very

2144
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:38,640
specific set of

2145
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:41,039
labs they're able to do it as we get as

2146
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:43,760
it becomes more and more democratized

2147
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:44,719
as it becomes easier and easier to do

2148
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,119
this kind of

2149
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,800
large-scale damage with a with an

2150
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:50,719
engineered virus

2151
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,400
the more and more there will be

2152
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,960
engineering of defenses against these

2153
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:54,238
systems

2154
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,600
is some of the things we talked about in

2155
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:56,639
terms of testing towards the collection

2156
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,840
of data

2157
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:01,920
but also in terms of like uh

2158
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,920
at scale contact tracing or also

2159
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,719
engineering of vaccines

2160
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,158
like in a matter of like days maybe

2161
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:11,279
hours maybe minutes

2162
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:13,439
so like i just i feel like the defenses

2163
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:15,519
that's what human species seems to do

2164
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:16,319
it's like we hit keep hitting the snooze

2165
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,360
button

2166
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:22,079
until there's like a like a storm

2167
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:24,079
on the horizon heading towards us then

2168
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:26,960
we start to quickly build up

2169
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:28,399
uh the defenses or the response that's

2170
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,600
proportional

2171
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:34,158
to the scale of the storm

2172
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,600
of course again certain kinds of

2173
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:38,719
exponential threats require

2174
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:40,480
us to build up the defenses

2175
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:41,920
way earlier than we usually do and

2176
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:45,279
that's i guess the question

2177
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:46,960
but i ultimately am hopeful that

2178
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:48,880
the natural process of hitting the

2179
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,640
snooze button until

2180
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,400
the deadline is right in front of us

2181
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,119
will work out for quite a long time for

2182
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:55,359
us humans

2183
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:56,960
and i fully agree i mean that's why i'm

2184
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:57,359
fundamentally may not sound like it thus

2185
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,520
far

2186
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:01,119
but i'm fundamentally very very

2187
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,560
optimistic about our ability to

2188
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:05,599
short-circuit this threat

2189
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:08,560
because there is again i'll stress

2190
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,320
um the technological feasibility and the

2191
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,400
profound affordability

2192
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:14,399
of a relatively simple set of steps that

2193
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:17,198
we can take to preclude it but we do

2194
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:19,439
have to take those steps and so you know

2195
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:21,599
what i'm hoping to do and trying to do

2196
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:23,198
is inject a notion of what those steps

2197
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,960
are you know into the public

2198
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:26,879
conversation and do my small part

2199
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,000
to up the odds that that actually ends

2200
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,119
up happening

2201
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,359
um you know it's the the danger with

2202
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:36,399
this one is it is exponential

2203
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:38,719
and i think that our minds are

2204
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:39,599
fundamentally struggle to understand

2205
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,760
exponential

2206
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,000
math it's just not something we're wired

2207
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,920
for our ancestors didn't

2208
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,439
confront exponential processes when they

2209
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,960
were growing up on the savannah

2210
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:51,039
so it's not something that's intuitive

2211
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,840
to us and our intuitions are reliably

2212
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:54,000
defeated

2213
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,840
when exponential processes come along so

2214
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,760
that that's issue number one

2215
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,440
and issue number two with something like

2216
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:02,560
this is

2217
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:04,158
you know it kind of only takes one you

2218
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,640
know that ball only has to go into the

2219
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:06,960
net

2220
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,840
once and we're doomed which is not the

2221
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,679
case

2222
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:12,079
with mass shooters it's not the case

2223
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,840
with you know commercial pilots run amok

2224
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:15,760
it's not the case

2225
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,640
with really any threat that i can think

2226
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:22,480
of with the exception of nuclear war

2227
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:25,679
that has the you know one bad outcome

2228
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:28,158
and game over and that that means that

2229
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:31,359
we need to be unbelievably serious about

2230
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:33,119
these defenses and we need to do things

2231
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:33,759
that might on the surface seem like a

2232
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:37,359
tremendous

2233
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:39,199
over reaction so that we can be prepared

2234
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:40,799
to nip anything that comes along in the

2235
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:43,678
bud but i like you

2236
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,239
believe that's imminently doable um i

2237
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,920
like you

2238
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:47,599
believe that the good guys outnumber the

2239
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,199
bad guys in this particular one to a

2240
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,000
degree that probably has no precedent in

2241
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:52,079
history

2242
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,760
i mean even the worst worst people i'm

2243
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:56,158
sure in isis

2244
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,440
even osama bin laden even any bad guy

2245
01:14:56,158 --> 01:15:00,879
you could imagine

2246
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:02,639
in history would be revolted by the idea

2247
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,640
of exterminating all of humanity

2248
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,920
i mean you know it's just that's a low

2249
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,920
bar

2250
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,039
and so the good guys completely

2251
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,440
outnumber

2252
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:13,600
the bad guys when it comes to this but

2253
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:16,879
the asymmetry and the fact that

2254
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,840
one catastrophic error could lead to

2255
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:19,679
unbelievably

2256
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,679
consequential things is what worries me

2257
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,520
here but i too am very optimistic

2258
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,039
the thing that i sometimes worry about

2259
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,560
is

2260
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:28,399
the fact that we haven't seen

2261
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,800
overwhelming evidence of alien

2262
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:33,039
civilizations out there

2263
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,400
makes me think um well there's a lot of

2264
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:36,719
explanations but one of them that

2265
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:39,359
worries me is that

2266
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:40,800
whenever they get smart they just

2267
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,599
destroy themselves oh yeah

2268
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:46,079
i mean that was the most fascinating is

2269
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,320
the most fascinating and chilling

2270
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:49,920
number or variable in the drake equation

2271
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:52,319
is l at the end

2272
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,480
at the end of it you look out you see

2273
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:56,158
you know one to 400 billion stars in the

2274
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:58,799
milky way galaxy

2275
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:00,799
and we now know because of kepler that

2276
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,039
an astonishingly high percentage of them

2277
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,279
probably have habitable planets

2278
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:07,039
and you know so all the things that were

2279
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:08,000
unknowns when the drake equation was

2280
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,920
originally written

2281
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,238
like you know how many stars have

2282
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:13,920
planets actually back then in the 1960s

2283
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:15,839
when the drake equation came along

2284
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,119
the consensus amongst astronomers was

2285
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,039
that it would be a small minority of

2286
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:21,039
solar systems that had planets or

2287
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:23,359
stars but now we know it's substantially

2288
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,840
all of them how many of those stars have

2289
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:26,000
habit

2290
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,600
have planets in the habitable zone it's

2291
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,800
kind of looking like 20

2292
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:33,440
like oh my god and so l which is

2293
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,920
how long does a civilization once it

2294
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:39,198
reaches technological competence

2295
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:42,560
continues to last that's the doozy

2296
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:45,039
and and you're right it's it's

2297
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,640
all too plausible to think that when a

2298
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:48,479
civilization reaches a level of

2299
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,480
sophistication that's probably just a

2300
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:53,759
decade or three in our future

2301
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:56,158
the odds of it self-destructing just

2302
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,280
start mounting astronomically no pun

2303
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:00,158
intended

2304
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,679
my hope is that that uh actually there

2305
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:03,198
is a lot of alien civilizations out

2306
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,960
there and what they figure out in order

2307
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:07,439
to avoid

2308
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,239
the self-destruction they need to turn

2309
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:10,079
off the

2310
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:11,839
thing that was useful that used to be a

2311
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:14,000
feature now became a bug which is

2312
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,039
uh the desire to colonize to conquer

2313
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,880
more land

2314
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:18,479
so they like there's probably ultra

2315
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,000
intelligent alien civilizations out

2316
01:17:18,479 --> 01:17:22,238
there they're just like chilling

2317
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,920
like on the beach with the with the

2318
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,079
whatever your favorite alcohol belt

2319
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,760
beverages but like without sort of

2320
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:30,800
trying to conquer everything

2321
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:32,480
just chilling out and maybe

2322
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:36,159
exploring in the in the realm of

2323
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:40,158
knowledge but almost like

2324
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:44,000
appreciating existence for its own sake

2325
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:47,599
versus uh life as a

2326
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,359
progression of conquering of other life

2327
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,800
like this kind of predator prey

2328
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:54,559
formulation that

2329
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:56,480
resulted in uh us humans perhaps is

2330
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,480
something we have to shed in order to

2331
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:01,678
survive i don't know

2332
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:03,279
yeah that that is um a very plausible

2333
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,480
solution to fermi's paradox and it's

2334
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:06,719
it's one that makes sense

2335
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:08,238
you know when we look at our own lives

2336
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:11,520
and their own archive project

2337
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:14,319
of technological um you know trajectory

2338
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,239
it's very very easy to imagine that in

2339
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:19,439
an intermediate future world of

2340
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:22,000
you know flawless vr or flawless

2341
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:24,079
you know whatever kind of simulation

2342
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
that we want to inhabit

2343
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:27,359
it will just simply cease to be

2344
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,560
worthwhile

2345
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:33,920
to go out and and expand our

2346
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:36,400
our interstellar territory and

2347
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,679
but if we were going out and conquering

2348
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:39,198
interstellar territory wouldn't

2349
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,560
necessarily have to be predator or prey

2350
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:42,559
i can imagine

2351
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:43,760
um a benign but sophisticated

2352
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,280
intelligence saying well we're going to

2353
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,480
go to places we're going to go to places

2354
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:47,840
that we can terraform

2355
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:50,158
and use a different word than terra

2356
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,600
obviously but we can turn into habitable

2357
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,479
for our particular

2358
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,120
physiology so long is that they don't

2359
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:57,039
house

2360
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:59,119
you know intelligent sentient creatures

2361
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:02,640
that would suffer from our invasion

2362
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:04,479
um but it is easy to see a sophisticated

2363
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,719
intelligent species evolving to the

2364
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:09,359
point where interstellar travel with its

2365
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,198
incalculable expense and physical

2366
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:12,559
hurdles just isn't worth it compared to

2367
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:15,198
what could be done

2368
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:16,800
you know where one already is so you

2369
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:18,639
talked about

2370
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,920
diagnostics at scale as a possible

2371
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:23,199
solution

2372
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:24,640
to future pandemics what about another

2373
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:27,359
possible solution which is

2374
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,400
kind of creating a backup copy you know

2375
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:31,439
i'm actually now

2376
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:33,279
um putting together nas for backup for

2377
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:34,879
myself for the first time taking backup

2378
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:36,880
of data seriously

2379
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,039
but if we were to take the uh the backup

2380
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,800
of human consciousness seriously and uh

2381
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:43,119
try to expand throughout the

2382
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,840
solar system and colonize other planets

2383
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:49,198
do you think that's an interesting uh

2384
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,960
solution one of many uh for

2385
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:53,279
protecting human civilizations from

2386
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,719
self-destruction sort of humans becoming

2387
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:56,479
a multi-planetary species

2388
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,079
oh absolutely i mean i find it

2389
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:59,759
electrifying first of all so i got a

2390
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:00,559
little bit of a personal bias when i was

2391
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,840
a kid

2392
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,039
i thought there was nothing cooler than

2393
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,480
rockets i thought there was nothing

2394
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:06,079
cooler than nasa

2395
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:07,919
i thought there was nothing cooler than

2396
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:10,238
people walking on the moon

2397
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,920
and as i grew up i thought there was

2398
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:13,678
nothing more tragic than the fact that

2399
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,279
we went from walking on the moon to

2400
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:17,119
at best getting to something like

2401
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:19,679
suborbital altitude

2402
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:22,079
and just i found that more and more

2403
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:25,520
depressing with the passage of decades

2404
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:27,840
at just the colossal expense of

2405
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:29,120
you know manned space travel and the

2406
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,639
fact that it seemed that we were

2407
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:31,679
unlikely to ever get back to the moon

2408
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:34,719
level on mars

2409
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:36,719
so i have a boundless appreciation for

2410
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,439
elon musk for many reasons but the fact

2411
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,480
that he has put

2412
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:41,839
mars on the incredible agenda is one of

2413
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:44,079
the things that i appreciate

2414
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,079
immensely so there's just this sort of

2415
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:47,198
space nerd in me that just says god

2416
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:49,119
that's cool

2417
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:50,559
but on a more practical level we were

2418
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:53,920
talking about

2419
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,719
you know uh potentially inhabiting

2420
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,199
planets

2421
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,119
that aren't our own and we're thinking

2422
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:02,719
about a benign civilization

2423
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:04,079
that would do that in in planetary

2424
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,000
circumstances

2425
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:07,359
where we're not causing other conscious

2426
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,039
systems to suffer

2427
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:11,198
i mean mars is a place that's very

2428
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:12,479
promising there may be microbial life

2429
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:13,439
there and i hope there is and if we

2430
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:14,799
found it i think it would be

2431
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:17,519
electrifying

2432
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,639
but i think ultimately the moral

2433
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,560
judgment would be made

2434
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:22,480
that you know the continued thriving of

2435
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:25,520
that microbial life

2436
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:27,039
is of less concern than creating a

2437
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,520
habitable planet to humans which would

2438
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:29,679
be a

2439
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,600
project on the many thousands of years

2440
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:32,000
scale but i don't think that that would

2441
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,719
be

2442
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,800
a greatly immoral act and if that

2443
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:39,039
happened and if mars became

2444
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,000
you know home to a self-sustaining group

2445
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:41,600
of humans

2446
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,198
that could survive a catastrophic

2447
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,719
mistake here on earth

2448
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:46,719
then yeah the fact that we have a backup

2449
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:47,039
quality is great and if we could make

2450
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,119
more

2451
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:51,119
i'm sorry not backup colony backup copy

2452
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:52,399
is great and if we can make more and

2453
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:54,880
more such backup

2454
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:56,879
copies throughout the solar system by

2455
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,719
hollowing out asteroids and whatever

2456
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,279
else it is maybe even venus we could get

2457
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:01,279
rid of

2458
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:03,599
three quarters of its atmosphere and you

2459
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:05,759
know turn it into a tropical paradise

2460
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,719
um i think all of that is wonderful now

2461
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,840
whether we can make the

2462
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,319
leap from that to interstellar trans

2463
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,319
transportation

2464
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:13,359
with the incredible distances that are

2465
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:16,000
involved

2466
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:17,279
um i think that's an open question but i

2467
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,679
think if we ever do that

2468
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:25,119
it would be more like the pacific

2469
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:27,840
ocean's uh channel of

2470
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:28,719
human expansion than the atlantic oceans

2471
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,039
and so

2472
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:31,760
what i mean by that is uh when we think

2473
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:34,560
about

2474
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,079
european society transmitting itself

2475
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:39,600
across the atlantic

2476
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:42,479
it's these big ambitious crazy

2477
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,600
expensive one-shot expeditions like

2478
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:45,919
columbus's

2479
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,039
to make it across this enormous expanse

2480
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,639
and at least initially

2481
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:50,079
without all any certainty that there's

2482
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:52,480
land on the other end right

2483
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:53,439
so that's kind of how i view our space

2484
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:55,839
program

2485
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:56,559
is like big you know very conscious

2486
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,560
deliberate

2487
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:00,400
efforts go from point a to point b if

2488
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:04,080
you look at how

2489
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:05,839
pacific islanders um transmitted

2490
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,279
you know their descendants and their

2491
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,920
culture and so forth

2492
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:11,279
throughout polynesia and beyond it was

2493
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,319
much more

2494
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:16,000
you know inhabiting a place getting to

2495
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:18,319
the point where there were people who

2496
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,238
were ambitious or unwelcome enough

2497
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:21,840
to decide it's time to go off island and

2498
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:22,879
find the next one and pray to find the

2499
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,039
next one

2500
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:27,039
that method of transmission didn't

2501
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:29,119
happen in a single

2502
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:30,479
con swift year but it happened over many

2503
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:32,079
many centuries

2504
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:33,919
and it was like going from this island

2505
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:35,600
to that island and probably for every

2506
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,199
expedition that went out to seek another

2507
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,679
island and actually lucked out and found

2508
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:40,000
one

2509
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,679
god knows how many were lost at sea but

2510
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,520
that form of transmission took place

2511
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:44,719
over a very long period of time and i

2512
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,120
could see us

2513
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,800
you know perhaps you know going from the

2514
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:50,479
inner solar system to the outer solar

2515
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,360
system to the kuiper belt to the oort

2516
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:53,119
cloud

2517
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,880
you know there's there's theories that

2518
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:56,479
there might be you know

2519
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,000
planets out there that are not anchored

2520
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:00,879
to stars like kind of

2521
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,920
hop hop slowly transmitting ourselves at

2522
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,199
some point we're actually an

2523
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:07,440
alpha centauri but i think that kind of

2524
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:09,519
backup copy and transmission of our

2525
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:12,198
physical presence and our culture

2526
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:13,920
to a diversity of you know

2527
01:24:12,198 --> 01:24:15,839
extraterrestrial

2528
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,359
outposts is a really exciting idea i

2529
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,679
really never thought about that because

2530
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:21,279
i

2531
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:22,399
i have thought my thinking about space

2532
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:24,479
exploration has been very

2533
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:26,319
atlantic ocean-centric in the sense that

2534
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:27,119
there will be one program with nasa and

2535
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:29,679
maybe

2536
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:31,519
private uh elon musk spacex or jeff

2537
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:34,480
bezos and so on

2538
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,120
but it's true that with the help of elon

2539
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:36,479
musk

2540
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:38,719
making it cheaper and cheaper more

2541
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:41,359
effective to create these technologies

2542
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:42,880
where you could go into deep space

2543
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:46,079
perhaps the way we actually

2544
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:50,560
colonize the solar system and

2545
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:52,719
uh and expand out into the galaxy

2546
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,159
is basically just like these like

2547
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:57,198
renegade ships

2548
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:59,198
of of uh weirdos

2549
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:02,079
it's just kind of like like home like

2550
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:03,678
most of them like quote-unquote homemade

2551
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:05,279
but they just kind of venture out into

2552
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:07,440
space and just like

2553
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:08,800
like you know the android the initial

2554
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,719
android model like

2555
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:13,279
millions of like these little ships just

2556
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:15,920
flying out most of them die off

2557
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,559
uh in horrible accidents but some of

2558
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,560
them will

2559
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,600
will persist or there'll be stories of

2560
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,120
them persisting

2561
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,520
and over a period of decades and

2562
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:26,319
centuries there'll be other attempts

2563
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:28,000
almost always as a response to the main

2564
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:29,759
set of efforts that's interesting

2565
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,279
yeah because you kind of think of mars

2566
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,480
colonization as

2567
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:35,119
the big nasa elon musk effort of a big

2568
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:37,439
colony

2569
01:25:35,119 --> 01:25:39,359
but maybe the successful one would be

2570
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:42,079
you know like a decade after that

2571
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:42,479
there'll be like a ship from like some

2572
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:44,399
kid

2573
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:46,079
some high school kid who gets together a

2574
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:46,960
large team and does something probably

2575
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:49,279
illegal

2576
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,560
and launches something where they end up

2577
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:52,559
actually persisting

2578
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,600
quite a bit and from that learning

2579
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,760
lessons

2580
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,840
that nobody ever gave permission for but

2581
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,400
somehow actually flourish

2582
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,360
and and then take that into the scale of

2583
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:04,158
uh

2584
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:05,439
centuries forward into the into the rest

2585
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:07,920
of space that's really interesting

2586
01:26:05,439 --> 01:26:09,678
yeah i think i think the giant steps are

2587
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,279
likely to be nasa-like efforts like

2588
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:12,719
there is no intermediate rock well i

2589
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:13,920
guess it's the moon but even getting the

2590
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,679
moon ain't that easy

2591
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,279
between us and mars right so like the

2592
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:19,600
giant sat steps the

2593
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:21,840
the big hubs like the o'hare airports

2594
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,199
yeah of the future probably will be very

2595
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,360
deliberate efforts

2596
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,719
but then you know you would have i think

2597
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:29,599
that kind of

2598
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:31,279
diffusion as space travel becomes more

2599
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:33,600
democratized and more capable you'll

2600
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:35,279
have this sort of natural diffusion of

2601
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,880
people who kind of want to be off grid

2602
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:38,238
or think they can make a fortune there

2603
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,600
you know kind of mentality that drove

2604
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:41,759
people to san francisco i mean

2605
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,960
san francisco was not populated as a

2606
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,960
result of

2607
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,800
a king ferdinand and isabella-like

2608
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,480
effort to fund columbus going over it

2609
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,440
was just a whole bunch of people making

2610
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:51,519
individual

2611
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:52,719
decisions that there's gold in them thar

2612
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,840
hills and i'm going to go out and get a

2613
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:55,279
piece of it so

2614
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,279
i could see that kind of fusion what i

2615
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:59,198
can't see and the reason that i think

2616
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:00,158
the specific model of transmission is

2617
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:03,039
more likely

2618
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:03,679
is i just can't see a nasa-like effort

2619
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:07,198
to go

2620
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:10,480
from earth to alpha centauri it's just

2621
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:11,678
too far i just see lots and lots and

2622
01:27:10,479 --> 01:27:14,479
lots of

2623
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:16,319
relatively tiny steps between now and

2624
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:18,799
there and the fact is that there is

2625
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:21,039
there are large chunks of matter going

2626
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,400
at least a light year beyond the sun i

2627
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:24,319
mean the oort cloud i think

2628
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:25,759
extends at least a light year beyond the

2629
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:26,880
sun and

2630
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,480
you know then maybe there are these

2631
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,159
untethered planets after that we won't

2632
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:32,399
really know till we get there

2633
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:33,519
and if our cloud goes out a light year

2634
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:35,439
and alpha centauri's

2635
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,520
or cloud goes out of light year you've

2636
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:39,678
already cut in half the distance

2637
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,880
you know so who knows but yeah one of

2638
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:43,119
the possibilities

2639
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,840
probably the cheapest and most effective

2640
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:48,000
way to create

2641
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:50,400
interesting interstellar

2642
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,679
spacecraft is ones that are powered and

2643
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:53,519
driven by ai

2644
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:56,639
and you can think of here's where you

2645
01:27:53,520 --> 01:28:00,080
have high school students be able to

2646
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:02,159
build a sort of a hal 9000 version uh

2647
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:03,519
the modern version of that

2648
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:05,679
and it's kind of interesting to think

2649
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:09,920
about these uh

2650
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:12,880
robots traveling out throughout perhaps

2651
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:14,399
perhaps sadly long after human

2652
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,719
civilization is gone

2653
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:18,479
there will be these intelligent robots

2654
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:21,520
flying throughout space

2655
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:22,158
and perhaps land on uh office entire bee

2656
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,040
or

2657
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:25,920
any of those kinds of planets and uh and

2658
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:31,198
colonize

2659
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:34,480
sort of humanity continues

2660
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:35,359
through the proliferation of our

2661
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:38,079
creations

2662
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:38,719
like uh like robotic creations that have

2663
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:42,079
some

2664
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:43,840
echoes of that uh intelligence hopefully

2665
01:28:42,079 --> 01:28:45,359
also the consciousness does that make

2666
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:49,440
you sad the future

2667
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:53,198
where agi super intelligent or just

2668
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:56,158
mediocre intelligent ai systems outlive

2669
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:57,919
humans yeah i guess it depends on the

2670
01:28:56,158 --> 01:28:59,519
circumstances in which they outlive

2671
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,639
humans so let's take the example that

2672
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:03,120
you just gave

2673
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:05,039
uh we send out you know very

2674
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:07,519
sophisticated agis

2675
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:08,238
on simple rocket ships relatively simple

2676
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,679
ones

2677
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:11,519
that don't have to have all the life

2678
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,560
support necessary for humans and

2679
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,280
therefore

2680
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:17,360
they're of trivial mass compared to a

2681
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:19,119
crude ship a generation ship

2682
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:21,198
and therefore they're way more likely to

2683
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:23,039
happen so let's use that example

2684
01:29:21,198 --> 01:29:24,559
and let's say that they travel to

2685
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:26,158
distant planets at

2686
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,840
you know a speed that's not much faster

2687
01:29:26,158 --> 01:29:29,839
than what a chemical rocket can achieve

2688
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:31,119
and so it's inevitably tens hundreds of

2689
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,480
thousands of years before they make

2690
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:34,238
landfall someplace

2691
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:36,559
so let's imagine that's going on and

2692
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:38,718
meanwhile

2693
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:41,039
we die for reasons that have nothing to

2694
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:42,158
do with those agis diffusing throughout

2695
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:43,679
the solar system

2696
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:46,158
whether it's through climate change

2697
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,199
nuclear war you know syn bio rogues and

2698
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:49,039
bio whatever

2699
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:51,359
in that kind of scenario the notion of

2700
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:52,960
the agis that we created outlasting us

2701
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:56,639
is very reassuring

2702
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:59,279
because it says that like we we ended

2703
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:01,039
but our descendants are out there and

2704
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:02,800
hopefully some of them make landfall

2705
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:04,800
and create some echo of who we are so

2706
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:07,840
that's a very optimistic one

2707
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:09,119
where is the terminator scenario of a

2708
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,360
super agi

2709
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:12,719
arising on earth and getting left let

2710
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:15,198
out of its box

2711
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:16,639
due to some boo-boo on the part of its

2712
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:17,678
creators who do not have super

2713
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:20,000
intelligence

2714
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:21,840
and then deciding that for whatever

2715
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,158
reason it doesn't have any need for us

2716
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,400
to be around and exterminating us

2717
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:27,759
that makes me feel crushingly sad i mean

2718
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:30,559
look i was sad

2719
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,440
when my elementary school was shut down

2720
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,800
and bulldozed

2721
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:34,960
even though i hadn't been a student

2722
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:36,880
there for decades yeah you know the

2723
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,359
thought of my hometown

2724
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,800
getting disbanded is even worse that's

2725
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:42,719
the thought of my home state of

2726
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,560
connecticut getting disbanded and like

2727
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:46,719
absorbed into massachusetts is even

2728
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,480
worse the notion of humanity is just

2729
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:51,439
crushingly crushingly sad to me

2730
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:52,799
so you you hate goodbyes i i certain

2731
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:54,399
goodbyes yes

2732
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,000
some goodbyes are really really

2733
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:59,839
liberating but yes

2734
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:03,039
well but what if the terminators um

2735
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:05,679
you know have consciousness and enjoy

2736
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:07,519
the hell out of life as well they're

2737
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:09,760
just better at it

2738
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:11,040
yeah well the have consciousness is a

2739
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:15,600
really key element

2740
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:18,639
and so there's no reason to be certain

2741
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,440
that a super intelligence would have

2742
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,199
consciousness

2743
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:23,919
we don't know that factually at all and

2744
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:26,000
so what is a very lonely outcome to me

2745
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:28,399
is the rise of a super intelligence that

2746
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,880
has a certain optimization function

2747
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,960
that it's either been programmed with or

2748
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,679
that arises in an emergently

2749
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:37,119
that says hey i want to do this thing

2750
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:38,800
for which humans are either an

2751
01:31:37,119 --> 01:31:40,559
unacceptable risk their presence is

2752
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,079
either an unacceptable risk or they're

2753
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:44,719
just collateral damage

2754
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:46,880
but there is no consciousness there then

2755
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:49,439
the idea of the light of consciousness

2756
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,920
being snuffed out by something that is

2757
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:52,960
very

2758
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:55,279
competent but has no consciousness is

2759
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,000
really really sad yeah but i tend to

2760
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:57,759
believe that

2761
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,439
it's almost impossible to create a super

2762
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:01,119
intelligent agent that can't destroy

2763
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:01,678
human civilization without it being

2764
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:04,158
conscious

2765
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:04,719
it's like those are coupled like you

2766
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:07,759
have to

2767
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:11,760
in order to destroy humans or

2768
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:14,480
supersede humans you really have to

2769
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:16,719
be accepted by humans i think this idea

2770
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:19,919
that you can build systems

2771
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:21,840
that that destroy human civilization

2772
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,600
without them being deeply integrated

2773
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,440
into human civilization is impossible

2774
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:28,079
and for them to be integrated

2775
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:29,359
they have to be human-like not just in

2776
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:32,158
body and form but

2777
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:34,479
in in all the things that we value as

2778
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:36,319
humans one of which is consciousness

2779
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:37,919
the other one is just ability to

2780
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:39,920
communicate the other ones poetry

2781
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:42,079
music and beauty and all those things

2782
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:44,158
like they have to be

2783
01:32:42,079 --> 01:32:45,198
all of those things i mean this is what

2784
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:47,920
i think about

2785
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:49,279
it it does make me sad but it's letting

2786
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:52,800
go

2787
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:55,198
which is uh they might be just better at

2788
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,079
everything we appreciate than us and

2789
01:32:55,198 --> 01:32:58,879
that's sad

2790
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:00,000
and and hopefully they'll keep us around

2791
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:03,039
but

2792
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,039
i think it's a kind of

2793
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:07,840
it is a kind of goodbye to uh

2794
01:33:06,238 --> 01:33:10,638
like realizing that we're not the most

2795
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:12,960
special species on earth anymore

2796
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:15,600
that's still painful it's still painful

2797
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,600
and in terms of whether

2798
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,120
such a creation would have to be

2799
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:22,159
conscious let's say

2800
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:23,439
i'm not so sure i mean you know let's

2801
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:24,719
imagine something that can pass the

2802
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:26,079
turing test

2803
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,239
you know that something that passes the

2804
01:33:26,079 --> 01:33:30,559
turing test could over text

2805
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:32,079
based interaction in any event um

2806
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,600
successfully mimic

2807
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:35,119
uh you know a very conscious

2808
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,039
intelligence on the other end but just

2809
01:33:35,119 --> 01:33:39,439
be completely unconscious

2810
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:40,800
so that's a possibility and that if you

2811
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:42,879
take that up a radical step

2812
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:45,119
which i think we can be permitted if

2813
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:47,199
we're thinking about super intelligence

2814
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:48,319
um you could have something that could

2815
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:51,279
reason its way

2816
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:53,198
through this is my optimization function

2817
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:54,639
and in order to get to it

2818
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:56,638
i've got to deal with these messy

2819
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:58,560
somewhat illogical things that are as

2820
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:01,359
intelligent in relation to me

2821
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,320
as they are intelligent relation to ants

2822
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:04,000
i can

2823
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:05,679
trick them manipulate them whatever and

2824
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,279
i know the resources i need i know this

2825
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:09,359
i need this amount of power

2826
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:11,198
i need to seize control of these

2827
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:13,599
manufacturing resources

2828
01:34:11,198 --> 01:34:15,198
that are robotically operated i need to

2829
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,960
improve those robots with software

2830
01:34:15,198 --> 01:34:17,599
upgrades and then ultimately mechanical

2831
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,158
upgrades

2832
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:21,280
which i can affect through x y and z

2833
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:22,960
that doesn't you know

2834
01:34:21,279 --> 01:34:24,319
that could still be a thing that passes

2835
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,960
the turing test

2836
01:34:24,319 --> 01:34:27,759
i don't think it's necessarily certain

2837
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:30,960
that

2838
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:34,480
that optimization function mass

2839
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:37,520
you know um maximizing entity

2840
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:39,678
would be conscious see i so this is from

2841
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:42,719
a very engineering perspective because i

2842
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:44,079
i think a lot about natural language

2843
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,800
processing all those kind of from

2844
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:48,960
so very i'm speaking to a very specific

2845
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:51,440
problem of just say the touring test

2846
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,158
i really think that something like

2847
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:54,879
consciousness

2848
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:55,920
is required when you say reasoning

2849
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,840
you're separating that from

2850
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:59,920
consciousness but i think

2851
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:02,000
consciousness is part of reasoning in in

2852
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:04,079
the sense that

2853
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,439
you will not be able to become super

2854
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,158
intelligent

2855
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:09,678
in the way that it's required to be part

2856
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:11,759
of human society

2857
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:13,520
without having consciousness like i i

2858
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,639
really think it's impossible to separate

2859
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:17,040
the consciousness thing

2860
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:18,239
but it's hard to define consciousness

2861
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:20,800
when you just use that word

2862
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:21,919
sure even just like the capacity the way

2863
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:25,039
i think about

2864
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,800
consciousness is the important

2865
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:28,800
symptoms or maybe consequences of

2866
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:32,400
consciousness one of which is

2867
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:33,760
the capacity to suffer i think ai will

2868
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:36,000
need to be able to

2869
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:37,199
suffer in order to become super

2870
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,679
intelligent

2871
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:40,319
to feel the pain the uncertainty the

2872
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:42,079
doubt

2873
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:43,840
the other part of that is not just the

2874
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:47,359
suffering but the con

2875
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:50,639
the ability to understand

2876
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:52,639
that it too is mortal in in a sense that

2877
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,760
has a self-awareness about his presence

2878
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:56,319
in the world

2879
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:57,280
understand that it's finite and be

2880
01:35:56,319 --> 01:35:59,359
terrified

2881
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:00,880
of that finiteness i personally think

2882
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:02,079
that's the fundamental part of the human

2883
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:04,000
condition is this

2884
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:05,198
fear of death that most of us construct

2885
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,279
an illusion around but

2886
01:36:05,198 --> 01:36:08,479
i think ai would need to be able to

2887
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:11,840
really

2888
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:14,959
have it part of its whole essence

2889
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:16,400
like every computation every part of the

2890
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,000
thing that generates

2891
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:19,599
that does both the perception and

2892
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,760
generates the behavior

2893
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,800
will have to have i don't know how this

2894
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,920
is accomplished

2895
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:27,920
but it i believe it has to truly be

2896
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:30,480
terrified of death

2897
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,359
truly have the capacity to suffer and

2898
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:32,959
from that

2899
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:35,039
something that would be recognized to us

2900
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:36,158
humans as consciousness would emerge

2901
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:38,079
whether it's the illusion of

2902
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:40,238
consciousness i don't know the point

2903
01:36:38,079 --> 01:36:41,840
is it looks a whole hell of a lot like

2904
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:45,839
consciousness to us humans

2905
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:48,880
and i believe the ai when you ask it

2906
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:50,719
will also say that it is conscious

2907
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:52,159
you know in the full sense that we say

2908
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:53,760
that we're conscious

2909
01:36:52,158 --> 01:36:55,439
and all of that i think is fully

2910
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,560
integrated like you can't separate the

2911
01:36:55,439 --> 01:37:00,079
two the

2912
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:02,960
idea of the paper clip maximizer

2913
01:37:00,079 --> 01:37:03,760
that sort of ultra rationally would be

2914
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,079
able to destroy

2915
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,560
all humans because it's really good at

2916
01:37:06,079 --> 01:37:11,760
that at accomplishing

2917
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:13,119
the um a simple objective function

2918
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,600
that doesn't care about the value of

2919
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:17,920
humans it may be possible but the number

2920
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:20,079
of trajectories to that

2921
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,600
are far outnumbered by the trajectories

2922
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:22,238
that create something that is conscious

2923
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,039
something that

2924
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:26,479
appreciative of beauty creates beautiful

2925
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:27,679
things in the same way that humans can

2926
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:31,279
create beautiful things

2927
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:34,399
and ultimately like the the sad

2928
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:38,399
destructive path for that ai

2929
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:41,519
would look a lot like just better humans

2930
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:43,599
than uh than like these cold machines

2931
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:45,920
and i would say of course the cold

2932
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:48,960
machines that lack consciousness

2933
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,520
the the philosophical zombies make me

2934
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,920
sad

2935
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,760
but also what makes me sad is just

2936
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:57,039
things that are far more powerful and

2937
01:37:53,760 --> 01:38:00,480
smart and uh creative than us

2938
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:01,840
too because then then um in the same way

2939
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:04,158
that

2940
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:06,319
alpha zero becoming a better chess

2941
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:08,479
player than the best of humans

2942
01:38:06,319 --> 01:38:10,639
even starting with deep blue but really

2943
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:12,319
with alpha zero

2944
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:14,239
that makes me sad too one of the most

2945
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:17,519
beautiful games

2946
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:19,599
that humans ever created uh

2947
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:22,000
that used to be seen as demonstrations

2948
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:24,480
of the intellect which is chess

2949
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,238
and go in other parts of the world have

2950
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:27,118
been solved by ai that that makes me

2951
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:28,799
quite sad

2952
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:30,399
and it feels like the progress of that

2953
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,400
is just pushing on forward

2954
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:33,519
oh it makes me sad too and to be

2955
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:35,920
perfectly clear i

2956
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,119
i absolutely believe that artificial

2957
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,359
consciousness

2958
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:41,039
is entirely possible and it's not

2959
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:42,000
something i rule out at all i mean you

2960
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:45,279
if you could

2961
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:47,198
get smart enough to have a perfect map

2962
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:48,800
of the neural structure and the neural

2963
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:50,399
states and the amount of

2964
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,480
neurotransmitters that are going between

2965
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:53,118
every synapse in a particular person's

2966
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:55,919
mind

2967
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:56,479
could you replicate that in silica at

2968
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,719
some

2969
01:38:56,479 --> 01:39:00,319
you know reasonably distant you know

2970
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:01,760
point in the future absolutely and then

2971
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:03,359
you'd have a consciousness i don't

2972
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,520
rule out the possibility of artificial

2973
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:07,759
consciousness in any way

2974
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,639
what i'm less certain about is whether

2975
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:11,280
consciousness

2976
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:13,600
is a requirement for super intelligence

2977
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:14,399
pursuing a maximizing function of some

2978
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:17,600
sort

2979
01:39:14,399 --> 01:39:20,479
um i don't i don't feel the certitude

2980
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,199
that consciousness simply must be part

2981
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:23,198
of that

2982
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:25,118
um you had said you know for it to

2983
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:27,118
coexist with human society

2984
01:39:25,118 --> 01:39:29,118
would need to be consciousness could be

2985
01:39:27,118 --> 01:39:32,639
entirely true but it also could

2986
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:35,319
just exist orthogonally to human society

2987
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:36,639
and it could also upon attaining a

2988
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:39,198
superintelligence

2989
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:40,719
with a maximizing function very very

2990
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:42,319
very rapidly

2991
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,158
because of the speed at which computing

2992
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:47,039
works compared to our own

2993
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:48,079
you know meat based minds very very

2994
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:50,158
rapidly

2995
01:39:48,079 --> 01:39:51,679
make the decisions and calculations

2996
01:39:50,158 --> 01:39:53,359
necessary to seize the reigns of power

2997
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:54,239
before we even know what's going on yeah

2998
01:39:53,359 --> 01:39:56,158
i mean kind of like

2999
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:57,839
biological viruses do yeah don't

3000
01:39:56,158 --> 01:39:59,920
necessarily they they integrate

3001
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:02,639
themselves just fine with human society

3002
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:03,279
yeah without technically without

3003
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:04,880
consciousness

3004
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:06,800
without even being alive you know

3005
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:07,760
technically by the standards of a lot of

3006
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,079
biologists

3007
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:12,480
so this is a bit of a tangent but you've

3008
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:15,039
uh talked with sam

3009
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:16,158
harris on that four hour special episode

3010
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:20,479
we mentioned

3011
01:40:16,158 --> 01:40:22,079
and um i just curious to ask because i

3012
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:24,799
use this meditation app i've been using

3013
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:26,559
the past month to meditate is this

3014
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:28,639
something you've integrated as part of

3015
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,800
your life meditation or fasting

3016
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:33,760
or has has some of sam harris rubbed off

3017
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:36,880
on you in terms of his appreciation of

3018
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:38,639
of meditation and just kind of from a

3019
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,359
third person perspective analyzing your

3020
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:41,440
own mind

3021
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:43,759
consciousness free will and so on you

3022
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:46,319
know i have tried it three separate

3023
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:48,159
times in my life really made a concerted

3024
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:50,960
attack on meditation

3025
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:52,399
and integrating it into my life um one

3026
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,319
of them the most extreme was i

3027
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:55,519
i took a class based on the work of john

3028
01:40:54,319 --> 01:40:58,479
kabat-zinn

3029
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:58,719
uh who is you know in many ways one of

3030
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:01,279
the

3031
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:02,880
the founding people behind the mindful

3032
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:05,118
meditation movement

3033
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,600
uh that required like part of the class

3034
01:41:05,118 --> 01:41:10,559
was you know it was a weekly class

3035
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:11,280
and you were going to meditate an hour a

3036
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,480
day

3037
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:16,238
every day and having done that for i

3038
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:18,399
think was 10 weeks it might have been 13

3039
01:41:16,238 --> 01:41:20,238
however long period of time was at the

3040
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:22,158
end of it it just didn't stick as soon

3041
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:23,599
as it was over

3042
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:26,559
you know i did not feel that

3043
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:30,560
gravitational pull i did not feel

3044
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:32,960
the collapse in quality of life after

3045
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:34,239
wimping out on that on that project and

3046
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:35,600
then the most recent one was actually

3047
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:38,238
with sam's app

3048
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,719
uh during during the lockdown i did make

3049
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:40,959
a

3050
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:41,840
pretty good and consistent concerted

3051
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:44,079
effort to

3052
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:45,440
listen to his 10-minute meditation every

3053
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:48,238
day and i've always

3054
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:49,839
fallen away from it and i i you know

3055
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:51,039
you're kind of interpreting why did i

3056
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,880
personally do this

3057
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:54,238
i do believe it was ultimately because

3058
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,639
it wasn't

3059
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:57,919
bringing me that you know joy or inner

3060
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:59,600
peace or

3061
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:01,520
better confidence of being me that i was

3062
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:03,119
hoping to get from it

3063
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,520
otherwise i think i would have clung to

3064
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:07,279
it in the way that we cling to certain

3065
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:08,639
good habits like i'm really good at

3066
01:42:07,279 --> 01:42:09,039
flossing my teeth not that you were

3067
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:11,359
going to

3068
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:12,639
ask lex but that's one thing that

3069
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:15,359
defeats a lot of people

3070
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:15,920
i'm good at that see uh herman hesse i

3071
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:18,319
think

3072
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,679
uh if you know which book or maybe i

3073
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:21,840
forget where

3074
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,719
i've read everything of his so it's it's

3075
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,880
unclear

3076
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:28,800
uh where it came from but he had this

3077
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:32,719
idea that anybody who is um

3078
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:35,360
who truly achieves mastery in things

3079
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:36,239
will learn how to meditate in some way

3080
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:39,519
so it could be the

3081
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:40,399
that for you the flossing of teeth is is

3082
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,159
yet another

3083
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:44,000
like little inkling of meditation like

3084
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:46,079
it doesn't have to be this very

3085
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,079
particular kind of meditation maybe

3086
01:42:46,079 --> 01:42:49,600
podcasting of an amazing podcast

3087
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:51,198
that could be meditation the writing

3088
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:54,159
process is meditation

3089
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:54,158
for me like

3090
01:42:55,039 --> 01:43:00,238
there's there's a bunch of there's a

3091
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:02,639
bunch of mechanisms which take my mind

3092
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:04,399
into a very particular place that looks

3093
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:07,440
a whole lot like meditation

3094
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:09,839
for example when i've been running

3095
01:43:07,439 --> 01:43:11,359
uh for the over the past couple years

3096
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:12,719
and um

3097
01:43:11,359 --> 01:43:14,559
especially when i listen to certain

3098
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:16,719
kinds of audiobooks

3099
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,600
like i've listened to the rise and fall

3100
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:20,079
of the third reich

3101
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:20,880
i've listened to a lot of sort of world

3102
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:24,960
war ii

3103
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:27,118
which at once because i have a lot of

3104
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:29,279
family who's lost in world war ii and so

3105
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:31,279
so much of the soviet union is grounded

3106
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:33,118
in the suffering of world war ii

3107
01:43:31,279 --> 01:43:35,599
that somehow it connects me to my

3108
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:38,960
history but also

3109
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:40,800
there's some kind of purifying aspect to

3110
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:42,719
thinking about how cruel

3111
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,719
but at the same time how beautiful human

3112
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:45,520
nature could be and so you're also

3113
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:48,399
running

3114
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:50,080
like it clears the mind from all the

3115
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:51,599
concerns of the world and somehow it

3116
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:52,880
takes you to this place where you're

3117
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,280
like deeply

3118
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,880
appreciative to be alive in the sense

3119
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:57,759
that as opposed to listening to your

3120
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,600
breath

3121
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,199
or like feeling your breath and thinking

3122
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,639
about your consciousness and all those

3123
01:44:01,198 --> 01:44:05,759
kinds of processes

3124
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:06,000
that uh sam's app does well this does

3125
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:09,199
that

3126
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,479
for me the the running and flossing may

3127
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:12,479
do that for you

3128
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:14,879
so maybe herman has these onto something

3129
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:16,638
so yeah i hope flossing is not my main

3130
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,319
form of expertise although i am going to

3131
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:18,880
claim a certain expertise there and i'm

3132
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:20,719
going to claim

3133
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:22,560
somebody has to be the best flosser in

3134
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:24,000
the world that ain't me i'm just glad

3135
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,360
that i'm a consistent one i mean there

3136
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,560
are a lot of things that bring me into a

3137
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:28,880
flow state and i think maybe

3138
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:30,480
perhaps that's one reason why meditation

3139
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,639
isn't as necessary for me

3140
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:33,919
um i definitely enter a flow state when

3141
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:35,279
i'm writing i'm definitely in her flow

3142
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:37,440
state when i'm editing i definitely

3143
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:38,800
enter a flow state when i'm mixing and

3144
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:40,719
mastering music

3145
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:42,400
um i enter a flow state when i'm doing

3146
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:46,399
heavy heavy research

3147
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:48,479
to either prepare for a podcast or to

3148
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:49,839
also do tech investing you know to make

3149
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:52,638
myself smart

3150
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,440
in a a new field that is fairly alien to

3151
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:55,760
me

3152
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:56,559
um i can just the hours can just melt

3153
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,000
away

3154
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,679
while i'm you know reading this and

3155
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,359
watching that youtube lecture and

3156
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:03,520
you know going through this presentation

3157
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:05,039
and so forth so maybe because there's a

3158
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,920
lot of things that bring me into a flow

3159
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:07,840
state

3160
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:09,199
in my normal weekly life not daily

3161
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,239
unfortunately but certainly my normal

3162
01:45:09,198 --> 01:45:12,319
weekly life

3163
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:13,839
that i have less of an urge to meditate

3164
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:15,840
you've been working with sam's app

3165
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:17,279
for about a month now you said um is

3166
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,560
this your first run-in with meditation

3167
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:19,920
it's your first attempt to integrate it

3168
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,440
with with your life for like

3169
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:24,079
meditation meditation yeah i always

3170
01:45:21,439 --> 01:45:26,238
thought running and thinking

3171
01:45:24,079 --> 01:45:27,279
i listened to brown noise often that

3172
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:28,559
takes my mind

3173
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,319
i don't know what the hell it does but

3174
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,239
it takes my mind immediately into like

3175
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:33,279
the state where i'm deeply focused on

3176
01:45:32,238 --> 01:45:34,638
anything i do

3177
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:36,399
i don't know why so it's like you're

3178
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:37,760
accompanying sound

3179
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:39,519
yeah really what's the difference

3180
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:41,360
between brown and white noise this is a

3181
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:43,199
cool term i haven't heard before

3182
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:44,158
so people should look up brown noise

3183
01:45:43,198 --> 01:45:45,198
they don't have to because you're about

3184
01:45:44,158 --> 01:45:47,039
to tell them what it is

3185
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:48,638
oh because you have to experience you

3186
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:51,439
have to listen to it so i think

3187
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:53,118
white noise is uh this is this has to do

3188
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:54,399
with music i think

3189
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:58,000
there's different colors there's pink

3190
01:45:54,399 --> 01:46:00,799
noise and i think that has to do with uh

3191
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,399
like the frequencies like the white

3192
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:06,079
noise is usually

3193
01:46:02,399 --> 01:46:09,118
uh less bassy brow noise is very bassy

3194
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:12,639
so it's more like like

3195
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:14,960
versus like like the

3196
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:16,800
if that makes sense so yeah it takes

3197
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,920
there's like a deepness to it i think it

3198
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:22,480
everyone is different but for me uh

3199
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:25,118
i i was it was when i was uh i was a

3200
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:26,000
research scientist at mit when i would

3201
01:46:25,118 --> 01:46:28,319
especially when there's a lot of

3202
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,920
students around

3203
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:31,439
i remember just being annoyed at the

3204
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,118
noise of people talking

3205
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:34,799
and one of my colleagues said well you

3206
01:46:33,118 --> 01:46:36,639
should try listening to brown noise

3207
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:38,560
like it really knocks out everything

3208
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:40,319
because i used to wear your earplugs too

3209
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:43,199
like just see if i can block it out

3210
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:43,920
and one like the moment i put it on

3211
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:47,198
something

3212
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:48,079
it's as if my mind was waiting all these

3213
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:50,559
years

3214
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:51,519
to hear that sound everything's just

3215
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:53,280
focused in

3216
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:54,800
at least it makes me wonder how many

3217
01:46:53,279 --> 01:46:57,118
other amazing things out there

3218
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,480
they're waiting to discover from my own

3219
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:00,880
particular

3220
01:46:58,479 --> 01:47:01,519
like biological for my own particular

3221
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:05,199
brain

3222
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:07,280
so that it just goes the mind just

3223
01:47:05,198 --> 01:47:09,118
focuses in it's kind of incredible so i

3224
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:11,000
see that as a kind of meditation

3225
01:47:09,118 --> 01:47:12,719
maybe uh i'm using a

3226
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,439
performance-enhancing uh

3227
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:16,800
uh sound to achieve that meditation but

3228
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:18,638
i've been doing that for

3229
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,560
for many years now and running and

3230
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:22,719
walking and doing uh

3231
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:24,639
cal newport was the first person that

3232
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:28,158
introduced me to the idea of deep work

3233
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:30,400
just put a word to the kind of thinking

3234
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:31,839
that's required to sort of deeply think

3235
01:47:30,399 --> 01:47:33,198
about a problem especially if it's

3236
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,039
mathematical in nature

3237
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:37,519
i see that as a kind of meditation

3238
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:39,198
because what it's doing is you're

3239
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:40,400
you have these constructs in your mind

3240
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:40,879
that you're building on top of each

3241
01:47:40,399 --> 01:47:42,238
other

3242
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,560
and there's all these distracting

3243
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:46,158
thoughts that keep bombarding your

3244
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:49,039
from all over the place and the whole

3245
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:50,960
process is you slowly let them kind of

3246
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:52,560
move past you and that's a meditative

3247
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:53,520
process it's very meditative that sounds

3248
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,560
a lot like what

3249
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:58,800
sam talks about um in his meditation app

3250
01:47:56,560 --> 01:48:01,440
which i did use to be clear for a while

3251
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:03,199
of just letting the thought go by

3252
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:04,638
without deranging you derangement is one

3253
01:48:03,198 --> 01:48:05,359
of sam's favorite words as i'm sure you

3254
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:07,920
know

3255
01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:09,759
um but uh brown noise that's really

3256
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:11,440
intriguing i am i am going to try that

3257
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:13,440
as soon as this evening

3258
01:48:11,439 --> 01:48:15,678
yeah to see to see if it works but very

3259
01:48:13,439 --> 01:48:17,279
well might not work at all so yeah yeah

3260
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:20,079
i think the interesting point is and the

3261
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:23,920
same with the fasting and the diet

3262
01:48:20,079 --> 01:48:28,158
is uh i long ago

3263
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:28,880
stopped trusting experts or maybe taking

3264
01:48:28,158 --> 01:48:32,238
the word of

3265
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:33,039
experts as the gospel truth and only

3266
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:36,238
using it

3267
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:40,800
as a an inspiration to try

3268
01:48:36,238 --> 01:48:42,238
something to try thoroughly something so

3269
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,920
fasting was one of the things when i

3270
01:48:42,238 --> 01:48:46,559
first discovered i've been

3271
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:49,118
many times eating just once a day so

3272
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:51,440
that's a 24-hour fast

3273
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:54,319
it makes me feel amazing and at the same

3274
01:48:51,439 --> 01:48:56,960
time eating only meat

3275
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:58,000
putting ethical concerns aside makes me

3276
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,880
feel amazing i

3277
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,359
don't know why it doesn't the the point

3278
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,679
is to be

3279
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:05,519
an n of one scientist until nutrition

3280
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:07,679
science becomes a real science

3281
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:10,159
to it to where it's doing like studies

3282
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:12,639
that deeply understand

3283
01:49:10,158 --> 01:49:14,000
the biology underlying all of it and

3284
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:17,359
also does

3285
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:19,920
real thorough long-term

3286
01:49:17,359 --> 01:49:20,880
studies of thousands if not millions of

3287
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:24,000
people

3288
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:25,679
versus uh versus a very like small

3289
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,719
studies that are kind of generalizing

3290
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:28,960
from

3291
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:30,000
the very from very noisy data and all

3292
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,239
those kinds of things

3293
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
where you can't control all the elements

3294
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:35,359
particularly because our own personal

3295
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,359
metabolism

3296
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:39,118
is highly variant among us so there are

3297
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:41,198
going to be some people like if brown

3298
01:49:39,118 --> 01:49:44,479
noise is a game changer

3299
01:49:41,198 --> 01:49:45,359
for seven percent of people yeah there's

3300
01:49:44,479 --> 01:49:47,039
93

3301
01:49:45,359 --> 01:49:48,479
odds that i'm not one of them but

3302
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:49,920
there's certainly every reason in the

3303
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:52,000
world to test it out

3304
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:53,118
now so i'm intrigued by the fasting i i

3305
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,279
like you

3306
01:49:53,118 --> 01:49:56,719
um well i assume like you i don't have

3307
01:49:55,279 --> 01:49:58,800
any problem going to one meal a day and

3308
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:00,880
i often do that inadvertently

3309
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:02,480
and i've never done it methodically like

3310
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,800
i've never done it like i'm going to do

3311
01:50:02,479 --> 01:50:06,799
this for 15 days maybe i should

3312
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,400
and maybe i should like how many how

3313
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:11,679
many days in a row of the one day

3314
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:14,000
one meal a day did you find brought

3315
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:15,118
noticeable impact to you was it after

3316
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,279
three days of it was it

3317
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:18,639
months of it like what was it well the

3318
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:20,880
noticeable impact is

3319
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:22,800
day one so for me folk because i i eat a

3320
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:25,359
very low carb diet

3321
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:27,599
so the hunger wasn't the hugest issue

3322
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:30,238
like if there wasn't a painful hunger

3323
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:32,000
egg like wanting to eat yeah so i was

3324
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:34,959
already kind of primed for it

3325
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,639
and uh the the benefit comes from a lot

3326
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:38,960
of people that do intermittent fasting

3327
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:40,639
that's only like 16 hours

3328
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:43,118
of fasting get this benefit too is the

3329
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:46,880
focus there's a clarity of thought

3330
01:50:43,118 --> 01:50:49,118
if my brain was a runner

3331
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:51,679
it felt like i'm running on a track when

3332
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:53,839
i'm fasting versus running in quicksand

3333
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:55,279
like it's much crisper and is this your

3334
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:57,360
first 72 hour faster

3335
01:50:55,279 --> 01:50:58,559
first time during 72 hours yeah and

3336
01:50:57,359 --> 01:51:02,399
that's a different thing

3337
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:03,440
but similar like i'm going up and down

3338
01:51:02,399 --> 01:51:05,519
in terms of

3339
01:51:03,439 --> 01:51:06,479
in terms of hunger and the focus is

3340
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,239
really crisp

3341
01:51:06,479 --> 01:51:09,598
the thing i'm noticing most of all to be

3342
01:51:08,238 --> 01:51:13,279
honest

3343
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:14,480
is um how much eating even when it's

3344
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:17,519
once a day

3345
01:51:14,479 --> 01:51:18,319
or twice a day is part a big part of my

3346
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,840
life

3347
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:21,920
like i almost feel like i have way more

3348
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:24,239
time in my life right

3349
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:26,079
and it's not so much about the eating

3350
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:26,718
but like i don't have to plan my day

3351
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:30,479
around

3352
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:32,880
like today i don't have any eating to do

3353
01:51:30,479 --> 01:51:33,519
it does free up hours or any cleaning up

3354
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:35,840
after eating

3355
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,960
yeah or provisioning of food but like or

3356
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:39,679
even like

3357
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:40,880
thinking about it's not a thing like so

3358
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:41,440
when you think about what you're going

3359
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:44,800
to do

3360
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:46,399
tonight i think i'm realizing that

3361
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,920
as opposed to thinking you know i'm

3362
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:49,039
going to work on this problem or i'm

3363
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:51,920
going to go on this walk

3364
01:51:49,039 --> 01:51:52,319
or i'm going to call this person i often

3365
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:54,960
think

3366
01:51:52,319 --> 01:51:55,519
i'm going to eat this thing you you

3367
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:58,158
allow

3368
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:59,520
dinner as a kind of uh you know when

3369
01:51:58,158 --> 01:52:00,319
people talk about like the weather or

3370
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,080
something like that

3371
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:04,000
it's almost like a generic thought you

3372
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:06,639
allow yourself to have

3373
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,319
because uh because it's the lazy thought

3374
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,079
and i don't have the opportunity to have

3375
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:12,079
that thought because i'm not eating it

3376
01:52:10,079 --> 01:52:13,679
right so now i get to think about like

3377
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:14,880
the things i'm actually gonna do tonight

3378
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:16,639
that are more

3379
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:18,000
complicated than the eating process

3380
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:20,319
that's that's been the most

3381
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,599
noticeable thing and to be honest and

3382
01:52:20,319 --> 01:52:24,399
then there's people that

3383
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:25,039
have written me that have done seven day

3384
01:52:24,399 --> 01:52:26,799
fast

3385
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:28,639
and uh there's a few people that written

3386
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:31,920
me and i've heard of this

3387
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:34,239
is doing uh 30 day fasts and

3388
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:37,039
it's interesting the body i don't know

3389
01:52:34,238 --> 01:52:40,479
what the health benefits are necessarily

3390
01:52:37,039 --> 01:52:41,920
what that shows me is how adaptable the

3391
01:52:40,479 --> 01:52:44,079
human body is

3392
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,960
yeah and and that's incredible and

3393
01:52:44,079 --> 01:52:47,760
that's something

3394
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:49,439
really important to remember when we uh

3395
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:50,560
think about how to live life because the

3396
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:52,319
body adapts

3397
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:53,840
yeah i mean we sure couldn't go 30 days

3398
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:56,319
without water that's right

3399
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:58,239
um but food yeah it's been done it's

3400
01:52:56,319 --> 01:53:00,639
demonstrably possible you ever read

3401
01:52:58,238 --> 01:53:01,919
um franz kafka has a great short story

3402
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:04,960
called the hunger artist

3403
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:06,239
yeah i love that great story

3404
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:08,239
you know that was before i started

3405
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:10,399
fasting i read that story and i i

3406
01:53:08,238 --> 01:53:12,158
admired the beauty of that the artistry

3407
01:53:10,399 --> 01:53:14,719
of that actual hunger artist

3408
01:53:12,158 --> 01:53:16,719
yeah that uh it's like madness but it

3409
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:18,319
also felt like a little bit of genius

3410
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:19,439
i actually have to reread it you know

3411
01:53:18,319 --> 01:53:20,559
what that's what i'm going to do tonight

3412
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:21,759
and i read it

3413
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,960
because i'm doing the fast because

3414
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:24,320
you're in the midst of it yeah it makes

3415
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:25,439
me very contextual i haven't read it

3416
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:27,198
since high school and i'd love to read

3417
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:28,638
it again i love his work so

3418
01:53:27,198 --> 01:53:30,319
we'll read it tonight too and part of

3419
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:32,639
the reason of

3420
01:53:30,319 --> 01:53:33,359
sort of i've uh here in texas people

3421
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:35,760
have been so

3422
01:53:33,359 --> 01:53:36,559
friendly that i've been non-stop eating

3423
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:39,360
like brisket

3424
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,320
with incredible people a lot of whiskey

3425
01:53:39,359 --> 01:53:42,719
as well so

3426
01:53:40,319 --> 01:53:44,319
i gained quite a bit of weight which i'm

3427
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:48,239
embracing it's okay

3428
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:51,359
but i am also aware as i'm fasting

3429
01:53:48,238 --> 01:53:55,598
that like i have a lot of fat for for

3430
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:57,519
to run on like i have a lot of like um

3431
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:59,440
natural resources on my body you've got

3432
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:01,360
reserves reserves

3433
01:53:59,439 --> 01:54:03,279
yeah and that's that's really cool you

3434
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:06,158
know there's like a re this whole

3435
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:07,198
thing this biology works well i can go a

3436
01:54:06,158 --> 01:54:09,279
long time

3437
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:11,039
because of the uh the long-term

3438
01:54:09,279 --> 01:54:12,800
investing in terms of brisket that i've

3439
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:13,439
been doing in the weeks before so it's

3440
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:15,679
all training

3441
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:17,519
it's all true prep work prep work yeah

3442
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:19,039
so okay you open a bunch of doors one of

3443
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:20,800
which is music

3444
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:23,439
so i gotta walk in at least for a brief

3445
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:26,079
moment i love guitar love music

3446
01:54:23,439 --> 01:54:28,319
you founded a music company uh but

3447
01:54:26,079 --> 01:54:29,920
you're also a musician yourself

3448
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:31,599
let me ask the big ridiculous question

3449
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:32,239
first what's the greatest song of all

3450
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:35,440
time

3451
01:54:32,238 --> 01:54:36,079
greatest song of all time okay wow it's

3452
01:54:35,439 --> 01:54:38,638
it's gonna

3453
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:40,079
obviously vary dramatically from genre

3454
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:43,359
to genre so

3455
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:44,238
like you i like guitar uh perhaps like

3456
01:54:43,359 --> 01:54:47,039
you

3457
01:54:44,238 --> 01:54:48,319
although i've dabbled in in inhaling

3458
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:51,439
every genre of music

3459
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:52,399
that i can almost practically imagine i

3460
01:54:51,439 --> 01:54:56,000
keep coming back

3461
01:54:52,399 --> 01:54:57,759
to you know the sound of bass guitar

3462
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
drum keyboards voice

3463
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:01,360
i love that style of music and added to

3464
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,679
it i think

3465
01:55:01,359 --> 01:55:05,279
a lot of really cool electronic

3466
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:08,000
production make something that's

3467
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:08,960
really really new and hybridy and

3468
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,920
awesome

3469
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,319
but you know that kind of like

3470
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:15,440
guitar-based

3471
01:55:12,319 --> 01:55:18,158
rock um i think i've gotta go

3472
01:55:15,439 --> 01:55:18,799
with won't get fooled again by the who

3473
01:55:18,158 --> 01:55:22,319
um

3474
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:23,840
it is such an epic song it's got so much

3475
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:26,399
grandeur to it

3476
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:28,159
it uses the synthesizers that were

3477
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:30,479
available at the time this has got to be

3478
01:55:28,158 --> 01:55:32,000
i think 1972-73 which are very very

3479
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:34,799
primitive to our ears

3480
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,079
but uses them in this hypnotic and

3481
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:38,400
beautiful way

3482
01:55:36,079 --> 01:55:40,319
that i can't imagine somebody with the

3483
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:42,399
greatest synthetic

3484
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:43,439
conceivable by today's technology could

3485
01:55:42,399 --> 01:55:46,638
do a better job of

3486
01:55:43,439 --> 01:55:50,158
in the context of that song and it's

3487
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:53,440
you know almost operatic so i would say

3488
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:56,479
in that genre the genre of you know

3489
01:55:53,439 --> 01:55:57,519
rock um that would be my nomination i'm

3490
01:55:56,479 --> 01:56:01,039
totally

3491
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:02,880
in my brain pinball wizard is overriding

3492
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:04,560
everything else but who's so like i

3493
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:07,039
can't even imagine the song

3494
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:09,760
well i would say ironically with pinball

3495
01:56:07,039 --> 01:56:12,960
wizard so that came from the movie tommy

3496
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:16,000
and in the movie tommy uh the rival

3497
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:17,439
of tommy the reigning pinball champ was

3498
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,439
elton john

3499
01:56:17,439 --> 01:56:21,279
and so there are a couple versions of

3500
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:22,559
pinball wizard out there one sung by

3501
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:24,238
roger daltrey of the who

3502
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:25,599
which a purist would say hey that's the

3503
01:56:24,238 --> 01:56:27,919
real pinball wizard

3504
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:29,360
but the version that is sung by elton

3505
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:30,880
john in the movie

3506
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:32,799
which is available though to those who

3507
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:35,599
are ambitious and want to dig for it

3508
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:36,159
that's even better in my mind yeah the

3509
01:56:35,599 --> 01:56:39,039
covers

3510
01:56:36,158 --> 01:56:39,759
and i for myself i was thinking what is

3511
01:56:39,039 --> 01:56:42,960
the song

3512
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:45,440
for me um

3513
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:47,439
i think uh i think that changes day to

3514
01:56:45,439 --> 01:56:51,759
day too i was realizing that

3515
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:55,519
but for me somebody who values

3516
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:57,119
lyrics as well and the emotion in the

3517
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:59,040
song

3518
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:00,719
by the way hallelujah by uh leonard

3519
01:56:59,039 --> 01:57:01,599
cohen was the close one but the number

3520
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:05,198
one is

3521
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:08,880
the johnny cash's cover of hurt that

3522
01:57:05,198 --> 01:57:11,598
is um there

3523
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:12,400
there's something so powerful about that

3524
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:15,199
song

3525
01:57:12,399 --> 01:57:16,960
about that cover about that performance

3526
01:57:15,198 --> 01:57:18,238
maybe another one is the cover of sound

3527
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:21,039
of silence

3528
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:21,759
uh maybe there's something about covers

3529
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:23,840
for me

3530
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,360
so who's cover sounds because simon and

3531
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:26,239
garfunkel i think did the original

3532
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:28,559
recording yes right

3533
01:57:26,238 --> 01:57:29,919
so which cover is it that there's a

3534
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:33,199
cover by

3535
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:34,960
a disturbed it's a metal band which is

3536
01:57:33,198 --> 01:57:36,319
so interesting because i'm really not

3537
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:39,279
into that kind of metal but

3538
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:40,960
he does a pure vocal performance so he's

3539
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:42,639
he's not doing a metal performance

3540
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:44,079
is i would say is one of the greatest

3541
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:46,960
people should see it

3542
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:48,079
it's like 400 million views or something

3543
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:51,279
like that

3544
01:57:48,079 --> 01:57:53,760
it's a it's probably the greatest live

3545
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:55,679
vocal performance i've ever heard is

3546
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:57,280
disturbed covering sound of silence

3547
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:58,880
and then do it as soon as i get home and

3548
01:57:57,279 --> 01:58:00,639
that song came to life to me in the way

3549
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:01,359
that simon gothanka never did there was

3550
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:02,719
no

3551
01:58:01,359 --> 01:58:05,118
for me it was simon and garfunkel

3552
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:06,719
there's not a there's not a pain there's

3553
01:58:05,118 --> 01:58:10,000
not an anger

3554
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:11,920
there's not uh like um

3555
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,840
power to their performance it's it's

3556
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:15,679
almost like this uh

3557
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:17,520
melancholy i don't know well there's a

3558
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:20,158
lot i guess there's a lot of

3559
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:20,800
beauty to it like yeah objectively

3560
01:58:20,158 --> 01:58:22,960
beautiful

3561
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:25,360
and yes i think i never thought of this

3562
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:28,319
until now but i think if you put

3563
01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:29,759
entirely different lyrics on top of it

3564
01:58:28,319 --> 01:58:30,559
unless they were joyous which would be

3565
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:32,800
weird

3566
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:34,159
um it wouldn't necessarily lose that

3567
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,520
much it's just a beauty in the

3568
01:58:34,158 --> 01:58:37,759
harmonizing

3569
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,040
it's soft and you're right it's not it's

3570
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:40,719
not

3571
01:58:39,039 --> 01:58:42,238
it's not dripping with emotion right the

3572
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:43,279
vocal performance is not dripping with

3573
01:58:42,238 --> 01:58:46,559
emotion it's

3574
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:48,158
dripping with with you know harmonizing

3575
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:50,400
you know technical harmonizing

3576
01:58:48,158 --> 01:58:52,479
brilliance and beauty

3577
01:58:50,399 --> 01:58:53,759
now if you compare that to the disturbed

3578
01:58:52,479 --> 01:58:56,479
cover or the

3579
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:57,840
johnny cash's herd cover when you walk

3580
01:58:56,479 --> 01:59:01,118
away

3581
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:02,560
there's a few it's it's haunting it's uh

3582
01:59:01,118 --> 01:59:03,839
it stays with you for a long time

3583
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,239
there's certain performances that will

3584
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:08,400
just

3585
01:59:04,238 --> 01:59:08,399
stay with you to where

3586
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:14,159
like if you watch people respond to that

3587
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:15,039
and that's certainly how i felt when you

3588
01:59:14,158 --> 01:59:17,198
listen to that

3589
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:18,560
the disturbed performance or giant cash

3590
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:20,479
hurt

3591
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:22,400
there's a response to where you just sit

3592
01:59:20,479 --> 01:59:26,319
there with your mouth open

3593
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:28,719
kind of like paralyzed by it somehow

3594
01:59:26,319 --> 01:59:30,960
and i think that's what makes for a

3595
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:32,800
great song to where you're just like

3596
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:35,359
it's not that you're like singing along

3597
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:37,760
or having fun that that's another

3598
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:38,960
way a song could be great but where

3599
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:42,000
you're just like

3600
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:45,039
what this is you're in awe yeah

3601
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:47,679
if we go to uh listen.com

3602
01:59:45,039 --> 01:59:48,399
and that whole fascinating era of music

3603
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:52,079
yeah in the

3604
01:59:48,399 --> 01:59:54,638
in the 90s transitioning to the arts

3605
01:59:52,079 --> 01:59:56,719
the so i remember those days the napster

3606
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:59,039
days when piracy

3607
01:59:56,719 --> 02:00:00,480
from my perspective allegedly ruled the

3608
01:59:59,039 --> 02:00:03,279
land

3609
02:00:00,479 --> 02:00:04,559
um what do you make of that whole era

3610
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:06,319
what what are the big

3611
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:08,080
what was first of all your experiences

3612
02:00:06,319 --> 02:00:10,719
of that era and uh

3613
02:00:08,079 --> 02:00:12,079
what were the big takeaways in terms of

3614
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:13,840
piracy in terms of what

3615
02:00:12,079 --> 02:00:15,198
what it takes to build a company that

3616
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:17,920
succeeds

3617
02:00:15,198 --> 02:00:19,839
in that kind of in in that kind of

3618
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,399
digital space in terms of music but in

3619
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:23,119
terms of

3620
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:24,559
anything creative well um so for those

3621
02:00:23,118 --> 02:00:26,238
who don't remember which is going to be

3622
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:28,000
most folks

3623
02:00:26,238 --> 02:00:29,839
listen.com created a service called

3624
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,679
rhapsody which is much much more

3625
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,039
recognizable to folks because rhapsody

3626
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:34,239
became a pretty big name for reasons

3627
02:00:33,039 --> 02:00:36,560
i'll get into in a second

3628
02:00:34,238 --> 02:00:38,079
so um for people who aren't you know

3629
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:39,199
don't know their early online music

3630
02:00:38,079 --> 02:00:41,599
history we were

3631
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:42,799
the first company so i founded listen i

3632
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:45,840
was alone founder

3633
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:47,599
and um rhapsody was we were the first

3634
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:48,719
service to get full catalog licenses

3635
02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:51,760
from all the major

3636
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:53,359
music labels uh in order to distribute

3637
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:54,000
their music online and we specifically

3638
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:56,079
did it through

3639
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,920
a mechanism which at the time struck

3640
02:00:56,079 --> 02:00:59,599
people as exotic and bizarre

3641
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:01,599
and kind of incomprehensible which was

3642
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:03,279
unlimited on demand streaming

3643
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:05,760
which of course now you know it's a

3644
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:08,000
model that's been you know appropriated

3645
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:09,520
uh by spotify and apple and many many

3646
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,238
others so we were a pioneer on that

3647
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:12,719
front

3648
02:01:10,238 --> 02:01:14,718
what was really really really hard about

3649
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:17,439
doing business in those days

3650
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:18,719
was the reaction of the music labels to

3651
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:21,439
piracy which was

3652
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:22,719
about 180 degrees opposite of what their

3653
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:24,238
reaction

3654
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:26,399
quote unquote should have been from the

3655
02:01:24,238 --> 02:01:27,598
standpoint of preserving their business

3656
02:01:26,399 --> 02:01:31,118
from piracy

3657
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:34,880
so napster came along and was

3658
02:01:31,118 --> 02:01:37,920
a service that enabled people to get

3659
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:40,480
near unlimited access to

3660
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:42,239
most songs i mean truly obscure things

3661
02:01:40,479 --> 02:01:43,759
could be very hard to find on napster

3662
02:01:42,238 --> 02:01:46,319
but most songs

3663
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:47,280
with a relatively simple you know

3664
02:01:46,319 --> 02:01:49,118
one-click

3665
02:01:47,279 --> 02:01:50,479
uh ability to download those songs that

3666
02:01:49,118 --> 02:01:52,880
have the mp3s

3667
02:01:50,479 --> 02:01:54,479
on on their hard drives but there was a

3668
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:56,400
lot that was very messy

3669
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:57,678
about the napster experience you might

3670
02:01:56,399 --> 02:02:00,719
download a really

3671
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:02,239
god-awful recording of that song you may

3672
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:04,399
download a recording that actually

3673
02:02:02,238 --> 02:02:06,158
wasn't that song with some prankster

3674
02:02:04,399 --> 02:02:08,559
putting it up to sort of mess with

3675
02:02:06,158 --> 02:02:10,158
people you could struggle to find the

3676
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:10,880
song that you're looking for you could

3677
02:02:10,158 --> 02:02:12,638
end up

3678
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:14,159
finding yourself connected with

3679
02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:15,760
peer-to-peer you might

3680
02:02:14,158 --> 02:02:17,920
randomly find yourself connected to

3681
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:19,360
somebody in bulgaria doesn't have a very

3682
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:19,760
good internet connection so you might

3683
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:24,000
wait

3684
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:26,000
19 minutes only for it to snap etc etc

3685
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,319
and our argument to well actually let's

3686
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,880
start with how that hit the music labels

3687
02:02:28,319 --> 02:02:32,000
the music labels had been in a very very

3688
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:35,118
comfortable position for

3689
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:38,238
many many decades of essentially

3690
02:02:35,118 --> 02:02:40,000
you know having monopoly

3691
02:02:38,238 --> 02:02:42,559
you know having been the monopoly

3692
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,439
providers of a certain subset of artists

3693
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:45,119
any given

3694
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:46,479
label was a monopoly provider of the

3695
02:02:45,118 --> 02:02:47,279
artists and the recordings that they

3696
02:02:46,479 --> 02:02:49,439
owned

3697
02:02:47,279 --> 02:02:51,599
and they could sell it at what turned

3698
02:02:49,439 --> 02:02:53,519
out to be tremendously favorable rates

3699
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:55,360
in the late era of the cd

3700
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:57,520
um you know you were talking close to

3701
02:02:55,359 --> 02:02:59,279
twenty dollars for a compact disc

3702
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:01,760
that might have one song that you were

3703
02:02:59,279 --> 02:03:03,920
crazy about and simply needed to own

3704
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:06,000
that might actually be glued to 17 other

3705
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:09,840
songs that you found to be sure crap

3706
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:12,238
and so the music industry had used

3707
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:13,279
the fact that it had this unbelievable

3708
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:16,799
leverage

3709
02:03:13,279 --> 02:03:19,198
and profound pricing power

3710
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:21,440
to really get music lovers to the point

3711
02:03:19,198 --> 02:03:24,638
that they felt very very misused by the

3712
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:27,279
entire situation now along comes napster

3713
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:28,239
and music sales start getting gutted

3714
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:31,359
with extreme

3715
02:03:28,238 --> 02:03:35,039
rapidity and the reaction of the music

3716
02:03:31,359 --> 02:03:37,679
industry to that was one of shock

3717
02:03:35,039 --> 02:03:38,719
and absolute fury which is

3718
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:40,960
understandable

3719
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:42,079
you know i mean industries do get gutted

3720
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:44,000
all the time

3721
02:03:42,079 --> 02:03:45,920
but i struggle to think of an analog of

3722
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,719
an industry that got it got gutted that

3723
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:48,639
rapidly

3724
02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:49,760
i mean we could say that passenger train

3725
02:03:48,639 --> 02:03:52,400
service certainly got

3726
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:54,320
gutted by airlines but that was a

3727
02:03:52,399 --> 02:03:56,078
process that took place over decades and

3728
02:03:54,319 --> 02:03:57,118
decades and decades it wasn't something

3729
02:03:56,078 --> 02:03:58,799
that happened

3730
02:03:57,118 --> 02:04:00,479
you know really started showing up in

3731
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:01,119
the numbers in a single digit number of

3732
02:04:00,479 --> 02:04:02,959
months

3733
02:04:01,118 --> 02:04:05,118
and started looking like an existential

3734
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:07,599
threat within a year or two

3735
02:04:05,118 --> 02:04:08,559
so the music industry is quite

3736
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:10,400
understandably

3737
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:11,920
in a state of shock and fury i don't

3738
02:04:10,399 --> 02:04:15,198
blame them for that

3739
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:17,840
but then their reaction was catastrophic

3740
02:04:15,198 --> 02:04:18,719
both for themselves and almost for

3741
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:21,440
people like us

3742
02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:23,198
who were trying to do you know the

3743
02:04:21,439 --> 02:04:25,198
cowboy and the white hat thing

3744
02:04:23,198 --> 02:04:26,399
so our response to the music industry

3745
02:04:25,198 --> 02:04:28,638
was look

3746
02:04:26,399 --> 02:04:30,238
what you need to do to fight piracy you

3747
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:30,960
can't put the genie back in the bottle

3748
02:04:30,238 --> 02:04:33,359
you can't

3749
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:34,560
switch off the internet even if you all

3750
02:04:33,359 --> 02:04:37,039
shut your eyes and wish

3751
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:38,159
very very very hard the internet is not

3752
02:04:37,039 --> 02:04:39,920
going away

3753
02:04:38,158 --> 02:04:41,679
and these peer-to-peer technologies are

3754
02:04:39,920 --> 02:04:43,920
genies out of the bottle and if you

3755
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:46,800
god don't whatever you do don't shut

3756
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:48,560
down napster because if you do

3757
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:50,400
suddenly that technology is going to

3758
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:52,159
splinter into 30 different nodes that

3759
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:54,479
you'll never ever be able to shut off

3760
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:57,198
what we suggested to them is like look

3761
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:58,718
what you want to do is to create a

3762
02:04:57,198 --> 02:05:01,519
massively

3763
02:04:58,719 --> 02:05:03,118
better experience to piracy something

3764
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:04,960
that's way better that you sell at a

3765
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:07,198
completely reasonable price

3766
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:09,198
and this is what it is don't just give

3767
02:05:07,198 --> 02:05:10,799
people access to that very limited

3768
02:05:09,198 --> 02:05:11,678
number of songs that they happen to have

3769
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:14,560
acquired

3770
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:15,840
and paid for or pirated and have on

3771
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:18,079
their hard drive

3772
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:19,679
give them access to all of the music in

3773
02:05:18,078 --> 02:05:21,039
the world for a simple low price and

3774
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:22,639
obviously that doesn't sound like a

3775
02:05:21,039 --> 02:05:24,000
crazy suggestion i don't think to

3776
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:25,359
anybody's ears today

3777
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,039
because that is how the majority of

3778
02:05:25,359 --> 02:05:28,399
music is now being consumed online but

3779
02:05:27,039 --> 02:05:30,560
in doing that

3780
02:05:28,399 --> 02:05:31,839
you're going to create a much much

3781
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:34,159
better option

3782
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:35,920
to this kind of crappy kind of rickety

3783
02:05:34,158 --> 02:05:38,238
kind of you know buggy

3784
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:40,560
process of acquiring mp3s now

3785
02:05:38,238 --> 02:05:43,759
unfortunately the music industry was so

3786
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:44,159
angry about napster and so forth that

3787
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:46,320
for

3788
02:05:44,158 --> 02:05:48,238
essentially three and a half years they

3789
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:50,158
folded their arms stamped their feet

3790
02:05:48,238 --> 02:05:52,000
and boycotted the internet so they

3791
02:05:50,158 --> 02:05:53,920
basically gave people who

3792
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:55,599
were fervently passionate about music

3793
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:57,679
and were digitally modern

3794
02:05:55,599 --> 02:05:59,440
they gave them basically one choice if

3795
02:05:57,679 --> 02:06:01,440
you want to have access to digital music

3796
02:05:59,439 --> 02:06:03,198
we the music industry insists that you

3797
02:06:01,439 --> 02:06:04,238
steal it because we are not going to

3798
02:06:03,198 --> 02:06:05,919
sell it to you

3799
02:06:04,238 --> 02:06:08,158
yeah so what that did is it made an

3800
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:10,480
entire generation of people

3801
02:06:08,158 --> 02:06:11,759
morally comfortable with swiping the

3802
02:06:10,479 --> 02:06:13,279
music because they felt quite

3803
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:15,039
pragmatically well they're not giving me

3804
02:06:13,279 --> 02:06:18,078
any choice here it's like a

3805
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:18,880
you know 20 year old violating the 21

3806
02:06:18,078 --> 02:06:20,399
drinking age

3807
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,920
they do that they're not going to feel

3808
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:23,039
like felons

3809
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:24,719
they're going to be like this is an

3810
02:06:23,039 --> 02:06:25,118
unreasonable law and i'm skirting it

3811
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:27,118
right

3812
02:06:25,118 --> 02:06:28,559
so i make a whole generation of people

3813
02:06:27,118 --> 02:06:31,118
morally comfortable

3814
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:32,239
with swiping music but also technically

3815
02:06:31,118 --> 02:06:34,078
adept at it

3816
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:36,319
and when they did shut down napster and

3817
02:06:34,078 --> 02:06:38,158
kind of even trickier tools and like

3818
02:06:36,319 --> 02:06:39,359
tweakier tools like kazaa and so forth

3819
02:06:38,158 --> 02:06:41,759
came along

3820
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:42,839
people just figured out how to do it so

3821
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:46,320
by the time they

3822
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:48,719
finally grudgingly it took years

3823
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:50,158
allowed us to release this experience

3824
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:51,760
that we were quite convinced would be

3825
02:06:50,158 --> 02:06:54,879
better than piracy

3826
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:57,280
we had this enormous hole had been dug

3827
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:58,639
where lots of people said music is a

3828
02:06:57,279 --> 02:07:00,800
thing that is free

3829
02:06:58,639 --> 02:07:01,760
and that's morally okay and i know how

3830
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:04,560
to get it

3831
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:05,599
and so streaming took many many many

3832
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,920
more years

3833
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:09,920
to take off and become the you know the

3834
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:10,880
gargantuan thing the juggernaut it is

3835
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:12,639
today

3836
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:14,560
then would have happened if they'd made

3837
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:16,239
you know pivoted to

3838
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:17,760
let's sell a better experience as

3839
02:07:16,238 --> 02:07:18,879
opposed to demand that people want

3840
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:21,119
digital music

3841
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:21,920
steal it like what lessons do we draw

3842
02:07:21,118 --> 02:07:23,839
from that because

3843
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,279
we're probably in the midst of living

3844
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:27,119
through a bunch of

3845
02:07:25,279 --> 02:07:28,399
similar situations in different domains

3846
02:07:27,118 --> 02:07:29,679
currently we just don't know there's a

3847
02:07:28,399 --> 02:07:31,279
lot of things in this world that are

3848
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:33,440
really painful

3849
02:07:31,279 --> 02:07:35,118
like uh i mean i don't know if you can

3850
02:07:33,439 --> 02:07:37,519
draw perfect parallels but

3851
02:07:35,118 --> 02:07:39,279
fiat money versus cryptocurrency there's

3852
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:40,800
a lot of currently

3853
02:07:39,279 --> 02:07:42,399
people in power who are kind of very

3854
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:44,159
skeptical about cryptocurrency

3855
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:45,920
although that's changing but it's

3856
02:07:44,158 --> 02:07:47,039
arguable it's changing way too slowly

3857
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:47,599
there's a lot of people making that

3858
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:49,198
argument

3859
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:50,880
where there should be a complete like

3860
02:07:49,198 --> 02:07:53,519
coinbase and all this stuff

3861
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:54,239
switched to that there's a lot of other

3862
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:57,360
domains

3863
02:07:54,238 --> 02:08:00,559
that where a pivot

3864
02:07:57,359 --> 02:08:01,359
like if you pivot now you're going to

3865
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:04,079
win

3866
02:08:01,359 --> 02:08:05,359
big but you don't pivot because you're

3867
02:08:04,078 --> 02:08:07,759
stubborn

3868
02:08:05,359 --> 02:08:09,439
and so i mean it's like is this just the

3869
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:12,239
way that companies are

3870
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:13,519
the company succeeds initially and then

3871
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:15,198
it grows

3872
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:16,639
and there's a huge number of employees

3873
02:08:15,198 --> 02:08:18,719
and managers

3874
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:20,078
that don't have the guts or the

3875
02:08:18,719 --> 02:08:21,920
institutional

3876
02:08:20,078 --> 02:08:23,519
mechanisms to do the pivot is that's

3877
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:25,199
just the way of companies

3878
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:27,119
well i think what happens i'll use the

3879
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:29,678
case of the music industry

3880
02:08:27,118 --> 02:08:31,519
there was an economic model that had put

3881
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:33,199
food on the table and paid for

3882
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:34,960
marble lobbies and seven and even

3883
02:08:33,198 --> 02:08:36,000
eight-figure executive salaries for many

3884
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:38,719
many decades

3885
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,439
which was the physical collection of

3886
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:40,719
music

3887
02:08:39,439 --> 02:08:42,879
and then you start talking about

3888
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:46,158
something like unlimited streaming

3889
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:47,679
and it it seems so ephemeral one like

3890
02:08:46,158 --> 02:08:48,960
such a long shot

3891
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:51,118
that people start worrying about

3892
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:52,800
cannibalizing their own business

3893
02:08:51,118 --> 02:08:54,639
and they lose sight of the fact that

3894
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:56,480
something illicit is cannibalizing

3895
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:57,840
their business at an extraordinarily

3896
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:58,799
fast rate and so if they don't do it

3897
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:00,239
themselves

3898
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:02,000
they're doomed i mean we used to put

3899
02:09:00,238 --> 02:09:03,198
slides in front of these folks this is

3900
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:06,078
really funny

3901
02:09:03,198 --> 02:09:08,399
where we said okay let's assume rhapsody

3902
02:09:06,078 --> 02:09:10,559
we want it to be 9.99 a month

3903
02:09:08,399 --> 02:09:11,679
and we want it to be 12 months so it's

3904
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:14,800
120

3905
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:16,319
a year from the budget of a music lover

3906
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:18,079
and then we were also able to get

3907
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:20,479
reasonably accurate statistics that

3908
02:09:18,078 --> 02:09:22,078
showed how many cds per year

3909
02:09:20,479 --> 02:09:24,078
the average person who bothered to

3910
02:09:22,078 --> 02:09:25,759
collect music which was not all people

3911
02:09:24,078 --> 02:09:28,078
actually bought and it was

3912
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:29,280
overwhelmingly clear that the average cd

3913
02:09:28,078 --> 02:09:31,679
plot buyer

3914
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:32,960
spends a hell of a lot less than 120 a

3915
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:35,039
year on music

3916
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:36,078
this is a revenue expansion blah blah

3917
02:09:35,039 --> 02:09:37,599
blah but all

3918
02:09:36,078 --> 02:09:39,359
they could think of and i'm not saying

3919
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:41,440
this in a pejorative or

3920
02:09:39,359 --> 02:09:43,039
or patronizing way i don't blame them

3921
02:09:41,439 --> 02:09:43,759
they'd grown up in this environment for

3922
02:09:43,039 --> 02:09:45,039
decades

3923
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:46,800
all they could think of was the

3924
02:09:45,039 --> 02:09:50,158
incredible margins that they had on

3925
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:53,279
a cd and they would say well if

3926
02:09:50,158 --> 02:09:54,638
this cd you know by the mechanism that

3927
02:09:53,279 --> 02:09:56,920
you guys are proposing

3928
02:09:54,639 --> 02:09:58,880
you know the cd that i'm selling for

3929
02:09:56,920 --> 02:10:00,719
17.99

3930
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:02,078
somebody would need to stream those

3931
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:03,599
songs we were talking about a penny a

3932
02:10:02,078 --> 02:10:05,439
play back then it's less than that now

3933
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:07,279
that the record labels get paid

3934
02:10:05,439 --> 02:10:09,839
but you know would have to stream songs

3935
02:10:07,279 --> 02:10:10,479
from that 1799 times it's never going to

3936
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:11,840
happen

3937
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:13,519
so they were just sort of stuck in the

3938
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:14,800
model of this but it's like no dude but

3939
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:15,679
they're going to spend money on all this

3940
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:17,119
other stuff so

3941
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:19,199
i think people get very hung up on that

3942
02:10:17,118 --> 02:10:21,439
i mean another example is really

3943
02:10:19,198 --> 02:10:23,039
the taxi industry was not monolithic

3944
02:10:21,439 --> 02:10:24,479
like that like the music labels

3945
02:10:23,039 --> 02:10:25,679
it was a whole bunch of fleets and a

3946
02:10:24,479 --> 02:10:27,359
whole bunch of cities very very

3947
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:28,399
fragmented it's an imperfect analogy but

3948
02:10:27,359 --> 02:10:30,799
nonetheless

3949
02:10:28,399 --> 02:10:32,000
imagine if the taxi industry writ large

3950
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:35,360
upon seeing uber

3951
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,319
said oh my god people want to be able to

3952
02:10:35,359 --> 02:10:38,639
hail things

3953
02:10:36,319 --> 02:10:40,238
easily cheaply they don't want to mess

3954
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:41,520
with cash they want to know how many

3955
02:10:40,238 --> 02:10:44,000
minutes it's going to be they want to

3956
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:46,560
know the fair in advance and they want a

3957
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:48,319
much bigger fleet than what we've got if

3958
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:51,039
the taxi industry had

3959
02:10:48,319 --> 02:10:52,799
rolled out something like that with the

3960
02:10:51,039 --> 02:10:55,760
branding of yellow taxis

3961
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:56,639
universally known and kind of loved by

3962
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:58,400
americans

3963
02:10:56,639 --> 02:10:59,840
and expanded their fleet in a necessary

3964
02:10:58,399 --> 02:11:01,439
manner i don't think uber lyft ever

3965
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:04,480
would have gotten a foothold yeah

3966
02:11:01,439 --> 02:11:06,799
um but the problem there was that real

3967
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:08,959
economics in the taxi industry

3968
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:10,719
wasn't with fairs it was with the

3969
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:12,880
scarcity of medallions

3970
02:11:10,719 --> 02:11:14,158
and so the taxi fleets in many cases

3971
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:17,118
owned gazillions of

3972
02:11:14,158 --> 02:11:18,559
medallions whose value came from their

3973
02:11:17,118 --> 02:11:21,279
very scarcity

3974
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:23,119
so they simply couldn't pivot to that so

3975
02:11:21,279 --> 02:11:24,078
you think you end up having these vested

3976
02:11:23,118 --> 02:11:25,839
interests with

3977
02:11:24,078 --> 02:11:27,759
economics that aren't necessarily

3978
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:30,719
visible to outsiders

3979
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:32,320
who get very very reluctant to disrupt

3980
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:34,719
their own model which is why it ends up

3981
02:11:32,319 --> 02:11:36,238
coming from the outside so frequently

3982
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:38,000
so you know what it takes to build a

3983
02:11:36,238 --> 02:11:41,198
successful startup but you're also an

3984
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:45,279
investor in a lot of successful startups

3985
02:11:41,198 --> 02:11:47,279
let me ask for advice what do you think

3986
02:11:45,279 --> 02:11:48,800
it takes to build a successful startup

3987
02:11:47,279 --> 02:11:51,679
by way of advice

3988
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:52,079
well i think it starts i mean everything

3989
02:11:51,679 --> 02:11:54,960
starts

3990
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:56,639
and even ends with the founder and so i

3991
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:58,078
think it's really really important to

3992
02:11:56,639 --> 02:12:00,560
look at the founders

3993
02:11:58,078 --> 02:12:02,078
motivations and their sophistication

3994
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:05,520
about what they're doing

3995
02:12:02,078 --> 02:12:07,359
um in almost all cases that i'm familiar

3996
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:10,880
with and have thought hard about

3997
02:12:07,359 --> 02:12:12,399
you've had a founder who was deeply

3998
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:15,118
deeply inculcated

3999
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:16,479
in the domain of technology that they

4000
02:12:15,118 --> 02:12:18,399
were taking on

4001
02:12:16,479 --> 02:12:19,759
now what's interesting about that is you

4002
02:12:18,399 --> 02:12:21,198
could say you know wait how is that

4003
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:23,440
possible because there's so many young

4004
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:25,359
founders when you look at young founders

4005
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:27,678
they're generally coming out of very

4006
02:12:25,359 --> 02:12:30,399
nascent emerging fields of technology

4007
02:12:27,679 --> 02:12:32,239
we're simply being present and accounted

4008
02:12:30,399 --> 02:12:34,000
for and engaged in the community for a

4009
02:12:32,238 --> 02:12:35,839
period of even months

4010
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,439
is enough time to make them very very

4011
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:38,719
deeply inculcated i mean you look at

4012
02:12:37,439 --> 02:12:41,759
mark andreessen

4013
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:42,800
and netscape um you know mark had been

4014
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:44,320
doing visual

4015
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:45,920
web browsers when netscape had been

4016
02:12:44,319 --> 02:12:47,679
founded for what a year and a half but

4017
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:50,399
he created the first one

4018
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:51,440
you know and in mosaic when he was an

4019
02:12:50,399 --> 02:12:54,638
undergrad

4020
02:12:51,439 --> 02:12:57,359
and the commercial internet was

4021
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:58,400
pre-nascent in 1994 when that escape was

4022
02:12:57,359 --> 02:13:00,000
was founded

4023
02:12:58,399 --> 02:13:01,679
so there's somebody who's very very deep

4024
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,198
in their domain mark zuckerberg also

4025
02:13:01,679 --> 02:13:04,399
social networking very deep in his

4026
02:13:03,198 --> 02:13:06,719
domain even though it was

4027
02:13:04,399 --> 02:13:08,719
nascent at the time lots of people doing

4028
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:10,800
crypto stuff i mean you know in the

4029
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:11,920
you know ten years ago even seven or

4030
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:15,039
eight years ago

4031
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:17,118
by being a really really vehement and

4032
02:13:15,039 --> 02:13:19,760
engaged participant in the crypto

4033
02:13:17,118 --> 02:13:20,319
ecosystem you could be an expert in that

4034
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:22,639
you look

4035
02:13:20,319 --> 02:13:24,880
however more established industries take

4036
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:26,639
salesforce.com salesforce automation

4037
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:28,560
pretty mature field when it got started

4038
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:30,800
who's the executive and the founder

4039
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:32,960
um mark benioff who spent 13 years at

4040
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:34,079
oracle and was an investor in siebel

4041
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:35,520
systems which

4042
02:13:34,078 --> 02:13:38,399
ended up being salesforce's main

4043
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:41,760
competition so you know more established

4044
02:13:38,399 --> 02:13:43,839
you need the entrepreneur to be very

4045
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:45,920
very deep in the technology and the

4046
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:47,840
culture and the winter

4047
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:49,679
of the space because you need that

4048
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:52,719
entrepreneur that founder

4049
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:54,480
to have just an unbelievably accurate

4050
02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:56,639
intuitive sense

4051
02:13:54,479 --> 02:13:58,000
for where the puck is going right and

4052
02:13:56,639 --> 02:14:00,239
that only comes

4053
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,479
from being very deep so that is sort of

4054
02:14:00,238 --> 02:14:04,638
factor number one and the next thing is

4055
02:14:02,479 --> 02:14:05,759
that that founder needs to be

4056
02:14:04,639 --> 02:14:08,880
charismatic

4057
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:11,360
and or credible or ideally both

4058
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:12,078
in exactly the right ways to be able to

4059
02:14:11,359 --> 02:14:14,799
attract

4060
02:14:12,078 --> 02:14:16,399
a team that is bought into that vision

4061
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:18,000
and is bought into that founders

4062
02:14:16,399 --> 02:14:20,238
intuitions being correct

4063
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,439
and not just the team obviously but also

4064
02:14:20,238 --> 02:14:24,078
the investors

4065
02:14:21,439 --> 02:14:25,598
so it takes a certain personality type

4066
02:14:24,078 --> 02:14:27,279
to pull that off

4067
02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:28,960
then the next thing i'm still talking

4068
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:33,118
about a founder is

4069
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:36,639
a relentlessness and indeed a mono mania

4070
02:14:33,118 --> 02:14:39,118
to put this above things that

4071
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:41,118
might rationally you know should perhaps

4072
02:14:39,118 --> 02:14:42,078
rationally supersede it for a period of

4073
02:14:41,118 --> 02:14:45,839
time

4074
02:14:42,078 --> 02:14:47,519
um to just relentlessly pivot when

4075
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:48,480
pivoting's called for and it's always

4076
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:50,719
called for i mean

4077
02:14:48,479 --> 02:14:52,399
think of even very successful companies

4078
02:14:50,719 --> 02:14:54,719
like how many times did

4079
02:14:52,399 --> 02:14:56,399
facebook pivot you know news feed was

4080
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:57,599
something that was completely alien to

4081
02:14:56,399 --> 02:14:58,960
the original version

4082
02:14:57,599 --> 02:15:00,560
of facebook and came found

4083
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:01,599
foundationally important how many times

4084
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:03,199
at google how many

4085
02:15:01,599 --> 02:15:05,199
times had any given how many times has

4086
02:15:03,198 --> 02:15:07,439
apple pivoted you know that

4087
02:15:05,198 --> 02:15:09,279
founder energy in dna when the foundry

4088
02:15:07,439 --> 02:15:10,719
moves on the dna that's been inculcated

4089
02:15:09,279 --> 02:15:12,880
with a company

4090
02:15:10,719 --> 02:15:15,279
has to have that relentlessness and that

4091
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:15,760
ability to pivot and pivot and pivot

4092
02:15:15,279 --> 02:15:18,158
without

4093
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:19,520
you know being worried about sacred cows

4094
02:15:18,158 --> 02:15:20,960
and then the last thing i'll say about

4095
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:22,000
the founder before i get to the rest of

4096
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:24,480
the team and

4097
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,760
that'll be mercifully brief is the

4098
02:15:24,479 --> 02:15:29,439
founder

4099
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:32,880
has to be obviously a really great hirer

4100
02:15:29,439 --> 02:15:36,000
but just important a very good fire

4101
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:38,400
and firing is a horrific experience

4102
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,719
for both people involved in it it is a

4103
02:15:38,399 --> 02:15:44,719
wrenching emotional experience

4104
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:47,840
and being good at realizing when

4105
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:49,118
this particular person is damaging the

4106
02:15:47,840 --> 02:15:52,000
interests of the company

4107
02:15:49,118 --> 02:15:52,719
and the team and the shareholders and

4108
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:55,760
you know

4109
02:15:52,719 --> 02:15:58,078
having the intestinal fortitude to have

4110
02:15:55,760 --> 02:16:00,800
that conversation and make it happen

4111
02:15:58,078 --> 02:16:01,679
is something that most people don't have

4112
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:03,440
in them

4113
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:05,440
and it's something that needs to be

4114
02:16:03,439 --> 02:16:07,359
developed in most people

4115
02:16:05,439 --> 02:16:09,198
um or maybe some people have it

4116
02:16:07,359 --> 02:16:11,839
naturally but without

4117
02:16:09,198 --> 02:16:14,000
that ability that will take an a plus

4118
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:15,279
organization into b minus range very

4119
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:17,840
very quickly

4120
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:19,198
and um so that's all what needs to be

4121
02:16:17,840 --> 02:16:22,319
present in the founder

4122
02:16:19,198 --> 02:16:23,839
can you just say sure how damn good you

4123
02:16:22,319 --> 02:16:25,519
are rob that was brilliant

4124
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:27,840
the the one thing that was kind of

4125
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:31,040
really kind of surprising to me

4126
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:34,239
is um having a deep technical knowledge

4127
02:16:31,039 --> 02:16:35,359
because um i think the way you expressed

4128
02:16:34,239 --> 02:16:38,079
it which is

4129
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:39,439
that allows you to be really honest with

4130
02:16:38,079 --> 02:16:42,718
the capabilities of

4131
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:46,000
what like what's possible

4132
02:16:42,718 --> 02:16:49,119
like of course you're

4133
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,478
often trying to do the impossible but in

4134
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:50,719
order to do the impossible you have to

4135
02:16:50,478 --> 02:16:52,318
be

4136
02:16:50,718 --> 02:16:54,638
quote unquote impossible but you have to

4137
02:16:52,318 --> 02:16:56,478
be honest with what is actually possible

4138
02:16:54,638 --> 02:16:58,398
and it doesn't necessarily have to be

4139
02:16:56,478 --> 02:16:59,519
the technical competence it's got to be

4140
02:16:58,398 --> 02:17:01,840
in my view

4141
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:03,439
just a complete immersion in that

4142
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:04,960
emerging market and so i

4143
02:17:03,439 --> 02:17:06,239
can imagine there are a couple people

4144
02:17:04,959 --> 02:17:07,039
out there who have started really good

4145
02:17:06,239 --> 02:17:09,840
crypto

4146
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:10,639
projects who themselves aren't right in

4147
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:12,880
the code

4148
02:17:10,638 --> 02:17:14,638
but they're immersed in the culture and

4149
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:16,000
through the culture and a deep

4150
02:17:14,638 --> 02:17:17,598
understanding of what's happening and

4151
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,718
what's not happening they can get a good

4152
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:20,719
intuition

4153
02:17:18,718 --> 02:17:22,398
of what's possible but the very first

4154
02:17:20,718 --> 02:17:24,079
power higher

4155
02:17:22,398 --> 02:17:26,000
i mean a good great way to solve that is

4156
02:17:24,079 --> 02:17:28,079
to have a technical co-founder

4157
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:29,040
and you know dual founder companies have

4158
02:17:28,079 --> 02:17:31,359
become extremely

4159
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:32,800
common for that reason uh and if you're

4160
02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:34,559
not doing that and you're

4161
02:17:32,799 --> 02:17:35,920
not the technical person but you are the

4162
02:17:34,558 --> 02:17:38,638
founder

4163
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:39,439
you've got to be really great at hiring

4164
02:17:38,638 --> 02:17:42,799
a

4165
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:43,840
very damn good technical person very

4166
02:17:42,799 --> 02:17:46,239
very fast

4167
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:47,359
can i can i on the founder ask you is it

4168
02:17:46,239 --> 02:17:51,199
possible

4169
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:52,880
to do this alone there's so many people

4170
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:54,960
giving advice on saying that it's

4171
02:17:52,879 --> 02:17:56,799
impossible to do the first few steps not

4172
02:17:54,959 --> 02:17:58,318
impossible but much more difficult to do

4173
02:17:56,799 --> 02:18:00,239
it alone

4174
02:17:58,318 --> 02:18:01,679
if we were to take the journey saying

4175
02:18:00,239 --> 02:18:02,318
especially in the software world where

4176
02:18:01,679 --> 02:18:04,638
there's not

4177
02:18:02,318 --> 02:18:05,599
significant investment required for to

4178
02:18:04,638 --> 02:18:09,199
build something up

4179
02:18:05,599 --> 02:18:10,799
yeah is it possible to go to the uh

4180
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:12,719
to a prototype to something that

4181
02:18:10,799 --> 02:18:13,920
essentially works and already has a huge

4182
02:18:12,718 --> 02:18:17,119
number of customers

4183
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:17,679
alone sure um there are lots and lots of

4184
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:19,280
low f

4185
02:18:17,679 --> 02:18:20,879
loan founder companies out there that

4186
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:23,920
have made an incredible difference

4187
02:18:20,879 --> 02:18:25,920
um i mean i'm not certainly putting

4188
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:27,840
rhapsody in the league of spotify we

4189
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:28,079
were too early to be spotify but we did

4190
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:30,159
an

4191
02:18:28,079 --> 02:18:31,599
awful lot of innovation and then after

4192
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:32,799
the company sold and ended up in the

4193
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:35,519
hands of real networks and

4194
02:18:32,799 --> 02:18:37,039
mtv you know got to millions of subs

4195
02:18:35,519 --> 02:18:39,439
right i was a lone founder

4196
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:40,639
and i studied arabic and middle eastern

4197
02:18:39,439 --> 02:18:42,639
history undergrad

4198
02:18:40,638 --> 02:18:44,879
so i def wasn't very very technical but

4199
02:18:42,638 --> 02:18:47,039
yeah loan founders can absolutely work

4200
02:18:44,879 --> 02:18:50,239
and the advantage of a loan founder

4201
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:51,200
is you don't have the catastrophic

4202
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:53,599
potential

4203
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:54,960
of a falling out between founders i mean

4204
02:18:53,599 --> 02:18:57,599
two founders

4205
02:18:54,959 --> 02:18:59,598
who fall out with each other badly can

4206
02:18:57,599 --> 02:19:02,079
rip a company to shreds

4207
02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:04,000
because they both have an enormous

4208
02:19:02,079 --> 02:19:05,519
amount of equity an enormous amount of

4209
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,638
power and the capital structure is a

4210
02:19:05,519 --> 02:19:08,960
result of that

4211
02:19:06,638 --> 02:19:10,318
they both have an enormous amount of

4212
02:19:08,959 --> 02:19:12,718
moral authority

4213
02:19:10,318 --> 02:19:14,318
with the team as a result of each having

4214
02:19:12,718 --> 02:19:17,759
that founder role

4215
02:19:14,318 --> 02:19:20,000
and i have witnessed over the years

4216
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:21,280
many many situations in which companies

4217
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,638
have been shredded

4218
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:26,960
or have suffered near fatal blows

4219
02:19:24,638 --> 02:19:29,039
because of a falling out between

4220
02:19:26,959 --> 02:19:31,678
founders and the more founders you add

4221
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:32,960
the more risky that becomes i i i don't

4222
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:35,280
think there should ever

4223
02:19:32,959 --> 02:19:37,518
almost i mean you never say never but

4224
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:40,880
multiple founders beyond two

4225
02:19:37,519 --> 02:19:42,639
um is such an unstable and potentially

4226
02:19:40,879 --> 02:19:45,358
treacherous situation

4227
02:19:42,638 --> 02:19:46,799
that i would never ever recommend going

4228
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:49,359
beyond two but i do see

4229
02:19:46,799 --> 02:19:50,639
value in the non-technical sort of

4230
02:19:49,359 --> 02:19:53,120
business and market and

4231
02:19:50,639 --> 02:19:54,559
outside-minded founder teaming up with

4232
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:56,479
the technical founder

4233
02:19:54,559 --> 02:19:58,159
um there is a lot of merit to that but

4234
02:19:56,478 --> 02:19:59,279
there's a lot of danger in that unless

4235
02:19:58,159 --> 02:20:01,840
those two blow apart

4236
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:02,880
was it lonely for you unbelievably and

4237
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:06,159
that's the drawback

4238
02:20:02,879 --> 02:20:09,599
i mean if you're a lone founder um

4239
02:20:06,159 --> 02:20:10,559
there is no other person that you can

4240
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:12,318
sit down with

4241
02:20:10,559 --> 02:20:14,318
and tackle problems and talk them

4242
02:20:12,318 --> 02:20:16,318
through who has precisely

4243
02:20:14,318 --> 02:20:17,519
or nearly precisely your alignment of

4244
02:20:16,318 --> 02:20:20,959
interests

4245
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:22,000
your most trusted board member is likely

4246
02:20:20,959 --> 02:20:23,839
an investor

4247
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:25,600
and therefore at the end of the day has

4248
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:26,960
the interest of preferred stock in mind

4249
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:30,239
not common stock

4250
02:20:26,959 --> 02:20:32,478
your most trusted vp

4251
02:20:30,239 --> 02:20:33,600
who might own a very significant stake

4252
02:20:32,478 --> 02:20:35,358
in the company

4253
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:37,200
doesn't own anywhere near your stake in

4254
02:20:35,359 --> 02:20:38,000
the company and so their long-term

4255
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:40,159
interest

4256
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:42,159
may well be in getting the right level

4257
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:44,239
of experience and credibility necessary

4258
02:20:42,159 --> 02:20:46,398
to peel off and start their own company

4259
02:20:44,239 --> 02:20:47,520
or their interests might be aligned with

4260
02:20:46,398 --> 02:20:49,439
you know

4261
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:50,560
jumping ship and and setting up with

4262
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:52,318
another with a

4263
02:20:50,559 --> 02:20:53,760
with a different company whether it's a

4264
02:20:52,318 --> 02:20:54,478
rival or one in a completely different

4265
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:56,398
space

4266
02:20:54,478 --> 02:20:58,239
so yeah being a loan founder is a

4267
02:20:56,398 --> 02:20:59,680
spectacularly lonely thing and that's a

4268
02:20:58,239 --> 02:21:01,199
major downside to what what about

4269
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:03,439
mentorship because you're a mentor to a

4270
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:06,159
lot of people

4271
02:21:03,439 --> 02:21:08,000
can you find an alleviation to that

4272
02:21:06,159 --> 02:21:10,079
loneliness in the space of ideas

4273
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:11,600
with a good mentor with a good mentor

4274
02:21:10,079 --> 02:21:13,600
like a mentor who's mentoring you

4275
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:15,040
yeah yeah you can a great deal

4276
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:16,318
particularly if it's somebody who's been

4277
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:18,319
through this very process and has

4278
02:21:16,318 --> 02:21:20,398
navigated it successfully

4279
02:21:18,318 --> 02:21:21,920
and cares enough about you and your

4280
02:21:20,398 --> 02:21:24,079
well-being being

4281
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:26,159
to give you you know beautifully

4282
02:21:24,079 --> 02:21:27,760
unvarnished advice that can be a huge

4283
02:21:26,159 --> 02:21:30,159
huge thing that can disraise things a

4284
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:33,359
great deal and i had a board member

4285
02:21:30,159 --> 02:21:35,359
who who was not an investor who

4286
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:37,120
basically played that role for me to a

4287
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:38,399
great degree he came in

4288
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:40,160
maybe halfway through the company's

4289
02:21:38,398 --> 02:21:43,439
history though i would have needed that

4290
02:21:40,159 --> 02:21:46,478
the most in the very earliest days

4291
02:21:43,439 --> 02:21:48,079
yeah the loneliness um

4292
02:21:46,478 --> 02:21:51,358
it's the whole journey of life we're

4293
02:21:48,079 --> 02:21:54,959
always alone alone together

4294
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:56,479
it pays to embrace that you were saying

4295
02:21:54,959 --> 02:21:58,398
that there might be something outside of

4296
02:21:56,478 --> 02:22:00,559
the founder that's also

4297
02:21:58,398 --> 02:22:01,680
that you were promising to be brief on

4298
02:22:00,559 --> 02:22:03,039
yeah okay so

4299
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:04,880
we talked about the founder you were

4300
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:07,040
asking what makes a great startup yes

4301
02:22:04,879 --> 02:22:08,559
and great founder is thing number one

4302
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:10,479
but then thing number two and it's

4303
02:22:08,559 --> 02:22:12,719
ginormous is a great team

4304
02:22:10,478 --> 02:22:14,239
and so i said so much about the founder

4305
02:22:12,719 --> 02:22:16,559
because

4306
02:22:14,239 --> 02:22:18,159
one hopes or one believes that a founder

4307
02:22:16,559 --> 02:22:20,559
who is a great hirer

4308
02:22:18,159 --> 02:22:22,079
is going to be hiring people and in

4309
02:22:20,559 --> 02:22:23,760
charge of critical functions like

4310
02:22:22,079 --> 02:22:25,600
engineering and marketing and biz dev

4311
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:26,800
and sales and so forth who themselves

4312
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:28,800
are great hirers

4313
02:22:26,799 --> 02:22:30,159
but what needs to radiate from the

4314
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:31,519
founder into the team that might be a

4315
02:22:30,159 --> 02:22:34,719
little bit different from what's

4316
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:38,079
in the gene code of the founder the team

4317
02:22:34,719 --> 02:22:40,239
needs to be fully bought in to

4318
02:22:38,079 --> 02:22:41,280
the you know the intuitions and the

4319
02:22:40,239 --> 02:22:44,318
vision of the founder

4320
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:46,079
great we've got that but um

4321
02:22:44,318 --> 02:22:48,159
the team needs to have a slightly

4322
02:22:46,079 --> 02:22:51,359
different thing which is

4323
02:22:48,159 --> 02:22:54,959
you know it's 99 obsession

4324
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:57,439
is execution is to relentlessly hit

4325
02:22:54,959 --> 02:22:59,119
the milestones hit the objectives hit

4326
02:22:57,439 --> 02:23:01,520
the quarterly goals

4327
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:02,479
that is you know one percent vision you

4328
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:05,760
don't want to get

4329
02:23:02,478 --> 02:23:08,000
lose that but execution

4330
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:09,439
machines you know people who have a

4331
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:12,799
demonstrated ability

4332
02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:14,639
and a demonstrated focus on yeah i go

4333
02:23:12,799 --> 02:23:16,799
from point to point to point

4334
02:23:14,639 --> 02:23:17,680
i try to beat and raise expectations

4335
02:23:16,799 --> 02:23:20,959
relentlessly

4336
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:23,200
never fall short and you know both sort

4337
02:23:20,959 --> 02:23:25,199
of blaze and follow the path

4338
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:27,120
not that the path is getting i mean

4339
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:29,600
blaze the trail as well i mean

4340
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:30,640
a good founder is going to trust that vp

4341
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:32,800
of sales

4342
02:23:30,639 --> 02:23:34,478
to have a better sense of what it takes

4343
02:23:32,799 --> 02:23:36,239
to build out that organization what the

4344
02:23:34,478 --> 02:23:37,920
milestones be and it's gonna be kind of

4345
02:23:36,239 --> 02:23:40,398
a dialogue amongst those

4346
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:41,520
at the top but you know execution

4347
02:23:40,398 --> 02:23:43,358
obsession

4348
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:45,120
in the team is the next thing yeah

4349
02:23:43,359 --> 02:23:47,359
there's some sense where the founder

4350
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:49,120
you know you talk about sort of the

4351
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:49,840
space of ideas like first principles

4352
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:52,079
thinking

4353
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:53,280
asking big difficult questions of like

4354
02:23:52,079 --> 02:23:55,920
future trajectories

4355
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:56,880
or having a big vision and big picture

4356
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:59,520
dreams

4357
02:23:56,879 --> 02:24:00,239
you can almost be a dreamer it feels

4358
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:03,439
like

4359
02:24:00,239 --> 02:24:07,920
when you're like not the founder but

4360
02:24:03,439 --> 02:24:10,318
in the space of sort of leadership

4361
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:11,840
but when it gets to the ground floor

4362
02:24:10,318 --> 02:24:14,959
there has to be execution

4363
02:24:11,840 --> 02:24:17,840
there has to be hitting deadlines

4364
02:24:14,959 --> 02:24:19,039
and uh sometimes those are attention

4365
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:23,200
there's something about

4366
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:26,479
dreams that um

4367
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:28,079
our attention with the pragmatic nature

4368
02:24:26,478 --> 02:24:31,760
of execution

4369
02:24:28,079 --> 02:24:34,559
not dreams but sort of ambitious vision

4370
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:35,600
and though those have to be i suppose

4371
02:24:34,559 --> 02:24:37,760
coupled

4372
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:39,520
the vision in the leader and the

4373
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:42,079
execution

4374
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:43,040
in the in the software world that would

4375
02:24:42,079 --> 02:24:46,639
be the programmer

4376
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:48,800
or the designer absolutely amongst

4377
02:24:46,639 --> 02:24:49,920
many other things you're an incredible

4378
02:24:48,799 --> 02:24:52,000
conversationalist

4379
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:53,920
a podcaster you host a podcast called

4380
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:55,600
after on

4381
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:57,120
what i mean there's a million questions

4382
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:58,800
i want to ask you here but

4383
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:00,640
one at the highest level what do you

4384
02:24:58,799 --> 02:25:04,318
think makes for a great conversation

4385
02:25:00,639 --> 02:25:07,519
i would say two things one of two things

4386
02:25:04,318 --> 02:25:10,639
and ideally both of two things one is

4387
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:13,359
if something is very

4388
02:25:10,639 --> 02:25:13,920
is beautifully architected whether it's

4389
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:16,640
done

4390
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:17,760
deliberately and methodically and

4391
02:25:16,639 --> 02:25:19,840
willfully as

4392
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:21,840
you know as when i do it or whether that

4393
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:24,398
just emerges from the conversation but

4394
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:25,760
something that's beautifully architected

4395
02:25:24,398 --> 02:25:27,840
that can create something that's

4396
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:30,398
incredibly powerful and memorable

4397
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:32,079
um or something where there's just

4398
02:25:30,398 --> 02:25:35,039
extraordinary chemistry

4399
02:25:32,079 --> 02:25:38,000
yes and so with all in or go way back

4400
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:40,479
you might remember the npr show car talk

4401
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,520
oh yeah i wouldn't care less about auto

4402
02:25:40,478 --> 02:25:43,760
mechanics myself

4403
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:45,359
that's right but i love that show

4404
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:46,398
because the banter between those two

4405
02:25:45,359 --> 02:25:49,680
guys was just

4406
02:25:46,398 --> 02:25:51,760
beyond it without any parallel right

4407
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:52,880
you know and some kind of edgy podcast

4408
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:54,639
like red scare

4409
02:25:52,879 --> 02:25:56,318
is just really entertaining to me

4410
02:25:54,639 --> 02:25:57,920
because the banter the women on that

4411
02:25:56,318 --> 02:25:59,439
show is just so good

4412
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:01,359
and all in and that kind of thing so i

4413
02:25:59,439 --> 02:26:02,639
think it's it's a combination of sort of

4414
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:05,760
the arc

4415
02:26:02,639 --> 02:26:06,079
and the chemistry and i think because

4416
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:09,040
the

4417
02:26:06,079 --> 02:26:10,478
arc can be so important that's why very

4418
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:13,120
very highly produced

4419
02:26:10,478 --> 02:26:14,719
uh podcasts like this american life

4420
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:15,840
obviously a radio show but i think of a

4421
02:26:14,719 --> 02:26:16,719
podcast because that's how i always

4422
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:19,359
consume it

4423
02:26:16,719 --> 02:26:20,239
or criminal or you know a lot of what

4424
02:26:19,359 --> 02:26:23,359
wonder he does

4425
02:26:20,239 --> 02:26:24,079
and so forth that is real documentary

4426
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:25,840
making

4427
02:26:24,079 --> 02:26:27,120
and that requires a big team and a big

4428
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:29,200
budget relative to the kinds of things

4429
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:31,040
you and i do but nonetheless

4430
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:32,479
then you got that arc and that can be

4431
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:32,880
really really compelling but if we go

4432
02:26:32,478 --> 02:26:35,519
back

4433
02:26:32,879 --> 02:26:38,318
to conversation i think it's a

4434
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:39,920
combination of structure and chemistry

4435
02:26:38,318 --> 02:26:41,600
yeah and i've actually personally have

4436
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:44,000
lost i used to

4437
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:45,520
love this american life and for some

4438
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:48,879
reason because it lacks

4439
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:52,000
the possibility of magic

4440
02:26:48,879 --> 02:26:52,719
it's engineered magic i i've fallen off

4441
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,040
of it myself

4442
02:26:52,719 --> 02:26:56,559
as well i mean when i fell madly in love

4443
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:58,319
with it during the auts

4444
02:26:56,559 --> 02:27:00,318
it was the only thing going yeah they

4445
02:26:58,318 --> 02:27:02,239
were really smart to adopting to adopt

4446
02:27:00,318 --> 02:27:03,119
podcasting as a distribution mechanism

4447
02:27:02,239 --> 02:27:06,398
early

4448
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:08,319
um but yeah i think that

4449
02:27:06,398 --> 02:27:09,439
maybe there's a little bit less magic

4450
02:27:08,318 --> 02:27:10,879
there now because i think they have

4451
02:27:09,439 --> 02:27:12,720
agendas other than

4452
02:27:10,879 --> 02:27:14,239
necessarily just delighting their

4453
02:27:12,719 --> 02:27:15,438
listeners with quirky stories which i

4454
02:27:14,239 --> 02:27:17,520
think is what it was all about back in

4455
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:19,359
the day and some other things

4456
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:22,159
is there like a memorable conversation

4457
02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:25,200
that you've had on the podcast whether

4458
02:27:22,159 --> 02:27:27,840
it was because it was wild and

4459
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:28,720
fun or one that was exceptionally

4460
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:30,719
challenging

4461
02:27:28,719 --> 02:27:31,920
maybe challenging to prepare for that

4462
02:27:30,719 --> 02:27:33,438
kind of thing is there something that

4463
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:35,600
stands out in your mind that

4464
02:27:33,439 --> 02:27:36,800
that's uh you can draw an insight from

4465
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:39,840
yeah i mean this

4466
02:27:36,799 --> 02:27:40,398
no way diminishes the episodes that will

4467
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:43,520
not be

4468
02:27:40,398 --> 02:27:44,000
the answer to these two questions but an

4469
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:45,359
example

4470
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:47,040
of something that was really really

4471
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:47,920
challenging to prepare for was george

4472
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:49,760
church

4473
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:51,439
so as i'm sure you know and as i'm sure

4474
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:52,478
many of your listeners know he is one of

4475
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:54,000
the absolute

4476
02:27:52,478 --> 02:27:57,279
leading lights in the field of synthetic

4477
02:27:54,000 --> 02:28:00,719
biology he's also unbelievably prolific

4478
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:02,399
his lab is large and has all kinds of

4479
02:28:00,719 --> 02:28:03,840
efforts have spun out of that

4480
02:28:02,398 --> 02:28:05,439
and what i wanted to make my george

4481
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:08,239
church episode about

4482
02:28:05,439 --> 02:28:09,600
was first of all you know grounding

4483
02:28:08,239 --> 02:28:12,799
people into

4484
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:14,960
what is this thing called syn bio and

4485
02:28:12,799 --> 02:28:16,559
that required me to learn a hell of a

4486
02:28:14,959 --> 02:28:19,358
lot more about sin bio than i knew

4487
02:28:16,559 --> 02:28:20,000
going into it so there was just this

4488
02:28:19,359 --> 02:28:22,239
very

4489
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:24,318
broad i mean i knew much more than the

4490
02:28:22,239 --> 02:28:26,000
average person going into that episode

4491
02:28:24,318 --> 02:28:27,600
but there was this incredible breadth of

4492
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,879
grounding that i needed to give myself

4493
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:32,239
in the domain

4494
02:28:28,879 --> 02:28:33,519
and then george does so many interesting

4495
02:28:32,239 --> 02:28:35,439
things there's so many interesting

4496
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:37,359
things emitting from his lab

4497
02:28:35,439 --> 02:28:38,559
that you know and and he had he and i

4498
02:28:37,359 --> 02:28:41,120
had a really good dialogue he was a

4499
02:28:38,559 --> 02:28:44,239
great guide going into it

4500
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:45,120
winnowing it down to the three to four

4501
02:28:44,239 --> 02:28:47,920
that i really wanted

4502
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:49,840
us to focus on to create a sense of

4503
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:51,439
wonder and magic in the listener of what

4504
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:53,600
could be possible from this

4505
02:28:51,439 --> 02:28:55,120
very broad spectrum domain that was a

4506
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:58,239
doozy of a challenge that was a

4507
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:59,920
tough tough tough one to prepare for now

4508
02:28:58,239 --> 02:29:04,079
in terms of something that was just

4509
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:05,520
wild and fun and unexpected

4510
02:29:04,079 --> 02:29:06,959
i mean by the time we sat down to

4511
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:08,079
interview i knew where we were going to

4512
02:29:06,959 --> 02:29:11,199
go but just in terms

4513
02:29:08,079 --> 02:29:14,398
of the idea space don hoffman

4514
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:16,000
oh wow yeah so don hoffman uh as again

4515
02:29:14,398 --> 02:29:16,398
some listeners probably know because

4516
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,159
he's

4517
02:29:16,398 --> 02:29:20,079
i think i was the first podcaster to

4518
02:29:18,159 --> 02:29:21,760
interview him i'm sure some of your

4519
02:29:20,079 --> 02:29:25,200
listeners are familiar with them but

4520
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:28,398
he has this unbelievably contrarian

4521
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:31,760
take on the nature of reality

4522
02:29:28,398 --> 02:29:33,119
but it is contrarian in a way that all

4523
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:35,600
the ideas are

4524
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:36,800
highly internally consistent and snap

4525
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:39,840
together in a way that's

4526
02:29:36,799 --> 02:29:43,599
just delightful and it seems

4527
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:46,159
as radically violating of our intuitions

4528
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:48,239
and is radically violating of the

4529
02:29:46,159 --> 02:29:50,159
probable nature of reality as anything

4530
02:29:48,239 --> 02:29:51,920
that one can encounter but an analogy

4531
02:29:50,159 --> 02:29:52,959
that he uses which is very powerful

4532
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:55,439
which is

4533
02:29:52,959 --> 02:29:56,318
what intuition could possibly be more

4534
02:29:55,439 --> 02:29:58,000
powerful

4535
02:29:56,318 --> 02:29:59,600
than the notion that there is a single

4536
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:02,639
unitary direction called

4537
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:05,120
down and we're on this big flat thing

4538
02:30:02,639 --> 02:30:06,559
for which there is a thing called down

4539
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:08,240
and we all know that i mean that's the

4540
02:30:06,559 --> 02:30:10,799
most intuitive thing that one

4541
02:30:08,239 --> 02:30:12,239
could probably think of and we all know

4542
02:30:10,799 --> 02:30:14,318
that that ain't true

4543
02:30:12,239 --> 02:30:16,478
so my conversation with don hoffman is

4544
02:30:14,318 --> 02:30:19,039
just wild and

4545
02:30:16,478 --> 02:30:19,599
full of plot twists and interesting

4546
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:21,520
stuff

4547
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:23,200
and the interesting thing about the

4548
02:30:21,520 --> 02:30:25,040
wildness of his ideas

4549
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:28,079
it's to me at least as a listener

4550
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:28,080
coupled with uh

4551
02:30:28,159 --> 02:30:35,119
he's a good listener and he empathizes

4552
02:30:32,159 --> 02:30:35,760
with the people who challenge his ideas

4553
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:38,399
like

4554
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:39,439
uh what's uh what's a better way to

4555
02:30:38,398 --> 02:30:42,159
phrase that

4556
02:30:39,439 --> 02:30:43,439
he is a welcoming of challenge in a way

4557
02:30:42,159 --> 02:30:46,719
that creates a really

4558
02:30:43,439 --> 02:30:50,318
fun conversation oh totally yeah he he

4559
02:30:46,719 --> 02:30:51,119
he loves a perry or a jab whatever the

4560
02:30:50,318 --> 02:30:54,318
word is

4561
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:57,359
yeah at his argument he honors it he's a

4562
02:30:54,318 --> 02:31:01,199
very very you know gentle and

4563
02:30:57,359 --> 02:31:04,960
and non-combative soul but then he

4564
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:07,600
is very good and takes great evident joy

4565
02:31:04,959 --> 02:31:09,199
in responding to that in in a way that

4566
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:10,000
expands your understanding of his

4567
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:13,200
thinking

4568
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:14,719
let me as a small tangent of tying up

4569
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:17,520
together our previous conversation about

4570
02:31:14,719 --> 02:31:20,559
listening.com and streaming and spotify

4571
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:23,120
and the world of podcasting

4572
02:31:20,559 --> 02:31:25,519
so we've been talking about this magical

4573
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:29,040
medium of podcasting

4574
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:32,720
i have a lot of friends at spotify at

4575
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:37,359
in the high positions of spotify as well

4576
02:31:32,719 --> 02:31:40,000
i worry about spotify and podcasting

4577
02:31:37,359 --> 02:31:41,120
and the future of podcasting in general

4578
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:44,719
that

4579
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:49,120
moves podcasting in the place of maybe

4580
02:31:44,719 --> 02:31:50,879
wild gardens of sorts um

4581
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:53,760
since you've had a foot in both worlds

4582
02:31:50,879 --> 02:31:55,920
have a foot in both worlds

4583
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:57,040
do you worry as well about the future of

4584
02:31:55,920 --> 02:32:00,559
podcasting

4585
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:04,160
yeah i think walled gardens are really

4586
02:32:00,559 --> 02:32:06,959
toxic to the medium that they start

4587
02:32:04,159 --> 02:32:09,280
balkanizing so to take an example i'll

4588
02:32:06,959 --> 02:32:12,559
take two examples

4589
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:14,960
with music it was a very very big deal

4590
02:32:12,559 --> 02:32:16,799
that at rhapsody we were the first

4591
02:32:14,959 --> 02:32:17,438
company to get full catalog licenses

4592
02:32:16,799 --> 02:32:19,039
from all

4593
02:32:17,439 --> 02:32:21,120
back then there were five major music

4594
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:22,960
labels and also hundreds and hundreds of

4595
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:25,040
indies because you needed to present the

4596
02:32:22,959 --> 02:32:27,759
listener with a sense that

4597
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:28,319
basically everything is there and there

4598
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:31,040
is

4599
02:32:28,318 --> 02:32:32,159
essentially no friction to discovering

4600
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:34,080
that which is new

4601
02:32:32,159 --> 02:32:35,359
and you can wander this realm and all

4602
02:32:34,079 --> 02:32:37,439
you really need

4603
02:32:35,359 --> 02:32:39,359
is a good map whether it is something

4604
02:32:37,439 --> 02:32:40,720
that somebody that the editorial team

4605
02:32:39,359 --> 02:32:42,318
assembled or a good algorithm or

4606
02:32:40,719 --> 02:32:43,358
whatever it is but a good map to wander

4607
02:32:42,318 --> 02:32:46,559
this domain

4608
02:32:43,359 --> 02:32:49,520
when you start walling things off a you

4609
02:32:46,559 --> 02:32:50,318
undermine the joy of friction free

4610
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:52,399
discovery

4611
02:32:50,318 --> 02:32:54,079
which is an incredibly valuable thing to

4612
02:32:52,398 --> 02:32:55,840
deliver to your customer

4613
02:32:54,079 --> 02:32:57,120
both from a business standpoint and

4614
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:59,600
simply from

4615
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:01,200
you know a humanistic standpoint of you

4616
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:03,920
want to bring delight to people

4617
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:06,560
but it also creates an incredible

4618
02:33:03,920 --> 02:33:08,398
opening vector for piracy and so

4619
02:33:06,559 --> 02:33:10,239
something that's very different from the

4620
02:33:08,398 --> 02:33:13,119
rhapsody spotify

4621
02:33:10,239 --> 02:33:14,079
etc like experience is what we have now

4622
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:16,399
in video

4623
02:33:14,079 --> 02:33:18,559
you know like wow is that show on hulu

4624
02:33:16,398 --> 02:33:21,599
is it on netflix is it on something like

4625
02:33:18,559 --> 02:33:23,119
ifc channel is it on discovery plus is

4626
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:25,840
it here is it there

4627
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:26,640
and the more frustration and toe

4628
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:30,079
stubbing

4629
02:33:26,639 --> 02:33:31,760
that people encounter when they

4630
02:33:30,079 --> 02:33:33,840
are seeking something and they're

4631
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:34,559
already paying a very respectable amount

4632
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:36,960
of money

4633
02:33:34,559 --> 02:33:38,000
per month to have access to content they

4634
02:33:36,959 --> 02:33:39,759
can't find it

4635
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,040
the more that happens the more people

4636
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:42,800
are going to be driven to piracy

4637
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:44,000
solutions like to hell with it

4638
02:33:42,799 --> 02:33:45,119
never know where i'm going to find

4639
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,478
something i never know what it's going

4640
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:48,800
to cost oftentimes

4641
02:33:46,478 --> 02:33:50,000
really interesting things are simply

4642
02:33:48,799 --> 02:33:51,840
unavailable

4643
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,959
that surprises me the number of times

4644
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:54,880
that i've been looking for things i

4645
02:33:52,959 --> 02:33:57,279
don't even think are that obscure

4646
02:33:54,879 --> 02:33:59,759
that are just it says not available in

4647
02:33:57,280 --> 02:34:01,600
your geography period mister right

4648
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:02,880
so i think that that's a mistake and

4649
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:05,359
then the other thing is

4650
02:34:02,879 --> 02:34:07,039
you know for podcasters and lovers of

4651
02:34:05,359 --> 02:34:08,640
podcasting

4652
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:10,160
we should want to resist this wall

4653
02:34:08,639 --> 02:34:14,000
garden thing because it

4654
02:34:10,159 --> 02:34:16,959
a it it does um

4655
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:18,559
smother this friction free or eradicate

4656
02:34:16,959 --> 02:34:19,839
this friction free discovery unless you

4657
02:34:18,559 --> 02:34:23,439
want to sign up for

4658
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:26,318
lots of different services and also

4659
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:28,079
dims the voice of somebody who might be

4660
02:34:26,318 --> 02:34:31,760
able to have a far far far bigger

4661
02:34:28,079 --> 02:34:33,200
impact by reaching far more neurons

4662
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:35,600
you know with their ideas i'll use an

4663
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:37,040
example from it was probably the 90s or

4664
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:40,559
maybe it was the oughts

4665
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:42,479
of howard stern who had the biggest

4666
02:34:40,559 --> 02:34:43,600
megaphone or maybe the second biggest

4667
02:34:42,478 --> 02:34:46,318
after oprah

4668
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:48,239
megaphone and popular culture and

4669
02:34:46,318 --> 02:34:49,600
because he was syndicated on hundreds

4670
02:34:48,239 --> 02:34:51,039
and hundreds and hundreds of radio

4671
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:52,399
stations at a time when terrestrial

4672
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:53,760
broadcast was the main thing people

4673
02:34:52,398 --> 02:34:54,719
listened to in their car no more

4674
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:56,800
obviously

4675
02:34:54,719 --> 02:34:58,239
but when he decided to go over to you

4676
02:34:56,799 --> 02:35:00,000
know satellite radio if you can't

4677
02:34:58,239 --> 02:35:01,600
remember was xm or sirius maybe they'd

4678
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:03,760
already merged at that point

4679
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:05,439
but when he did that he made you know

4680
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:08,000
totally his right to do it

4681
02:35:05,439 --> 02:35:09,120
a financial calculation that they were

4682
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:11,920
offering him a nine

4683
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:12,319
figure sum to do that but his audience

4684
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:13,840
because

4685
02:35:12,318 --> 02:35:15,199
not a lot of people were subscribing to

4686
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:16,000
satellite radio at that point his

4687
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:18,159
audience

4688
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:20,799
probably collapsed by i wouldn't be

4689
02:35:18,159 --> 02:35:23,200
surprised if it was as much as 95

4690
02:35:20,799 --> 02:35:24,000
and so the influence that he had on the

4691
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:26,079
culture

4692
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,439
and his ability to sort of shape

4693
02:35:26,079 --> 02:35:30,478
conversation

4694
02:35:27,439 --> 02:35:33,439
and so forth just gotten muted

4695
02:35:30,478 --> 02:35:35,920
yeah and also there's a certain sense

4696
02:35:33,439 --> 02:35:39,439
especially in modern times where

4697
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:43,359
the walled gardens naturally lead

4698
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:46,479
to um i don't know

4699
02:35:43,359 --> 02:35:46,960
if there's a term for it but people who

4700
02:35:46,478 --> 02:35:50,159
are not

4701
02:35:46,959 --> 02:35:52,559
creatives starting to have power

4702
02:35:50,159 --> 02:35:54,398
over the creatives right and even if

4703
02:35:52,559 --> 02:35:57,760
they don't stifle it

4704
02:35:54,398 --> 02:36:01,199
if they're providing you know

4705
02:35:57,760 --> 02:36:03,840
incentives within the platform to shape

4706
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:05,200
shift or you know even completely mutate

4707
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:07,439
or distort

4708
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:08,399
the show i mean imagine somebody has got

4709
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:10,318
um

4710
02:36:08,398 --> 02:36:11,680
you know reasonably interesting idea for

4711
02:36:10,318 --> 02:36:12,959
a podcast and

4712
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:14,720
they get signed up with let's say

4713
02:36:12,959 --> 02:36:16,478
spotify then spotify is going to give

4714
02:36:14,719 --> 02:36:19,279
them financing to get the things spun

4715
02:36:16,478 --> 02:36:21,438
up and that's great and spotify is going

4716
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:23,760
to give them a certain amount of really

4717
02:36:21,439 --> 02:36:26,000
uh you know powerful placement

4718
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:27,120
you know within the visual field of

4719
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,120
listeners

4720
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:30,399
but spotify's conditions for that they

4721
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:32,720
say look you know

4722
02:36:30,398 --> 02:36:34,000
we think that your podcast will be much

4723
02:36:32,719 --> 02:36:37,358
more successful

4724
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:40,879
if you dumb it down about 60

4725
02:36:37,359 --> 02:36:41,920
uh if you add some you know silly dirty

4726
02:36:40,879 --> 02:36:44,879
jokes

4727
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:47,120
if you do this you do that and suddenly

4728
02:36:44,879 --> 02:36:48,879
the person who is dependent upon spotify

4729
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:50,479
for permission to come into existence

4730
02:36:48,879 --> 02:36:51,279
and is really different really wants to

4731
02:36:50,478 --> 02:36:52,719
please them

4732
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:54,000
you know to get that money in to get

4733
02:36:52,719 --> 02:36:54,879
that placement really wants to be

4734
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:55,920
successful

4735
02:36:54,879 --> 02:36:58,079
now all of a sudden you're having a

4736
02:36:55,920 --> 02:37:00,960
dialogue between a complete

4737
02:36:58,079 --> 02:37:03,120
non-creative some marketing you know

4738
02:37:00,959 --> 02:37:05,199
sort of data analytic person at spotify

4739
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:07,439
and a creative that's going to shape

4740
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:08,240
what that show is yeah you know so that

4741
02:37:07,439 --> 02:37:11,200
could be

4742
02:37:08,239 --> 02:37:12,398
much more common and ultimately having

4743
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:15,040
the aggregate

4744
02:37:12,398 --> 02:37:16,639
um an even bigger impact than you know

4745
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:18,399
the cancellation let's say if somebody

4746
02:37:16,639 --> 02:37:19,439
who says the wrong word or voices the

4747
02:37:18,398 --> 02:37:21,039
wrong idea

4748
02:37:19,439 --> 02:37:23,280
i mean that's kind of what you have not

4749
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:26,800
kind of what you have with film and tv

4750
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:29,040
is that so much influence

4751
02:37:26,799 --> 02:37:30,799
is exerted over the storyline and the

4752
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:32,000
plots and the character arcs and all

4753
02:37:30,799 --> 02:37:34,398
kinds of things

4754
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:35,920
by executives who are completely alien

4755
02:37:34,398 --> 02:37:37,519
to the experience and the skill set of

4756
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:39,120
being a show runner in television being

4757
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:40,720
a director in film

4758
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:42,560
that you know is meant to like oh we

4759
02:37:40,719 --> 02:37:43,599
can't piss off the chinese market here

4760
02:37:42,559 --> 02:37:46,318
or we can't say that

4761
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:48,318
we need to have you know cast members

4762
02:37:46,318 --> 02:37:50,318
that have precisely these demographics

4763
02:37:48,318 --> 02:37:52,318
reflected or whatever it is

4764
02:37:50,318 --> 02:37:54,318
that you know and obviously despite that

4765
02:37:52,318 --> 02:37:55,359
extraordinary at least tv shows are now

4766
02:37:54,318 --> 02:37:57,760
being made

4767
02:37:55,359 --> 02:37:58,559
um you know in terms of film i think the

4768
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:01,040
quality has

4769
02:37:58,559 --> 02:38:02,879
has nose-dived of the average let's say

4770
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:04,560
say american film coming out of a major

4771
02:38:02,879 --> 02:38:06,318
studio the average quality and my view

4772
02:38:04,559 --> 02:38:06,799
is nose dived over the past decade is

4773
02:38:06,318 --> 02:38:08,000
it's

4774
02:38:06,799 --> 02:38:10,639
kind of everything's got to be a

4775
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:14,079
superhero franchise but you know

4776
02:38:10,639 --> 02:38:16,959
great stuff gets made despite that but i

4777
02:38:14,079 --> 02:38:19,200
have to assume that in some cases at

4778
02:38:16,959 --> 02:38:20,879
least in perhaps many cases

4779
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:22,800
greater stuff would be made if there was

4780
02:38:20,879 --> 02:38:23,519
less interference from non-creative

4781
02:38:22,799 --> 02:38:25,438
executives

4782
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:27,200
it's like the flip side of that though

4783
02:38:25,439 --> 02:38:28,800
and this is was the pitch of spotify

4784
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:32,399
because i've heard their pitch

4785
02:38:28,799 --> 02:38:34,318
is netflix from everybody i've heard

4786
02:38:32,398 --> 02:38:36,079
that i've spoken with about netflix is

4787
02:38:34,318 --> 02:38:37,279
they actually empower the creator

4788
02:38:36,079 --> 02:38:40,159
i don't know i don't know what the heck

4789
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:42,079
they do but they do a good job of giving

4790
02:38:40,159 --> 02:38:43,520
creators even the crazy ones like tim

4791
02:38:42,079 --> 02:38:46,000
dillon like joe rogan

4792
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:46,960
like comedians freedom to be their crazy

4793
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:49,520
cells

4794
02:38:46,959 --> 02:38:50,239
and the result is like some of the

4795
02:38:49,520 --> 02:38:53,760
greatest

4796
02:38:50,239 --> 02:38:56,000
television some of the greatest cinema

4797
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:57,760
whatever you call it ever made true

4798
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,639
right and i don't know what the heck

4799
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:00,318
they're doing

4800
02:38:58,639 --> 02:39:01,279
it's a relative thing it's not from what

4801
02:39:00,318 --> 02:39:02,559
i understand it's a relative thing

4802
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:06,000
they're interfering far far

4803
02:39:02,559 --> 02:39:08,398
far less yeah than you know nbc or

4804
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:10,318
you know amc would have interfered so

4805
02:39:08,398 --> 02:39:11,680
it's a relative thing and

4806
02:39:10,318 --> 02:39:12,799
obviously they're the ones writing the

4807
02:39:11,680 --> 02:39:13,840
checks and the other ones giving the

4808
02:39:12,799 --> 02:39:14,879
platform so they have every right to

4809
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:17,280
their own influence

4810
02:39:14,879 --> 02:39:18,000
yeah obviously uh but my understanding

4811
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:20,079
is it's

4812
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:22,079
they're relatively way more hands-off

4813
02:39:20,079 --> 02:39:23,120
and that has had a demonstrable effect

4814
02:39:22,079 --> 02:39:25,439
because i agree

4815
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:27,920
some of the greatest you know video

4816
02:39:25,439 --> 02:39:29,680
produced video content of all time

4817
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:31,280
an incredibly inordinate percentage of

4818
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:32,960
that is coming out from netflix in just

4819
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:34,399
a few years when the history of cinema

4820
02:39:32,959 --> 02:39:37,519
goes back many many decades

4821
02:39:34,398 --> 02:39:38,959
and spotify wants to be that for

4822
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:40,479
podcasting and

4823
02:39:38,959 --> 02:39:42,000
i hope they do become that for

4824
02:39:40,478 --> 02:39:44,879
podcasting but

4825
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:46,559
i'm uh wearing my skeptical goggles or

4826
02:39:44,879 --> 02:39:48,799
skeptical hat whatever the heck

4827
02:39:46,559 --> 02:39:49,600
it is because it's not easy to do and it

4828
02:39:48,799 --> 02:39:52,799
requires

4829
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:55,120
uh it requires letting go of power

4830
02:39:52,799 --> 02:39:56,639
yeah giving power to the creatives it

4831
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:59,520
requires pivoting which

4832
02:39:56,639 --> 02:40:00,719
large companies even as innovative as

4833
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:02,640
spotify is

4834
02:40:00,719 --> 02:40:04,559
still now a large company pivoting into

4835
02:40:02,639 --> 02:40:05,439
a whole new space is very tricky and

4836
02:40:04,559 --> 02:40:08,239
difficult

4837
02:40:05,439 --> 02:40:10,159
so i'm skeptical but hopeful yeah what

4838
02:40:08,239 --> 02:40:10,879
advice would you give to a young person

4839
02:40:10,159 --> 02:40:13,520
today

4840
02:40:10,879 --> 02:40:15,438
about life about career we talked about

4841
02:40:13,520 --> 02:40:16,880
startups we talked about music

4842
02:40:15,439 --> 02:40:18,800
we talked about the end of human

4843
02:40:16,879 --> 02:40:21,358
civilization

4844
02:40:18,799 --> 02:40:23,119
is there advice you would give to a

4845
02:40:21,359 --> 02:40:24,720
young person today maybe in college

4846
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:27,600
maybe in high school

4847
02:40:24,719 --> 02:40:29,119
about uh about their life well let's see

4848
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:30,000
i mean there's so many domains you can

4849
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:34,000
advise on

4850
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:36,398
and you know i i'm not going to give

4851
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:38,000
advice on life because i i fear that i

4852
02:40:36,398 --> 02:40:39,199
would drift into sort of hallmark

4853
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,559
bromides

4854
02:40:39,200 --> 02:40:42,319
that really wouldn't be all that

4855
02:40:40,559 --> 02:40:43,119
distinctive and they might be entirely

4856
02:40:42,318 --> 02:40:45,519
true

4857
02:40:43,120 --> 02:40:46,160
sometimes the greatest insights about

4858
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:48,000
life

4859
02:40:46,159 --> 02:40:49,119
turn out to be like the kinds of things

4860
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,398
you'd see on a hallmark card so i'm

4861
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:53,040
gonna steer clear that

4862
02:40:50,398 --> 02:40:53,760
on a career level you know one thing

4863
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:56,240
that i think

4864
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:57,359
um is unintuitive but unbelievably

4865
02:40:56,239 --> 02:41:00,398
powerful

4866
02:40:57,359 --> 02:41:03,680
is to focus not necessarily

4867
02:41:00,398 --> 02:41:05,358
in on being you know in the top sliver

4868
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:07,520
of one percent

4869
02:41:05,359 --> 02:41:09,200
in excelling at one domain that's

4870
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:12,239
important and valuable

4871
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:15,279
but to think in terms of intersections

4872
02:41:12,239 --> 02:41:16,398
of two domains which are rare but

4873
02:41:15,279 --> 02:41:19,520
valuable

4874
02:41:16,398 --> 02:41:22,398
and there's a couple reasons for this

4875
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:24,399
the first is in an incredibly

4876
02:41:22,398 --> 02:41:25,680
competitive world that is so much more

4877
02:41:24,398 --> 02:41:26,559
competitive than it was when i was

4878
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:27,840
coming out of school

4879
02:41:26,559 --> 02:41:30,079
radically more competitive than when

4880
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:32,799
it's when i was coming out of school

4881
02:41:30,079 --> 02:41:34,318
to navigate your way to the absolute

4882
02:41:32,799 --> 02:41:35,438
pinnacle of any domain let's say you

4883
02:41:34,318 --> 02:41:38,398
want to be

4884
02:41:35,439 --> 02:41:40,239
you know really really great at you know

4885
02:41:38,398 --> 02:41:41,119
python pick a language whatever it is

4886
02:41:40,239 --> 02:41:43,279
you want to be

4887
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:44,960
one of the world's greatest python

4888
02:41:43,279 --> 02:41:47,200
developers javascript whatever your

4889
02:41:44,959 --> 02:41:50,398
language is hopefully it's not cobalt

4890
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:52,640
um but by the way if you listen to this

4891
02:41:50,398 --> 02:41:53,439
i am actually looking for a cobalt

4892
02:41:52,639 --> 02:41:54,639
expert to

4893
02:41:53,439 --> 02:41:56,239
interview because i find the language

4894
02:41:54,639 --> 02:41:57,119
fascinating and there's not many of them

4895
02:41:56,239 --> 02:41:58,959
so please

4896
02:41:57,120 --> 02:42:00,399
if you're if you know a world expert in

4897
02:41:58,959 --> 02:42:02,719
cobalt uh

4898
02:42:00,398 --> 02:42:03,680
or fortran but both actually or if you

4899
02:42:02,719 --> 02:42:06,559
are one or

4900
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:08,000
if you are one please email me yeah so i

4901
02:42:06,559 --> 02:42:08,719
mean if you're going out there and you

4902
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,559
want to be

4903
02:42:08,719 --> 02:42:12,159
in the top sliver one percent of python

4904
02:42:10,559 --> 02:42:13,359
develops a very very difficult thing to

4905
02:42:12,159 --> 02:42:14,639
do particularly would be number one in

4906
02:42:13,359 --> 02:42:16,800
the world something like that

4907
02:42:14,639 --> 02:42:18,079
and i'll use an analogy is i had a

4908
02:42:16,799 --> 02:42:22,559
friend in college

4909
02:42:18,079 --> 02:42:25,120
um who was um on a track and indeed

4910
02:42:22,559 --> 02:42:26,000
succeeded at that to become an olympic

4911
02:42:25,120 --> 02:42:27,600
meddler

4912
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:29,920
medalist and i think 100 meter

4913
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:33,600
breaststroke and

4914
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:36,639
he mortgaged a significant

4915
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:38,399
percentage of his sort of college life

4916
02:42:36,639 --> 02:42:39,840
to that goal i should say dedicated or

4917
02:42:38,398 --> 02:42:41,599
invested or whatever you wanted to say

4918
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:42,639
but he didn't participate in a lot of

4919
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:44,800
the social

4920
02:42:42,639 --> 02:42:45,840
a lot of the late night a lot of this a

4921
02:42:44,799 --> 02:42:48,159
lot of that

4922
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:49,760
because he was training so much and

4923
02:42:48,159 --> 02:42:52,000
obviously he also wanted to keep up with

4924
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:54,559
his academics and at the end of the day

4925
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:55,680
story has a happy ending and that he did

4926
02:42:54,559 --> 02:42:58,079
meddle in that

4927
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:59,359
bronze not gold but holy cow anybody who

4928
02:42:58,079 --> 02:43:01,120
gets an olympic medal that's an

4929
02:42:59,359 --> 02:43:02,960
extraordinary thing and at that moment

4930
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:04,960
he was you know one of the top three

4931
02:43:02,959 --> 02:43:07,839
people on earth at that thing

4932
02:43:04,959 --> 02:43:08,559
but wow how hard to do that how many

4933
02:43:07,840 --> 02:43:10,639
thousands

4934
02:43:08,559 --> 02:43:12,398
of other people went down that path and

4935
02:43:10,639 --> 02:43:12,799
made similar sacrifices and didn't get

4936
02:43:12,398 --> 02:43:15,840
there

4937
02:43:12,799 --> 02:43:19,438
it's very very hard to do that whereas

4938
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:20,559
i'll use a personal example when i came

4939
02:43:19,439 --> 02:43:23,279
out of business school

4940
02:43:20,559 --> 02:43:24,799
i went to a good business school and and

4941
02:43:23,279 --> 02:43:25,600
learned the things that were there to be

4942
02:43:24,799 --> 02:43:28,239
learned

4943
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:28,960
and i came out and i entered a world

4944
02:43:28,239 --> 02:43:30,639
with lots of

4945
02:43:28,959 --> 02:43:32,799
harvard business school by the way okay

4946
02:43:30,639 --> 02:43:34,559
yes it was harvard it's true

4947
02:43:32,799 --> 02:43:36,000
you're the first person who went there

4948
02:43:34,559 --> 02:43:37,920
who didn't say where you went

4949
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:39,040
it was just beautiful i appreciate that

4950
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:40,559
it's one of the greatest business

4951
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:42,080
schools uh

4952
02:43:40,559 --> 02:43:43,519
in the world it's a it's a whole another

4953
02:43:42,079 --> 02:43:44,239
fascinating conversation about that

4954
02:43:43,520 --> 02:43:46,560
world

4955
02:43:44,239 --> 02:43:48,159
but anyway but anyway so i learned the

4956
02:43:46,559 --> 02:43:51,278
things that you you learn getting to be

4957
02:43:48,159 --> 02:43:52,879
an mba from a from a top program and i

4958
02:43:51,279 --> 02:43:54,000
entered a world that had hundreds of

4959
02:43:52,879 --> 02:43:57,039
thousands of people

4960
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:58,398
who had mbas uh probably hundreds of

4961
02:43:57,040 --> 02:43:59,760
thousands who have them from you know

4962
02:43:58,398 --> 02:44:03,039
top ten programs

4963
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:05,120
uh but so i was not particularly great

4964
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:06,319
at being an mba person i was

4965
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:07,840
inexperienced

4966
02:44:06,318 --> 02:44:09,680
uh relative to most of them and there

4967
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:12,719
were a lot of them but it was okay

4968
02:44:09,680 --> 02:44:15,920
mba person right newly minted uh

4969
02:44:12,719 --> 02:44:18,639
but then as it happened i found my way

4970
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:20,159
into working on the commercial internet

4971
02:44:18,639 --> 02:44:22,559
in 1994

4972
02:44:20,159 --> 02:44:24,079
so i went to a at the time giant hot

4973
02:44:22,559 --> 02:44:24,879
computing company called silicon

4974
02:44:24,079 --> 02:44:26,879
graphics

4975
02:44:24,879 --> 02:44:28,959
which had enough heft and enough you

4976
02:44:26,879 --> 02:44:30,559
know head count that they could take on

4977
02:44:28,959 --> 02:44:31,679
and experienced mbas and

4978
02:44:30,559 --> 02:44:33,840
try to train them in the world of

4979
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:36,318
silicon valley but

4980
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:38,000
within that comp that company that had

4981
02:44:36,318 --> 02:44:40,159
an enormous amount of surface area and

4982
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:42,318
was touching very a lot of areas and was

4983
02:44:40,159 --> 02:44:43,520
had unbelievably smart people at the

4984
02:44:42,318 --> 02:44:46,719
time uh

4985
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:47,439
it was not surprising that sgi started

4986
02:44:46,719 --> 02:44:49,119
doing

4987
02:44:47,439 --> 02:44:51,040
really interesting and innovative and

4988
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:52,479
trailblazing stuff on the internet

4989
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:53,680
before almost anybody else

4990
02:44:52,478 --> 02:44:55,278
and part of the reason was that our

4991
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:57,279
founder jim clark went off to co-found

4992
02:44:55,279 --> 02:44:58,560
netscape with mark andreessen so

4993
02:44:57,279 --> 02:44:59,840
the whole company was like wait what was

4994
02:44:58,559 --> 02:45:00,559
that what's this commercial internet

4995
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:02,719
thing

4996
02:45:00,559 --> 02:45:05,039
so i end up in that group now in terms

4997
02:45:02,719 --> 02:45:05,920
of being a commercial internet person or

4998
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:09,200
a world web

4999
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:11,279
world wide web person um again uh

5000
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:12,960
i was in that case barely credentialed i

5001
02:45:11,279 --> 02:45:15,120
couldn't write a stitch of code

5002
02:45:12,959 --> 02:45:16,478
but i got a i had a pretty good mind for

5003
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:19,359
grasping

5004
02:45:16,478 --> 02:45:21,679
the business and and and cultural uh

5005
02:45:19,359 --> 02:45:23,359
significance of this transition

5006
02:45:21,680 --> 02:45:25,200
and this was again we were talking

5007
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:27,359
earlier about emerging areas

5008
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:29,279
within a few months you know i was in

5009
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:31,359
the relatively top echelon of people in

5010
02:45:29,279 --> 02:45:32,640
terms of just sheer experience

5011
02:45:31,359 --> 02:45:34,000
because like let's say it was five

5012
02:45:32,639 --> 02:45:35,439
months into the program there were only

5013
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,959
so many people who had been doing

5014
02:45:35,439 --> 02:45:38,960
world wide web stuff commercially for

5015
02:45:36,959 --> 02:45:41,358
five months you know and then

5016
02:45:38,959 --> 02:45:42,079
what was interesting though was the

5017
02:45:41,359 --> 02:45:44,479
intersection

5018
02:45:42,079 --> 02:45:46,478
of those two things the commercial web

5019
02:45:44,478 --> 02:45:49,519
as it turned out grew into

5020
02:45:46,478 --> 02:45:52,719
uh unbelievable vastness

5021
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:53,439
and so by being a pretty good okay web

5022
02:45:52,719 --> 02:45:56,559
person

5023
02:45:53,439 --> 02:45:58,559
and a pretty good okay mba person

5024
02:45:56,559 --> 02:46:00,639
that intersection put me in a very rare

5025
02:45:58,559 --> 02:46:03,760
group which was

5026
02:46:00,639 --> 02:46:05,840
web oriented mbas and

5027
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:07,600
in those early days you could probably

5028
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:08,799
count on your fingers

5029
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:10,159
the number of people who came out a

5030
02:46:08,799 --> 02:46:11,679
really competitive programs who were

5031
02:46:10,159 --> 02:46:12,639
doing stuff full-time on the internet

5032
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:15,200
and and

5033
02:46:12,639 --> 02:46:16,398
there was a greater appetite for great

5034
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:18,240
software developers

5035
02:46:16,398 --> 02:46:20,079
in the internet domain but there was an

5036
02:46:18,239 --> 02:46:23,199
appetite and a real one and a

5037
02:46:20,079 --> 02:46:26,000
rapidly growing one for mba

5038
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:26,800
thinkers who were also seasoned and

5039
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,478
networked

5040
02:46:26,799 --> 02:46:30,239
in the emerging world of the commercial

5041
02:46:28,478 --> 02:46:33,199
world wide web and so

5042
02:46:30,239 --> 02:46:33,840
finding an intersection of two things

5043
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:36,399
you can be

5044
02:46:33,840 --> 02:46:37,520
pretty good at but is a rare

5045
02:46:36,398 --> 02:46:40,318
intersection

5046
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:40,960
and a special intersection is probably a

5047
02:46:40,318 --> 02:46:42,398
much

5048
02:46:40,959 --> 02:46:44,799
easier way to make yourself

5049
02:46:42,398 --> 02:46:45,439
distinguishable and in demand from the

5050
02:46:44,799 --> 02:46:47,278
world

5051
02:46:45,439 --> 02:46:48,559
than trying to be world-class at this

5052
02:46:47,279 --> 02:46:50,720
one thing

5053
02:46:48,559 --> 02:46:52,000
so in the intersection is where there's

5054
02:46:50,719 --> 02:46:53,519
a to be discovered

5055
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:55,600
opportunity and success that's really

5056
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:57,200
interesting yeah there's actually more

5057
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:58,880
intersection of fields and fields

5058
02:46:57,200 --> 02:47:00,240
themselves right so

5059
02:46:58,879 --> 02:47:02,239
yeah i mean i'll give you kind of a

5060
02:47:00,239 --> 02:47:03,840
funny hypothetical here but it's one

5061
02:47:02,239 --> 02:47:05,600
i've been thinking about a little bit

5062
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:06,880
um there's a lot of people in crypto

5063
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:09,920
right now it'd be

5064
02:47:06,879 --> 02:47:10,559
hard to be in the top percentile of

5065
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:12,159
crypto

5066
02:47:10,559 --> 02:47:13,760
people whether it comes from just having

5067
02:47:12,159 --> 02:47:14,959
a sheer grasp of the industry a great

5068
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:16,478
network within the industry

5069
02:47:14,959 --> 02:47:17,519
technological skills whatever you want

5070
02:47:16,478 --> 02:47:19,840
to call it

5071
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:21,680
um and then there's this parallel world

5072
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:22,880
an orthogonal world called crop

5073
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:24,720
insurance

5074
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:26,478
and there's you know i'm sure that's a

5075
02:47:24,719 --> 02:47:26,799
big world crop insurance is a very very

5076
02:47:26,478 --> 02:47:28,398
big

5077
02:47:26,799 --> 02:47:30,079
deal particularly in the wealthy and

5078
02:47:28,398 --> 02:47:31,840
industrialized world where people

5079
02:47:30,079 --> 02:47:33,520
through sophisticated financial markets

5080
02:47:31,840 --> 02:47:35,120
rule of law and

5081
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:36,560
you know large agricultural concerns

5082
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:39,200
that are worried about that

5083
02:47:36,559 --> 02:47:41,039
um somewhere out there is somebody who

5084
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:42,560
is pretty crypto savvy but probably not

5085
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:44,880
top one percent

5086
02:47:42,559 --> 02:47:46,959
but also has kind of been in the crop

5087
02:47:44,879 --> 02:47:49,119
insurance world and understands that a

5088
02:47:46,959 --> 02:47:50,719
hell of a lot better than almost anybody

5089
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:52,079
who's ever had anything to do with

5090
02:47:50,719 --> 02:47:54,799
cryptocurrency

5091
02:47:52,079 --> 02:47:55,359
and so i think that um decentralized

5092
02:47:54,799 --> 02:47:58,159
finance

5093
02:47:55,359 --> 02:48:00,079
defy one of the interesting and i think

5094
02:47:58,159 --> 02:48:02,079
very world positive things that i think

5095
02:48:00,079 --> 02:48:03,200
it's almost inevitably we'll be bringing

5096
02:48:02,079 --> 02:48:05,920
to the world

5097
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:06,640
is crop insurance for small holding

5098
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:08,478
farmers

5099
02:48:06,639 --> 02:48:10,000
you know i mean people who have tiny

5100
02:48:08,478 --> 02:48:12,559
tiny plots of land

5101
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:14,478
in places like india etc where there is

5102
02:48:12,559 --> 02:48:15,920
no crop insurance available to them

5103
02:48:14,478 --> 02:48:17,599
because

5104
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:18,960
just the financial infrastructure

5105
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:21,120
doesn't exist

5106
02:48:18,959 --> 02:48:22,478
but it's highly imaginable that using

5107
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:25,279
oracle networks

5108
02:48:22,478 --> 02:48:27,119
that are trusted outside deliverers of

5109
02:48:25,279 --> 02:48:28,960
factual information about rainfall in a

5110
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:31,200
particular area you can start giving

5111
02:48:28,959 --> 02:48:32,879
drought insurance to folks like this

5112
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:35,680
the right person to come up with that

5113
02:48:32,879 --> 02:48:38,079
idea is not a crypto whiz

5114
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:39,840
who doesn't know a blasted thing about

5115
02:48:38,079 --> 02:48:41,279
small holding farmers the right person

5116
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:42,398
to come up with that is not a crop

5117
02:48:41,279 --> 02:48:44,399
insurance whiz

5118
02:48:42,398 --> 02:48:45,439
who isn't quite sure what bitcoin is but

5119
02:48:44,398 --> 02:48:47,840
somebody

5120
02:48:45,439 --> 02:48:50,079
occupies that intersection that's just

5121
02:48:47,840 --> 02:48:51,680
one of gazillion examples

5122
02:48:50,079 --> 02:48:54,000
of things that are going to come along

5123
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:55,359
for somebody who occupies the the right

5124
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,398
intersection of skills but isn't

5125
02:48:55,359 --> 02:48:58,239
necessarily

5126
02:48:56,398 --> 02:48:59,439
the number one person at either one of

5127
02:48:58,239 --> 02:49:01,680
those expertises

5128
02:48:59,439 --> 02:49:02,720
that's making me kind of wonder about my

5129
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:05,439
own little

5130
02:49:02,719 --> 02:49:05,840
things that i'm average at and seeing

5131
02:49:05,439 --> 02:49:07,760
were

5132
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:09,040
the intersections that could be

5133
02:49:07,760 --> 02:49:11,200
exploited

5134
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:12,720
that's pretty profound so we talked

5135
02:49:11,200 --> 02:49:14,479
quite a bit about

5136
02:49:12,719 --> 02:49:16,318
the end of the world and how we're both

5137
02:49:14,478 --> 02:49:19,358
optimistic about us

5138
02:49:16,318 --> 02:49:21,920
figuring our way out unfortunately

5139
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:24,000
for now at least both you and i are

5140
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:27,439
going to die one day

5141
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:31,520
way too soon

5142
02:49:27,439 --> 02:49:31,520
first of all that sucks it does

5143
02:49:32,478 --> 02:49:39,358
i mean one i'd like to

5144
02:49:35,840 --> 02:49:41,760
ask if you ponder your own mortality

5145
02:49:39,359 --> 02:49:43,279
how does that kind of um what kind of

5146
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:45,200
wisdom inside does it give you about

5147
02:49:43,279 --> 02:49:47,600
your own life

5148
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:48,720
and and broadly do you think about your

5149
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:50,960
life and

5150
02:49:48,719 --> 02:49:54,000
what the heck it's all about yeah with

5151
02:49:50,959 --> 02:49:56,639
respect to pondering mortality

5152
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:57,920
um i do try to do that as little as

5153
02:49:56,639 --> 02:49:59,199
possible because there's not a lot i can

5154
02:49:57,920 --> 02:50:01,680
do about it

5155
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:02,399
um but it's inevitably there and i think

5156
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:04,720
that

5157
02:50:02,398 --> 02:50:06,000
what it does when you think about it in

5158
02:50:04,719 --> 02:50:09,039
the right way

5159
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:11,200
is it makes you realize how

5160
02:50:09,040 --> 02:50:12,720
unbelievably rare and precious the

5161
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:14,960
moments that we have here

5162
02:50:12,719 --> 02:50:16,478
are and therefore how consequential the

5163
02:50:14,959 --> 02:50:17,358
decisions that we make about how to

5164
02:50:16,478 --> 02:50:20,639
spend our time

5165
02:50:17,359 --> 02:50:24,399
are you know like do you do those

5166
02:50:20,639 --> 02:50:26,318
17 nagging emails or do you have dinner

5167
02:50:24,398 --> 02:50:27,680
with somebody who's really important to

5168
02:50:26,318 --> 02:50:28,719
you who haven't seen in three and a half

5169
02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:30,880
years

5170
02:50:28,719 --> 02:50:32,159
if you had an infinite expanse of time

5171
02:50:30,879 --> 02:50:34,000
in front of you you

5172
02:50:32,159 --> 02:50:35,600
might well rationally conclude i'm going

5173
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,239
to do those emails because collectively

5174
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:38,640
they're rather

5175
02:50:36,239 --> 02:50:40,959
important and i have tens of thousands

5176
02:50:38,639 --> 02:50:42,799
of years to catch up with my buddy tim

5177
02:50:40,959 --> 02:50:45,519
but i think the scarcity of the time

5178
02:50:42,799 --> 02:50:48,159
that we have

5179
02:50:45,520 --> 02:50:48,560
helps us choose the right things if

5180
02:50:48,159 --> 02:50:51,119
we're

5181
02:50:48,559 --> 02:50:52,478
tuned to that and we're attuned to the

5182
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:54,560
context that mortality

5183
02:50:52,478 --> 02:50:55,679
puts over the consequence of every

5184
02:50:54,559 --> 02:50:57,278
decision we make

5185
02:50:55,680 --> 02:50:58,559
of how to spend our time that doesn't

5186
02:50:57,279 --> 02:51:00,319
mean that we're all very good at it

5187
02:50:58,559 --> 02:51:04,079
doesn't mean i'm very good at it

5188
02:51:00,318 --> 02:51:06,000
but it does add a dimension of choice

5189
02:51:04,079 --> 02:51:07,520
and significance to everything that we

5190
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:09,040
elect to do

5191
02:51:07,520 --> 02:51:10,560
it's kind of funny you say you try to

5192
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:11,920
think about it as little as possible i

5193
02:51:10,559 --> 02:51:14,000
would venture to say you probably think

5194
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:15,439
about the end of human civilization more

5195
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:17,520
than you do about your own life

5196
02:51:15,439 --> 02:51:19,040
you're probably right because that's it

5197
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:19,520
that feels like a problem that could be

5198
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:21,760
solved

5199
02:51:19,520 --> 02:51:22,880
right and whereas the end of my own life

5200
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:23,840
can't be solved

5201
02:51:22,879 --> 02:51:25,438
well i don't know i mean there's

5202
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:26,880
transhumanists who have incredible

5203
02:51:25,439 --> 02:51:28,880
optimism about

5204
02:51:26,879 --> 02:51:30,239
you know near or intermediate future

5205
02:51:28,879 --> 02:51:31,438
therapies that could really really

5206
02:51:30,239 --> 02:51:34,159
change human lifestyle

5207
02:51:31,439 --> 02:51:34,559
lifespan i really hope that they're

5208
02:51:34,159 --> 02:51:36,079
right

5209
02:51:34,559 --> 02:51:37,680
but i don't have a whole lot to add to

5210
02:51:36,079 --> 02:51:39,600
that project because i'm not a life

5211
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:42,079
scientist myself so

5212
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:44,239
i'm i'm in part also afraid of

5213
02:51:42,079 --> 02:51:47,600
immortality

5214
02:51:44,239 --> 02:51:49,439
not as much but close to as as i'm

5215
02:51:47,600 --> 02:51:52,000
afraid of death itself so

5216
02:51:49,439 --> 02:51:53,359
it feels it feels like the things that

5217
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:55,040
give us meaning

5218
02:51:53,359 --> 02:51:57,040
give us meaning because of the scarcity

5219
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:58,000
that surrounds it agreed i'm almost

5220
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:01,439
afraid

5221
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:03,439
of um of having too much of stuff

5222
02:52:01,439 --> 02:52:05,279
yeah although although if there was

5223
02:52:03,439 --> 02:52:08,559
something that said this can expand your

5224
02:52:05,279 --> 02:52:09,200
your enjoyable well spanned or life span

5225
02:52:08,559 --> 02:52:12,159
by

5226
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:13,200
75 years i'm all in well part of the

5227
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:16,959
reason i wanted to

5228
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:16,960
not do a startup

5229
02:52:17,359 --> 02:52:21,520
really the only thing that worries me

5230
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:24,880
about doing a startup

5231
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:26,399
is if it becomes successful because of

5232
02:52:24,879 --> 02:52:30,959
how much i dream how much

5233
02:52:26,398 --> 02:52:33,039
i'm driven to be successful that

5234
02:52:30,959 --> 02:52:35,519
there will not be enough silence in my

5235
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:38,240
life enough scarcity

5236
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:38,960
to appreciate the moments i appreciate

5237
02:52:38,239 --> 02:52:41,520
now

5238
02:52:38,959 --> 02:52:42,159
as deeply as i appreciate them now like

5239
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:45,120
yeah

5240
02:52:42,159 --> 02:52:47,359
there's a simplicity to my life now that

5241
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:52,000
it feels like you might disappear with

5242
02:52:47,359 --> 02:52:56,318
success i wouldn't say might um

5243
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:59,279
i think if you start a company that has

5244
02:52:56,318 --> 02:53:00,799
um ambitious investors ambitious for the

5245
02:52:59,279 --> 02:53:02,640
returns that they'd like to see

5246
02:53:00,799 --> 02:53:04,159
yeah that has ambitious employees

5247
02:53:02,639 --> 02:53:05,840
ambitions for

5248
02:53:04,159 --> 02:53:07,680
you know the career trajectories they

5249
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:10,799
want to be on and so forth

5250
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:14,000
um and is driven by

5251
02:53:10,799 --> 02:53:16,959
your own ambition uh there's a

5252
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:17,840
profound monogamy to that you know and

5253
02:53:16,959 --> 02:53:21,679
it is

5254
02:53:17,840 --> 02:53:24,000
it is very very hard to carve out time

5255
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:25,600
to be creative to be peaceful to be so

5256
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:28,000
forth because of

5257
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:30,399
you know with every new employee that

5258
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:32,879
you hire that's one more mouth to feed

5259
02:53:30,398 --> 02:53:35,039
with every new investor that you take on

5260
02:53:32,879 --> 02:53:36,159
that's one more person who to whom you

5261
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:38,240
really do want to

5262
02:53:36,159 --> 02:53:40,079
deliver great returns and as the

5263
02:53:38,239 --> 02:53:41,600
valuation ticks up

5264
02:53:40,079 --> 02:53:43,520
the threshold to delivering great

5265
02:53:41,600 --> 02:53:46,559
returns for your investors

5266
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:49,760
always rises and so there is

5267
02:53:46,559 --> 02:53:53,439
an extraordinary monogamy to being

5268
02:53:49,760 --> 02:53:55,840
a founder ceo um above all for

5269
02:53:53,439 --> 02:53:57,520
the first few years and first in

5270
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:58,159
people's minds could be as many as 10 or

5271
02:53:57,520 --> 02:54:01,439
15.

5272
02:53:58,159 --> 02:54:04,959
so but i i guess the the

5273
02:54:01,439 --> 02:54:07,680
the fundamental calculation is whether

5274
02:54:04,959 --> 02:54:08,959
the passion for the vision is greater

5275
02:54:07,680 --> 02:54:11,680
than the cost you'll pay

5276
02:54:08,959 --> 02:54:13,599
right it's all opportunity cost it's all

5277
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:15,439
opportunity cost

5278
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:18,239
in terms of time and attention and

5279
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:19,600
experience and some things like i'm i'm

5280
02:54:18,239 --> 02:54:21,279
everyone's different but i'm less

5281
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:23,520
calculating some things you just can't

5282
02:54:21,279 --> 02:54:25,680
help sometimes you just dive in

5283
02:54:23,520 --> 02:54:27,520
oh yeah i mean you can do balance beats

5284
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:28,800
all you want on this versus that and

5285
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:29,760
what's the right i mean i've done it in

5286
02:54:28,799 --> 02:54:32,398
the past and

5287
02:54:29,760 --> 02:54:34,000
it's never worked you know it's always

5288
02:54:32,398 --> 02:54:37,599
been like okay what's my gut screaming

5289
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:41,600
at me to do yeah but about the

5290
02:54:37,600 --> 02:54:44,720
the meaning of life you ever think about

5291
02:54:41,600 --> 02:54:46,800
about that yeah i mean this is not going

5292
02:54:44,719 --> 02:54:47,679
to go all hallmarking on you but i think

5293
02:54:46,799 --> 02:54:50,719
that

5294
02:54:47,680 --> 02:54:53,120
you know there's a few things and um

5295
02:54:50,719 --> 02:54:54,000
you know one of them is certainly love

5296
02:54:53,120 --> 02:54:57,279
and

5297
02:54:54,000 --> 02:55:00,398
the love that we experience and feel

5298
02:54:57,279 --> 02:55:01,680
and cause to well up in others is

5299
02:55:00,398 --> 02:55:05,278
something that's just

5300
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:08,559
so profound and goes beyond

5301
02:55:05,279 --> 02:55:11,120
almost anything else that we can do and

5302
02:55:08,559 --> 02:55:12,879
whether that is something that lies in

5303
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:13,680
the past like maybe there was somebody

5304
02:55:12,879 --> 02:55:16,799
that you

5305
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:18,960
were dating and loved very profoundly in

5306
02:55:16,799 --> 02:55:20,559
college and haven't seen in years

5307
02:55:18,959 --> 02:55:22,159
i don't think the significance of that

5308
02:55:20,559 --> 02:55:24,398
love is anyway diminished

5309
02:55:22,159 --> 02:55:25,439
by the fact that it had a notional

5310
02:55:24,398 --> 02:55:27,199
beginning and end

5311
02:55:25,439 --> 02:55:28,639
the fact is that you experienced that

5312
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:30,560
and you triggered that in somebody else

5313
02:55:28,639 --> 02:55:33,199
and that happened and

5314
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:34,719
it doesn't have to be certainly doesn't

5315
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:36,479
have to be love of romantic partners

5316
02:55:34,719 --> 02:55:37,760
alone it's family members it's love

5317
02:55:36,478 --> 02:55:39,840
between friends

5318
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:41,040
um it's love between creatures you know

5319
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:43,120
i

5320
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:44,160
had a dog for 10 years who passed away a

5321
02:55:43,120 --> 02:55:47,040
while ago and

5322
02:55:44,159 --> 02:55:47,439
you know experienced unbelievable love

5323
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:49,840
with

5324
02:55:47,439 --> 02:55:51,200
with her um it can be love of that which

5325
02:55:49,840 --> 02:55:53,040
you create and we were talking about the

5326
02:55:51,200 --> 02:55:55,520
flow states that we enter and

5327
02:55:53,040 --> 02:55:57,200
and the pride or lack of pride or the

5328
02:55:55,520 --> 02:55:59,040
minsky case your hatred of that which

5329
02:55:57,200 --> 02:56:02,240
you've done but nonetheless

5330
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:05,760
the the creations that we make

5331
02:56:02,239 --> 02:56:07,840
and whether it's the love or the joy or

5332
02:56:05,760 --> 02:56:11,040
the engagement or the perspective shift

5333
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:12,880
that that cascades into other minds

5334
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:14,240
i think that's a big big big part of the

5335
02:56:12,879 --> 02:56:16,559
meaning of life it's not something that

5336
02:56:14,239 --> 02:56:18,799
everybody participates in necessarily

5337
02:56:16,559 --> 02:56:20,478
although i think we all do you know at

5338
02:56:18,799 --> 02:56:23,119
least in a very local

5339
02:56:20,478 --> 02:56:25,438
level by you know the example that we

5340
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:28,399
set by the interactions that we have

5341
02:56:25,439 --> 02:56:28,960
but for people who create works that

5342
02:56:28,398 --> 02:56:31,519
travel

5343
02:56:28,959 --> 02:56:33,759
far and reach people they'll never meet

5344
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:36,079
that reach countries they'll never visit

5345
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:37,760
that reach people perhaps that come

5346
02:56:36,079 --> 02:56:39,359
along and come across their ideas or

5347
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:41,200
their works or their stories or

5348
02:56:39,359 --> 02:56:42,960
their aesthetic creations of other sorts

5349
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:45,600
long after they're dead

5350
02:56:42,959 --> 02:56:46,639
um i think that's really really big part

5351
02:56:45,600 --> 02:56:49,920
of the fabric of the

5352
02:56:46,639 --> 02:56:51,840
the meaning of life and um

5353
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:54,879
you know so all these things like you

5354
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:58,239
know love and creation

5355
02:56:54,879 --> 02:57:01,438
um i think really

5356
02:56:58,239 --> 02:57:03,600
is what it's all about and

5357
02:57:01,439 --> 02:57:05,359
part of love is also the loss of it

5358
02:57:03,600 --> 02:57:09,040
there's a louis

5359
02:57:05,359 --> 02:57:11,120
episode with louis c.k was a

5360
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:12,160
an old gentleman is giving him advice

5361
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:14,399
that this

5362
02:57:12,159 --> 02:57:15,760
this sometimes the sweetest parts of

5363
02:57:14,398 --> 02:57:18,079
love is when you

5364
02:57:15,760 --> 02:57:18,960
lose it and you remember it sort of you

5365
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:22,159
reminisce

5366
02:57:18,959 --> 02:57:23,839
on the loss of it and um

5367
02:57:22,159 --> 02:57:26,559
there's some aspect in which and i have

5368
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:30,239
many of those in my own life

5369
02:57:26,559 --> 02:57:32,159
that almost like the memories of it

5370
02:57:30,239 --> 02:57:33,600
and the intensity of emotion you still

5371
02:57:32,159 --> 02:57:36,799
feel about it

5372
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:39,359

from plato

5410
02:58:52,398 --> 02:58:55,519
we can easily forgive a child who's

5411
02:58:54,079 --> 02:58:58,559
afraid of the dark

5412
02:58:55,520 --> 02:59:00,640
the real tragedy of life is when men are

5413
02:58:58,559 --> 02:59:02,239
afraid of the light

5414
02:59:00,639 --> 02:59:14,079
thank you for listening and hope to see

5415
02:59:02,239 --> 02:59:14,079
