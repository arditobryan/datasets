1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,399
michael minna his second time on the

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:09,439
podcast he's a professor at harvard

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,960
doing research on infectious disease and

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:14,320
immunology

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,800
in my view the most powerful doable and

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,240
obvious solution to covet 19 from the

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,000
very beginning is rapid at-home testing

9
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:23,679
this is what michael has been talking

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,439
about and writing about since the

11
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,079
beginning of the pandemic

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,399
the accuracy of these tests is high for

13
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,159
the task of detecting contagiousness

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,238
which is what matters

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,879
hundreds of millions can be manufactured

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,519
quickly and relatively cheaply privacy

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,359
and individual freedoms are preserved i

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,120
believe that if you give people the

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,960
power of information

20
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,519
information about whether they are

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,320
contagious or not they will do the right

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,719
thing

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,960
at scale all while respecting their

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,600
freedom and minimizing the destructive

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,679
effects of the pandemic on our health

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,480
and our economy

27
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,399
the solution was obvious in may of 2020

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,959
it was obvious when michael and i spoke

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,840
the first time a year ago and it is

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:10,559
obvious today we talk about why it has

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,240
not yet been done and how we can still

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,840
do it this is the lex friedman podcast

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,239
and now here's my conversation with

36
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,840
michael minna

37
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:28,719
we spoke a year ago about rapid at-home

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,960
testing and i think you think

39
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,359
it should have been still should be a

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,478
big part of the solution to covid

41
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:40,640
so let's recap where do things stand

42
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,599
today in terms of rapid at home testing

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,079
well

44
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,000
it's a it's certainly something that uh

45
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,438
you're right i do think we should have

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,959
them today

47
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,919
we've now had almost

48
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:55,519
20 months of

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,200
living in anxiety uncertainty

50
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,359
uh being afraid for our health for our

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
family's health for our friends you know

52
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,959
shutdowns

53
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,280
economic instability everything has been

54
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,039
uncertain because this virus

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,199
and then there's this little test and

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,719
it's the first time for many people that

57
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,919
they are they're using it and they're

58
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,840
feeling

59
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,159
empowered they're feeling like they can

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,640
control their little slice

61
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,400
of this pandemic so

62
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,479
as these tests have come out and more

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,120
and more more americans have had an

64
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,799
opportunity to go and buy them from you

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,719
know cvs or walgreens or wherever

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
they're at

67
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,878
i think that it's really shifting the

68
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,640
tenor of the discussion

69
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:39,439
for a long time all of 2020 it was like

70
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:41,839
i often felt like it was me and a few

71
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,000
other people against the world you know

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,479
these tests should be public health

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,080
tools these tests are infectiousness

74
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,280
indicators they shouldn't be compared to

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,719
pcr

76
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
you know all of the these different

77
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,959
things and we could of course go through

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,239
and recap what those what the benefits

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,400
and the

80
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,920
metrics are that we should be looking at

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,480
but the point is

82
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,598
last year and most of this year

83
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,039
was about educating scientists educating

84
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,439
public health leaders educating

85
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,598
physicians

86
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,359
to get them to understand

87
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:15,598
that there is a different reason to test

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,680
in a pandemic than purely diagnostics

89
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,158
and transmission blockade and severing

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,439
transmission chains the big one so now

91
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,959
i think we're at a point where people

92
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,799
are now understanding and they're

93
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,640
understanding because they are feeling

94
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,760
it they're holding it and they're doing

95
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,759
it they're seeing they're feeling the

96
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,318
delight of seeing a negative

97
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,479
and saying i feel more comfortable it's

98
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:35,759
not perfect but it's pretty darn close

99
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,719
to perfect

100
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,679
to allowing me to go and see my mom

101
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,479
without mistakenly infecting her

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,799
you know or whatever the story might be

103
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,479
and now that that's happening i think

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,360
all of a sudden we're seeing a massive

105
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,919
change

106
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,840
politically for these tests

107
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,438
uh biden just came out the kova 19

108
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,759
action plan the other day and one of the

109
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,919
main pillars of it was testing and in

110
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,759
particular bringing rapid tests uh

111
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,199
scaling them up

112
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,280
so

113
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,119
on that front i think

114
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,959
finally there is success people are

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
actually understanding and

116
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,280
you know i haven't stopped beating this

117
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,438
drum

118
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,120
for far too long and i like hate rapid

119
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,680
tests now

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,358
so maybe it's good to step back uh

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,240
would you say most americans have not

122
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,319
taken a rapid home test absolutely most

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,280
have definitely not taken a rapid test

124
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,719
so like

125
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,679
many of them probably don't know they

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,680
kind of

127
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,478
probably say testing

128
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,240
they have like memories of testing like

129
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,000
pcr testing they have to go into

130
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,960
somewhere and they have to

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
like a

132
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,198
swab deep in their nose and that's the

133
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,280
experience so maybe when if you have to

134
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,960
travel like canada or something like

135
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,879
that you have to get tested that kind of

136
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:52,638
stuff so what are rapid at home tests

137
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:54,879
yeah so so the rapid at-home tests are

138
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,360
i like to call them paper strip tests

139
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,918
simple they're simple tests that i wish

140
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,319
i brought some today but i didn't um

141
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,279
they're simple tests that

142
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,079
uh

143
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,638
you

144
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,079
swab at the moment most of them use a

145
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,160
swab that you just swab the front of

146
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,599
your nose so it's not one of the deep

147
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,880
the deep swabs that you know goes into

148
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
your brain

149
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,399
and uh and so it's not very

150
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,478
uncomfortable it's just like picking

151
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,519
your nose if you'll you know and and you

152
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,279
you put that swab and

153
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,120
you put that swab into

154
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,279
a little tube

155
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,478
and the tube has some liquid in it and

156
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,638
then you

157
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,079
pour put a few drops of that liquid onto

158
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,879
a paper strip or you drop the paper

159
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,918
strip into the tube just like

160
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,959
one of those

161
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,879
indicators for the pool and if you dress

162
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,560
like a pregnancy test then if you get

163
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,159
two lines you're positive one line

164
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,560
you're negative

165
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,320
it's super simple it takes 30 seconds

166
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,560
once you know how to do it of hands-on

167
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,120
time and you wait around 10 minutes and

168
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,839
then you read the result

169
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,038
they are extraordinarily effective to

170
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,799
answer

171
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:03,439
one question am i infectious

172
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,079
and that is the public health question

173
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,439
that we need to answer and consistently

174
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,079
ask

175
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,918
during this pandemic are you infectious

176
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,639
am i infectious because it's only when

177
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,959
we know that we're infectious that we

178
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,280
can be empowered to not mistakenly

179
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,918
infect others

180
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,159
the pcr test is a little different

181
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,478
and we can go into

182
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,639
the pros and cons but

183
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,038
uh you know one of the the major

184
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,038
differences is that a pcr test

185
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:34,719
gets a lot of

186
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,800
a lot of people talking about the pcr

187
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,840
test say it's much more sensitive

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,720
and

189
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:45,119
at an analytical level it is it can

190
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,840
detect one molecule instead of a hundred

191
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,000
thousand

192
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,478
but for public health we don't want a

193
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,120
test that can detect one molecule in

194
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,639
fact that has created a net negative for

195
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,720
public health

196
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,960
we just want to know am i infectious and

197
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,680
to know that question to know if i'm

198
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,918
infectious i only need a test

199
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,680
that is going to be positive

200
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:08,879
if i have a high viral load like a

201
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,560
million

202
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,560
and when you're and the virus grows so

203
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,240
fast it will grow from zero to a billion

204
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,079
in a day

205
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,598
so you don't really need even on the

206
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,839
front end of an infection you don't need

207
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,360
better sensitivity

208
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,918
if the trade-off is that you don't get

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,639
the result for one two or three days you

210
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,560
absolutely want a rapid result

211
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,840
that can tell you yes you're infectious

212
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,759
you're transmitting to others right now

213
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,839
and i'm going to give you the results

214
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,000
right now so it is a much more effective

215
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,959
tool because it's fast because it's

216
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,319
accessible we can use them in the home

217
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,638
and there's some issues with using them

218
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,199
a home we can talk a little bit about

219
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,879
what those issues are like reporting and

220
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,319
how do you is everything on the honor

221
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,080
system if you have a test that you're

222
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,039
taking at home and you use it to go to

223
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,519
work

224
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,560
but they can be they can be accessible

225
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:00,079
pcr has to go into a lab it takes a lot

226
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,680
of time for somebody to get a pcr test

227
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,120
they either have to go online and order

228
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,079
it it takes the next day for it to come

229
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,680
back

230
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,959
they swab themselves they ship it out

231
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,199
the next day and then they get a result

232
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,959
two days later

233
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,038
that's four days minimum for the most

234
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,638
part and you know at that point you're

235
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,079
not even infectious even if you did

236
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,759
happen to be infectious when you first

237
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,598
ordered the test right

238
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,800
so it's really of the speed of these

239
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,639
tests and the accessibility and

240
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,038
distribution of them that makes them so

241
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,639
immensely powerful so this like amazing

242
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,598
graphic you tweeted

243
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,519
it's

244
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,598
exactly what you're saying which is a

245
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,079
rapid antigen test

246
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,158
answers the question am i currently

247
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,000
infectious and you have i think a

248
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,958
comparison of three different uh sorry

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,918
seven different tests based on the viral

250
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,158
load

251
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,360
and based on the viral load across these

252
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,039
different tests

253
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,879
you look at the likelihood of

254
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,879
infectiousness

255
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,958
so what is this graphic show we can

256
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,039
overlay that for people just i think

257
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,679
it's just really nice and really clear

258
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:00,000
yeah so what that's showing is that we

259
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,159
can never ask what's the sensitivity of

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,639
a test and just let that be the answer

261
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,799
that's what the fda does currently

262
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,958
and that question doesn't mean anything

263
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,599
we have to say what is the sensitivity

264
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,599
of the test to detect what right

265
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,759
and so we can have different viral loads

266
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,440
for example we can have

267
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,639
you can have a viral load of one or you

268
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,600
can have a viral load of a trillion and

269
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,519
a pcr test will tell tell you that you

270
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,080
are positive regardless of whether it's

271
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,720
one or a trillion

272
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,560
now so we can't ask the question how

273
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,879
sensitive is a rapid test compared to

274
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,079
pcr because that covers the whole gamut

275
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:38,080
what we really want to say is how

276
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,639
sensitive is the rapid test

277
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,519
to detect me if i am infectious

278
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,480
and that gets to about 97

279
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,600
or so

280
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,240
sensitive

281
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,920
if the question is how likely is it to

282
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,440
detect me if i'm a super spreader that's

283
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,719
a really important one to be able to

284
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,160
detect they're all about 100 sensitive

285
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,600
so if you have extraordinarily high

286
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,079
viral loads to the point where you might

287
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,480
be a super spreader these simple rapid

288
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,480
tests will essentially always catch you

289
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,159
and tell you you're positive

290
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,120
and then as you go down the line if

291
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,838
you're no longer infectious at all

292
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,639
then these rapid tests might have a zero

293
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,959
percent sensitivity compared to pcr but

294
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,639
that's actually a good thing the fda and

295
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,319
others look at it as though it's a bad

296
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,838
thing because they average it all

297
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,000
together and say oh

298
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,240
this is only a 40 sensitive test

299
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,320
compared to pcr

300
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,600
but that's not the right way to look at

301
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,200
it you want to say well out of all of

302
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,600
the samples how many of them were not

303
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,920
transmissible how many were mid moderate

304
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,278
high extremely high super spreader

305
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,479
and you should at the very least create

306
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,799
a weighted average based on

307
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,399
transmissibility potential

308
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,240
we don't do that you know and that's why

309
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,480
nobody in america has these tests

310
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,879
because that's why they're very rare

311
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,039
because we have slowed down their

312
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,958
authorization because of that

313
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:53,919
misunderstanding that they don't have to

314
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,319
be

315
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,399
80 or 90 sensitive compared to any time

316
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,040
pcr positivity

317
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,839
they need to be 80 or 90 or more if

318
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,679
you're infectious and for that question

319
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,760
they're like 95

320
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,838
up to 100 sensitive when you're most

321
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,639
infectious so you have a lot of iron

322
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,880
particles in you so i mean that's what

323
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,720
it means when you say viral load that

324
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,240
means you're going to be very infectious

325
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,560
the more you have the more infectious

326
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,919
you are and this test is

327
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,919
basically

328
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,759
very good at detecting when you're very

329
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,399
infectious

330
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,480
why don't we have

331
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,000
a rapid home test so you said there's a

332
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,399
bit of confusion

333
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,799
fda is involved you've talked about you

334
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,399
continue to talk about

335
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:40,719
that

336
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,799
these at-home tests are classified as i

337
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,959
guess medical devices that's right and

338
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:47,439
so because of that fda is looking at

339
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,759
them differently

340
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,959
then they probably should be looked at

341
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,120
so

342
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,039
what what's the problem here

343
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
can you can you sort of explain what

344
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,879
does it mean to be a medical device why

345
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,040
is that an issue where is the fda

346
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,360
messing up

347
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:05,360
when we declare something as a medical

348
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,759
device and we evaluate it as a medical

349
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,759
device then it makes sense that the

350
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,600
comparison if you're trying to get a new

351
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,360
one onto the market

352
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,440
that the comparison would be against a

353
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,120
gold standard medical device for that

354
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,800
purpose

355
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,200
so pcr

356
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,319
is currently the gold standard or at

357
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,040
least

358
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,519
in

359
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,360
the in the eyes of the fda the pcr test

360
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,679
is the gold standard

361
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,200
uh medical device

362
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,278
and as a physician that's because it's

363
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,720
so sensitive

364
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,399
as a physician

365
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,600
i have one patient in front of me at a

366
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,440
time

367
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,879
and that patient comes to me and i don't

368
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,920
have to care about the 99.9999

369
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,919
of people

370
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,599
in the world who are not

371
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,958
in front of me i only care about that

372
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,480
one patient

373
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:53,039
and so when i get a sample from that

374
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,639
patient and that patient's saying doc

375
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,919
you know i don't feel well i haven't

376
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,919
been feeling well for the last few weeks

377
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,719
do you think this is covid

378
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:04,078
well for that question i want to have

379
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,519
the absolute best sensitivity test

380
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,519
regardless of what it means for

381
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,519
transmissibility because my patient

382
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,440
isn't sitting in my office saying doc do

383
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,959
you think i'm infectious

384
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,680
they're saying doc do you think i have

385
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,278
recently been or am infected

386
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,078
and these are totally different things

387
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:19,360
one

388
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,599
is medicine

389
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,120
and if the patient's infected you know i

390
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,560
the time isn't of the essence because

391
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,519
they're sitting there in my office i can

392
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,278
say look

393
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,519
i'm sorry you're not feeling well let's

394
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,200
get a pcr test on you we'll be able to

395
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,919
tell you if you have any

396
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,920
evidence that there has been recently an

397
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,599
infection inside of you

398
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,039
and you'll get the result in a couple

399
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,278
days

400
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,039
and it might be expensive and so

401
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,120
insurance is going to pay for it and

402
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,799
you're just one person and so i don't

403
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,959
really care how many resources it takes

404
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,559
to get you this answer

405
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,000
on the other hand

406
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:55,039
there's rapid there's public health

407
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,600
testing and public health testing is

408
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,360
it has to account for all of the people

409
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,879
you're not seeing as well as the person

410
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,399
you're testing at the moment so

411
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:06,320
accessibility becomes a central theme

412
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,759
frequency of tests it has to account for

413
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,680
all the days that you're not sitting

414
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,919
there in front of your doctor's office

415
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,078
getting a test as well as the one you

416
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,679
are so it has to say how frequently what

417
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,278
if you're infected tomorrow but you're

418
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,039
at the doctor's office today getting a

419
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,198
negative covet test

420
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,039
that pcr test at the doctor's office

421
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,879
today is going to do nothing

422
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,958
to let you know that you get exposed and

423
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,399
infected tomorrow the only way to know

424
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,159
that is to be testing yourself

425
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,519
frequently

426
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,439
so

427
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,919
and the the reason it matters is

428
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,480
that these tests can be accessible if we

429
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,000
are okay with saying the real purpose of

430
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,440
a of a

431
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,519
public health test is to answer the

432
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,120
question am i infectious

433
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,480
the reason we want to answer that is if

434
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,679
you're infectious that's when you

435
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,399
isolate

436
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:54,239
we actually don't want to isolate

437
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,399
positive pcr pcr-positive individuals

438
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,440
who are no longer infectious

439
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,958
that's bad public health practice like

440
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,399
if i haven't been infectious for three

441
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,759
weeks i don't want to have somebody tell

442
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,000
me that i need to

443
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,159
go and isolate for 10 days just because

444
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,799
i happen to use a pcr test

445
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,679
today three weeks after i was infectious

446
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,919
and furthermore i definitely don't want

447
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,599
the public health agency to come and you

448
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,879
know round up all the people i was with

449
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,079
last night and so you guys have to

450
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,919
quarantine

451
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,399
for 14 days because you were with

452
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:27,039
michael who wasn't infectious yesterday

453
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,879
it's nonsensical to do that

454
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,799
it's a huge disincentive to actually get

455
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,799
tested that's exactly right huge

456
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,240
disincentive to get tested people you

457
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,799
know if it's too sensitive especially

458
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,560
with flights things like that like

459
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,399
we shouldn't be stopping people from

460
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:44,000
taking a flight if they haven't been

461
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,000
infectious for 60 days and to be clear

462
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,679
people are only infectious for i don't

463
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,879
know somewhere between three and seven

464
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,838
days

465
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,759
but can be positive on a pcr test for

466
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,519
30 to 70 days

467
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,600
so i mean it's it's potentially a

468
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,278
tenfold difference in terms of how long

469
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
your pc are positive

470
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,360
versus how long you're infectious

471
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,680
so we don't want to be taking people

472
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,360
during those 30 to 70 days and saying

473
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,439
you need to isolate just because you go

474
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,519
and get a swab or you can't go on your

475
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,639
trip just because you had covered last

476
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,480
month

477
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,480
that's not good use of a test

478
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,439
so the reason we don't have these tools

479
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:24,399
right now is because

480
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,079
when we evaluate an ant a rapid test as

481
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,919
a medical device

482
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,239
the fda says

483
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:32,958
well this has to achieve the properties

484
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,399
that we expect from a medical device

485
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,399
which again

486
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,159
doesn't have to take time into account

487
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,240
doesn't really have to take cost or

488
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,480
resources or scalability or access into

489
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,639
account it only takes sensitivity and

490
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,639
specificity to catch molecules

491
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,000
and so just

492
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,199
by definition i mean it is a

493
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,600
mathematical fact you know that that if

494
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,120
you have a perfect public health test

495
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,040
for covid which means that it would be

496
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,198
100 sensitive

497
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:04,240
and 100 specific

498
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:07,759
for contagious people or for the

499
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,480
infectious stage of an infection

500
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:13,919
then it literally can't it is an

501
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:17,519
impossibility for that test to achieve

502
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,520
an 80 sensitivity at a population level

503
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,759
against a medical device which is what

504
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:24,798
the fda asks for and that's because

505
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,000
you're only infectious for maybe 20

506
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,160
so

507
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,519
theoretically it should only have a 20

508
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,600
sensitivity

509
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,160
against the pcr while still being a

510
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,480
perfect medical a perfect public health

511
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,000
test and the test is answering the

512
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,240
question am i infectious that's what

513
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,240
you're testing for not for the exact

514
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,079
counting of the viron particles in your

515
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,279
system that's that's exactly right okay

516
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,639
so what

517
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,798
why

518
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,679
are we still here

519
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:54,960
so have you had conversations with folks

520
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,400
you said that there's a bunch of um

521
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,558
leaders that are kind of starting to

522
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,480
wake up to this idea but why is this

523
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,240
taking this so long

524
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,319
why don't we still have hundreds of

525
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:10,160
millions of at home tests

526
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:13,279
the reason it's taking long i think is

527
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,480
because every agency and government

528
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,399
is generally deferential to the fda and

529
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,120
in this context

530
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,000
i would argue that government hasn't

531
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,798
been particularly creative

532
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,480
so for example last year trump was still

533
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:29,679
president i would or or in the

534
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,279
transition

535
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,679
and i i recall talking to the white

536
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,000
house a number of times and saying

537
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,200
here's a plan to give us our lives back

538
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,079
i think that was actually the title of

539
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,798
the atlantic article you know and

540
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,038
this plan can stop shutdowns it can it

541
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,359
can stop outbreaks it can allow society

542
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,599
to keep running and could have

543
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,319
prevented the outbreaks of last winter

544
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,399
and

545
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,399
fall and saved hundreds of thousands of

546
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,720
lives

547
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,759
so when i bring that to the white house

548
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,839
or to the government of federal

549
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:02,000
government whoever it might be and i say

550
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,918
here's a plan like this this would work

551
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,160
they say you know what i get back is

552
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,320
this sounds really interesting michael

553
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,080
uh it looks like it checks out but

554
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,918
there's one problem we don't have the

555
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,519
test there's no scale

556
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,120
and that's kind of where it all dropped

557
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,240
it's like this defeatist attitude of

558
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,558
like oh don't have the test so

559
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,400
so we can't act on it but now it's

560
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:23,678
really changing

561
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,120
well and so that's really where things

562
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,720
have been and so nobody's paid attention

563
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,599
it's always been this like esoteric

564
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,440
thing

565
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,119
that yeah maybe one day we'll get around

566
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,679
to it but really it's not that important

567
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:36,399
and the pandemic's going away but

568
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,720
this was like 100 predictable everything

569
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,480
that's happening today we predicted it

570
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,160
last year you know it's not this isn't

571
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,679
like rocket science or the variance and

572
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,160
all those kinds of things

573
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,038
so the fda we can start to understand

574
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,320
why but also like

575
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,200
one question i want to ask is it

576
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:57,279
possible to go around the fda yeah

577
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,279
so why has the fda not changed

578
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,279
and why has nobody tried to push the fda

579
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,600
to change like

580
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,440
the i think what the real reason is the

581
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,158
fda

582
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,240
has one job around these tests and it is

583
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,400
to authorize them as medical devices

584
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,919
they haven't been charged with doing

585
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,240
anything else

586
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,720
so in their eyes they're doing exactly

587
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,558
what they're supposed to do

588
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,240
they're evaluating these tests as

589
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,158
medical devices and they're telling

590
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,558
company after company after company

591
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,080
sorry you don't make the cut

592
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,678
and the only way to make the cut is

593
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,599
really to kind of skew your clinical

594
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,840
trials to favor

595
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,359
the rapid test being positive which

596
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:39,038
isn't really good practice we shouldn't

597
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,479
be trying to skew clinical trials

598
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,558
but that's kind of what's happened

599
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,400
that's been it's been forced upon the

600
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,440
companies to do that

601
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,360
and so

602
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,558
i think the fda truly believes from the

603
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,558
bottom of their heart that they are

604
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,038
doing the right thing here

605
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:56,240
and i would argue that to an extent they

606
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,720
are i've been pretty hard on the fda but

607
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,480
maybe the issue is a higher level issue

608
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,839
like the the in vitro diagnostics

609
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,599
division is

610
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:04,798
they get applications and they evaluate

611
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,798
them and the applications are for

612
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,639
medical claims

613
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,200
that's however because there's been a

614
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,759
misunderstanding of these tests and the

615
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,279
companies only know to apply for these

616
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,119
as medical claims

617
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:18,879
because there is no

618
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,719
there's nothing else in this country to

619
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,400
apply for

620
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,240
except the medical claim

621
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,798
so we we don't have a public health

622
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,279
pathway to evaluate a test and authorize

623
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,519
a test it doesn't exist we have

624
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,200
defunded and devalued public health for

625
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,798
so long

626
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,440
that we literally don't have a language

627
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,440
for it we don't have laws a language

628
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,600
words is it called a public health test

629
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,400
is it called something else i call it a

630
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,480
public health test because i'm trying to

631
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,320
create a new definition here

632
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,000
but that's why

633
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,200
that's why nobody's acted because no

634
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,119
because everyone says well there's no

635
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,279
other pathway so the fda

636
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,918
in vitro medical diagnostics division is

637
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,960
the only pathway so what i am trying to

638
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,200
do

639
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,240
is to say look

640
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,919
the fda very clearly states

641
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,000
that they do not authorize or review

642
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,440
public health tools

643
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,200
and not and they don't authorize or

644
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,159
review public health tests for for covid

645
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,640
so

646
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,760
what i want the president of the united

647
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,640
states to do is to utilize executive

648
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,279
powers and take an executive action that

649
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,280
can simply state like one line one line

650
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,960
could potentially

651
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,200
change all of this

652
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,279
and it's a pretty obvious and simple

653
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,200
line and it is that

654
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,960
any tools

655
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,038
used for public health

656
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,798
testing during this public health

657
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,640
emergency

658
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,918
will be designated as public health

659
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,919
tools

660
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,520
like it's obvious like it's public

661
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,200
health emergency it's a tool used for

662
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,279
public health it should be designated as

663
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,600
a public health tool

664
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:58,158
if we can do that if we can get that

665
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,918
language out there so that that's the

666
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,840
president's decision

667
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,880
then all of a sudden the fda is off the

668
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,678
hook

669
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,679
they're not trying to to cram a square

670
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,960
peg through a round hole

671
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,640
they can say look the antigen tests are

672
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,319
not on us anymore at least if they're

673
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,840
going to be used for public health like

674
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,279
when you test a thousand people at a

675
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,918
time or

676
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,000
test a school a school classroom if

677
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,159
they've been exposed this is public

678
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,038
health and so then the cdc could take it

679
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,440
over

680
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,359
the cdc could say okay

681
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,240
what are the metrics we are interested

682
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,599
in

683
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,038
and they could say we're interested in a

684
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:34,959
test that can catch you if you're

685
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,158
infectious so you want high viral load

686
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,000
detection that's fast that's scalable

687
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,080
and hey you know if your test has been

688
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,919
used in europe for months and has

689
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,759
performed extremely well

690
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,559
then then we'll give you a certificate

691
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,798
by right you know immediately and that

692
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,558
could actually get

693
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,038
hundreds of millions of additional tests

694
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,798
into the united states tomorrow

695
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,038
so you need some kind of classification

696
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,879
from an fda from somebody to call it a

697
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,278
public health tool in order for it to be

698
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,440
manufactured is it possible to just go

699
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,759
around all of this and just for somebody

700
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,960
to manufacture at scale

701
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:09,759
tests

702
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,159
well

703
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:13,679
you if you did that and you just called

704
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,960
them you put a claim on them that called

705
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,200
them public health tools

706
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,278
the fda has a very

707
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,880
weird view of this and they will tell

708
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:27,200
you that it's illegal that it's a crime

709
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,480
is there a way to say like elon musk did

710
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,960
with the flamethrower it's not a

711
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,278
flamethrower yeah

712
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,240
uh believe me i've tried i've tried to

713
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,759
think of all the different approaches um

714
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,919
you know there's weird there's like

715
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,440
there's major inconsistencies here so

716
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,960
it's not like we don't have a precedent

717
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,798
for a public health test even during

718
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,120
this pandemic

719
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,119
there is a very strong precedent

720
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,199
uh pooled testing

721
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,959
we have companies like ginkgo right

722
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,240
based out here in cambridge

723
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,120
that are

724
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,038
uh

725
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,719
you know working with 100 different labs

726
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,480
around the country so that might mean

727
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,000
like not a ton of quality control over

728
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,200
those labs

729
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,640
doing

730
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,240
uh i mean i don't want to say that they

731
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,000
don't i'm just saying the reality is if

732
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,919
you're working with that many labs it's

733
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,200
hard to say they're running pooled

734
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,640
testing

735
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,038
of millions and millions millions of

736
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,919
kids

737
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:19,278
so here you have a company that's

738
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,880
testing

739
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:25,200
in each pool five to 25 kids at a time

740
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,480
millions of kids in a pretty distributed

741
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,480
way across the country and all these

742
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,400
different labs

743
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,240
and the fda doesn't care at all you

744
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,159
don't need any ua it doesn't need a

745
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,839
regulatory authority

746
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,880
it's collection on site it's getting

747
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,158
shipped to a lab there's no oversight of

748
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,400
it

749
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,039
so why does that have no oversight but a

750
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,320
rapid test for pub for the exact same

751
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,679
purpose

752
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,759
you're just giving people immediate

753
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,000
results instead of two-day delayed

754
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:53,759
pooled pcr results so it's a much more

755
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,919
effective tool

756
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,960
why is the rapid test used for the same

757
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,720
purpose

758
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,240
not designated as a public health tool

759
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,400
but requiring

760
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,120
fda authorization

761
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,759
it's a ridiculous reason

762
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,519
and it's because the fda says that if a

763
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,519
test

764
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,599
and this is actually cms that says this

765
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:17,200
and then the fda adopts it

766
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:19,599
if a test alters your

767
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,840
behavior if you get a single result and

768
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,359
it's going to alter your behavior

769
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,399
then that is a medical device

770
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,399
but

771
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,320
the thing that i find ridiculous is like

772
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,840
okay but you can give a pooled test that

773
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,759
alters 25 people's behavior at once

774
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,759
and that's not falling like that's more

775
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,400
risky one person turns positive in the

776
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,558
pool and 25 people have to be

777
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,038
quarantined

778
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,720
and uh how do they evaluate the accuracy

779
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,599
so for people who don't know a pooled

780
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,839
test

781
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,759
is you're testing a small fraction of

782
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,480
the people

783
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,200
and

784
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,798
if one of them is positive then you

785
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,880
basically say we have to retest

786
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:01,200
everybody in the pool or like you yeah

787
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,039
so you take let's say you have a school

788
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,278
and each classroom you might have 20

789
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,879
kids each swab their nose in a classroom

790
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,000
and all those swabs go into a single

791
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,679
tube

792
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,919
and then you rinse that tube out with

793
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,679
some saline and you run a pcr test on

794
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,919
that tube of 25 samples or 20 samples

795
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,679
and so if that tube turns positive in

796
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,120
the pcr test

797
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:25,759
then all 20 or 25 of those students

798
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,479
are now having to quarantine yeah and if

799
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,079
there's no positive then all 20 or 25

800
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,000
students are

801
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,199
interpreting that their result is

802
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,159
negative

803
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,880
you know so it really is ridiculous

804
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,039
decision by the fda to say that

805
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,720
if the test itself only tests one sample

806
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,720
at a time it's medicine

807
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,480
because it will tell you one person at a

808
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,640
time if you're positive or if you're

809
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,240
negative but if you do it as a pool and

810
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,159
you and you

811
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,079
tell 25 people that your pool was

812
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,679
negative

813
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,918
then that's somehow different that's

814
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,679
public health not medicine it it doesn't

815
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,159
make there's no logic there was it just

816
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,159
personalities and accidents of history

817
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,600
or something like that for example

818
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,320
you talk about the

819
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,439
public health tools and cdc you look at

820
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,079
masks

821
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,519
so masks were decided to somehow be an

822
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,319
effective tool

823
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:19,200
to help with the pandemic like so i'm

824
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,439
sure the evidence that was used there

825
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,000
was probably not as strong as the

826
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,038
evidence supporting antigen rapid tests

827
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,798
i was

828
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:29,519
very much reading a lot of research on

829
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,839
masks it's tricky it's really tricky to

830
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,440
show how well they stop the transmission

831
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,038
of a virus especially when you don't

832
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,360
fully understand how the virus is

833
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,599
transmitted or the viral load required

834
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:42,000
all that kind of stuff but then the cdc

835
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,599
pretty quickly decided masks or whatever

836
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,919
there's some oscillations back and forth

837
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:49,519
but then they quickly decided all

838
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,520
everybody decided masks is a good tool

839
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,398
so masks being decided a good tool and

840
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,038
then

841
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:57,678
rapid antigen tests not a good tool is

842
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:59,519
that just like certain personalities who

843
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,360
didn't speak up in a meeting or who did

844
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,119
speak up in a meeting is this just like

845
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,879
a weird role of the dice or is there a

846
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,439
better explanation

847
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,720
i think it's somewhat of a roll the dice

848
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,519
but i also think it's that testing

849
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,440
so

850
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,839
doctors

851
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,840
don't pretend to like really understand

852
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,398
much about like

853
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,079
fluid dynamics and you know how well

854
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:23,678
masks are working like that's like way

855
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,960
out of their realm

856
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,840
doctors

857
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,319
do believe that they understand all

858
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:33,359
aspects of the tests right

859
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:37,918
and so the greatest barriers to rapid

860
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:40,558
tests being brought to market or sort of

861
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,679
being being rolled out heavily and

862
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:45,440
supported as public health tools

863
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,679
uh the greatest barriers came from

864
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,840
physicians saying

865
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,480
hell no we can't use a test that's not

866
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:53,678
as sensitive as a pcr

867
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,079
and

868
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,798
look at what happens if you use this

869
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,678
antigen test and not a pcr test you get

870
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,918
people

871
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,000
who are showing a positive on a pcr

872
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,640
negative on an antigen

873
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,880
and they just assume that that was a

874
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,559
false negative on the antigen

875
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,919
for public health i would call it a

876
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:16,079
false positive on the pcr test but this

877
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,720
type of thinking

878
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,398
literally does not exist in medicine and

879
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,360
i think the biggest problem here is that

880
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,319
we

881
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,439
placed physicians in decision making

882
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,960
power

883
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,519
we have

884
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,319
won this pandemic hit everyone called up

885
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,839
clinical uh laboratory folks and

886
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:35,359
microbiologists

887
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,000
and physicians to ask well what kind of

888
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:40,879
tests should we use that kind of thing

889
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,720
and there is no training in medical

890
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,520
school for this kind of public health

891
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,919
work like uh you have to optimize on the

892
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:51,038
right qualities of a test

893
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,679
that have nothing to do with medicine

894
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,359
and then sometimes if not frequently

895
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,278
they're actually at odds and i'll give

896
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,798
an example

897
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:00,240
why the physicians you could see why the

898
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,079
physicians would have been against it

899
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,839
from their perspective

900
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:07,038
and they say uh if a physician is a tsa

901
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,480
agent

902
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:11,200
at the airport

903
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,640
you know a tsa agent their role at any

904
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,919
given time

905
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,919
and the role they think that the

906
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,480
instruments need to play is i want you

907
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,080
to scan the bag as well as possible this

908
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,759
is the only bag that i'm interested in

909
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:25,519
at the moment

910
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,960
and this is my lane this is my bag

911
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,480
i want to make sure that my instrument's

912
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,759
doing i don't want the crappy instrument

913
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,798
in my lane i want to make sure that i'm

914
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,798
doing everything i can but

915
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:36,720
what those tsa agents don't have to

916
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,480
worry about is well how many other

917
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,159
instruments are there in this airport is

918
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,679
anyone getting through

919
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,440
the lines here without going through

920
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,720
security the average tsa agent doesn't

921
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,640
have to worry about that they literally

922
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,640
have one job to do and it's pay

923
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,038
attention to this lane

924
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,038
if there's a big gap in the security

925
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:54,960
line and people are flowing through

926
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,558
without going through security that's

927
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,440
not on the tsa agent that's not a big

928
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,798
systematic problem of that of of the the

929
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,600
system

930
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,440
and we can't expect that tsa agent to

931
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,959
have ever even thought about that like

932
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,440
that's not on them they were trained to

933
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,079
look at a to look at the bag

934
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,919
and that's kind of like physicians

935
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,278
and i you know probably some physicians

936
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,360
will hear this and feel like i'm

937
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,798
insulting it i don't mean to be liking

938
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,558
you know the two professions and or

939
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,480
anything like that i what but the point

940
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,278
is is that

941
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,480
a physician has one duty do no harm to

942
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,359
this patient

943
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,399
time isn't of the essence scale how many

944
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:35,038
tests can my hospital perform in a day

945
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:37,359
how many tests can my county or country

946
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,440
perform in a day that's not a

947
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,119
physician's training to think like that

948
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,759
at all

949
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:46,239
and so what has happened is doctors got

950
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,759
on board early and said oh hell no we've

951
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,519
seen these antigen tests before they're

952
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,919
not particularly sensitive compared to

953
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,000
pcr and and early in the pandemic there

954
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,960
was like pissing matches between labs

955
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,159
who had the most sensitive pcr

956
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,798
and it just

957
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,440
distracted everything it really i was

958
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,359
trying to say pretty early like

959
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,360
we don't need sensitivity we just need

960
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,519
frequency we just need scale we need to

961
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,879
think differently because our only goal

962
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,798
if we're doing

963
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,600
frequent routine testing of asymptomatic

964
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:15,440
people

965
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,879
is not medicine it's to say do you need

966
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,960
to isolate now

967
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,600
and if you have a pcr test that's taking

968
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,600
three days to return and you're like if

969
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,278
i was currently spreading virus before i

970
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,879
walked in here

971
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:28,960
and you handed me this actually happened

972
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,799
to me today when i walked into harvard

973
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,079
today was my first day back into harvard

974
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:36,558
since february of 2020. i go in i

975
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,960
scan my badge and they they hand me a

976
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:40,720
pcr tube and they says they say like

977
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,399
return this you know by

978
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,600
noon or something before you before your

979
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,079
work day's done

980
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:48,079
and i'm looking at it i'm like

981
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,000
what is this going to do like what if

982
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,759
i'm super spreader right now yeah you're

983
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,919
giving me free reign to walk around and

984
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,519
infect everyone in the school

985
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,519
and you're gonna give me my result to

986
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,399
tell me i did that in two days from now

987
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,319
it doesn't doesn't really make sense so

988
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,319
who is supposed to be so it's

989
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:07,678
understandable that doctors kind of feel

990
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,039
that way just like you said do no harm

991
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,280
who's supposed to

992
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,440
care about public health

993
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,519
is it the fda is there some other

994
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,440
organization yet to be created

995
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,000
is it like uh just like with the

996
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,720
military the reason we have civilian

997
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,878
leadership when when you talk about war

998
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,838
is it the president that's supposed to

999
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:29,118
do like override fda override doctors

1000
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:30,719
override

1001
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,838
and basically politicians in

1002
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,519
representing the people in the state of

1003
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:37,519
emergency make big public health

1004
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,759
decisions like who is supposed to do it

1005
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,878
besides you on twitter

1006
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,720
it's like

1007
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,639
most people really thinking about

1008
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,838
solutions to kovid

1009
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,159
we'll mention you or will mention this

1010
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:53,519
idea of rapid home testing

1011
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,280
and it's it's you watch that happening

1012
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,719
this discussion that this is an obvious

1013
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,000
part of the solution and the solution is

1014
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,000
not happening

1015
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,199
so who is supposed to implement this

1016
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,280
idea

1017
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:04,078
i think the cdc that it should start

1018
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,000
there

1019
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,359
override the fda

1020
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,199
well i don't even think it needs to

1021
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:10,960
override it and that's why i think these

1022
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,159
should just be designated as a different

1023
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,760
tool

1024
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,399
so that the company is it's not

1025
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,599
overriding it's just saying look this

1026
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,240
isn't even this isn't in your

1027
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,039
jurisdiction to the fda this is just a

1028
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,399
a public health tool but the problem is

1029
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,519
the centers for medicaid medicare

1030
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,280
services designates any tool just like

1031
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,599
fda they designate these as medical

1032
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,599
devices purely because they could change

1033
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,440
somebody's behavior based on the result

1034
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,680
of one test

1035
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,000
so to change that at this point unless

1036
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,078
you get cms buy-in you know we don't

1037
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,358
have there is no designation as a public

1038
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,760
health tool

1039
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,279
but the president

1040
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,960
can just say

1041
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,960
these are public health tools these are

1042
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,280
not to be

1043
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,519
regulated as medical devices if their

1044
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,200
goal is not medicine but public health

1045
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,079
and if he does it he does have the

1046
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:00,879
authority to do that as president and to

1047
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,440
say

1048
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,160
i'm tasking the cdc

1049
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,639
to certify these tests or or authorize

1050
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,159
them for use in the united states and

1051
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:12,480
you know he has to say something like

1052
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,358
that he can't come out and say these are

1053
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,760
public health tools have free reign

1054
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:18,960
just you know any company start start

1055
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,960
shipping them in the us because that

1056
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,720
would create pandemonia and we'd have a

1057
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,199
lot of bad tests

1058
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:28,159
but there's a lot of really good tests

1059
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:30,719
out there we just are taking like 6 to

1060
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,838
12 months to run trials they're failing

1061
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,039
because they can't keep up with pcr

1062
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:36,480
and

1063
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,159
if the president were to do this then

1064
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,358
the cdc could take it over and they

1065
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,078
could say okay

1066
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:44,319
it's on us we're going to decide

1067
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,320
the uk actually did this they

1068
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,160
early on they said okay

1069
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,000
they laid out a very clear regimen they

1070
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,279
said this is how we are going to

1071
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,280
evaluate

1072
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,680
rapid antigen tests because they're

1073
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,119
public health tools they did it in a in

1074
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:59,199
a domain that was outside of their

1075
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,400
normal medical diagnostic regulatory

1076
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,039
agencies

1077
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,599
and they they literally just had

1078
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:08,400
a very fast screening to say what are

1079
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,760
the best tests they went through a huge

1080
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,519
number of different tests they said okay

1081
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,359
these are the this is the rank order of

1082
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,920
which tests are good which are bad which

1083
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,920
are scalable which are not

1084
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,720
and they were able to start deploying

1085
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,800
them in weeks not years so i think the

1086
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:26,159
cdc really needs to take charge the

1087
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,640
problem is when it comes to like law

1088
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,440
if everyone currently perceives this as

1089
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,279
like

1090
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,440
fully within the domain of the fda and

1091
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,400
they've never heard of such an uh public

1092
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,679
health

1093
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,480
test idea enable it but but the fda

1094
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,879
itself has created the idea by saying we

1095
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,639
don't regulate public health tools

1096
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,358
so the word is out there the fda has

1097
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:49,519
said we don't regulate them so that

1098
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,799
gives the president an opportunity to

1099
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,480
say okay

1100
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,519
these are those you know these are

1101
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,440
public health tools by definition

1102
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,358
and and i do think that this is a kind

1103
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,760
of a crisis and it's a crisis of testing

1104
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:02,719
but it's also a crisis of like

1105
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,320
really we're going to go through this

1106
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:05,519
whole pandemic and never figure this

1107
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,079
thing out

1108
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:09,838
that's just really sad you know if we

1109
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,400
get through this and don't figure out

1110
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:13,199
how to evaluate a damn rapid test

1111
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,200
so

1112
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:18,559
how do vaccines

1113
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:21,598
play with this so one of the things that

1114
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,838
when people discuss solutions to covid

1115
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,400
there's a sense that

1116
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,719
once you have a vaccine kova dissolved

1117
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,559
so how does that interplay

1118
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:33,439
like why do we still need tests if we

1119
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,199
have vaccines yeah i am i actually wrote

1120
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,280
an op-ed in

1121
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,358
new york times or wall street journal or

1122
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,480
something that was titled why we still

1123
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,920
need rapid tests with with vaccines

1124
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,240
and

1125
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,800
the real reason is because we have

1126
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:50,879
evaluated our vaccines based on their

1127
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,320
ability to stop disease

1128
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,800
in fact most of the trials didn't

1129
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,559
evaluate them based on their ability to

1130
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,119
stop transmission

1131
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:00,880
they didn't even evaluate that at all no

1132
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,960
less put it as one of the metrics for

1133
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,000
authorization

1134
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,240
and

1135
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,559
with a virus like this it would be a bit

1136
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:12,000
naive to think that it's really going to

1137
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,000
stop transmission well

1138
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,320
i think a lot of excitement happened

1139
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:18,000
right after the first clinical trials

1140
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,280
and i'm sure we were talking about it

1141
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,039
when when i was last here i would

1142
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,640
imagine given the timing

1143
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,920
but those first clinical trials came out

1144
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,279
and everyone

1145
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,200
you know jumped for joy that these

1146
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,560
things were going to be the the end to

1147
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,480
this pandemic

1148
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,920
but we had really short-sighted vision

1149
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,440
there by not recognizing two main

1150
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,159
features one is

1151
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,880
uh that they might not stop transmission

1152
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:42,480
another i guess three another is that uh

1153
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,920
new variants might come around that will

1154
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,199
break through the vaccine protective

1155
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,320
immunity and the third is that we

1156
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,799
were not

1157
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,119
we were measuring the efficacy of these

1158
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,480
vaccines during the peak of their

1159
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,640
performance in the first few months

1160
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,400
after people got vaccinated

1161
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,759
and that gives a skewed view of just how

1162
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,760
effective these are going to be long

1163
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,839
term so what happened

1164
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,680
with the vaccines is that

1165
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,759
everyone got very comfortable this

1166
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,598
including the cdc saying

1167
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,920
if you've been vaccinated you know this

1168
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,760
is the end of the pandemic for you

1169
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,079
and let's keep it up

1170
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,599
but then delta comes along and waning

1171
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,800
immunity comes along and both of these

1172
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,838
things compound exactly as anticipated

1173
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,839
to get breakthrough cases

1174
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:28,159
and unfortunately what we're seeing now

1175
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,719
is the cdc and the administration went

1176
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,879
so all in on saying that

1177
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,239
breakthrough cases are rare that

1178
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,559
transmission doesn't really happen if

1179
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:39,199
you're vaccinated without great data

1180
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,679
especially with delta that once people

1181
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:44,078
started seeing breakthrough cases

1182
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,919
they start interpreting that as a

1183
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,200
failure of the vaccine the vaccines are

1184
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,480
still working to keep people out of the

1185
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,919
hospital

1186
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,880
for the most part

1187
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,440
but

1188
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,119
they're not working to stop transmission

1189
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,838
and if our goal is to stop transmission

1190
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,760
which until we decide as a society that

1191
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,159
we have different goals

1192
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,319
like we're okay with people getting ill

1193
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:08,159
and letting transmission go because we

1194
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,159
don't want to worry about it anymore

1195
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:11,598
we're not there yet so until we decide

1196
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,159
we're not going to stop transmission we

1197
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,519
need other avenues besides the vaccine

1198
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:17,039
because it's

1199
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,599
it's not doing it it also means that

1200
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:21,279
herd immunity isn't going to happen and

1201
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,359
unfortunately as long as we keep letting

1202
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,040
spread happen in the context of

1203
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,799
vaccinated people

1204
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:29,838
we're kind of giving this virus a boot

1205
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,920
camp of exactly what it needs to

1206
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:34,480
do and mutate to get around our

1207
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,480
vaccine-derived antibodies that makes me

1208
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,159
very nervous so the more we can do to

1209
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,079
stop spread

1210
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:43,199
in the unvaccinated in the elderly

1211
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,839
vaccinated and in other people

1212
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,919
the better we we just should be focusing

1213
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,358
on that so in your eyes the solution

1214
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,200
would look like this

1215
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,880
you would have make enough tests where

1216
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,559
every single person would get tested

1217
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,640
every single day

1218
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:58,239
i think that that would be

1219
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:01,039
i don't want to do that actually i want

1220
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,959
to do a variation on that i think what

1221
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,000
we should do is have a dynamical testing

1222
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,880
program

1223
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,318
it doesn't have to be

1224
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,480
complicated

1225
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:12,159
it's every household has a box of tests

1226
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,559
in their cupboard

1227
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,318
and if you haven't seen any cases in

1228
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:18,719
your community for a long time stop

1229
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,559
testing do waste water

1230
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,078
testing to see if there's any rna coming

1231
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,838
back

1232
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,440
if you start to see rna in the waste

1233
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:27,440
water that represents the virus and

1234
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,039
you're still wanting to stop outbreaks

1235
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,159
you say hey

1236
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,639
you know those tests that are in your

1237
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:34,318
cupboards households in this county

1238
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,000
why don't what is in each household or

1239
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,519
each person each household use one test

1240
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,559
per week

1241
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,639
and can you uh sorry to just pause

1242
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,639
on that idea that's

1243
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,480
really cool the the waste water testing

1244
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,358
that's the thing so you can you can get

1245
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,119
a sense of how prevalent the virus is in

1246
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:53,519
a particular community by testing the

1247
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,720
wastewater that's exactly right and so

1248
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:59,519
the viral load associated uh the viral

1249
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:02,159
load that you can find in the community

1250
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,000
represents the prevalence of the virus

1251
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,920
in the community which is really quite

1252
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
nice that's not that's a nice way to

1253
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,880
paint like a map of the

1254
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,480
the intensity uh of the virus okay so

1255
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,880
when it

1256
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,159
when it goes above a certain level

1257
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,119
you can start

1258
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:19,358
doing

1259
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,680
much higher frequency testing per house

1260
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,880
in each household that's right so i

1261
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,118
don't want people to be in testing

1262
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,480
purgatory like that's not what i want i

1263
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,920
just want us to get through this damn

1264
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,280
pandemic and

1265
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,200
and so we can monitor the waste water or

1266
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,519
any other methods we can monitor the

1267
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:37,118
hospitals in the clinics and if somebody

1268
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:38,480
does come in with coveted like symptoms

1269
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,400
and then a few other people come in you

1270
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,920
realize okay we got spread happening in

1271
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,760
our community

1272
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,280
send out a text message put it on the

1273
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,640
news put in the newspaper whatever you

1274
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,519
need to do

1275
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:51,759
tell people tell families use your test

1276
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:53,199
and if the cases get worse

1277
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,640
because you're just doing it once a week

1278
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,679
that's not going to stop transmission

1279
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:59,679
but it's going to enable you to identify

1280
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,279
where outbreaks are happening

1281
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,399
if you start to find outbreaks in

1282
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,160
pockets

1283
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,000
then the rule is simply okay let's

1284
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,000
squash the outbreak real fast so

1285
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,519
everyone in that area uncertain zip code

1286
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,358
or whatever it might be

1287
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:13,119
test every two days

1288
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,480
you know for seven days or every day for

1289
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,039
seven days

1290
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,679
and you'll get rid of the outbreak

1291
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:21,759
we can do that and if you've now gone

1292
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:22,879
again you know a week or two with no

1293
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,760
cases

1294
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,519
uh identified stop the testing again

1295
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,359
that's the nice thing that

1296
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,719
everything changes when people have the

1297
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,159
tests in their home

1298
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,719
it becomes

1299
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:36,399
dynamic it can become easy send a text

1300
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:38,318
message take your test today

1301
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,920
if some people don't do it that's fine

1302
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,318
the only goal

1303
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,920
is to get r below one and you stop the

1304
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:46,000
outbreak

1305
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,079
people think it has to be near perfect i

1306
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,599
always hear people say

1307
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,160
ah what if somebody doesn't doesn't use

1308
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,960
it or what if somebody lies like well

1309
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:57,519
you you have 98 of people testing or

1310
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,519
even 50 that's a whole lot better

1311
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,440
and you know another big difference that

1312
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,480
people i think often times have their

1313
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,159
have a problem wrapping their head

1314
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,639
around

1315
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,639
especially to the extent

1316
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:09,920
physicians who are used to really

1317
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,000
like who are used to different kinds of

1318
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,318
metrics is that

1319
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,239
all we have to do to completely stop an

1320
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:19,838
outbreak from spreading in a community

1321
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:20,879
is to get for every hundred infected

1322
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,318
people

1323
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,838
to get them to go on and infect 95.

1324
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:27,759
most people would say oh my god that's a

1325
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,599
horrible you know that's a horrible

1326
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,560
program you're still letting a hundred

1327
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,039
people go and infect 95 people

1328
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,440
but that's for a virus like this that's

1329
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:40,559
a massive public health win if you can

1330
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,159
get 100 people to infect 90 most people

1331
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:44,078
doctors i would say like a lot of people

1332
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,279
would say that sounds like a failure to

1333
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,359
be honest

1334
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,480
but if you do that for multiple days in

1335
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:50,159
a row

1336
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,000
then in a couple of weeks you've gone

1337
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:53,358
from a big outbreak to a very very small

1338
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,719
outbreak

1339
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:56,719
and on the other hand if you don't do

1340
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:59,199
that if you allow 100 people to just

1341
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:01,199
infect 140 people

1342
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:03,519
because you're not doing the testing

1343
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:05,598
then instead of having 20 people at the

1344
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,159
end of those four weeks with the testing

1345
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,000
you literally would have 600

1346
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:10,960
massive differences here

1347
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,639
and all

1348
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,559
the only goal then is to get our below

1349
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,639
one have 100 people in fact less than

1350
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,239
100 and you stop the outbreaks and

1351
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:19,920
everyone stays safe

1352
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:21,838
from everything you've seen how cheap

1353
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,440
can these things get from like in the

1354
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:24,799
past year

1355
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,119
in in terms of the developments you've

1356
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,400
seen with the various test manufacturers

1357
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,318
how cheap can it be to make a test to

1358
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,400
manufacture a test so there's the

1359
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,480
manufacturing process that could be 50

1360
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,240
cents maybe less

1361
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,920
it's hard to get it's hard to really

1362
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,279
have eyeballs inside these companies you

1363
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,480
know in terms of where they're producing

1364
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,240
them in china

1365
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,280
and taiwan a number of other places

1366
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:49,279
some of them are produced here in the

1367
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,960
united states too but 50 cents say it

1368
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,800
was a very very reasonable generous

1369
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,318
number for how much it cost per test

1370
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,400
you look at a place with high market

1371
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,318
competition that has actually authorized

1372
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,720
a lot of these tests like germany

1373
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,639
germany has 60 70 some different

1374
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:06,159
companies of high quality rapid tests

1375
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,480
authorized

1376
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:09,759
you can go there and buy it for 80 cents

1377
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,599
you know that's and they're still making

1378
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,200
profit and so

1379
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,318
so it's extremely cheap market

1380
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:19,039
competition can drive these tests

1381
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:21,199
uh way down in terms of cost

1382
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,719
i think one of the most important

1383
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,279
features

1384
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:28,639
of a rapid test program is what do you

1385
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,640
do with the result is it going to

1386
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:31,838
be used for you to gain entry to school

1387
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,838
or work

1388
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:35,440
is it going to be reported to the public

1389
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:37,358
health agencies

1390
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,119
you know all of these the primary mode

1391
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:40,239
should be just get people test but

1392
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,160
really if you're going to be using it

1393
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:44,399
for a workplace thing like what biden is

1394
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:46,078
now saying vaccinate our test which is

1395
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,358
going to lead to a crisis if we don't

1396
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,440
fix this soon because we're going to

1397
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:51,199
massive demand for testing in the next

1398
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,440
couple weeks

1399
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,279
but when he says that that's essentially

1400
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,358
saying okay companies need to make sure

1401
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,839
that their people are testing so are you

1402
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:03,039
gonna base it on the honor system

1403
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:04,799
i would say you probably would not base

1404
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,759
testing on the honor system if it's like

1405
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,240
to uh take somebody who would otherwise

1406
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,000
be quarantined from in school and so you

1407
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,919
can go to school as long as your test is

1408
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,358
negative so test to stay program is a

1409
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,119
big thing that i've been pushing for and

1410
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:20,318
others have

1411
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,680
businesses bringing people into work who

1412
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:23,759
need to test

1413
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:24,960
they need to have verification

1414
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,119
but they don't want to like set up

1415
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,880
nursing stations in their lobbies or in

1416
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,640
the school parking lot or whatever like

1417
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,920
everyone's tired of that we need to

1418
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,719
bring the test into the home but that

1419
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,680
means we need the technology to enable

1420
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:38,639
it

1421
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:41,118
and so i was at a conference recently

1422
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,078
do you know mike milken milken institute

1423
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,240
he's a

1424
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,000
very wealthy billionaire but he's done a

1425
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,919
lot of philanthropy and he hosts a

1426
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,039
conference to raise money for prostate

1427
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,280
cancer

1428
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:52,880
research i was at this conference

1429
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,680
recently francis collins a number of

1430
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,680
other people were there

1431
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,440
and every morning we all had to test in

1432
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:01,358
the morning which i thought was a great

1433
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,119
idea obviously before we walked into

1434
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:06,159
that conference

1435
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,358
and um but you didn't have to test there

1436
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:10,078
and they didn't base it on the honor

1437
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:13,119
system every morning i'll i

1438
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:15,839
scanned a qr code on the box and emed

1439
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:17,920
which is a service that provides

1440
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:19,519
test uh verification

1441
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,280
popped up with a proctor right on my

1442
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,440
phone or on my computer

1443
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,800
and said okay

1444
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,480
let's go through your tests like and

1445
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,079
they watch you they videotape you using

1446
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,280
the test so it's all recorded it's all a

1447
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,039
reportable

1448
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,079
type of test

1449
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:35,519
and at the end of it just from your home

1450
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,880
you don't actually see the proctor you

1451
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,318
know they're but they're just verifying

1452
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,318
that you actually do it

1453
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:42,558
they verify the test they verify that

1454
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:45,039
test results with you

1455
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,040
and at the end of it you've then gotten

1456
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:48,239
from from your couch or from your car

1457
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,039
wherever you are

1458
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,239
an actual verified laboratory report

1459
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,400
that can be

1460
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,719
considered proof that you yourself use

1461
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,800
the test and you yourself got a negative

1462
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,558
so the tools are out here

1463
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,839
if we want to use them at scale and in

1464
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,359
fact the cdc uses emed now to

1465
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:06,880
enable people to come back into the

1466
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:08,558
united states

1467
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,920
uh through an antigen test so before you

1468
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,079
get on your flight you're sitting in the

1469
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,318
airport in heathrow or wherever you are

1470
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,839
you can get on your computer use your

1471
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:17,440
emed test

1472
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,440
and you get the negative and that and

1473
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,358
cdc will accept that tsa will accept you

1474
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,200
to come back into the us with the rapid

1475
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:25,358
antigen test that you did without anyone

1476
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,838
else watching except for this proctor on

1477
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:29,838
your phone super simple

1478
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,920
how much private information is being

1479
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:33,199
collected so like this you know people

1480
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,960
have

1481
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:37,519
in the united states

1482
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,880
the american way they have a hesitancy

1483
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:42,239
on the overreach of government in things

1484
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,440
like vaccine

1485
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:45,039
passports

1486
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,679
like using

1487
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:49,920
any mechanism any mechanism of

1488
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:53,358
verification that's controlled by

1489
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,838
government can lead to overreach by said

1490
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,199
government so there's a concern of that

1491
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:00,000
do you

1492
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:02,159
see there a way of achieving

1493
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,119
testing that's verified but does not

1494
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:06,000
violate people's privacy or sense of

1495
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,200
freedom

1496
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,119
absolutely i i think so the way that

1497
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,759
um right now in the united states

1498
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,000
they're requesting that

1499
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,480
these tests get that the results get

1500
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,559
delivered to public health agencies but

1501
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,480
i've long held that

1502
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,480
while that's ideal it should never be

1503
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,280
the thing that holds up somebody being

1504
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,760
allowed to know their own status

1505
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,000
but if you are going to work

1506
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,599
and you have to let your boss or your

1507
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,039
manager whomever know that you were

1508
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,400
negative that day or if you're going to

1509
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,000
school

1510
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,760
i think it's going to be hard to

1511
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,760
maintain complete privacy

1512
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,480
in that situation because they need to

1513
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,280
know your name but sure i mean could you

1514
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,679
cut off the public health reporting

1515
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,839
yes you could but i worry i mean can you

1516
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,919
opt out maybe you could opt out that

1517
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:59,519
should be a feature i want to opt out of

1518
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,119
the public health reporting because

1519
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:03,199
for whatever reason otherwise i'm not

1520
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,640
going to do the test and but that means

1521
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,480
that okay then you're not going to go to

1522
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:08,000
work so right now there's this serious

1523
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,240
tension and

1524
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,079
i am very uncomfortable with

1525
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:14,159
the idea that we force anyone to do

1526
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,760
anything but

1527
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:17,519
there is a tension between these two

1528
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,280
things for sure and how do you balance

1529
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,199
that during a public health

1530
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,440
emergency

1531
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,039
i think first and foremost let people

1532
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,480
everyone has a right to know their

1533
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:28,480
status

1534
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,240
the fact that we have made it hard for

1535
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,039
people to know their status on their

1536
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,399
terms i think is a travesty i mean it's

1537
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:37,199
just so

1538
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,519
terrible that we have

1539
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,519
prioritized

1540
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,199
us knowing at the expense of you know

1541
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:44,960
essentially what like elta's long said

1542
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:47,358
during this pandemic is

1543
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,599
if i'm public health it's if i can't

1544
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:51,199
know then you can't know your status

1545
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,519
like that's not the right way to look at

1546
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:55,279
public health we need to engage the

1547
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:56,960
public and if some of them don't want to

1548
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,319
participate in the public health part

1549
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,760
but want to know

1550
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:01,599
their status

1551
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,960
by default they are participating in

1552
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,240
public health whether they know it or

1553
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,159
not because they're not going to go get

1554
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:07,919
their mom sick by mistake

1555
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:11,440
at least most people wouldn't and then

1556
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,720
also you can create systems where

1557
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,240
you can

1558
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:18,000
individuals can form relationships based

1559
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:20,239
on their status

1560
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
without ever reporting it to a

1561
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,159
centralized place so

1562
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,719
you can go to i don't know

1563
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:28,639
a local business owner might

1564
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:30,159
require that you show

1565
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:32,400
that you're negative

1566
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:33,759
but that doesn't require reporting it

1567
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,480
you can

1568
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,680
like there might be um basically like an

1569
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,960
id

1570
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,558
that's only in possession you are the

1571
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,720
only person in possession of that so you

1572
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,119
literally show it exactly here's a test

1573
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:49,279
i took it's negative and nobody else

1574
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,519
knows about that test so that could very

1575
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,040
well be done even through a company like

1576
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,639
e-med i think

1577
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,358
and i might be wrong here

1578
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:59,358
uh i believe that they take the test

1579
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,920
result and because they are considered a

1580
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,358
clia waived laboratory like a digital

1581
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,400
laboratory

1582
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:08,639
they report their results by law out to

1583
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,599
uh the public health agencies

1584
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,799
but let's say there was something a

1585
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,119
little different let's say you were

1586
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,480
verifying an over-the-counter test

1587
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,680
and it doesn't have to be a cleo wave

1588
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,079
because it's over the counter then

1589
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:18,960
you're not bound by clio rules

1590
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,960
and

1591
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,639
you could create the same service but

1592
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,400
that just doesn't report out to the

1593
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:25,598
public health agencies it gives people

1594
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,440
the option

1595
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,039
to opt in or out of public health

1596
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,000
reporting and

1597
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:32,400
you know

1598
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,719
i know that public health people

1599
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,318
get a little queasy when i talk about

1600
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:37,919
this but

1601
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:39,679
as a public health person myself like

1602
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,000
yes of course i would prefer that the

1603
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:43,519
data be available to evaluate to know

1604
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,199
where the cases are

1605
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:48,239
but first and foremost i want to make

1606
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:50,239
sure that the people using the test

1607
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:52,719
are are going to use the test and if

1608
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:54,000
that means that they're not reporting

1609
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:55,838
and if that's the only way that they

1610
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
will use it is if it's not reported then

1611
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,480
that's better than no test

1612
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,519
and especially given that the

1613
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:06,000
central to the vaccine hesitancy is a

1614
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:07,838
distrust of authority in the distrust of

1615
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,679
government so

1616
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:12,639
you're asking

1617
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:14,879
you're asking people to get tested

1618
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:17,118
and report their

1619
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,798
status

1620
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,920
to a centralized authority when they're

1621
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:21,838
clearly

1622
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,838
do not trust that authority it doesn't

1623
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:25,199
make any sense it seems like a perfect

1624
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:27,599
solution

1625
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:29,838
to let people who are hesitant on the

1626
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,280
vaccine to uh

1627
00:55:29,838 --> 00:55:33,759
get their own status and have full

1628
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,440
control of that information and opt-in

1629
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,520
provide that information if they wish to

1630
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,440
but they have the full control of it and

1631
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:42,318
have the freedom to do that information

1632
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,679
what they want i fully agree with that i

1633
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:45,759
really do i think we can have the

1634
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,440
verified services

1635
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,880
and we could have the privacy if you

1636
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,960
want if you want if you need to go into

1637
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,880
a restaurant and there's a rule that you

1638
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,240
have to be a negative test

1639
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,559
have it on your phone and only your

1640
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,879
phone and it's okay like emed emails you

1641
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,559
the the lab report you have it you can

1642
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,640
say look that's my name i use it this

1643
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,400
morning negative

1644
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,639
and in that case you'd want something

1645
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,160
that just is there and is not

1646
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,558
going anywhere else and i think that

1647
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,519
those services like i think they can

1648
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,000
exist

1649
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,599
and it's a struggle because for those

1650
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,119
companies

1651
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,760
they don't want to fall out of favor

1652
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,920
with the cdc or with the fda

1653
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,760
and so this is a big problem in our

1654
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:28,079
marketplace in general by having

1655
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,599
by having private companies

1656
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,160
who want to

1657
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,838
be the be the public health agents of

1658
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:35,598
this pandemic

1659
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:37,119
we lose a lot of control because the

1660
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:39,440
companies ultimately have to do what's

1661
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,960
going to make them money so they survive

1662
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,159
and keep performing the service it's

1663
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,159
really it's really just such a hard

1664
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:48,078
problem and i this is why last time i

1665
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,000
was here i'm guessing

1666
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,280
i was probably really pushing for the

1667
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,599
government

1668
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,040
to be producing these tests

1669
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,400
i think i would have still been pushing

1670
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,838
for that you know at this point i've

1671
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,680
decided okay the government's clearly

1672
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:01,440
not going to do that i've been thinking

1673
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:02,639
i really want elon musk to produce the

1674
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,559
tests like

1675
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:07,598
i i really

1676
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,839
am sort of serious that these tests are

1677
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,200
simple to make but we've been using like

1678
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:12,798
machines to make them that have been

1679
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,118
around for a long time

1680
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:17,599
scale is an issue right now

1681
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,039
kind of really it's the eua process and

1682
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,039
getting the companies to be allowed to

1683
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,199
market in the us that's the issue but

1684
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:24,960
let's just say scale is the issue and

1685
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,118
one company wants to make 20 million

1686
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,880
tests a day

1687
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,559
these aren't that hard like we we should

1688
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,559
be able to do that we just need a faster

1689
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,720
machine a better machine yeah and a

1690
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,559
quicker one and a few folks like you

1691
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,318
mentioned know how to solve that problem

1692
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,640
yeah i've had a lot of discussion with

1693
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:42,239
uh with tesla folks you know with with

1694
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:44,639
people that used to work a test like jim

1695
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:46,318
keller about how to make stuff much

1696
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,118
cheaper much better that's basically

1697
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:50,558
what tesla is world-class at and

1698
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:51,760
it's like okay

1699
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,160
does this

1700
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,920
thing have to cost a thousand dollars no

1701
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:57,920
it can cost ten dollars right and let's

1702
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,760
figure out how to manufacture it those

1703
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,960
those those folks are like the best in

1704
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:06,319
the world they're doing that okay but um

1705
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,400
what about this biden action plan

1706
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:11,119
so it sounds like

1707
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,400
the guy uh agrees with you vaccinate or

1708
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,680
test

1709
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,119
so

1710
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:17,919
i think given that choice a lot of

1711
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:20,000
people go test in america because

1712
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,119
there's there's like a division it seems

1713
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,239
like so what is this just uh politics is

1714
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,680
is this

1715
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:27,358
just words or do you think this is

1716
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:29,519
actually going to lead to something and

1717
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:31,598
maybe can you explain what the action

1718
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,440
plan sure is

1719
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,720
so there's there's a number of pillars

1720
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,400
to the action plan um the two that i've

1721
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,078
been most focused on i mean some of them

1722
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,920
are we want to get everyone vaccinated

1723
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,480
all these things and

1724
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,838
one pillar is saying any

1725
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:51,440
company in the united states that has

1726
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:54,239
more than a hundred employees

1727
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,639
is now required to

1728
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,399
ensure that any unvaccinated individuals

1729
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,118
in their workforce

1730
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,039
test weekly

1731
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,960
another pillar is that

1732
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:08,318
the president's going to

1733
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:11,599
reduce the cost of pcr tests

1734
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:13,279
by 35 which is pretty

1735
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,200
moderate reduction

1736
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,280
um and

1737
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:20,558
is going to reduce the cost of antigen

1738
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,798
tests and scale them up and make 280

1739
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:26,319
million tests

1740
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:28,079
and put two billion dollars into it

1741
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:29,599
so those are the two that i found most

1742
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,280
intriguing for the kind of mission that

1743
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,838
i've been on which is to just educate

1744
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,519
people around hey we have really really

1745
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:37,119
powerful public health tools we have yet

1746
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,440
to deploy

1747
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,440
um

1748
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:43,358
the issue

1749
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,358
at hand though is that now that the

1750
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:49,519
president has said vaccinate or test

1751
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:51,279
there's a problem inherent in that you

1752
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,759
know it's essentially to coerce people

1753
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,119
around vaccinated to get vaccinated

1754
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,480
because vaccinator test doesn't make

1755
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,318
sense when the vaccinated people can

1756
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,039
transmit the virus just fine it should

1757
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:02,798
be vaccinate and test exactly it's the

1758
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:04,558
problem that i have with that vaccinate

1759
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:06,559
or test idea

1760
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,839
is it's great if you want to use it as a

1761
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,720
coercive

1762
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:10,880
uh

1763
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:13,519
effort to get people vaccinated like i'm

1764
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,119
not going to wade into that argument

1765
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,920
do i agree with it or not i'm just not

1766
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:20,480
going to even put my uh

1767
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:23,838
i disagree with let me say

1768
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:26,719
i disagree as opposed to doing great yes

1769
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:29,358
science communication this weird

1770
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:30,959
like people talking down to the populace

1771
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:34,798
as if they're children trying to trick

1772
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:37,679
them here have some candy uh this kind

1773
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:39,039
like everyone with common sense

1774
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,118
somebody told me i was having a

1775
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,480
conversation like if the government is

1776
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,838
going to give you money to take the

1777
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,760
vaccine

1778
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:47,519
people that were already hesitant about

1779
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,920
the vaccine

1780
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,759
are not going to trust whatever the heck

1781
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,519
you're doing so don't trick people into

1782
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,960
taking a vaccine be honest and

1783
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:56,400
communicate

1784
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,039
transparently everything that's known

1785
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:03,440
about the vaccine communicate the data

1786
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:03,440
inspire people with uh

1787
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,318
with uh transparency and like

1788
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,920
real communication of all the

1789
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,239
uncertainty around it and all the

1790
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,798
difficult decisions of risk and all

1791
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,558
those kinds of things and as opposed to

1792
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:18,639
trying to trick them like children into

1793
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,839
taking the vaccine anyway

1794
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:24,078
yes but okay well i didn't have to say

1795
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:25,920
it so there

1796
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,400
but you're saying it should not be uh uh

1797
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,480
like vaccinate or test this that's that

1798
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,720
tradeoff doesn't mean exactly vaccinate

1799
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,920
by saying vaccinate or test

1800
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:37,919
is absolutely confusing

1801
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,000
because it implies for anyone who's

1802
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,200
thinking about it it is implying and and

1803
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,960
i've seen this because i have business

1804
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:44,960
leaders call me fortune 500 business

1805
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,280
leaders who call me and say

1806
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,960
what do i do like i have 8 000 employees

1807
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,640
where am i going to get my tests you

1808
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,798
know and a lot of people are

1809
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:54,639
saying they're calling this a pandemic

1810
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:57,440
of the unvaccinated

1811
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:59,598
these types of divisive

1812
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,519
this divisive language doesn't help this

1813
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:03,760
isn't a pandemic of the unvaccinated

1814
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:05,280
it's a pandemic of a virus you

1815
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,200
know like

1816
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,200
don't ever put it on the unvaccinated

1817
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,879
who frankly are just scared they don't

1818
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:12,078
know who to trust

1819
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,559
and we haven't given them a lot of

1820
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,640
reason to trust public health to be

1821
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:19,039
frank

1822
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:21,279
so i agree i mean now that you've opened

1823
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,280
the door i'll just say my piece like

1824
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:26,480
absolutely we need to be the most honest

1825
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:28,079
we can with all of this this

1826
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,159
this is confusing language to say

1827
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,000
vaccinator tests we need to say we need

1828
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:34,960
to be very upfront that says and say

1829
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,199
look vaccines aren't aren't stopping

1830
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,960
transmission very well

1831
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:40,399
unfortunately this is the world we have

1832
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,358
we have delta we're going to have new

1833
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,440
mutants

1834
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:45,279
we have a vaccine that's that wanes

1835
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,480
somewhat over time you know this is

1836
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,760
biology i'm sorry i'm you know this is

1837
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,519
just what it is

1838
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,760
and then we say but

1839
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:54,798
the vaccines are really protective for

1840
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,160
your personal health they're going to

1841
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:57,759
keep you out of the hospital this is

1842
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:59,199
what you should care about as an

1843
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,240
individual

1844
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:02,159
and

1845
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:03,759
as a population we need to figure out

1846
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:05,759
okay we have to stop transmission if

1847
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,200
that's our goal

1848
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,640
so we should use the tools that are

1849
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,960
going to stop transmission if that's our

1850
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:13,199
goal and saying vaccinate or test if our

1851
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,119
goal is to actually stop transmission

1852
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:18,399
that's confusing because vaccines are

1853
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:20,960
not stopping it there may be mildly

1854
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,358
lowering the risk of transmission

1855
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,880
so i i'm just not a fan of that language

1856
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:26,558
i think we should be being very very

1857
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,680
clear like you said and up front about

1858
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,480
what are the

1859
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:32,480
limitations of the test of the vaccine

1860
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,838
and of the test and we should be very

1861
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,639
clear that like you know it can only

1862
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:39,358
help the american public

1863
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:41,279
in aggregate is extremely intelligent to

1864
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:43,358
you know they will figure out

1865
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,119
when you say that vaccine breakthrough

1866
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:46,078
cases are rare and then they start

1867
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,318
seeing

1868
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:50,880
story after story of like whole parties

1869
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:52,639
of people or vaccines have outbreaks and

1870
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,079
and everyone knows more people now who

1871
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:56,159
are having breakthrough cases than they

1872
01:03:54,079 --> 01:04:00,000
knew who had regular cases before the

1873
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:01,279
vaccine people start to wonder hmm

1874
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,798
well this is weird they say that the

1875
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,480
vaccines are working breakthrough cases

1876
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:06,318
are rare maybe the whole vaccine program

1877
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,760
is failing entirely

1878
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:10,159
and so it ends up shooting ourselves in

1879
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,160
the foot if we try to

1880
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:14,719
create false expectations because we

1881
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:16,399
think it's going to be beneficial

1882
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:18,159
uh for one thing when it's not for the

1883
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,680
other and so the other so to get back to

1884
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:23,038
the action plan

1885
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:25,118
vaccinate or test i think

1886
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,440
and and the re and the increase in rapid

1887
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,720
tests i do think it was a bold move i

1888
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,880
think it

1889
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:32,000
i i would say that it was the most

1890
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:33,599
prominent

1891
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,519
sort of display

1892
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,200
encouraging display of the fact that

1893
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:38,318
rapid tests are

1894
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:40,719
indeed

1895
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:43,358
effective public health tools

1896
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:45,679
my real concern now with with is that

1897
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:47,358
280 million tests that's like less than

1898
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:49,838
one per person per year in the united

1899
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:51,598
states so that's not

1900
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:53,038
the way that he said and delivered it

1901
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,880
and what most people think of when they

1902
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,160
hear the word 280 million you don't

1903
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,680
usually put a lot of thought into what

1904
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,038
does that number mean it sounds a big

1905
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:00,480
number

1906
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,319
most people are now going to be

1907
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,000
expecting that these tests are actually

1908
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:06,318
going to be staying in stock on the on

1909
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,519
the shelves at cvs and walgreens and

1910
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:11,838
amazon or whatever so that's crisis

1911
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:13,679
number one it's like now the expectation

1912
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:15,679
is set for having rapid tests but

1913
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,199
they're not going to scale that well

1914
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,279
we won't have them and then there's

1915
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:20,798
vaccinate or test

1916
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,798
and that's going to bring millions and

1917
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:24,798
millions of people who are not currently

1918
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:27,358
testing to have to start testing so

1919
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:29,358
that's going to overwhelm our pcr labs

1920
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:31,838
and it's going to create five-day delays

1921
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:33,838
again with pcr if not longer

1922
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:35,759
because we'll have backlogs

1923
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:37,759
and so the only real solution to this is

1924
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,119
to just scale up the tests that are

1925
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,720
actually scalable

1926
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,640
and that's these simple rapid tests and

1927
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:44,318
it's not even to scale them up

1928
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:45,118
through production and manufacturing

1929
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:47,440
here

1930
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,440
it's to open the doors so the companies

1931
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,679
that already exist here and can scale

1932
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,280
are allowed to do it and to bring in the

1933
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:56,159
international market some of the biggest

1934
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,760
diagnostic companies in the world

1935
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:58,960
are not selling their

1936
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,640
millions and millions and millions of

1937
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,240
tests in the billions of tests in the

1938
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:04,318
united states

1939
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:05,838
because they don't want to play the the

1940
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:07,920
the game that the fda is currently

1941
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:10,239
requiring of them

1942
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,440
so we have an opportunity and i i am

1943
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:12,959
very encouraged that the president

1944
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,720
actually did put these into the action

1945
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,599
plan and i do want to say for the record

1946
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:18,558
that i'm

1947
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,640
supportive of it in principle

1948
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:23,440
but i think now

1949
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:24,960
now we actually are in a in like a the

1950
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,798
timer has been set and we have to deal

1951
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,920
with the crisis before it happens

1952
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:29,199
otherwise there could be some real

1953
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,760
political

1954
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:33,598
points taken off you know i do worry

1955
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,200
that the president if he doesn't pull

1956
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,640
through with this and really make the

1957
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:39,118
test available we end up getting into

1958
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:41,118
this other test crisis this fall

1959
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,720
there could be political consequences to

1960
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:44,400
that and the reason is like these rapid

1961
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,959
tests are so personal they become

1962
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,318
emotional almost they're so they give

1963
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,838
people that empowerment that i was

1964
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:52,239
talking about earlier

1965
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:54,558
and when people can't get that because

1966
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:56,719
the shelves are out of stock

1967
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:58,640
they actually feel frustrated and then

1968
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:01,679
that converts into like anger like in

1969
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:03,679
the blame and so i do think that we have

1970
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:05,199
to be really smart about

1971
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,358
making a policy like this and then

1972
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:09,038
ensuring that we can carry through

1973
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:11,199
with what the average american is

1974
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,400
actually expecting

1975
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:14,318
and

1976
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,240
speaking of politics one of the great

1977
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:18,159
things about testing maybe you can

1978
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:21,038
correct me but for my sense

1979
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:23,440
it's one of the only solutions to covid

1980
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:26,400
that has not yet been politicized

1981
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:29,039
so masks and vaccines whether you like

1982
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,639
it or not have been

1983
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:33,440
heavily politicized where there's

1984
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:35,679
literally a red blue split

1985
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,519
on the use of those

1986
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:38,798
or like

1987
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:42,719
proud

1988
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:44,719
use effective use of those tools and it

1989
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:47,679
seems like everybody i talked to about

1990
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:49,679
testing everybody's on board red or blue

1991
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:51,598
they are which is why

1992
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:54,159
i am particularly concerned about the

1993
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:56,160
vaccinate or test policy right because

1994
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:58,480
all of a sudden we just politicized it

1995
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,318
we just

1996
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,079
brought it with this thing that was

1997
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:04,159
fully bipartisan

1998
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,559
really by part i mean i've talked to the

1999
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:09,358
fully the really right

2000
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:11,839
side of congress and the super liberal

2001
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:13,838
side of congress the senate the same

2002
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:16,640
politicians governors

2003
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:18,000
everywhere in this country have asked me

2004
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,560
for support

2005
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,079
around these rapid tests because it just

2006
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,520
you can have it reported or not you can

2007
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:25,838
have it in the home in the privacy of

2008
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,920
your own home or not or you do it at

2009
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:30,640
school these these tools are just so

2010
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:32,798
powerful to identify infectious people

2011
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,480
they didn't have to be politicized

2012
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:36,000
they still don't i don't think that the

2013
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:38,559
action plan went so far that it's going

2014
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
to politicize them but i do think

2015
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,120
already it's starting to conjure up

2016
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,838
emotion saying well now i have to

2017
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,960
get tested i have to part right and that

2018
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:50,000
is where

2019
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,679
we go wrong it's i have to get tested or

2020
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,798
vaccinated

2021
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:57,199
you know screw that i am independent you

2022
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:59,119
know whatever and

2023
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:01,278
and i do worry that this thing that was

2024
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:03,599
purely bipartisan that we could have

2025
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,880
just scaled up months ago people would

2026
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,480
have we could have delivered it to every

2027
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,480
household didn't even have to

2028
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,599
ask people to request to just deliver

2029
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:13,119
packages

2030
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,880
to every home in america by now easily

2031
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:16,719
if we were smart about it you know we

2032
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,520
could have done it the most unpleasant

2033
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:22,560
thing about covet is the uncertainty and

2034
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:25,440
that's what leads to fear on both the um

2035
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,120
uh vaccine hesitant it's the answer into

2036
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,559
about the vaccine

2037
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:29,920
and uh

2038
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,759
people who are

2039
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,079
have taken the vaccine the uncertainty

2040
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:36,719
around like am i in danger walking

2041
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:39,119
around can i go can i walk down the hall

2042
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,239
like this fear of the world around you

2043
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:43,119
and i think

2044
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:45,919
testing allows you to uh remove a lot of

2045
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:47,679
that uncertainty like you you gain back

2046
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,560
confidence that you can operate in this

2047
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,880
world

2048
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,600
and not get infected and you become like

2049
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,119
a nicer person i i find myself every

2050
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,320
time i get tested i become a nicer

2051
01:09:55,119 --> 01:10:00,319
person to others because i know i'm not

2052
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,599
putting a danger i'm not putting people

2053
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:03,840
in danger

2054
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,520
it's a it's a heavy burden to carry to

2055
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,600
worry

2056
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,120
am i infectious like i was out last

2057
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,280
night but i do want to go see my mom

2058
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:13,519
today you know like am i infectious i

2059
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:14,800
don't know and this has created massive

2060
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:18,080
anxiety

2061
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,920
and i can't tell i completely agree that

2062
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:22,719
it is

2063
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:25,520
it's a relieving feeling and and it's an

2064
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,960
amazing feeling to be in a room

2065
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,239
when and i did this in the middle of the

2066
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,279
pandemic when everyone was supposed to

2067
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:33,759
be wearing a mask indoors

2068
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:35,359
at every one rapid test you know and i

2069
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,840
said everyone should wrap a test before

2070
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:40,639
you walk into this room

2071
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:43,360
and it was a wonderful experiment

2072
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,440
because everyone was just so relaxed

2073
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:47,759
yeah you know the other the alternative

2074
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:49,279
is everyone nobody tests and everyone

2075
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,480
wears a mask

2076
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:54,479
you have a mask that maybe gives you 20

2077
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:55,919
maybe protection

2078
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:57,678
during if you're all in the same room

2079
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,440
together if that

2080
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:00,880
or you have a rapid test program

2081
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:04,639
wherever in rapid test before and that

2082
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:07,119
gives you like 95 to 100 protection not

2083
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,880
100 but close

2084
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:11,039
and all of a sudden that allows everyone

2085
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,719
to take a big sigh and be like wow this

2086
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:14,479
is the first time

2087
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:15,920
i've seen people without masks indoors

2088
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:17,919
in a long time and i feel pretty good

2089
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,440
and restaurants like

2090
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,800
restaurants are scary right now because

2091
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:24,238
you just don't know who might be

2092
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:25,520
infectious and nobody's masked

2093
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:27,359
and

2094
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,640
like wouldn't it be great to just go

2095
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:31,279
into a restaurant where you know that

2096
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:34,480
everyone just tested negative that day

2097
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:37,519
it just really reduces anxiety

2098
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:39,599
it makes individuals feel empowered

2099
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,679
and i mean at the end of the day covet

2100
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,560
and our response to covet is a re is a

2101
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:46,640
it's truly an information problem

2102
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,239
you know we why do we quarantine anyone

2103
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,360
why did we ever close anything down we

2104
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:51,678
didn't close things down because

2105
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:53,599
everyone is positive we closed things

2106
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,119
down because we didn't know if anyone

2107
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:58,159
was positive

2108
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:59,920
we quarantine a whole classroom of kids

2109
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:01,519
not because they're all positive but

2110
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:03,119
because we don't know if one of them are

2111
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,360
positive and so we just quarantine

2112
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:07,119
everyone when there's a positive in the

2113
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:08,719
case in the in the classroom like one

2114
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:11,198
day we'll then ask the whole classroom

2115
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,719
not to come to school for 10 days

2116
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:14,319
that's not

2117
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,079
a biological problem that's an

2118
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:18,639
information problem

2119
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:21,359
and the crazy thing is we have the tool

2120
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:23,119
to solve that information problem

2121
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:24,719
it's literally our eyes on the virus

2122
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:26,238
it's how we see this virus and if

2123
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,520
everyone glowed green

2124
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:29,279
when they were infectious we would have

2125
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:31,120
never had to close down anyone any

2126
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:32,158
society and we would have never had the

2127
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:34,479
outbreaks because we would have been

2128
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:36,479
able to stay away from the green people

2129
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:38,079
you know and yeah i like what you said

2130
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:39,439
the quarantine is an information problem

2131
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:41,279
that's absolutely right

2132
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,039
what is there something you can say to

2133
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:45,519
what people can do

2134
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:46,719
like listening to this individuals do

2135
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,920
you just

2136
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:51,840
complain like loudly like why can't we

2137
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,960
do this can you speak with your money

2138
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,039
somehow

2139
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,560
what what can people do

2140
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:59,119
to help

2141
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,800
god it's it's amazing to think

2142
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:02,559
you're asking me this question

2143
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,119
and this video will go out to you know

2144
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:07,600
the web and all the people that watch

2145
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:09,840
you and uh last year

2146
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,679
in july maybe something like that june i

2147
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,079
forget exactly what it was i was on

2148
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,920
twitter this week in virology

2149
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:17,679
um shout out to two of those guys are

2150
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,199
awesome they are awesome i love i love

2151
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,960
twiv

2152
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:22,719
and they asked me the exact same

2153
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,000
question towards the end i said this

2154
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,840
makes so much sense you know why

2155
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,600
wouldn't we do this what can people do

2156
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,520
and so i said

2157
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,039
oh you know just send me an email like

2158
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,040
write to me i'm sure you could find my

2159
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:35,279
email somewhere online

2160
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,960
and uh and get in touch and i will you

2161
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:38,158
know and and we can try to figure out

2162
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,279
how to

2163
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:43,439
uh make something happen yeah bad idea

2164
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,279
very smart

2165
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:46,639
way too many emails i didn't i feel bad

2166
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:48,719
because i didn't end up getting back to

2167
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,960
anyone because i just got inundated but

2168
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:53,279
it did lead to the development of rapid

2169
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,039
test.org where we did

2170
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:58,158
automate the process of writing letters

2171
01:13:55,039 --> 01:14:00,399
to um congressional members and and

2172
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:02,319
elected representatives

2173
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:04,158
so that helps

2174
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:06,639
fast forward to today what can what can

2175
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:06,639
people do

2176
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,198
i honestly don't know like what can the

2177
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:14,399
average person at this point do we have

2178
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:15,198
tried everything the fda is immutable on

2179
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,879
this

2180
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:18,879
they will not change and we shouldn't

2181
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,880
ask them to change because they have

2182
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,000
decided that this is how they regulate

2183
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,719
medical devices and they're going to

2184
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,399
stick to it so what we need to do and

2185
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:29,439
maybe this is something to do

2186
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:32,639
is get if you know people

2187
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:34,079
who have sway over politicians lobbyists

2188
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,480
whatever it might be

2189
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:38,079
let people know to request

2190
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:41,119
that the president literally the

2191
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:43,679
president of the united states

2192
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:47,119
uses executive powers

2193
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:49,119
to just do a sim something as simple as

2194
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:51,439
designating these powerful public health

2195
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:52,640
tools as public health tools allow the

2196
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:55,279
cdc

2197
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:57,360
and the nih or whoever it must be or or

2198
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:59,279
academic centers of excellence

2199
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:01,439
designated by the cdc

2200
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:03,759
to evaluate the tests

2201
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:05,599
in a very fast fashion with the

2202
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,760
appropriate metrics that these tests

2203
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,800
need to achieve for public health

2204
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,480
and within two days we can have ten new

2205
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,920
tests authorized

2206
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:15,759
you know this doesn't have to be a six

2207
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,239
to twelve month endeavor this could be a

2208
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:21,280
two day endeavor we actually did it i

2209
01:15:18,238 --> 01:15:22,799
judged the rapid test x prize

2210
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:24,880
and it went great we actually got

2211
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,800
incredible metrics about how well does

2212
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,520
each test work

2213
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:31,360
and no clinical trials you know just a

2214
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,280
couple days worth of work in the lab and

2215
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:35,599
boom and if we actually systematize it

2216
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,840
would be an hour so in the lab you know

2217
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,679
so

2218
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:42,159
simple so i don't know i mean i don't

2219
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:43,920
know how to really impact change i've

2220
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:46,879
thankfully you know i have a platform

2221
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,800
and i've been able to start talking with

2222
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:52,159
people who are very close to the

2223
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:54,000
president and the white house and um and

2224
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:56,639
i do think that some change is finally

2225
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,960
happening because the silver bullet of

2226
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,719
the vaccine has not panned out to be the

2227
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,000
silver bullet so now we gotta

2228
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:03,920
now i think

2229
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,479
we're moving from a country that was a

2230
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,079
vaccine only approach to

2231
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:10,319
finally recognizing at the highest

2232
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:12,399
levels that there's other tools

2233
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:13,519
do you think it's possible to reopen

2234
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:15,198
fully

2235
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,880
without solving the testing problem

2236
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:19,439
completely like do you think this

2237
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,520
vaccine approach will get us to reopen

2238
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:24,799
fully

2239
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:28,080
i do yeah i think over time though

2240
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:30,400
i mean if we a lot of people ask me like

2241
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:32,319
what's what's like happening like what's

2242
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:33,519
the end game here like where does this

2243
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:36,000
end

2244
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:39,360
and um

2245
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:43,119
it's actually not a mystery the end game

2246
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:44,799
is we will grow out of this virus

2247
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:46,319
and by that i mean

2248
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,199
you and i

2249
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:48,799
and

2250
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:51,039
most people who are watching this are

2251
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,920
adults right

2252
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:56,479
adults don't like to get infected with a

2253
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:59,039
virus for the very first time as adults

2254
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:00,959
babies are okay with it and so what we

2255
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:02,960
have to do to understand how we're

2256
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,600
getting out of this virus

2257
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:07,600
is to look at babies look at newborns

2258
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,039
and say okay how does a baby get out of

2259
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,239
their high risk

2260
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:11,920
time period

2261
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:15,198
they get exposed they get like exposed

2262
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:16,719
multiple times or vaccinated of course

2263
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:18,079
and eventually

2264
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:19,760
they get exposed enough that they build

2265
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:21,920
up this nice cushion of immunity that's

2266
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,280
sufficiently diverse that they can

2267
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,600
battle whatever gets thrown at them

2268
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:26,399
because they've seen it all already

2269
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,640
but

2270
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:30,719
one exposure doesn't do it i mean over

2271
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,800
the course of the first few years of

2272
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:34,640
life kids get exposed to chronoviruses

2273
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,600
tons of times lots of different viruses

2274
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,280
they get

2275
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,079
so unfortunately what's happening with

2276
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:41,359
us why this is so bad for us is that as

2277
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:43,198
we're adults

2278
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:44,799
we don't regenerate tissue very well we

2279
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:46,319
have like over abundant inflammatory

2280
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,079
response we have all these problems that

2281
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:49,119
when we get an infection for the first

2282
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:51,760
time

2283
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:54,238
it sucks it harms us it causes us

2284
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,840
problems but over time just like a baby

2285
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:59,119
we're going to start building up our

2286
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:01,119
immunity through vaccines and exposures

2287
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:02,640
you know i hate to say it but tons of

2288
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:04,719
people are getting exposed to delta

2289
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,079
right now who don't know it

2290
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:07,359
tons

2291
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:09,439
and

2292
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:11,279
uh if you're vaccinated you don't know

2293
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:12,879
it as my point there

2294
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:14,880
and you know at the end of the day this

2295
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,119
is actually i do not want this to be

2296
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:19,119
misconstrued as like saying go get

2297
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:21,119
infected but the fact that people are

2298
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:24,079
getting infected you know will

2299
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:25,840
add to our level of protection later on

2300
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:28,319
and so yeah but the question is how long

2301
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,560
that whole process takes i think you

2302
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:33,679
know my guess is probably by the end of

2303
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:35,600
next year early 2023 we will probably

2304
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:37,840
start looking at this as though it is

2305
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,440
not a particularly dangerous virus for

2306
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,199
most people the elderly though it will

2307
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:43,439
still be but that's because they're

2308
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:46,079
immunity like variants and stuff right

2309
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:49,519
now other people say this statement you

2310
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:52,238
just said a year ago about this spring

2311
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:54,000
right well that probably was not wise

2312
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:56,158
well i mean it's because your the

2313
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,319
intuition is like okay

2314
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:59,519
now that there's a vaccine you're either

2315
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:01,679
going to take the vaccine or get

2316
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:03,679
infected and then it'll be hurt immunity

2317
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:05,119
over like it'll be very quick

2318
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:06,960
so you know

2319
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:09,119
that that's the intuition but

2320
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:11,279
it seems like that's not

2321
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:13,039
happening it seems like we're in this

2322
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,439
constant state

2323
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:18,640
of uh fear-mongering for different

2324
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:20,559
reasons it's almost um

2325
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,640
it's almost like the virus got

2326
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,080
deeply integrated not into just our

2327
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:27,840
biology but

2328
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:30,399
in the game of politics and

2329
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:32,239
in the fear mongering around the news

2330
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:34,238
because the virus now started being

2331
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:36,399
together with the vaccine and the masks

2332
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:40,000
and it started getting

2333
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:42,799
uh integrated into uh the division

2334
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,119
that's so effective at uh

2335
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,279
monetizing social media for example and

2336
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:49,920
so it's like all right

2337
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:51,519
so how do you get out of that mm-hmm

2338
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,199
because you can always kind of present

2339
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,840
certain kinds of numbers about number of

2340
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:56,639
cases or

2341
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,760
how

2342
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:01,920
full hospitals are and and start making

2343
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,600
claims about that we're still this is as

2344
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,719
bad as it's ever been those kinds of

2345
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,880
statements

2346
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:10,158
and so i'm not sure exactly what the way

2347
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:12,560
out is except the same way out as it was

2348
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:15,839
originally which is testing

2349
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:17,679
this information it's information yeah

2350
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,560
and and i think we can do that we can

2351
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:22,000
keep outbreaks suppressed with testing

2352
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,440
because it's information like people

2353
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,359
keep thinking of tests as big medical

2354
01:20:23,439 --> 01:20:27,198
things they're not they're information

2355
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:28,000
it can allow us to control things just

2356
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:30,000
like

2357
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,520
we drive down

2358
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,359
a road and

2359
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,560
we look at the cars and we don't hit

2360
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:35,679
other cars because we have the

2361
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,280
information that they're in the lane

2362
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:39,039
next to us

2363
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:41,359
and they're moving over like that's just

2364
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:43,198
information like you said glow green the

2365
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:45,599
problem with the virus you don't have

2366
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:47,839
you don't see you're walking around and

2367
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,039
everybody is a potential

2368
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,719
uh

2369
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:53,198
like infectious

2370
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:55,600
creature and so if you see the world as

2371
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:57,039
a potential potential for infection

2372
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,639
you're going to be terrified of that

2373
01:20:57,039 --> 01:21:00,639
exactly right and that is what has

2374
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:02,880
happened and i and that's why i've been

2375
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:05,359
pushing so hard for for these tests

2376
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,279
because they can allow people if you use

2377
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:08,799
them at a community level you can have

2378
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:10,319
enough people know that they're positive

2379
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,400
enough people are good people that they

2380
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:14,559
won't go out and affect others

2381
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:17,279
and the other great thing about them is

2382
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:19,440
again a 10-day isolation period

2383
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:21,439
especially for a vaccinated person but

2384
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:23,919
in either case

2385
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:25,839
is also an information problem we don't

2386
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,760
have to isolate for 10 days if we're

2387
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:29,520
infected what if we're only infectious

2388
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,280
for two yeah especially if we're

2389
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,520
vaccinated why are we telling people the

2390
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:35,279
only reason the cdc ever and the wha

2391
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,920
suggested a 10-day

2392
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:39,198
isolation or a 14-day quarantine is

2393
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,119
because we didn't know when people

2394
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:42,399
stopped being infectious

2395
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:44,719
there's actually some people stay

2396
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:46,399
infectious for 14 days it's rare

2397
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:48,319
but there's a lot of people who stay

2398
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:49,679
infectious for like four

2399
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:51,759
and that's a whole other week that we're

2400
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:54,960
asking people to isolate people would

2401
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,560
probably be much more likely to comply

2402
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,920
if they only have to isolate as long as

2403
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,800
they wake up each morning and see two

2404
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,079
lines

2405
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:02,320
because you're actually seeing it for

2406
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:03,679
your own two eyes you're being empowered

2407
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:05,840
to make your own decision you're not

2408
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:07,119
being told you need to isolate for 10

2409
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,440
days and you're sitting there thinking

2410
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:10,960
oh i feel fine i don't know why you know

2411
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:13,839
there's a lot of asymptomatic spread but

2412
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:15,840
if you see the two lines

2413
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,440
every day then you actually get to

2414
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,440
you're doing a little experiment for

2415
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:21,519
yourself to prove to yourself

2416
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:23,279
today i'm still infectious let's hope

2417
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,120
it's tomorrow come on immune system you

2418
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:26,559
can do this you know and then you get to

2419
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:28,158
day four and boom you start being

2420
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,760
negative

2421
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:32,399
that's a much more tolerable thing

2422
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,639
because you are you are being able to

2423
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:37,198
make that decision based on

2424
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:39,119
true data that is empowering you and it

2425
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:40,960
really does change

2426
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:42,559
changes everything like because it's all

2427
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:45,119
fear and

2428
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,560
and empowerment and these are empowering

2429
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:48,319
devices

2430
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,000
well i wanted to have this conversation

2431
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:52,158
with you because obviously it's a great

2432
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:55,119
solution let's keep talking about it

2433
01:22:52,158 --> 01:22:56,879
people who listen to this should uh

2434
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:59,599
i guess pressure

2435
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,920
local politicians

2436
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,960
federal write articles write articles

2437
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:07,760
with the title like dear potus yeah you

2438
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,198
know please designate these as public

2439
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,960
health tools or just start talking about

2440
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:12,158
in the media talk it talk about social

2441
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,560
media anywhere

2442
01:23:12,158 --> 01:23:17,119
testing is a public health good

2443
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,880
testing is a public health good we all

2444
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:21,279
like it should not be considered a

2445
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,199
medical device

2446
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:25,359
i shouldn't have to pay

2447
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:27,279
to keep you safe like testing should

2448
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:29,519
generally be free for that matter like

2449
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:31,840
subsidized by the government

2450
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,440
these tools exist they we should all and

2451
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,159
i think the more people that generate

2452
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:38,000
noise to just say

2453
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:38,960
a public health test is a public health

2454
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,158
tool

2455
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,239
you know

2456
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:43,599
period like it's you can't even argue

2457
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:45,359
with it

2458
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,280
yeah i think

2459
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,599
if you talk about it enough then certain

2460
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:51,920
people that have even a bigger platform

2461
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,840
like elon musk sandra perchai

2462
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:56,079
though those folks that

2463
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:59,039
have power to really

2464
01:23:56,079 --> 01:24:00,479
do like large-scale manufacturing also

2465
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:02,479
influence

2466
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:04,158
governments will pay attention and

2467
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:06,319
that's that's the hope enough people

2468
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:08,638
talk about it i think business leaders

2469
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:10,639
like business leaders obviously have so

2470
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:12,880
much power here yeah

2471
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:14,319
you know they they pay the lobbyists who

2472
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,000
you know make things happen like let's

2473
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:17,679
be honest there's people who pull levers

2474
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,039
that are not the politicians themselves

2475
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:20,880
and i do think

2476
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:22,639
business leaders have so much to gain

2477
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,159
from these tools to keep their

2478
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:26,159
businesses safe to not have to

2479
01:24:24,158 --> 01:24:28,960
quarantine and lock down and i hope that

2480
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:31,198
all them hear this message to say

2481
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,439
let's let's ask the president or the

2482
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:35,839
people around the president to

2483
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:37,599
designate these as public health tools

2484
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,279
change the system

2485
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,280
and if you can't change every aspect of

2486
01:24:39,279 --> 01:24:42,840
the system then figure out how to change

2487
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:45,279
the system enough so that you're doing

2488
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:47,279
everything in a safe way

2489
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:50,559
that is not endangering anyone but it is

2490
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:52,880
only protective yeah

2491
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,960
you mentioned last time you spent time

2492
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,079
as a buddhist monk

2493
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,000
we like

2494
01:24:56,079 --> 01:24:59,600
didn't spend much time talking about i

2495
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,319
just would love to talk to you about

2496
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,679
about it a little bit more

2497
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:06,000
maybe

2498
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:07,600
as uh by way of advice

2499
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,800
how do you recommend people can

2500
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:14,480
integrate meditation into their lives

2501
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:18,480
or how does one meditate

2502
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:20,158
i i think for me meditation was

2503
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:24,399
um

2504
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:26,000
really an active effort um

2505
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:27,839
which sounds weird because most people

2506
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,600
think of meditation as like they la in

2507
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,039
the absence of activity

2508
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:34,560
um

2509
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:36,560
but just like anything uh meditation is

2510
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,639
it requires exercise

2511
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,400
in this case it requires exercise and

2512
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,400
quieting your mind

2513
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:43,759
and the whole

2514
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:45,359
well there's a lot of different reasons

2515
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,600
people meditate

2516
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:50,479
most people watching this

2517
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,480
podcast or this show what is this called

2518
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:55,359
i don't know is this a interview i'm not

2519
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:56,399
even recording this just you and i talk

2520
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:57,599
um

2521
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,000
it is

2522
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:02,400
you know most people are

2523
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,079
uh meditating to like bring some balance

2524
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,238
and bring some sanity to their life and

2525
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:08,880
just like be able to control their

2526
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:10,799
feelings and emotions a little bit more

2527
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:13,760
and for that purpose like

2528
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:15,679
i think the best way to to you know what

2529
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,679
meditation is if you can call it what

2530
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:19,600
you will it's just getting some alone

2531
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:21,600
time some time to think or not think you

2532
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:24,719
know whatever and that looks different

2533
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:27,120
for each person for me

2534
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,719
it was a very active effort to try to

2535
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:32,399
quiet my mind

2536
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:33,600
with the explicit intent to detach from

2537
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:36,000
things

2538
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:39,280
from lots of things and it's actually it

2539
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,840
sounds weird in our culture here to talk

2540
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:44,079
about detachment as a goal

2541
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:46,000
detachment from loved ones detachment

2542
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:47,760
from objects is kind of

2543
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,880
easy to reconcile like people understand

2544
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,199
that yeah i don't want to be too

2545
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,279
attached to my car or whatever

2546
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:54,719
but detachment from a loved one is like

2547
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:56,479
a very hard thing because we want to do

2548
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:58,639
the opposite usually we want to love a

2549
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:59,839
loved one

2550
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:01,840
but in

2551
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,800
a lot of buddhist thought

2552
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:07,440
it is those attachments that keep people

2553
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:09,760
in this cycle of rebirth now i don't

2554
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:12,000
personally um

2555
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,320
believe in rebirth in the way that uh

2556
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,319
you know

2557
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:18,319
in a buddhist sense and that like you

2558
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:20,638
actually get

2559
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:22,799
born multiple times i think we my

2560
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:26,319
personal feeling is we die and we're

2561
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:28,400
vanished you know um that's just me

2562
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:31,039
um and

2563
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:33,439
but i still really found meditation to

2564
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:35,519
be extraordinarily powerful

2565
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:37,678
to

2566
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,239
feel control over a whole different part

2567
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,840
of my body that i never thought that

2568
01:27:40,238 --> 01:27:44,479
it could be controlled

2569
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:48,159
your mind like you close your eyes

2570
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:49,678
and most of us immediately start seeing

2571
01:27:48,158 --> 01:27:52,719
blotches and

2572
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,639
we start thinking about things and

2573
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:55,920
and it's an amazing feeling to start

2574
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:58,319
getting to the point where you can

2575
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,319
actually

2576
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:05,439
actually quiet your mind and close

2577
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:08,639
your mind down so that you can just

2578
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:10,960
have peace like silence of your mind for

2579
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:13,359
a long period of time and you know i

2580
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,719
loved it it was you know but it's a it's

2581
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:16,319
kind of a dangerous slope because you

2582
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:17,679
can kind of get caught up in it and like

2583
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:19,599
really start

2584
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:21,199
going from okay i'm trying to quiet my

2585
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,639
mind to almost being like addicted to

2586
01:28:21,198 --> 01:28:24,960
quiet in your mind

2587
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:27,359
and it was a very active exercise every

2588
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,920
day 15 hours a day to just

2589
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:32,399
practice quieting my mind

2590
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,279
and eventually i could you know it and

2591
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:34,638
and

2592
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:36,880
in buddhism there's a whole lot of

2593
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:38,239
stages that you go through to

2594
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,840
once you hit that point where you can

2595
01:28:38,238 --> 01:28:41,119
quiet your mind then there's

2596
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,679
like other

2597
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:47,599
psychological things that happen and

2598
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:49,520
eventually the the end goal for a

2599
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,600
buddhist monk who's spending their life

2600
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,159
meditating in the forest

2601
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:56,400
is to achieve nirvana is to have

2602
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:57,920
an absence of any attachment to the

2603
01:28:56,399 --> 01:28:59,279
point where

2604
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,000
you're not even attached to your own

2605
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:03,359
foot or your own leg you can cut it off

2606
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,719
and

2607
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:06,399
you say well

2608
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:09,359
so you don't even have an attachment to

2609
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:11,759
self like to you to ego to cause do you

2610
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:13,439
feel like a conscious being or no like

2611
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,280
the goal you never attained it but you

2612
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:17,678
know i know is that the goal just that

2613
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:19,439
would be so the goal is

2614
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:21,679
you have to first look at it through the

2615
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:22,879
eyes of samsara which is the cycle of

2616
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:24,480
rebirth

2617
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,400
which is suffering it's a cycle of

2618
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:30,000
suffering it's how it's viewed and the

2619
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:32,238
idea is like if i really love this hat

2620
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,319
and then the hat gets lost i'm sad so

2621
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:36,559
that makes me suffer

2622
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:39,119
and if i hate this hat and i see it then

2623
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:41,520
it makes me sad or mad and that you know

2624
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:44,559
it's an emotion but if i have if i'm

2625
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,760
completely ambivalent about that hat

2626
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:48,000
i don't care it's there i don't care if

2627
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:51,440
it gets lost if it's shredded

2628
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,840
then that is invokes no emotional rise

2629
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:56,079
out of me good or bad and so the idea is

2630
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:57,920
to find the balance there where

2631
01:29:56,079 --> 01:30:00,238
you are so detached from everything that

2632
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:02,639
you're not getting a rise negative or

2633
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:04,799
positive and

2634
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:07,119
you know this is really it's really such

2635
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,079
a distinct

2636
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:11,519
thing

2637
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:13,439
in a relative to our normal lives here

2638
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,760
in america where

2639
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:18,079
we live for rises you know you want

2640
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:20,159
happiness and joy and then you also you

2641
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,920
know nobody wants sadness but like when

2642
01:30:20,158 --> 01:30:23,039
you come out of sadness you feel happy

2643
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,960
you understand

2644
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:27,198
either way it averages out right and if

2645
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,960
it doesn't average out then you're

2646
01:30:27,198 --> 01:30:29,919
you know you're in a bad spot like that

2647
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,439
would be

2648
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:33,119
things like major depressive disorder

2649
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:35,279
where you're truly not averaging out but

2650
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:36,639
if you're living a pretty happy life

2651
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:38,238
that's why there's no right or wrong you

2652
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,359
can go up and down and you average out

2653
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:41,359
or you can just

2654
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:43,519
go that straight line

2655
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:45,839
this is not necessarily

2656
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,280
the the buddhist ideal is somehow

2657
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,600
obviously

2658
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:52,079
the ideal you should strive for

2659
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:54,320
but the actual access exercise and

2660
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:57,679
meditation that they the buddhist monks

2661
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:57,679
use seems like um

2662
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:04,000
seems like a great tool

2663
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:07,919
for becoming aware of your own mind

2664
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,560
and that seems to be important for

2665
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:13,279
appreciating life or some some kind of

2666
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:15,440
uh experiencing life

2667
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:18,559
on a deeper level

2668
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:21,198
i i think so i mean that's my

2669
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,800
my personal opinion is yes and that i

2670
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:24,799
think it

2671
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:28,560
i don't meditate anymore

2672
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:30,719
um back in the capitalist western world

2673
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,880
where there's meetings and

2674
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:34,800
that's right i mean i stopped i i was a

2675
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:37,440
monk and then the tsunami hit

2676
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,880
and i lived in a refugee camp and i was

2677
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:40,638
that was the indian ocean tsunami in

2678
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:44,480
2004

2679
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:46,079
and it just really

2680
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:47,678
it was really interesting in sri lanka

2681
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:48,800
they wanted me i asked well what can i

2682
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:52,158
do to help

2683
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:54,639
it was it was a horrible horrible

2684
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:56,799
you know hell on earth

2685
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:59,119
experience in many ways but

2686
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,440
when i said what can i do to help

2687
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:03,679
the answer was well you could meditate

2688
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:05,279
like that's how you know be keep keep

2689
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:06,079
doing what you're doing like that's how

2690
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:08,079
you

2691
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:10,559
that's how we can get good karma and to

2692
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:12,719
me coming from like western roots

2693
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:14,560
i just couldn't deal with that i i just

2694
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:17,439
said that that doesn't make sense to me

2695
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:19,199
why would i just sit and meditate when

2696
01:32:17,439 --> 01:32:21,119
there's so much devastation happening

2697
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:22,638
here and and so i kind of stopped

2698
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:24,800
meditating then and then never really

2699
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:25,679
recovered from that time in the refugee

2700
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,119
camp

2701
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:29,920
but

2702
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:32,800
i do feel like i understand or like i am

2703
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:34,560
aware of of a part of me that most

2704
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,719
people never get the privilege to be

2705
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,800
aware of and that is a pretty profound

2706
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:41,359
and

2707
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:43,600
it's a it's a profound uh feeling i

2708
01:32:41,359 --> 01:32:45,599
think or just awareness to to say oh i

2709
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:48,079
do have the cap if i ever need to go

2710
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,719
back to that i have the capacity

2711
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:52,800
to do that and i do use it i mean i

2712
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:55,119
don't use it a lot but i use it when i

2713
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:57,840
really need to um

2714
01:32:55,119 --> 01:32:58,639
to try to like settle to settle myself

2715
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,119
to

2716
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:03,279
to actually calm

2717
01:33:01,119 --> 01:33:06,880
myself whether it's pain physical or

2718
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:09,119
emotional pain like it is possible to

2719
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:11,050
make those things go away but it just

2720
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:12,238
like anything it takes training

2721
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:14,719
[Music]

2722
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:17,198
have you if you take yourself back to

2723
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:19,359
that place you were

2724
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:21,279
you know sam harris talks about

2725
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:22,639
that through his meditation practice

2726
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:25,279
he's able to

2727
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:28,719
escape the sense of free will

2728
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:30,960
and uh this the sense of agency

2729
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:32,319
you can get away from that hey do you

2730
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,399
ever think about

2731
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:36,399
consciousness and free will

2732
01:33:34,399 --> 01:33:39,198
when when you were meditating

2733
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:40,638
like did you get some deep insight about

2734
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:43,039
the nature

2735
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:44,719
of consciousness

2736
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:47,198
that you were somehow able to escape it

2737
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:48,960
through meditation or no

2738
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:50,559
i looked at it in a much more

2739
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,399
utilitarian way

2740
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,480
i think and

2741
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:56,238
the sensation like minimizing amount of

2742
01:33:54,479 --> 01:33:57,678
thoughts in your mind and then uh

2743
01:33:56,238 --> 01:33:59,039
beginning to really appreciate the

2744
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:01,199
sensation

2745
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:02,639
yeah you weren't writing a book on the

2746
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:05,119
on free will right

2747
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:06,960
and uh i mean maybe if i kept at it you

2748
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:09,279
know there's a good chance that if the

2749
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,239
tsunami didn't happen i might still be

2750
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:11,198
sitting there on the top of that

2751
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:13,839
mountain

2752
01:34:11,198 --> 01:34:15,839
tsunamis you see uh pain you see

2753
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,920
especially um

2754
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,360
uh if you see cruelty and you're

2755
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,440
supposed to meditate through that that

2756
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:22,880
doesn't

2757
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:23,759
there's something in the human spirit

2758
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,760
that

2759
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:28,079
pushes us to want to help

2760
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:30,239
if you see somebody who's suffering

2761
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:32,319
to react to that seems like to help them

2762
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:34,799
as opposed to

2763
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:36,479
care less through meditation

2764
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,320
don't become attached to the suffering

2765
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:40,799
of others

2766
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:42,719
exactly i mean that's i i do think that

2767
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,639
that's you know and they're two totally

2768
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,800
valid ways to live life

2769
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:48,239
um they are

2770
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,800
generally i think they're ingrained in

2771
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:53,678
us pretty early in society right and

2772
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:55,760
it's hard to escape yeah what about uh

2773
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:57,039
just in general becoming detached from

2774
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:59,360
possessions

2775
01:34:57,039 --> 01:35:02,158
like minimalism

2776
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:03,679
in uh not having many things so the the

2777
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:05,679
capitalist world

2778
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:08,158
kind of

2779
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:09,039
pushes you towards having possessions

2780
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:11,198
and

2781
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:12,639
deriving joy from more and more and

2782
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:14,399
better possessions

2783
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:16,239
have you um

2784
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:17,439
have you returned back to the joys of

2785
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:19,198
that world

2786
01:35:17,439 --> 01:35:20,319
or do you find yourself

2787
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:22,079
enjoying

2788
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:26,158
the minimalist life

2789
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:29,039
uh a little of both i think i

2790
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:31,599
really don't like i find things to be a

2791
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:33,600
burden to be a massive burden

2792
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:35,360
yeah and

2793
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,280
and to me when you have a burden like

2794
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:39,439
that you know even if it's just knowing

2795
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:42,319
that there's like boxes in your basement

2796
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:44,158
of stuff you know whatever it might be

2797
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:45,279
it makes it hard to

2798
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:47,359
focus

2799
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:49,519
um and so

2800
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:51,839
i personally like

2801
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,360
i mean my ideal like if i had a

2802
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:57,199
my house for example would be to have

2803
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:58,719
like nothing on anything it just

2804
01:35:57,198 --> 01:36:01,039
and and

2805
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:03,439
that to me is like peaceful some people

2806
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:06,238
find that to be not peaceful

2807
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:09,678
for me it's like i love the night to

2808
01:36:06,238 --> 01:36:11,359
have the night the idea that

2809
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:14,239
if needed i could like

2810
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:16,399
pack up and move yeah and not worry

2811
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:18,079
about anything do i actually have that

2812
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:18,879
in reality

2813
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:21,039
no

2814
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,199
um we're about to have a baby

2815
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:24,479
you know there's but it's like it's our

2816
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:26,238
i already see it it's like stressful

2817
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:29,118
there's like boxes of stuff showing up

2818
01:36:26,238 --> 01:36:31,198
at the house like bottles and

2819
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:32,719
clothes and all these little hats and

2820
01:36:31,198 --> 01:36:35,678
whatnot and

2821
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:38,399
i do i do have to like sometimes go into

2822
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:41,520
my meditation to just

2823
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:42,399
just say like this is okay you know

2824
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:46,000
like it's

2825
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:48,799
it's okay to have all of this stuff

2826
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,118
it's not permanent you know and um but i

2827
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:53,279
do think that it's easy to get lost in

2828
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:54,880
it all and it's important to remember

2829
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:56,319
given all that like people who buy

2830
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:58,560
houses

2831
01:36:56,319 --> 01:37:00,559
you know buy a home and buy a house and

2832
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:03,039
make a home out of it and you start a

2833
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,800
family it's easy to

2834
01:37:03,039 --> 01:37:08,079
forget that even though you have all

2835
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:11,199
these responsibilities you're still free

2836
01:37:08,079 --> 01:37:13,679
and like freedom takes work and it takes

2837
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:15,839
remembering it takes meditation on it

2838
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:18,000
but you're you're free

2839
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,600
you're you're born free you live free i

2840
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,439
mean depends of course which country but

2841
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,719
in the united states even with all the

2842
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:25,279
possessions

2843
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:26,880
even with all the burdens

2844
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:29,679
of um

2845
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:31,118
sort of credit and owing money and all

2846
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:32,079
those kinds of things

2847
01:37:31,118 --> 01:37:34,880
you can

2848
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:37,760
scale everything down and you're free

2849
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:39,920
but ultimately the people you love

2850
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:42,800
if you love each other it doesn't take

2851
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:45,118
much money to be happy together

2852
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:47,920
and for me i i personally value that

2853
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:49,599
freedom of having the freedom to always

2854
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:52,639
pursue your happiness as opposed to

2855
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:54,800
being burdened by material possessions

2856
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:56,960
that uh

2857
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,719
you know yeah that basically limit your

2858
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,800
ability to be happy because you're

2859
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:02,480
always paying off stuff you're always

2860
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,920
catching you know trying to match the

2861
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:06,158
neighbors that are always a little bit

2862
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:09,039
richer that kind of pursuit i think that

2863
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:11,519
pursuit is wonderful for innovation and

2864
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:13,519
for building cooler better things but on

2865
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:15,360
an individual level

2866
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:17,920
i think you have to remember that first

2867
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:19,679
of all life is finite and second of all

2868
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:21,600
like your goal is not to get a bigger

2869
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:23,840
house your goal is to be just content

2870
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:26,239
and happy

2871
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:28,079
right in the moment i completely

2872
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:30,559
completely agree with that

2873
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:32,880
so in looking at our failure

2874
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:34,800
at scale

2875
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:38,159
to

2876
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,600
to engineer to manufacture to deploy

2877
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:41,759
tests

2878
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,520
how do you feel about our prospect as a

2879
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,039
human civilization

2880
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:47,280
are you optimistic

2881
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:48,319
so this pandemic

2882
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:49,439
it is

2883
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:52,639
what it is

2884
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:54,799
it um hurt a lot of people both

2885
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:57,279
it took lives

2886
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:00,480
but it also hurt a lot of businesses and

2887
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:02,238
a lot of people economically

2888
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:04,238
but uh they're

2889
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:05,599
very likely to be a much worse pandemic

2890
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:07,839
down the line there might be other

2891
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,800
threats to human civilization

2892
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,639
are you nevertheless optimistic

2893
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,600
oh i don't think i'm optimistic about it

2894
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:16,800
all

2895
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:18,320
i think what are you most worried about

2896
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,480
i it's it's one of those things so

2897
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:22,238
existential that i don't worry about it

2898
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:24,399
um

2899
01:39:22,238 --> 01:39:26,319
but i do think i mean let's in the

2900
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:28,319
united states for example so you asked

2901
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:30,479
about the human civilization but let's

2902
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:31,439
talk about like a american society for a

2903
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:33,359
moment

2904
01:39:31,439 --> 01:39:35,919
i do think that like we're

2905
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:37,359
probably seeing like

2906
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,679
the end of a really interesting

2907
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:42,238
experiment like the american experiment

2908
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,679
and we're seeing its limitations

2909
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:45,839
we're probably going to become another

2910
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,520
blip like another one another power

2911
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,520
that's in the history books that like

2912
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,880
rose and collapsed probably that's where

2913
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:54,480
we'll go

2914
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:57,039
in terms of civilization i think

2915
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:59,439
we're demonstrating a pretty significant

2916
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:01,840
inability to

2917
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:03,279
recognize the danger when

2918
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,239
whether that's the pandemic or whether

2919
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:06,238
that's climate change

2920
01:40:06,399 --> 01:40:13,439
i think it's extraordinary that we

2921
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:14,480
we are not taking these things seriously

2922
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:16,799
yeah and

2923
01:40:14,479 --> 01:40:20,238
we're not acting with the urgency and i

2924
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:22,800
mean in some ways climate change

2925
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:25,519
truly makes like this pandemic look like

2926
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:28,639
child's play in terms of like the

2927
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:30,400
destruction it has the potential to read

2928
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:32,480
i tend to think if you just look at the

2929
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:34,719
progress of human history

2930
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:37,678
that the people

2931
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:40,480
who do good in the world

2932
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:42,960
out power the people that are the

2933
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:45,439
that do bad in the world so we kind of

2934
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,920
there's something about our minds

2935
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:50,638
that likes to focus on the negative like

2936
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,000
on the destructive because we're afraid

2937
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:53,840
of it

2938
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,639
it's also for some reason more fun to

2939
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:59,760
watch destruction i don't you know

2940
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:03,600
but it seems like the people who build

2941
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:07,280
who create solutions who um

2942
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:08,159
yeah who innovate and who just put

2943
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:10,079
like

2944
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:11,359
both on the emotional level so love out

2945
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:12,158
there and

2946
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:14,238
like

2947
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:16,559
on the actual engineering level tools

2948
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:18,559
that make for higher quality of life i

2949
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,679
think those win out if you look at human

2950
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:21,679
history

2951
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:24,399
um but the question is whether the

2952
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:26,399
negative stuff can sometimes peak to the

2953
01:41:24,399 --> 01:41:28,638
level where everybody's just destroyed

2954
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:31,198
but as long as that doesn't happen

2955
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:33,440
i i tend to believe that there would be

2956
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:35,759
like a gradual with some

2957
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:38,158
noise a gradual improvement of quality

2958
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,719
of life in human civilization

2959
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:42,399
i do think so to a certain extent but

2960
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:44,158
it's that what's what you said like

2961
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:46,879
unless there's like some

2962
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:49,359
significant peak of bad you know the

2963
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:51,440
the problem with bad

2964
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:52,960
is that it can happen like that you know

2965
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,359
good

2966
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:57,600
you can you can't build a society

2967
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,839
overnight but you sure can kill one

2968
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,480
like i just think

2969
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:03,679
about

2970
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:05,599
food crises and instability and just i

2971
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:08,960
don't know but i do hope that i mean i

2972
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:11,920
completely agree i think we can engineer

2973
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:15,359
our way to a healthier

2974
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:17,679
better world like i truly do

2975
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:20,000
my concern is that the people who are

2976
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:22,560
doing that until very recently

2977
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:25,118
don't generally rule the world

2978
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:29,039
now of course we're seeing

2979
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:29,920
non-elected leaders and you know people

2980
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:33,679
who

2981
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:36,158
run massive corporations essentially

2982
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:38,719
having as much or really more power than

2983
01:42:36,158 --> 01:42:39,920
elected leaders or than kings and queens

2984
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,000
and such

2985
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:44,158
so how they choose to wield that power

2986
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,560
you know is an interesting choice and i

2987
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:48,879
do hope that you're right in that

2988
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:50,239
over time

2989
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:53,118
fear

2990
01:42:50,238 --> 01:42:54,799
will drive companies to

2991
01:42:53,118 --> 01:42:56,719
produce a better product or whatever you

2992
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:59,199
know something like over time it's just

2993
01:42:56,719 --> 01:43:01,520
like predator prey models

2994
01:42:59,198 --> 01:43:03,839
you get so bad or so everything like

2995
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:05,600
it's so revved up that all of a sudden

2996
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,600
something cracks and they say okay i do

2997
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,719
want an electric car or whatever like

2998
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,560
and

2999
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:11,760
and that takes some combination of

3000
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:13,119
innovation

3001
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,440
letting people know that these electric

3002
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:17,599
cars exist it's kind of rapid tests too

3003
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:18,479
like you get to finally feel it and see

3004
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:20,320
it

3005
01:43:18,479 --> 01:43:21,839
have an electric car and then all of a

3006
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:23,519
sudden things change and everyone says

3007
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,600
oh this is so bad and actually i'm doing

3008
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,800
good for the world relatively speaking

3009
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,800
and

3010
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,840
you know i guess it's a paradigm shift

3011
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,239
yeah

3012
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,199
it becomes uh lack of a better word

3013
01:43:32,238 --> 01:43:34,959
viral

3014
01:43:33,198 --> 01:43:36,000
positivity does

3015
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,239
and

3016
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,399
i mean i believe that ultimately that

3017
01:43:38,238 --> 01:43:42,718
that wins out

3018
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:45,359
because i think there's much more power

3019
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:47,840
to be gained so i think most people want

3020
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:51,198
to do good and if you want to wield

3021
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:54,079
power you want to uh

3022
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:56,559
channeled people's desire to do good

3023
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:58,880
and i think over time that's that's

3024
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:01,119
exactly what people uh

3025
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:03,279
will do but yeah this i mean both on the

3026
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:04,799
natural side the pandemic you know

3027
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:06,319
there's still biology at play there's

3028
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,960
still viruses out there trying to help

3029
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:11,519
us there's accidents uh there's nuclear

3030
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,880
weapons there's unintended consequences

3031
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,440
of tools whether it's on the

3032
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:17,199
nanotechnology side or the artificial

3033
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:19,359
intelligence side then there's the

3034
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:22,158
natural things like meteors and all that

3035
01:44:19,359 --> 01:44:23,839
that kind of stuff and yeah climate

3036
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:25,039
change

3037
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:27,119
all of that

3038
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:29,039
but i tend to think

3039
01:44:27,118 --> 01:44:30,559
we humans are a clever bunch and when

3040
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:33,600
there's a deadline

3041
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:35,600
a real deadline or real threat before us

3042
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,960
we kind of step up

3043
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:39,440
i don't know but

3044
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:42,239
maybe you have to believe that

3045
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:43,919
um until the very end

3046
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:44,959
yeah

3047
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,719
that's

3048
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,639
that's right it will oh i mean we'll

3049
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:49,520
have to see i guess you know neither

3050
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:51,350
well

3051
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,440
ideally we won't be alive to see that

3052
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:56,320
[Laughter]

3053
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:58,719
well no michael i'm glad we talk again

3054
01:44:56,319 --> 01:45:01,279
because um

3055
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:04,800
this has been such a difficult time that

3056
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:07,439
feels like there's no solutions

3057
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:10,320
and it's so refreshing to hear

3058
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:12,319
that there's a solution to covid and

3059
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:14,719
it's an engineering solution on the

3060
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:16,238
individual level something people can do

3061
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:18,719
on the government level is something

3062
01:45:16,238 --> 01:45:20,638
people can do on the global level

3063
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:23,279
something people can do we should be

3064
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,480
doing rapid testing at scale it's

3065
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:28,399
obvious

3066
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:28,399
it's amazing that you still

3067
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:34,000
are you know telling that story pushing

3068
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,440
that message bravely boldly i really

3069
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:39,359
really appreciate the work you're doing

3070
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:40,559
man and i'm i i will do in my small way

3071
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:42,479
uh the same

3072
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:44,800
to try to help out and everybody else

3073
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:46,319
should too until we get

3074
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:48,639
hundreds of millions of tests in

3075
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:50,238
people's hands uh it's an obvious

3076
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:51,359
solution we should have had a long time

3077
01:45:50,238 --> 01:45:53,919
ago

3078
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:53,920
and um

3079
01:45:54,479 --> 01:45:59,599
i like solutions not problems and this

3080
01:45:57,118 --> 01:46:01,039
is obviously a solution so thank you for

3081
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,440
presenting it to the world and thank you

3082
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:05,920
for talking about it

3083
01:46:03,439 --> 01:46:07,599
it's it's something that i can't not do

3084
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,520
if it saves one person's life then it

3085
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:12,960
was worth the two years of

3086
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:14,880
lobbying for this you know and uh so

3087
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,560
let's hope we see a change

3088
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:18,560
thanks for talking today

3089
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,679
