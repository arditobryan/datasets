list goes on it's just some of the

biggest movies in history

32
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,519
what does it take to make an epic movie

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,478
like that or what does it take to make

34
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,438
it happen from start to finish

35
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,438
well

36
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:22,399
look i i've been enamored with movies

37
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,079
since i was a kid as a fan and i think

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
what you need

39
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,399
is to is to be able to tell a great

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,600
story

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,478
and if you're going to tell a great

42
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,239
story

43
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,200
you need a great director

44
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,118
you got to start with a fantastic script

45
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,200
um that

46
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,359
you know is able to take some of these

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,520
iconic characters that we did

48
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,799
and put your own stamp on it while still

49
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:48,000
respecting uh the mythology

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,360
and uh i had zero experience in movies

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
and television before i started

52
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,118
legendary so it was it was a very

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,159
interesting trip

54
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,399
total luck uh that uh

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,040
we had the opportunity to make five

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,478
movies at the time with chris nolan who

57
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,320
turned out to be one of the greatest

58
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,640
filmmakers of all time

59
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,280
but it's uh each one is its own little

60
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,959
startup company uh and i don't think

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
there's any formula

62
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,439
to get there but i know that if you

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,680
don't have a great director and a great

64
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,919
script if you don't have that foundation

65
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
it's hard to pull off who's the ceo of

66
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,759
that little start-up company companies

67
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,599
the the director who would you say kind

68
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,199
of defines the success or the failure of

69
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,919
a movie well

70
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,000
when you build a big movie like that

71
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,839
it's an enormous effort

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,639
360 degrees i mean from digital

73
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,878
effects

74
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,719
certainly the actors i mean if you have

75
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,318
an amazing script an amazing director

76
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,800
but you don't believe anybody playing

77
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:46,000
the parts that's a problem so the reason

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,319
i think it was

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,400
so difficult to pull off is always used

80
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,238
to say you start with a stack

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,840
of papers with words on it called a

82
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,680
script

83
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,759
bring that to life

84
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,599
and you're asking an audience to believe

85
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,318
in everything that you're trying to

86
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,399
put out there and you've got a cast

87
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,238
that even if they're immensely talented

88
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,640
individually they have to mesh together

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,759
they have to have chemistry together

90
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,079
um

91
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,399
and you know the director is kind of the

92
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,120
general on the the battlefield but

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,400
if you have a strong producer who's very

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,759
hands-on but it truly to me is each one

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
had its own

96
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,759
story in its own sort of

97
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,158
how it came to be and why it why it

98
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,639
worked or didn't work

99
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,479
so you said you were new to the industry

100
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,479
but you did a lot of revolutionary

101
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,679
things with legendary

102
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,359
so at that time and now what is the uh

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,200
the good the bad and ugly of the

104
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,959
business of filmmaking

105
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,359
what what are some interesting holes

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,280
that you were able to or like problems

107
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,000
that you were able to fix

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,759
what problems still exist that can still

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,639
be solved

110
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,199
well

111
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,079
look the the business has changed so

112
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,399
radically since 2004.

113
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,680
when i started legendary dvds were still

114
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,959
a cash cow

115
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,438
so you know

116
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,120
that's how how far things have come

117
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,280
but i i would say a couple of things the

118
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,719
reason that i started it from a business

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,640
perspective

120
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,759
was at the time it was a 30 billion

121
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,719
dollar industry and there was no

122
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,399
institutional capital around

123
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,479
the movie business and i was fascinated

124
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,799
by that because almost every other

125
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,959
category that you look at of that size

126
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,680
has institutional capital private equity

127
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,959
etc is kind of a cottage industry set up

128
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,160
around it

129
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,239
and i was

130
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,919
perplexed and fascinated that that

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,759
didn't occur and the way the movie

132
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,959
business worked was unlike any business

133
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,360
i'd ever

134
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,680
looked at before so

135
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,080
after kind of convincing myself

136
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
that you could actually make money if

137
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,719
you were disciplined and had the right

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,960
approach

139
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,880
uh you know went out raised the money

140
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,599
from the capital markets markets which

141
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,199
was uh herculean still maybe the hardest

142
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
thing i've ever

143
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
done in my career

144
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,840
to walk around and say look i have no

145
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,800
experience

146
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,038
i've never done this before but you know

147
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,800
and the second thing being very

148
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,560
fortunate at the time

149
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,680
was able to partner up with warner

150
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,000
brothers

151
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,680
warner's at the time was run by a man

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,439
named alan horn

153
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,478
who besides being creative is also a

154
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,079
harvard mba so really understood what i

155
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,360
wanted to do

156
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,038
um and alan you know was just an

157
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,280
absolute gentleman someone that i still

158
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,800
look up to to these to this day

159
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,758
after warner brothers he went and ran

160
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,120
disney

161
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,038
with their run

162
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,240
you know between marvel and star wars

163
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:37,599
and everything and

164
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
so between

165
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,000
uh alan being responsible for harry

166
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
potter the dark knight stuff and then on

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,199
to all the disney stuff he probably had

168
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
as great a career as anyone i've ever

169
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,000
heard of

170
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,038
in the movie business

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,360
so

172
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,879
my first focus was around sort of two

173
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,360
concepts global worldwide large

174
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,600
tentpole films and franchises

175
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,280
and then the business aspect of being

176
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,520
bringing long-term

177
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:08,239
institutional capital to bear i'm going

178
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,240
to ask you dumb questions which is uh

179
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
part of the style i guess

180
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
but just for people who don't know uh

181
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,319
including me

182
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,639
what is institutional what is capital

183
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,960
what is institutional capital what is

184
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,840
equity what is private equity got it

185
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:26,959
okay well so

186
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,918
if um if you're starting a company

187
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,839
and

188
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,680
you go around to a bunch of your

189
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,318
successful friends and say hey you

190
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,720
should invest in my company well that

191
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,039
that's sort of uh that's great and it's

192
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,639
capital but it's not

193
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,759
getting money from fidelity or tea row

194
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,519
or

195
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,319
you know a sovereign wealth fund or an

196
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:52,159
endowment fund from a university that

197
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,080
has large pools of organized capital

198
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,400
that has a long

199
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,560
term point of view on your business

200
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,439
so if you get money from

201
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,399
your neighbor who's a successful dentist

202
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,719
next year

203
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,279
the dentist may say hey

204
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,960
times are hard i need my money back

205
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,879
if you're partners with you know

206
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,478
fidelity or morgan stanley or any of

207
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,680
these institutions

208
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:14,800
they have the capital and the

209
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,280
wherewithal

210
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,439
uh to to say okay i'm looking at this

211
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,359
over the next five to ten years

212
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,839
and i thought there was an opportunity

213
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,080
to bring that type of capital

214
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,839
to the to the movie business

215
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:32,719
uh to to be patient and the benefit of

216
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:34,959
that patient so it's long term

217
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,639
you have to deal with fewer parties and

218
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:40,239
they would do much larger investments

219
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,840
so what what are the benefits what are

220
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,160
the sort of the challenges of that kind

221
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,719
of investment well i think the benefits

222
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,960
in some ways are there professionals who

223
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,479
are largely dispassionate right it's

224
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,439
like look if you're hitting the numbers

225
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,478
you told me and you're hitting your plan

226
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,719
great

227
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,519
um and the other the other thing that

228
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,520
always

229
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,719
was interesting to me about the movie

230
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,198
business

231
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,879
is if i'm investing in an artificial

232
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,680
intelligence company or a chipset

233
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,759
company or something like that

234
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,759
a lot of the institutions don't have the

235
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,120
technical expertise to really truly

236
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,598
grasp

237
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,120
what's being done so they don't you know

238
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,800
other than good business practices

239
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,360
they're not offering every little

240
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,038
opinion the movies and television are

241
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,840
completely approachable

242
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,560
meaning everybody has an opinion

243
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,239
so

244
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,399
you know whether it's i think you guys

245
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,399
chose the wrong actor for that or why

246
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,038
did you do that move it's it's

247
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,120
so it invites a lot more

248
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,278
sort of second guessing and things like

249
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,879
that so that was always uh

250
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,039
one of the idiosyncrasies of the

251
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,639
business that i thought was uh

252
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,399
you know was interesting

253
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,159
um and and then

254
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,159
when you talk about private equity

255
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,120
versus public equity if you're a public

256
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,120
company where the companies can

257
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,360
are traded you want to buy microsoft

258
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,080
shares you just go to your broker

259
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,000
go on td ameritrade and buy them if on

260
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,600
the other hand uh you're talking about

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,039
private equity that's

262
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,320
uh institutions or individuals investing

263
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,240
in private companies um so thus the if

264
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,560
you have pools of capital that mostly

265
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,480
invest in private equity deals that

266
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,000
that's how you how you'd think about it

267
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,639
it's difficult to make those happen

268
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,519
because it's individuals you have to

269
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,439
sort of

270
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,200
what have dinners and

271
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,600
agree so it's much less

272
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,519
it's a much more human much less

273
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,920
mechanical i would say

274
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,879
yeah now and again massive difference

275
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,199
between large private equity

276
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,799
shops who are professionalized and in

277
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,839
the same category that i mentioned

278
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,120
earlier

279
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,680
uh versus private individuals

280
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,000
who are wealthy or whatever but again

281
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,278
it's it's much more individualized when

282
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,839
you're going

283
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,399
uh to people who like your idea and just

284
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,680
say i'd like to invest in this is there

285
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,278
is that

286
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,359
from all the kinds of investments you've

287
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,120
seen

288
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,959
what do you think is the most conducive

289
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,720
to creating

290
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,039
works of genius

291
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,879
whether that's in technology ai space or

292
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,000
whether that's in movies sure so

293
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:18,720
creating something special in this world

294
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,559
i would say a couple of things

295
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
enough money

296
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,639
that whatever endeavor

297
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,079
you you're you're going into

298
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,278
that you're not

299
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,039
so nervous about the edges right if my

300
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,600
if i have a hundred dollars to spend and

301
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,838
i'm i think i can create a perpetual

302
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,600
motion machine or something for 104

303
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,120
i can't do it because they're all over

304
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,159
me about the budget so i would say

305
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,320
making sure that you have enough capital

306
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,199
making sure that that capital is patient

307
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
enough

308
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,040
so that it's you know if you're going to

309
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,879
do things that are extraordinary

310
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,719
it takes some time

311
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,078
and you're going to break stuff

312
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,399
right you're going to make mistakes

313
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,000
you're going to have a whole bunch of

314
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,519
film on the cutting room floor so to

315
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,799
speak or if you're in the lab you're

316
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,078
going to have a whole bunch of broken

317
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,240
stuff

318
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,838
and i also think it's very important at

319
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,200
the beginning

320
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,360
and i always try to do this with

321
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,519
companies i invest in or buy

322
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,440
is make sure that you have a

323
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,240
philosophical

324
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,079
and somewhat mechanical alignment with

325
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,200
the management team

326
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,559
so that

327
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,879
going in

328
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,599
you both understand hey this is how we

329
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,399
think about this problem or this company

330
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,079
this is what we feel like our culture is

331
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,000
this is what our goal is and these are

332
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,599
the metrics by which we'll agree to

333
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,559
measure them by

334
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
because

335
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,039
if you don't have that shared

336
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,800
you know hey we're going to take this

337
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,799
journey

338
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,958
then i think that's where people get

339
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,240
upset disappointed etc

340
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,719
what about

341
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,240
this is a weird question but constraints

342
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,639
so this is both for filmmaking and

343
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,959
investment

344
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,399
do you think more money is always better

345
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,518
no

346
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,679
so i

347
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,240
i like constraints a lot

348
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,479
it's like constraints

349
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,799
and almost like a desperation and

350
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,440
deadlines are uh

351
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:15,120
catalysts for creativity for uh for

352
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,839
productivity for sort of uh innovation

353
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,799
so can you can you kind of speak to that

354
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,360
sure as an investor as a creator like

355
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,399
what's uh what's the right balance here

356
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,639
well i i think if you're focused on a

357
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,919
particular problem or a company or a

358
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,320
thesis is if you have that focus

359
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,078
and you feel like i have unlimited

360
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,200
resources

361
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,719
or renewable resources so there's really

362
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,120
there's no

363
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,519
leverage in the situation

364
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,159
right there's no

365
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,039
if i fail at this i'll just go get more

366
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,559
money

367
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,120
right i'll just go

368
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,559
i i think that's a hard way to be

369
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,679
resilient

370
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,119
uh and and to think of new ways to solve

371
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,638
problems

372
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,159
um

373
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,799
so i think

374
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,360
capitalizing things just

375
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,879
you know to the nth degree

376
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,278
does create some problems so i think

377
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,838
there's that perfect blend of

378
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,000
don't starve the oxygen to the point

379
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,560
where you make short-term decisions or

380
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,559
non-strategic or thoughtful decisions

381
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,000
because you got to pay the rent and on

382
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,719
the other hand

383
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,839
you you can't have it be like this

384
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,759
you know everlasting gobstopper of

385
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,600
whatever you want will just keep flowing

386
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,958
the cash because that doesn't create any

387
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,399
friction points

388
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:39,759
that i think um do

389
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,278
result in in works of genius in in

390
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,559
things that uh

391
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,278
you know

392
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,278
that that are transformative and

393
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,399
one of the things that is interesting to

394
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,039
me

395
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,919
about society sort of

396
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,319
writ large is

397
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,719
i think that when you go through hard

398
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,720
times

399
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,120
and you have to do things that are

400
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:03,919
uncomfortable and you don't want to do

401
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,320
them

402
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:09,198
because you're tired because you're

403
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,199
that in some ways builds up that you're

404
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,639
comfortable being uncomfortable

405
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,719
muscle

406
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,959
and i i sometimes think we're losing

407
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,839
that a little bit and you you can't sort

408
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,198
of paint with a wide brush but

409
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,040
um

410
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,559
you know i i that's that's one of the

411
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,519
things that i kind of

412
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,838
observe and and hope that we don't

413
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,000
go that way i i do think challenge and

414
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,959
discomfort are a kind of gift

415
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,039
because uh like overcoming that it's

416
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,719
like uh from from every perspective from

417
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,879
a human perspective it's a source of

418
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,480
happiness and fulfillment overcoming

419
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,679
challenge but from a business

420
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,519
perspective

421
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,719
i see like if something is really

422
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,879
difficult

423
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,278
to me it's also a sign that most others

424
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,240
would or many others would fail at this

425
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,639
point

426
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,879
so like it's a feature it's nice that

427
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,879
something is difficult when

428
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,439
when people tell you that something is

429
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,958
impossible i love that because it's like

430
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,880
all right well then that's what a lot of

431
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,879
people would believe

432
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,958
and that gives you an opportunity to be

433
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,799
the person who shows it's not impossible

434
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,399
and you of course you might be wrong but

435
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,919
if you're not wrong you have the

436
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,839
opportunity to stand out so going

437
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,799
through that hardship taking those big

438
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,480
risks is going to really pay off so like

439
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,639
discomfort

440
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,639
is a

441
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,198
it's a feature not a bug

442
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,079
of both personal life it's just good for

443
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,719
life

444
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,799
but uh for business it seems like just

445
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800
just good business sense

446
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,479
if something is hard it's probably a

447
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,519
good idea to do that

448
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,879
yeah because most others will fail

449
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,879
fun question i don't know if you can

450
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,360
answer this but uh what's the most

451
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:49,600
expensive movie you were involved with

452
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,600
to make and why was it

453
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,759
you don't have to say numbers but like

454
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,560
do is something stand out as being

455
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,199
exceptionally expensive and why this is

456
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,799
expensive um

457
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,919
i think jurassic world was pretty

458
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,639
expensive

459
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,679
work i mean worked out great

460
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,879
um

461
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,559
and uh that's like that's an epic film

462
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,240
by the way it it

463
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,879
look it's uh

464
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,600
it's it's one of my favorites they just

465
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,320
did an amazing job and frankly

466
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,040
the crazy thing about my life

467
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,680
is all the stuff that i loved as a kid

468
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,198
somehow came full circle back into my

469
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,239
adult life

470
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,078
and having the opportunity

471
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,759
while i was out there to

472
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,120
to develop a friendship with steven

473
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,839
spielberg

474
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,440
and then have have my name on the same

475
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,279
film as steven spielberg i mean that

476
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,120
that was

477
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,240
pretty surreal

478
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,879
um

479
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,959
so that was an expensive film um you

480
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,120
know dark knight rises was it was an

481
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,719
expensive film but again to me there's a

482
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,399
difference between expensive and

483
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,800
irresponsible

484
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,399
and expensive because the vision

485
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,000
warranted

486
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,159
and it turned out financially it

487
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,160
certainly did yeah with jurassic world

488
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,759
it's

489
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,319
i mean i can't imagine having those

490
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,240
meetings because like you have to create

491
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,159
so much and so much of it is obviously

492
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,078
not real you can't

493
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,880
bring dinosaurs in a

494
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,519
yeah

495
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,799
uh is that where a lot of the cost is is

496
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:19,918
in the

497
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,400
uh

498
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,959
you know the computer side of things

499
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,519
yeah those are generally pretty

500
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,440
massive components of uh of the budget

501
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,160
and especially if you're

502
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,798
doing it and inventing things yeah as

503
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,679
you go i mean jim cameron is one of

504
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,759
those

505
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,400
filmmakers who

506
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,839
you know is is designing the plane

507
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,640
as it's flying in such a brilliant way

508
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:49,519
and uh i you know i've got to know him

509
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,799
over the years and just in awe

510
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:55,119
of the way his brain works and uh so

511
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,879
yeah it's it's a big component

512
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,119
can you speak a little bit more to him

513
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,880
in terms of uh because you're such a

514
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,798
fascinating person

515
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,799
because you care a lot about technology

516
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,918
you care a lot about the cutting edge of

517
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,400
technology

518
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,320
so how does he a creator

519
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,880
a director

520
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,319
build the plane while it's flying like

521
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
what's the role of innovation in this

522
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,038
whole process

523
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,400
well um

524
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:23,119
so i never made a film with jim i'm just

525
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,200
a huge fan and got to know him

526
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:28,639
um and john landau his producing partner

527
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,759
and one of the things that just

528
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,520
fascinates me about jim is so he makes

529
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,599
titanic and there's a bunch of

530
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,359
underwater cameras and things that they

531
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,678
need that don't exist

532
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,959
so he goes and invents them

533
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,840
and

534
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,319
you know has a good grasp of engineering

535
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:50,319
and has not only the imagination but the

536
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:52,639
ability to lead a team to build them

537
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,879
i got to go down early when they were

538
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,720
shooting avatar

539
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,400
at a warehouse i think it was where they

540
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,558
were shooting and as they were

541
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,320
explaining to me

542
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,639
how they were capturing it and that they

543
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,879
could go back later because they created

544
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,080
the environment

545
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,039
it blew my mind and i said okay this is

546
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,038
truly

547
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,720
people talk about a a big leap this

548
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,720
certainly is one so

549
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,640
he has continued

550
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,960
to push the envelope

551
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,600
in terms of the art of the possible and

552
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,000
i i just think he's an incredible genius

553
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,639
in that way

554
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,960
again another hard question so you uh in

555
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,440
the realm of music care about story

556
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,200
storytelling

557
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,200
is there some aspect in which money

558
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,679
and beautiful graphics get in the way of

559
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,679
story

560
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,120
in filmmaking so if you think

561
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,200
um if you think about jurassic world

562
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,199
obviously that's an experience like any

563
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,200
other

564
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,679
like what do we what do you think about

565
00:19:54,079 --> 00:20:00,159
the tension between

566
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,360
story experience and like visual

567
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,720
effects

568
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,879
well look

569
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,279
if you're using

570
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,000
big effect shots

571
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,440
and all kinds of tricks to cover over

572
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,679
the fact that you don't have a very

573
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,159
interesting story to tell

574
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,840
that's where i think it gets in the way

575
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,559
um

576
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,720
where i think you have these incredible

577
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,038
filmmakers we mentioned chris nolan and

578
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,319
jim cameron guillermo del toro

579
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,879
um

580
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:32,079
you know you could go on and on

581
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,080
of folks that

582
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,399
just see the world differently and use

583
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,799
technology

584
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,480
to enhance the storytelling right to

585
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,000
make you believe

586
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,960
uh differently

587
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,960
uh rather to to make you

588
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,960
not just suspend your disbelief but to

589
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,600
feel like you're immersed in it

590
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,240
um so i've certainly seen it done

591
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,079
expertly and i've seen it done poorly

592
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,440
uh you've talked about this a little bit

593
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,599
in the past

594
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,320
you kind of uh left

595
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:04,719
the the movie-making business at an

596
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,038
interesting time perhaps you saw the

597
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,640
changes

598
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:12,000
there's been a lot of excitement with

599
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,799
netflix with tv so the the role of film

600
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,079
in society has changed so

601
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,960
what do you think is the future of

602
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:21,599
movies versus tv like if you are as a

603
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,798
business person as a creator as a

604
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:24,639
consumer

605
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,440
as a technologist

606
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,640
or thinking about the next 10 20 years

607
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,519
what do you think is going to be the

608
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,159
the godfather the great

609
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,079
pieces that move us as a society in the

610
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,080
next 10 20 years this is going to be tv

611
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,918
is it going to be movie is it going to

612
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,519
be uh tick tock

613
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,559
uh clips

614
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,599
what is it

615
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,480
well

616
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:50,480
so i i and i think the other category

617
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,759
that i would add to that that will be

618
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,440
the next great medium is truly immersive

619
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,679
virtual reality

620
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,400
uh in which

621
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,679
new storytellers will emerge

622
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,559
especially when you can go into vr

623
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,159
and there's enough computing power

624
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,240
to sustain it

625
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,640
and to allow it to be social

626
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,640
and you know for you to have different

627
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,120
paths to go down

628
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,038
that'll be i think the next realm of

629
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,038
what storytelling and experience will

630
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:23,279
will look like so do you think a video

631
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,038
game kind of world or is it more movies

632
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:28,079
or is it more

633
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:31,679
social network or is it all the kind of

634
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:34,079
blending reality and gaming and movies

635
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,240
yeah i thought uh if you saw ready

636
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,960
player one which i loved the book and

637
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,240
and the movie was cool too

638
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,480
but you know that that's one version of

639
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,599
it right where you go in

640
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,440
now everybody's talking about the

641
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,519
metaverse and all that but you go into a

642
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,120
world that's fully rendered

643
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:54,158
as yourself and you interact with that

644
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,558
world the other side of it is to go in

645
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,200
somewhere between being a passive

646
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:01,440
observer but being able to move around

647
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
your point of view and experiences

648
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,919
which i think is interesting

649
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,840
and then i think another another

650
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,640
adventure so to speak i could think of

651
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,798
is

652
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,120
a blend of video games so there's a

653
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,879
mission right there's a there's

654
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,639
obstacles there's everything and you

655
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,799
move through it

656
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,038
but it's immersive and it tells a story

657
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,720
at the same time and that's why i think

658
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:26,319
you're going to see

659
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,919
new amazing storytellers

660
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,839
that we don't know yet

661
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,000
that understand how to innovate and how

662
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,399
to make you feel something in in that

663
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,839
environment

664
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,840
and to your earlier point you know i

665
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:44,720
saw probably around 2015

666
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:47,519
when netflix decided to

667
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,440
be bold put out house of cards

668
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,519
put out all the episodes

669
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,120
leave you in charge of the pace at which

670
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,319
you would view them

671
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,798
uh which i thought was was great

672
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,879
that was a gutsy move yes it was and i

673
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,319
can't tell you around hollywood anybody

674
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,480
that says that everybody thought it was

675
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,519
a great idea is not being truthful

676
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,240
because

677
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:10,240
everybody i talked to said this is

678
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,359
they're idiots right they're what do

679
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,798
they know about movie making and tv

680
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,038
and

681
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:19,759
what i saw happening

682
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,839
was if you look at what netflix pulled

683
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,640
off and they realized that there isn't

684
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,798
really a moat around the studios

685
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,000
you really could make stuff

686
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,158
um

687
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,200
and really good stuff and so they

688
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,200
started to create their own content

689
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,840
that pulled in

690
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,640
amazon which pulled in google through

691
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,918
youtube and and then you had hulu then

692
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,759
you had

693
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,640
disney deciding that they're gonna have

694
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,319
disney plus and the next thing you know

695
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,840
you have some of the the biggest

696
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,678
companies with the largest balance

697
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,639
sheets on the planet

698
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,240
uh being in the creative business

699
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,640
that's you know if you're an independent

700
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,480
that's that's bringing a knife to a gun

701
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,600
fight to be sure

702
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,599
and so

703
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:06,319
you know i thought that was interesting

704
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:07,839
the other thing that it used to be that

705
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,158
movies were where the big things

706
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:13,038
happened and television was sort of

707
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,320
it was small screen different experience

708
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,679
and you had something like game of

709
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:18,240
thrones come out

710
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,640
which was not only on the same

711
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,200
epic level visually and storytelling

712
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,919
wise but had the budget to be able to do

713
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,679
it

714
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,278
and now

715
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,960
i think you're you're seeing um

716
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,400
you're seeing uh

717
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,159
all kinds of

718
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,759
different storytelling

719
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,360
taking place

720
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,519
and i also like that it's you're not

721
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,439
pigeonholed into

722
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,480
a time like you got two hours to tell

723
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,240
the story

724
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,919
you can do a three-part mini series a

725
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,359
five-part mini-series you can do

726
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,038
television that's

727
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,359
you know all kinds of different format

728
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,158
and that i think is uh

729
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,079
it

730
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,120
allows creators to do a lot more

731
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:59,199
interesting things

732
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,678
it is also interesting to consider the

733
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,480
role of companies that enable that like

734
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,200
the capital that enables that you know

735
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,720
without netflix you wouldn't an hbo you

736
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,840
wouldn't have

737
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,038
um some of these epic shows and so for

738
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,639
if we're thinking about the virtual

739
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:18,240
reality world that you're talking about

740
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,480
it's interesting to consider who will

741
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,558
enable that you know now like you said

742
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,319
facebook is talking about meta and

743
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,200
metaverse

744
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,720
but it's unclear that just having money

745
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,240
is enough

746
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,640
netflix did a lot of really

747
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,400
revolutionary stuff there's a

748
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,159
you know amazon has money there's a lot

749
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,400
of companies have money that don't quite

750
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,960
do as good of a job yet

751
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,480
at enabling creators of

752
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,558
um

753
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,640
creating revolutionary new content that

754
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:47,918
changes the the whole industry and

755
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,720
that's probably going to be the case

756
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,120
with virtual reality there there is a

757
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,360
lot of money needed to enable

758
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,359
experiences like in terms of compute

759
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,119
infrastructure

760
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,599
there needs to be a huge amount of money

761
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:04,079
there but you also need to somehow give

762
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:06,480
freedom to creators to have fun

763
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,839
to do their best work and at the same

764
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,038
time

765
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,399
like

766
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,720
provide the

767
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,640
the perfect amount of constraints all of

768
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,319
that together like however netflix makes

769
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,720
it happen they do a pretty good job

770
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,480
because it's a very constrained platform

771
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,440
but yet all the creators i've ever

772
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,120
talked to comedians and so on that work

773
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,558
with netflix are really happy because

774
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,879
they feel free

775
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,158
to create their work yeah and i think a

776
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,559
lot of times

777
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,720
you know companies are a letterhead but

778
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:36,319
it boils down to the people yeah and i

779
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,880
think um

780
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,119
i've known ted sarandos a long time who

781
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,720
who ran the studio at netflix and now

782
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,519
took over for reid

783
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,919
uh

784
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,480
running the company but ted

785
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,960
very smart talented guy and understood

786
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,558
early how to cultivate talent and

787
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,240
relationships with talent which is

788
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,079
important when you're dealing with

789
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,399
creative people

790
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,158
their motivations and their goals are

791
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,000
not always the same right they're not

792
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,480
always capitalistic

793
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,919
right and so in terms of being able to

794
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,399
communicate

795
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,640
with creative people uh that are not

796
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:13,278
always a to b to c

797
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,360
is is a talent and so i think they they

798
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,720
did a great job ted did a great job with

799
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,599
that early

800
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,440
um

801
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,319
you know but i i think that you're gonna

802
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,278
see

803
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:26,079
different formats i i i don't think

804
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,720
i mean going to a theater

805
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:30,798
to see a massive movie

806
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,120
on that screen in that format i is a

807
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:35,759
fundamentally different experience yeah

808
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,079
and i think you're gonna find movies uh

809
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,558
you know my old shop legendary just put

810
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,678
out dune which i thought was

811
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,798
phenomenal

812
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:47,519
um i uh you know we when we secured the

813
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,558
rights to dune years ago

814
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,639
it was

815
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:53,918
i was over the moon because it's i love

816
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,038
the book i i love the the entire world

817
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,720
um that uh that is dune

818
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:01,440
and that's a movie that i think you see

819
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,839
on the the big screen i think uh

820
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,798
when avatar 2 comes out i want to see

821
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:06,558
that

822
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,240
on a big screen but i think you're going

823
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,398
to see

824
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,720
a ton of content is obviously being

825
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,319
produced and it's not all going to go to

826
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,278
a theater going experience so you're

827
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,278
going to see

828
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,599
i think different versions of this over

829
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,599
the next five to 10 years

830
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,240
in case james cameron is listening to

831
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,319
this so he officially agreed to talk at

832
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,319
the time of on this podcast at the time

833
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,678
of avatar to release i'm just holding

834
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,960
you to that in this recorded

835
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,000
conversation

836
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,120
um also just super excited um both the

837
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,079
movie

838
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:41,119
and uh the director

839
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,199
there is something special about movies

840
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,798
you know they win oscars

841
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,880
they um

842
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,720
they're historic in nature there's

843
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,799
something about tv shows even when

844
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,519
they're epic like game of thrones

845
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,519
that they're forgotten much quicker

846
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,519
in history i don't know maybe that's

847
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,079
because we haven't had enough of them

848
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:01,038
but you know the de niro performances

849
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,038
and

850
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:06,079
you know the scorsese films all the

851
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,839
great films that kind of we think of uh

852
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,158
throughout the generations that define

853
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,079
generations are films

854
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,679
is that um is that just old school

855
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:17,359
thinking is that always going to be the

856
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,360
case i mean look to me

857
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,038
going in a darkened theater with a bunch

858
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,399
of strangers and the lights go down

859
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:28,558
and you go on this journey

860
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,918
there is something special and magical

861
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,158
about that

862
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,159
and i think

863
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,440
movies have been a part of our cultural

864
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,320
fabric

865
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,320
forever and for some reason hollywood

866
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:42,480
in america

867
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,519
was you know uniquely

868
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,200
positioned uh to do a great job with it

869
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,200
right and not that there aren't great

870
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,000
foreign movies but

871
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,840
far and away american movies you know

872
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,119
are dominate the not only the world

873
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,599
market but

874
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:00,079
you know and so whatever it is that we

875
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,119
do well or hollywood does well

876
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:02,480
um

877
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:06,479
you know there's there's something in

878
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,880
the water apparently but i i agree that

879
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,480
i love movies and i will you know for

880
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,039
the rest of my days

881
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,038
it's it's interesting how creators can

882
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:17,200
move back and forth now

883
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,599
as well that used to be a complete no-no

884
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,200
you're either a movie guy or you're a

885
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:23,839
person or a

886
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,600
you know or you're a tv director and

887
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,519
that's that but those lines have

888
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,678
completely uh blurred

889
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,000
and they're also blurring i mean they're

890
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,159
blurring all kinds of lines like they're

891
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,960
they're moving to tick tock and

892
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,399
instagram and like i know right now it

893
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,798
seems ridiculous

894
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:43,518
to consider that these like

895
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,359
one minute things

896
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,200
could be considered even in the same

897
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,599
realm creatively

898
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,759
as a film but maybe that changes over

899
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,599
time too maybe experiences can

900
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,640
completely become fluid in terms of

901
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,678
their

902
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,000
size as long as they have some

903
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,960
deep lasting impact on you as a human

904
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,038
being

905
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,240
as a consumer look

906
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,319
to me

907
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,839
the whole thing is about

908
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,000
either the moving image or even

909
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,879
sometimes a picture

910
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,880
will bring out an emotion a reaction

911
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,278
something so

912
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,039
you know short form is harder because

913
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,679
you have less time to set things up and

914
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,919
all that but i'm sure there will be

915
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,278
short videos and creators that come up

916
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,759
with things and if a moving image

917
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,919
can get a reaction out of you and make

918
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,599
you feel a certain way and stay with you

919
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,679
or inspire you

920
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,199
well that that to me is just the next

921
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,038
evolution of

922
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,880
whatever it's going to be between humans

923
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:43,200
and cameras etc

924
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,278
see i think that's why we've talked

925
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,840
offline about this that's why i love

926
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:50,319
robots as i think there's certain things

927
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,959
in the short form with robots that

928
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,839
immediately can bring out a feeling in

929
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,319
people

930
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,798
there's something about

931
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:01,278
our consideration of our own

932
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,079
intelligence of our own consciousness of

933
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,398
all

934
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:06,639
the fears and hopes and the beautiful

935
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,119
things about human nature the dark

936
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,080
things about human nature that somehow

937
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:14,319
especially lego robots bring out because

938
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,480
we have both a fear and excitement

939
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:18,798
towards that are these going to be our

940
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,278
overlords our gods

941
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,558
that overtake humanity are these going

942
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:23,519
to be

943
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:24,960
things

944
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,278
like horses or something like that

945
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,880
something that empower humanity like you

946
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,880
don't know what to make sense of it

947
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,480
that's why they're super exciting i

948
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,480
agree speaking of robots and film uh

949
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,240
you've gone into traditional industries

950
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,880
and disrupted them quite a few times

951
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,679
was there is there a system for deciding

952
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,640
which industry is right for disruption

953
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,880
when you

954
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,799
look at the world and see

955
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,880
what are the big problems

956
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:55,359
you would like to solve

957
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,440
uh do you have a system of how you see

958
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,798
which problems to solve how do you

959
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,919
look at the world

960
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,759
yeah well on the business side of that

961
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,038
um so i have a holding company called

962
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:09,760
tulco very imaginatively named

963
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:12,480
and part of that is literally every name

964
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,679
ever is now taken registered and all

965
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,440
that stuff

966
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,358
um so

967
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,000
we're a holding company what's a holding

968
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:22,960
company so instead of being a fund that

969
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,559
has money flowing in and out of it and

970
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,440
you know there's what's called a vintage

971
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,519
year i raise capital and i agree to

972
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,918
invest that capital for so long and then

973
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,599
i give it back to you which i sometimes

974
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,118
creates artificial time pressures and

975
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,320
things like that a holding company is

976
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,079
more

977
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,440
permanent capital

978
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,280
so the idea was behind telco

979
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,720
was to buy

980
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,639
almost always whole companies or

981
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,759
majority stakes with great management

982
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,240
teams

983
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,200
in spaces that did not traditionally

984
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:56,959
have a lot of innovation

985
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:59,838
and to have our labs group who were data

986
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,039
scientists ai practitioners

987
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,599
you know

988
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:04,960
engineers machine learning etc and to be

989
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,519
able to bring

990
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,320
that wherewithal to that company so to

991
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,559
provide them with the right capital

992
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,720
and to provide them with access to

993
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,400
technology that would be hard to

994
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,679
individually recruit

995
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,039
uh for that company so i would say

996
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,118
that

997
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:25,279
the thesis was to look for industries

998
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,160
that were large enough that hadn't

999
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,280
traditionally had access to that type of

1000
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:33,358
technology or innovation and to try to

1001
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,280
look for companies

1002
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,440
that not only

1003
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,720
uh looked that part but had management

1004
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,119
teams

1005
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,118
that embraced this and wanted to take

1006
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,680
that kind of journey yeah there is quite

1007
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,680
a few industries like that but that

1008
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,759
finding

1009
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:52,559
the industries

1010
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,560
and uh the management pair because like

1011
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,519
those industries often have a lot of old

1012
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,119
school folks who don't

1013
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:01,440
it takes quite a bit of work for them to

1014
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,519
leap into technology i work quite a bit

1015
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,838
with the autonomous vehicles

1016
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,519
and just the automotive industry

1017
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,078
depending on the company there's old

1018
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:12,000
school folks it's like detroit thinking

1019
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,880
versus like uh what do you call it i

1020
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,280
don't know

1021
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,320
california thinking

1022
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,920
well

1023
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,838
you have to i think you have to look at

1024
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,639
the nexus of two things there one is

1025
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,039
just

1026
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,400
plain old human behavior if i am

1027
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,400
uncomfortable

1028
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,160
and i this isn't

1029
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,039
a comfort zone for me and it's not

1030
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,118
something i have as a field of expertise

1031
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:35,599
i'm gonna shy away from that right

1032
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,119
especially if i'm successful and i feel

1033
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,880
good about myself and it's a big

1034
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,680
successful company or person or whatever

1035
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,680
it might be

1036
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,358
and the second thing is

1037
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,559
that especially if you're a public

1038
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:48,400
company and you're being weighed and

1039
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,960
measured every quarter

1040
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,320
you are rewarding the managers of that

1041
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,039
company

1042
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,119
to hit metrics and to be reliable and to

1043
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,039
say hey i'm counting quarter to quarter

1044
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,720
that you're going to deliver what you

1045
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,639
say

1046
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,879
it's difficult to say you know what

1047
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,559
everybody for the next two years i

1048
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,640
wouldn't count on our financial

1049
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,559
projections at all because we're going

1050
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,480
to reinvent what we're doing

1051
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:14,000
it's going to work in the work in the

1052
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,760
long run and you're going to see that

1053
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,639
this was a really smart investment five

1054
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,359
to seven years from now

1055
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:24,559
that's not the way capitalism is

1056
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:27,358
currently wired generally right and a

1057
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:29,838
lot of so again if you reward

1058
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:32,719
managers with yearly bonuses and stock

1059
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:35,599
options based and tied to

1060
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,519
stock price and all these other things

1061
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,359
you know and then ask them to go break

1062
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:41,199
stuff

1063
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,400
that that's that's hard i think so

1064
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,480
you're saying

1065
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,039
like uh so

1066
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,719
the uh the taco approach this the

1067
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:52,159
private investment

1068
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,679
is the best way or perhaps the only way

1069
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,159
to enable this kind of long-term

1070
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:58,399
innovation investment taking big risks

1071
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:59,358
and investing in innovation well look we

1072
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,000
certainly

1073
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:04,239
are not by any means the only one doing

1074
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,800
it i'm just saying that when you when

1075
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,199
you think about big companies the more

1076
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,720
successful you know that are in old line

1077
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,159
businesses

1078
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,000
and i hear people

1079
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:17,199
sort of talk about well why can't they

1080
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,280
just pivot they recognize they need to

1081
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:22,159
be in the technology business well

1082
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,640
because it's hard it's hard to steer a

1083
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,960
ship and turn it that big and especially

1084
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,639
if it's not part of your dna at that

1085
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,920
company

1086
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,400
so

1087
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,559
you know i i just think that

1088
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,720
what we tried to do is to

1089
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,400
enable

1090
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,719
management teams

1091
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,920
that know where they want to go

1092
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:46,559
and to be patient with capital and also

1093
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,838
again bring bring innovation

1094
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,480
um

1095
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:52,559
to bear that that they have access to uh

1096
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,440
but there's plenty of capital structures

1097
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:54,799
doing

1098
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,440
interesting things that's one of the

1099
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,480
things i love about our country

1100
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,358
this country innovates and this country

1101
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,199
invents things and i'm

1102
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,078
constantly in awe

1103
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:10,159
of of just the

1104
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,560
you know the human ability

1105
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:16,239
uh to to innovate and to iterate um you

1106
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,599
know i i get to hang around some

1107
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,159
universities

1108
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,920
uh including your old shop mit and it's

1109
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,279
like i'm still there yeah still still

1110
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,079
there still teaching they're still

1111
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,880
teaching but that place is like hogwarts

1112
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,280
i mean it's it's just uh

1113
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,440
it's inspiring yeah right and and

1114
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,839
certainly the the energy in silicon

1115
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,079
valley which now austin texas where

1116
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,199
we're sitting yeah uh has its own

1117
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,160
incredible

1118
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:44,960
ecosystem uh so that's that's one of the

1119
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:47,358
things i i love about america

1120
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,199
is the ability

1121
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:52,159
and that really is i think in the

1122
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,118
american dna to create things and invent

1123
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,879
things

1124
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,880
um and i i just i think that's

1125
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,640
invigorating and i think that's even

1126
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,519
bigger than capitalism sort of the

1127
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:03,920
machine of how capitalism works that's

1128
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:06,400
just human nature capitalism is just one

1129
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,920
of the ways to sort of uh

1130
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:14,400
make that human nature shine i suppose

1131
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,400
but it's it's like you mentioned mit

1132
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,640
you know

1133
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,159
there's a drive there to invent to

1134
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:23,759
innovate

1135
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:26,399
that's um that's so

1136
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,000
human that that human spirit to sort of

1137
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,000
build something new

1138
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,079
it's like that hopeful optimistic spirit

1139
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,519
especially in the engineering space like

1140
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,079
if you pay attention to the internet

1141
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:38,400
like twitter and all that kind of stuff

1142
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,240
intellectuals and so on there's a

1143
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,280
cynicism

1144
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:46,000
to when we talk about stuff

1145
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,720
but there's an optimism to when we do

1146
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,119
stuff and the the doing part when you

1147
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,799
actually build things especially like

1148
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,480
you care a lot about manufacturing too

1149
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,760
like you actually build physical

1150
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,119
products

1151
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,920
that um that's where we truly shine

1152
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,640
yeah

1153
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,838
no question about it and i and i

1154
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:07,920
you know i'm passionate about our

1155
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:09,920
country making stuff again right doing

1156
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,639
our own manufacturing

1157
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,960
uh and and making sure that we don't

1158
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,078
lose the ability not just to create

1159
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
things

1160
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,560
um

1161
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,318
intellectually and do the world's

1162
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,199
greatest blueprints but actually make

1163
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:23,519
things

1164
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,759
here actual factories yeah that's

1165
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,759
exactly right how how do we how do we do

1166
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,480
that how do we bring more

1167
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,480
manufacturing to the united states

1168
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,519
well there there's a company that i have

1169
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,199
a

1170
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,400
big personal investment in called

1171
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,719
rebuild

1172
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,639
uh with uh

1173
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:44,879
some folks that all went through the mit

1174
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,639
school years ago

1175
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,599
there's a good friend of mine named jeff

1176
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:52,400
wilke who used to be at amazon

1177
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,640
and we all felt the same way that

1178
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,480
you know america needed to make sure

1179
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:57,679
that it didn't lose its edge in that way

1180
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,318
so

1181
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,440
it's uh it's a company that invests in

1182
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,079
american

1183
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,679
high-tech manufacturing

1184
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,440
and i think the way that we do that is

1185
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,440
provide capital

1186
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,838
provide training

1187
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,639
to me this is also fertile ground for

1188
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:19,838
good sustainable high-paying jobs um and

1189
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:22,239
you know we have to we have to make it

1190
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:23,679
economically feasible to do that again

1191
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,078
here in this country

1192
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,440
uh and not to say to companies that

1193
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,599
again are being weighed and measured

1194
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,679
quarter by quarter hey this is three

1195
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,039
times as expensive to do it here but you

1196
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,279
should do it here

1197
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:38,159
we need to innovate and and we need to

1198
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,640
create processes and and

1199
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,000
companies and opportunity that balance

1200
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:43,519
that equation

1201
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,119
and i think as we saw during the

1202
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,880
pandemic

1203
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,079
you know i don't think in this day and

1204
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,480
age you can be an isolationist that

1205
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,800
that doesn't make any sense to me but

1206
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,480
being self-reliant and self-determinate

1207
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,599
and making sure

1208
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,240
that you

1209
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,079
are never in a position as a nation

1210
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,639
that we can't do basic things because

1211
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,480
we're relying on supply chain in other

1212
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:09,679
countries and whether it's

1213
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,240
you know uh we're not friends anymore or

1214
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,759
a natural disaster or a virus or

1215
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:15,759
something pops up

1216
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,680
i think those are

1217
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,920
costs of doing business that we have to

1218
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,879
put into the calculus

1219
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,599
of

1220
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,960
uh

1221
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,119
being able to make things here there's

1222
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,880
an extremely high cost to making supply

1223
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,519
chain resilient that we really have to

1224
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,680
consider and it's so

1225
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,960
if you really consider that cost it

1226
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,440
makes a lot of sense to invest

1227
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,838
especially long term in building up

1228
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,240
manufacturing in a way where like you're

1229
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,719
making most of the stuff in one place

1230
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,399
sort of uh

1231
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,199
bringing it all

1232
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,760
not all but as much in as possible and

1233
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,838
um building it almost like from scratch

1234
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,599
here in the united states i mean what

1235
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,719
i guess the

1236
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,720
your thought is with innovation

1237
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,000
uh it's possible to sort of

1238
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,919
revolutionize the way we do

1239
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,559
manufacturing so reduce the amount of

1240
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,119
supply chain stuff and like build stuff

1241
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,639
from scratch like do a high-tech

1242
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,599
manufacturing

1243
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:10,960
so like

1244
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,519
optimize all aspects of the

1245
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,440
manufacturing all that kind of stuff

1246
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:19,440
yeah and i think where technology

1247
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,358
is the most efficient

1248
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,358
uh is is the human machine interface

1249
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,318
right it's not let's automate everything

1250
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:30,719
and have nobody work anywhere i i

1251
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:32,318
for a long time that's neither feasible

1252
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,799
nor desirable

1253
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:37,358
but where we can enhance

1254
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,160
jobs

1255
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:42,239
and

1256
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:43,920
make that interface immensely productive

1257
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,318
with the right training and so forth i

1258
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,760
think that's a worthwhile endeavor and

1259
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,119
something that's going to be important

1260
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,760
to our country

1261
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,599
yeah i mean you're

1262
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,280
you know who you're talking to i love

1263
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,519
human robot interaction human machine

1264
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,040
interaction human ai interaction so what

1265
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,920
do you think is the role of robotics in

1266
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,920
this high-tech manufacturing

1267
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,960
sort of like industrial robots robotic

1268
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,760
arms all that kind of stuff um or even

1269
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,960
even more complicated kind of robots

1270
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,240
what do you think is the role of

1271
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,039
robotics what do you think is the role

1272
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:17,759
of ai in this manufacturing future

1273
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:20,400
you're thinking about well robotics to

1274
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,480
me is an extremely exciting field i

1275
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,039
don't have the same expertise that you

1276
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,318
do i have an adjacency but not the depth

1277
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:27,119
of knowledge

1278
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:29,039
um

1279
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,280
have never really delved deeply into it

1280
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,199
or made investments in it but i think

1281
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,079
what's exciting about it is everything

1282
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,559
from

1283
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,839
doing jobs that are very dangerous for

1284
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:38,639
humans

1285
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,440
um

1286
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:44,799
enhancing the human experience

1287
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,720
when you look at really repetitive labor

1288
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,680
things that

1289
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:49,439
you know

1290
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:52,000
it might take away a job but is it a

1291
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,838
good job for that that person is you

1292
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,159
know spending 30 years doing something

1293
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:58,880
highly repetitious is that

1294
00:45:56,159 --> 00:46:00,799
is that a good experience in life

1295
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,358
so i think um and then when you think

1296
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,880
about everything from military

1297
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:05,679
applications

1298
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,838
uh

1299
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:10,239
you know rescue we're already seeing a

1300
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:12,639
bunch of those things and then

1301
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,439
just lastly when you talk about that

1302
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,799
human interaction with robots when you

1303
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,440
start to have

1304
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,000
the combination so you have some level

1305
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,280
of intelligence and interaction

1306
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,679
i mean

1307
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,480
that's why we always love the droids in

1308
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,719
star wars right i mean it's uh

1309
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,240
it it's it's exciting it captures the

1310
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,598
imagination

1311
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,318
um

1312
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,480
and i i think look

1313
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:41,119
many many hours and

1314
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,719
have been spent on debating artificial

1315
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,599
intelligence

1316
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:47,519
and the the ramifications if things go

1317
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,079
sideways and so forth

1318
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,000
um and i think those are all

1319
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,079
you know those are appropriate

1320
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,880
conversations to be having

1321
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,560
ai is happening uh i think it's actually

1322
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,838
happening slower than most people

1323
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,519
realize

1324
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,480
um

1325
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:06,719
because there are tasks that humans do

1326
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,119
every minute of every day

1327
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,598
standing up without losing your sense of

1328
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,800
balance i mean these are really hard

1329
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,318
things

1330
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,760
but i think

1331
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:18,000
there's enough

1332
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,400
investment both in private industry as

1333
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,679
well as nation states now on artificial

1334
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,358
intelligence that it is coming

1335
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:27,279
so both in the software space in the

1336
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:29,598
digital space

1337
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,040
and in the physical space so we talked

1338
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,720
about manufacturing so industrial

1339
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,960
robotics

1340
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,199
is very true that even in the factory

1341
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,280
even the tasks that you think are

1342
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:40,480
pretty um

1343
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,200
basic

1344
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,199
you know the amount of small

1345
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:48,239
intuitive decisions that humans make is

1346
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:50,558
quite incredible so we have to be kind

1347
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,959
of explicit about saying which tasks are

1348
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,640
actually really hard and humans are just

1349
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,720
really good at them

1350
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,719
and uh so

1351
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:00,558
on and on the flip side in the digital

1352
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,879
space was the social networks of

1353
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,119
recommender systems with all kinds of

1354
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,039
like personal assistants in terms of

1355
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:10,160
voice

1356
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,039
voice based ai systems all of that

1357
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:13,199
there's

1358
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:14,880
opportunities there to find niches where

1359
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,199
ai can really have

1360
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,480
a transformative effects

1361
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:23,838
i think one of the

1362
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,838
places that really haven't

1363
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,559
this is where like you're worried to say

1364
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,358
stupid things but i believe this very

1365
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,880
much

1366
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:32,558
that um

1367
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,480
when we have ai systems in the home

1368
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,720
currently you have somebody like alexa

1369
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,719
and google home and so on they're kind

1370
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:40,639
of

1371
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:42,239
very basic servants

1372
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,400
they tell you about the weather they can

1373
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,919
play some music they can turn the lights

1374
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,519
on and off all the kind of like smart

1375
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,720
home stuff

1376
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:52,480
i think there's a lot of value in

1377
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:55,358
systems that

1378
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,280
form relationships with us in the way

1379
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:58,799
that pets do dogs

1380
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,920
and cats

1381
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,599
i don't know

1382
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,358
just for people who have cats cats don't

1383
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,039
care about you they they really don't

1384
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,639
they don't form any kind of relationship

1385
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:10,318
i don't know why you have a relationship

1386
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:12,078
with them it's one way anyway

1387
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,000
sorry to throw some shade i'm just

1388
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,359
kidding by the way that's a basic kind

1389
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,800
of connection you have with another

1390
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:18,639
living being

1391
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,920
then there's also just friends you have

1392
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:22,078
you have different levels of friends

1393
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,119
acquaintances you have lifelong friends

1394
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,280
all that that that friendship you have

1395
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,599
i really believe that there is some

1396
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,800
aspect of the human experience

1397
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,920
that

1398
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,280
is deeply enriched by interacting with

1399
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,760
other beings

1400
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,720
and for

1401
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,839
systems computing systems artificial

1402
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,838
intelligence systems in our

1403
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:48,318
world to have the capability to engage

1404
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:50,400
in some of that i think is not just an

1405
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:53,119
opportunity to

1406
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,480
to to uh help people grow become better

1407
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,720
people but it's also just a good

1408
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,880
business opportunity too and that hasn't

1409
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,639
really been explored enough so that to

1410
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,720
me is really

1411
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:03,519
that's a whole exciting space that i

1412
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:06,719
think

1413
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:08,880
will enable better industrial

1414
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:11,679
industrial robotics it will it it will

1415
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,760
empower a better facebook

1416
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:15,919
a better social network a competitor to

1417
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,680
facebook that overthrows facebook so

1418
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:22,639
it'll it'll create better technologies

1419
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,960
that uh currently don't have that human

1420
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:27,598
robot interaction touch so

1421
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:31,199
i don't know that's super exciting to me

1422
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,640
but that that has to deal with the mess

1423
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,239
of

1424
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:36,400
human nature

1425
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,399
the the the reason that most robotics

1426
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,639
people and ai people stay away from

1427
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,480
humans

1428
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:44,639
they stay away from the human robot

1429
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,519
interaction problem it's because humans

1430
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:49,039
are complicated they're messy they're

1431
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,679
hard to control

1432
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:51,679
they're hard to

1433
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,800
predict stuff about they're hard to make

1434
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,680
sense of or like test repeatedly because

1435
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,760
one human can be drastically different

1436
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,199
from another human and so for to deal

1437
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,960
with that as the robotics problem is

1438
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:08,960
super hard

1439
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,480
and so one of the questions

1440
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,960
is uh

1441
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,480
which problems can you remove the human

1442
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,720
from consideration when you're trying to

1443
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,800
solve the problem so like elon musk is

1444
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:21,279
an example of somebody who believes

1445
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,680
autonomous driving we can remove the

1446
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,319
human from consideration we can solve

1447
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:28,159
autonomous driving as a robotics problem

1448
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,679
it's staying lane

1449
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:30,960
when there's a red light you stop at a

1450
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:32,480
red light

1451
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,400
you know if there is humans in the

1452
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,400
picture like pedestrians

1453
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,440
that's a ballistics problem

1454
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,559
it's just treat them as a moving object

1455
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,559
that has uh was with like 90 probability

1456
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,480
keeps moving in the way they were in the

1457
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,200
past few seconds with some smaller

1458
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,440
probability that might stop or turn like

1459
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,078
just do some basic models about them and

1460
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,679
you'll be able to do just fine so i i

1461
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,000
tend to believe that

1462
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,159
even driving

1463
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,318
has to consider the full messiness of

1464
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:05,039
humans the dance the game theoretic

1465
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:06,079
dance of chicken that we all do

1466
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,639
when

1467
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,559
we jaywalk we look at the car

1468
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:12,078
is that car that car doesn't that driver

1469
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,440
doesn't have the guts to murder me so

1470
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,160
i'm going to walk in front of it and not

1471
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,318
look at the car we do that kind of dance

1472
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,318
and ai systems need to be able to play

1473
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:23,679
the uh um

1474
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:23,679
uh do that kind of dance

1475
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,400
in telco

1476
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,800
there's the the labs

1477
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,960
so there's a data science component the

1478
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,680
ai component so

1479
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,920
how do they go into a company

1480
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:41,118
and help revolutionize that industry

1481
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,280
well there's different examples so

1482
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,880
one of our companies figs makes

1483
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,519
healthcare workwear

1484
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,680
started by these two brilliant women

1485
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,440
and you know

1486
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:53,598
early days

1487
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,480
helping to build the platform and

1488
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,480
recruit and

1489
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,200
make sure that the the everything that

1490
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,920
we did at the company

1491
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:06,480
uh embraced technology and at the same

1492
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,079
time they were obsessive about their

1493
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,240
customer which is

1494
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,599
you know doctors nurses healthcare

1495
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:13,598
workers who are putting it on the line

1496
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,599
every day and obsessive about their

1497
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,359
product and when you have those two

1498
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,760
things come together

1499
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:22,880
you know you you get the result that

1500
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,800
that uh that we did at figgs

1501
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,119
um

1502
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,318
we have a company called akasher which

1503
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,318
it's ai

1504
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:31,440
lab and base is down here in austin

1505
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:33,920
texas

1506
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,639
it was uh an insurance one of the

1507
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,000
largest insurance brokers in the world

1508
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,838
and uh

1509
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,079
you know we

1510
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,119
did a deal with them and sold some of

1511
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,880
our

1512
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,760
our insurance holdings that was

1513
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,318
completely ai driven

1514
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:53,040
and in that case you basically put the

1515
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:55,279
team inside the company right because

1516
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,119
it's it's a massive

1517
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,480
company with all and we've gone into all

1518
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,920
kinds of things

1519
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,880
um

1520
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,838
so it just depends on the different uh

1521
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,519
situations but the the biggest thing was

1522
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:08,799
just to make sure whatever the company

1523
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:11,920
needed

1524
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,920
uh they had access to the talent

1525
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,400
sometimes we'd build it sometimes we'd

1526
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,400
help recruit for it you know how thing

1527
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,318
in technology it's whatever works right

1528
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:22,800
there's there's no

1529
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:24,880
one way to do things um well echo sure

1530
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,640
is really dif uh is really interesting

1531
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,640
as an example so insurance is a

1532
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:31,598
fascinating space it sounds like

1533
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:32,558
very ripe still for disruption across

1534
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,880
the board

1535
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:37,599
so how do you it seems like a lot of the

1536
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,680
disruption has to do with

1537
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,720
like uh

1538
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:45,679
almost the first dumb step of we've been

1539
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:47,679
using mostly paper

1540
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,000
like it's not digitized

1541
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:52,239
you have to basically convert uh create

1542
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,880
a uh infrastructure in a framework where

1543
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:58,000
like everybody is using the same digital

1544
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,079
system like databases and just organize

1545
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,159
the data that it seems like that's a

1546
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,160
huge leap that basically can

1547
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:06,078
revolutionize major industries that

1548
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:08,159
still hasn't been done insurance is

1549
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,640
obviously the great example of that and

1550
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:13,118
one of the things that struck me uh the

1551
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:14,639
the founder ceo of actual is a guy named

1552
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,119
greg williams they're out of grand

1553
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:19,118
rapids michigan and as we were looking

1554
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,640
at expanding our footprint and insurance

1555
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,960
i met with a lot of

1556
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:25,679
insurance executives and they would talk

1557
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,480
about technology but greg

1558
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,279
uh

1559
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:33,199
truly understood the power of what would

1560
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,119
happen across actuarial sciences

1561
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:37,199
you know you know predictive analytics

1562
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,880
and and using machine learning

1563
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:41,759
to really run every aspect of your

1564
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,000
business and then automating

1565
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,799
a lot of the just the back office

1566
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,559
tedious steps and as you said one of the

1567
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:51,358
things that was great for us

1568
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,280
they already had um

1569
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:55,279
a data collection

1570
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,359
system and department so that so it was

1571
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,760
much easier to pivot

1572
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:02,639
um and you know i'm very excited about

1573
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,160
the future of that company it's uh

1574
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,159
you know they're

1575
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:08,399
doing some pretty innovative uh

1576
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,639
groundbreaking things and

1577
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,280
those are the things that i like doing

1578
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:16,159
right is that um

1579
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,920
yes i i want to make money just you know

1580
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:18,879
that that's what that is but at the same

1581
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,200
time

1582
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,280
what did you do with your time on earth

1583
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,118
right did you do anything to leave any

1584
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,960
kind of mark that

1585
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,880
you know you did anything

1586
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,599
interesting i i can only speak for

1587
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,400
myself there are many more ways

1588
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,880
to measure one's life and i can only

1589
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,119
speak about how i think about things

1590
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,318
um you know i grew up poor in upstate

1591
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,400
new york

1592
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:44,400
with a single mom and watched her work a

1593
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,920
couple jobs and

1594
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,599
you know had to

1595
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,599
from a young age

1596
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,680
you know shovel snow and mow lawns and

1597
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,039
do all kinds of things to help her

1598
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:56,239
picture make sure the lights weren't

1599
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:57,679
turned off uh in our little place and

1600
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:00,159
so that's just something that i've

1601
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:01,679
always been driven towards

1602
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:05,279
and um

1603
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:07,039
you know i just i have a really eclectic

1604
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,040
tastes and interests

1605
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:10,318
and um

1606
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:13,199
you know it's just it's just been an

1607
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:14,719
interesting journey so help be part of

1608
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:16,399
and help enable

1609
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:21,118
some

1610
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,160
cool new creations across the board like

1611
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,440
film

1612
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:24,719
music

1613
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,480
ai

1614
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,519
manufacturing

1615
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,480
just you know insurance all the specific

1616
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,119
uh

1617
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,280
industries that you disrupted yeah uh

1618
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,358
small tangent

1619
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,119
back to your childhood

1620
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:41,759
with your mom

1621
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:45,200
any uh memories kind of

1622
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:47,520
stand out stick with you as um

1623
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:48,960
as something that helped define who you

1624
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,639
are as a man

1625
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,720
yeah even though

1626
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:54,798
you know uh the university and college

1627
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,318
experience was not part of the the

1628
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:58,159
family tree

1629
00:57:56,318 --> 00:58:00,400
um

1630
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:02,480
and we had no connections i didn't

1631
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,000
understand i didn't know what a trust

1632
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,519
fund was or prep school i didn't know

1633
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,960
what any of that was

1634
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:07,759
um

1635
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,720
but

1636
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,079
my mom from a young age would always say

1637
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:13,679
you know you're going to go to college

1638
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,760
there's no

1639
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:17,759
you know if you choose to and and i

1640
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,280
think from a young age that was just an

1641
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,440
expectation

1642
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,680
um that that i had and that she

1643
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,559
instilled and the work ethic i watched

1644
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,838
her

1645
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:29,760
and then my my grandmother was uh

1646
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:31,759
was a janitor a cleaning lady in a

1647
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,119
hospital for 50 years

1648
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,680
and then

1649
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,760
i i remember there were times of

1650
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:40,318
you know i'm probably 10 years old it's

1651
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,640
freezing cold out and if i don't go out

1652
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:44,239
and shovel six driveways

1653
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:46,078
we don't have enough money to pay the

1654
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:48,479
bill so

1655
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,798
i don't know i'm not a psychologist so i

1656
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,798
don't know how that manifests itself

1657
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:54,960
in my life today

1658
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:56,880
but i think

1659
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,838
the grit

1660
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:02,079
to say i'm not in the mood to do this i

1661
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:05,358
don't want to do this but that's the

1662
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,280
work that needs to be done and

1663
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:08,880
no excuses

1664
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,680
not i'm a victim and i'm going to sit

1665
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,519
around and talk about no it is what it

1666
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:14,960
is and you have to get done what you

1667
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:19,358
need to get done

1668
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:21,280
and again i think it's uh

1669
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:23,679
you can never fully put yourself in

1670
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,359
someone else's shoes or experience so i

1671
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:26,798
don't know what that is or feels like

1672
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:29,039
but for me

1673
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:30,838
though those were two i think formative

1674
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:33,440
things

1675
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:34,960
um that that were important in my

1676
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,280
childhood so that that's pretty the

1677
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,318
reality of life like that is pretty

1678
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,359
humbling

1679
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,679
you still

1680
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:43,358
you've been so exceptionally successful

1681
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:45,039
that it's easy to get

1682
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:46,960
soft now

1683
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:49,119
how do you get uh

1684
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,480
humbled these days

1685
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,358
by getting up

1686
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,358
you know you know i i think um

1687
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:57,279
for me personally

1688
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:59,119
trying to push the envelope

1689
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,640
and being weighed and measured right

1690
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,240
that's why i always love sports too

1691
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,719
there's a scoreboard

1692
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,000
and you know i'm a huge believer in

1693
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:08,078
opportunity

1694
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,798
meritocracy

1695
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:14,640
all those things that i i think are

1696
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:17,280
ideals that we want to uh aspire to

1697
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:18,719
and i think that um

1698
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,480
there's a lot of things i'm involved

1699
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:22,639
with right now that

1700
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,838
i just want to see if i can do it i want

1701
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:25,199
to see if

1702
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:27,519
you know if

1703
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:29,199
and and you know my own little mantra is

1704
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,039
cause the outcome

1705
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,759
right as much as you can

1706
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:36,000
and at the same time have the humility

1707
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:38,000
and not to have the hubris or arrogance

1708
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,920
to say i'm always going to cause the

1709
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,960
outcome because you'll get your ass

1710
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:45,039
kicked pretty quickly and and humbled

1711
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,400
the world in the universe is a big place

1712
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:48,239
with forces

1713
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,119
you know beyond

1714
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,159
uh

1715
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:54,079
but i think um

1716
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:56,960
you know i also think a lot about being

1717
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:59,440
intellectually honest which

1718
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,400
when i do university talks and so forth

1719
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,559
i

1720
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,720
i think that's a superpower

1721
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,640
because if you find yourself making

1722
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:08,838
decisions

1723
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:11,598
based on other people's

1724
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:14,318
expectations based on

1725
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:16,318
places you don't want to go but

1726
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:18,318
you know you're either

1727
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:19,358
you feel like momentum is taking you

1728
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:20,719
there

1729
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:22,400
um

1730
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:25,039
i think that's a big problem and there

1731
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,960
there are people that go to our top

1732
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:28,318
universities

1733
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,920
and

1734
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:31,920
can't wait to get out and start their

1735
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:35,039
own company and they want that pressure

1736
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,880
and they they want to to grind

1737
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,599
and there are other people that are

1738
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,519
smart and talented but just say look i i

1739
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,880
don't want to lay awake staring at the

1740
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,358
ceiling wondering how i'm going to make

1741
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,200
payroll i don't want that in my life

1742
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:49,598
and i think if you can

1743
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:51,519
square that up and be okay with it and

1744
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,640
say what what makes me tick what makes

1745
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:54,719
me happy

1746
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:56,639
what puts me in a bad headspace because

1747
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:57,759
there's a difference between challenging

1748
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:59,920
yourself

1749
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,760
and going against your nature

1750
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,000
so that's why i think that being

1751
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,319
intellectually honest and being able to

1752
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,358
really sit down and go inside your own

1753
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:09,358
head

1754
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:10,318
and say what am i good at what am i not

1755
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:11,759
good at

1756
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:13,679
how am i going to put myself in a

1757
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,039
position to be successful

1758
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:17,279
because

1759
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,720
you know i'm working on my weaknesses

1760
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,760
but i'm not going to

1761
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:22,719
put myself career-wise in a position

1762
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,240
where i

1763
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:27,519
i'm just fundamentally going to have a

1764
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:27,519
hard time being successful

1765
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,480
yeah intellectually honest is a tricky

1766
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,480
one and it gets

1767
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:37,118
there's like levels to it too sure

1768
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:39,359
because um

1769
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,798
well like some of the things you know i

1770
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:42,719
i think about

1771
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:46,159
when you

1772
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:48,318
when you dream of doing certain kinds of

1773
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:49,199
big things

1774
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:52,798
uh

1775
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:54,798
a part of intellectual honesty is to say

1776
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:56,480
several things one is like

1777
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:59,280
hey um

1778
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,318
the thing you're dreaming about

1779
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,880
like

1780
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:04,880
one the fact that nobody's done it

1781
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,838
probably shows that you're

1782
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,039
you know

1783
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:09,759
um

1784
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:12,880
you're just a dreamer this this is not

1785
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,240
this is not going to like think clearly

1786
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,160
the fact that it hasn't been done

1787
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:17,439
probably shows that it may not be the

1788
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,480
right path

1789
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,280
and

1790
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,960
uh two is like if you're dreaming about

1791
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,480
stuff there's a certain point where it's

1792
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,639
like hey

1793
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,318
you haven't done it like why haven't you

1794
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:29,199
done it already then like you have to be

1795
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:33,038
honest with yourself like you're right

1796
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:33,038
you have to be ambitious like you know

1797
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:38,160
a lot of people work hard a long time

1798
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:39,759
for a dream but you have to wake up and

1799
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:40,879
be like all right i've been at this for

1800
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,240
10 years

1801
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,519
like with a startup you launched a

1802
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:47,439
startup and you think okay

1803
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:49,199
one year two years three years four

1804
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,679
years pretty successful you know but it

1805
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:54,078
hasn't exploded like you dreamed and

1806
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,838
you have to shut it down you know you

1807
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:57,440
have to be intellectually honest there

1808
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:59,519
at the same time

1809
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,960
you might want to be

1810
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:04,159
uh

1811
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:06,318
like step it up lean into it

1812
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:07,358
say almost like

1813
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:09,519
um

1814
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:11,598
the flip side of like intellectual

1815
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:13,440
honesty is like

1816
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,760
maddening ambition

1817
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,798
i'm just saying [ __ ] it i'm gonna go all

1818
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,400
in

1819
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:20,798
but that that is a kind of intellectual

1820
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,039
honesty saying like you know the the big

1821
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:24,838
problem here is i've been kind of going

1822
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:27,520
doing too many things

1823
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:30,000
um maybe with this

1824
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:31,358
uh dream you have to go all in on it all

1825
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,159
those kinds of things i mean this is

1826
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:36,078
human experience it's complicated

1827
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:38,239
yes without all human things are

1828
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,440
complicated the the and i think there's

1829
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:41,519
a difference

1830
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,920
between being reckless

1831
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:46,239
and making well thought out informed

1832
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:48,559
decisions if you're going to go all in

1833
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:50,719
make sure you you've you know measure

1834
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:53,039
twice cut once as they say

1835
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,879
and one of my other

1836
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,559
favorite i i forget

1837
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,160
many years ago i heard this saying and

1838
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,798
it stayed with me it was

1839
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:02,480
never mistake clear line of sight with

1840
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:06,400
distance

1841
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:09,199
and you know that so i i think that

1842
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,960
the key whether you're starting a

1843
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:12,318
business or you're thinking about

1844
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,000
leaving the company you're at and

1845
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:15,199
starting a business or just leaving for

1846
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,760
another job

1847
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:18,719
any of these things is as much as you

1848
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,480
can

1849
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:23,118
right and psychologists i think would

1850
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:25,599
tell us it's hard to be self-aware

1851
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,880
completely right that's the rub

1852
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:28,400
that if we were all completely

1853
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,400
self-aware of everything that we did in

1854
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,318
strength and weaknesses

1855
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,358
it'd be a different world

1856
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:36,798
but i do think you can work on that

1857
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:39,279
and at least

1858
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:41,358
challenge yourself to to think about it

1859
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:43,440
and not be in a position

1860
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:45,038
where i'm you know i'm going to medical

1861
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,119
school because that's what you do in my

1862
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:48,880
family and even though i'm

1863
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,440
miserable doing it

1864
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,798
uh you know things like that

1865
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,639
this is a definitely you don't want to

1866
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:56,559
be sort of um

1867
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:57,598
because you don't think

1868
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,400
fall

1869
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:02,079
um victim to conformity let's just go on

1870
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,039
doing the same thing over and over

1871
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,839
that's right

1872
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,839
but at the same time

1873
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:11,440
is measured twice and cut once

1874
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:13,279
um

1875
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,280
it does feel like some of the

1876
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,559
the biggest um

1877
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,119
leaps

1878
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:22,559
taken or where you

1879
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:25,760
cut once and measure later

1880
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:27,760
is you leap in first sure it's almost

1881
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:30,079
like a gut i suppose that is a

1882
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,480
measurement but you build up a good gut

1883
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,880
uh instinct of like what to do and then

1884
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,119
you just do it and then you figure out

1885
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,880
as it's the building the airplane as

1886
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:42,079
you're flying it right

1887
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,000
well and i think each one of those uh

1888
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,839
instances that you could probably cite

1889
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,159
has its own

1890
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:50,639
unique circumstances right i don't have

1891
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:52,078
a deep biotech background so if i

1892
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:54,960
suddenly stood up and said i'm going to

1893
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,720
put everything i have into this idea

1894
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:58,720
well

1895
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:00,639
that's you know those are right it's

1896
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:01,759
game theory right what are the odds of

1897
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:03,679
success

1898
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:06,079
if on the other hand

1899
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,919
uh you know you're you're brilliant in

1900
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,760
your field or you've seen some

1901
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,159
opportunity that you

1902
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,839
you think is wide open

1903
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:15,038
and you're gonna go for it and break

1904
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:17,920
stuff

1905
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:20,079
that's great you just want to wait to me

1906
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,200
always say like

1907
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:25,680
how crazy is this on the spectrum of

1908
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:28,558
you know do i have any expertise

1909
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,919
what is the downside if i fail

1910
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,160
right

1911
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,599
you know if you're if you're at a

1912
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:34,879
certain point in life with young

1913
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,039
children

1914
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,960
and you've got a mortgage or whatever

1915
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:41,440
else that that is one circumstance

1916
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,519
versus i just got out of stanford or i

1917
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,720
just got out of whatever and i'm gonna

1918
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:45,838
go for it

1919
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:48,239
it's just

1920
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:49,759
the whole thing right it's it is complex

1921
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:51,759
as you point out

1922
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,920
and sometimes you just want to have the

1923
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,240
right matrix in your head of

1924
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,720
decision-making process to try to arrive

1925
01:07:56,239 --> 01:08:00,719
at the right place and even if you get

1926
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:03,118
close that's where i think you say you

1927
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:04,719
know what the hell with it i'm doing

1928
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,920
this yeah

1929
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:07,679
yeah

1930
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,680
i do want to ask you

1931
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:12,078
about

1932
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:13,358
specific idea that uh sounds super

1933
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:15,519
fascinating that you're involved with

1934
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:18,079
recently you led the 50 million dollar

1935
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:19,838
seed round for a company called colossal

1936
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:22,079
that is focused on

1937
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:24,559
de-extinction

1938
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,399
uh this is funny relative to our

1939
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,400
connection uh and conversation about

1940
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,079
jurassic world

1941
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:32,000
they're seeking to restore lost

1942
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:33,198
ecosystems and use gene editing to

1943
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,640
restore the

1944
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:37,519
woolly mammoth to the arctic tundra

1945
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,520
uh

1946
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,799
how are they gonna do that

1947
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:45,759
well um i met this fascinating guy at

1948
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:47,759
harvard named george church

1949
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:52,158
five six years ago

1950
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:55,039
um and found him to be incredibly smart

1951
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:56,238
uh have an imagination

1952
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:57,679
um

1953
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:59,358
and

1954
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,399
he partnered up with a guy named ben

1955
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:04,239
lamb who's an entrepreneur

1956
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:08,719
and basically

1957
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:11,119
the the uh the press and to me the the

1958
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,719
imaginative like you're capturing my

1959
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:14,719
imagination by telling me you're gonna

1960
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,560
bring back the woolly mammoth and other

1961
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,798
extinct animals and i

1962
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:22,159
you know we'll see where that road leads

1963
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:23,838
i'm was more interested in an investor

1964
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,798
in the things that they're working

1965
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:27,679
through

1966
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:30,719
uh around understanding

1967
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:32,960
genes and more in proteins and crispr

1968
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:35,920
and all these other things because

1969
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:38,319
um being adjacent to george church and

1970
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,880
his team as these things unfold over the

1971
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,798
next decade i i thought was

1972
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,039
uh the right the right thing to do

1973
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:46,798
people are important here just like

1974
01:09:45,039 --> 01:09:49,119
investing in people and seeing what the

1975
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:51,359
hell they come up with absolutely i mean

1976
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:52,640
you can look through history

1977
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,600
and

1978
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,960
um

1979
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,560
great things are done by great people

1980
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:02,640
right and companies

1981
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:04,640
they end up over time becoming a logo

1982
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,560
and immediately what you think of them

1983
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,600
but they started out

1984
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,600
with a person with an idea and a team

1985
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,560
that cultivated that and made that

1986
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,840
happen

1987
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,080
um

1988
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,079
and i and i think there are certain

1989
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:21,679
folks that are just immensely talented

1990
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:23,840
that if you can be around uh them

1991
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,359
and i also know his

1992
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,360
and his team's

1993
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:28,639
ethics in terms of you know after

1994
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:32,880
spending time

1995
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:34,960
talking about where the lines are

1996
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:36,800
people in other countries that you know

1997
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,800
may not have the same

1998
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,600
process may not have the same checks and

1999
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:43,199
balances are doing this and pursuing

2000
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,520
this regardless so

2001
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:46,879
at least i felt like with george and ben

2002
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,360
and their teams they're also very

2003
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,279
responsible people

2004
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:53,359
this is where the human

2005
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:54,800
side of things comes into play

2006
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:57,920
i've interacted with a lot of really

2007
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,600
brilliant people in the technology space

2008
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,960
where you kind of

2009
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,560
you know there's a lot of ways to feel

2010
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,158
this out you can ask them whether they

2011
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:07,039
kind of read literature you could you

2012
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:08,879
can feel out how much they really

2013
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:10,158
understand

2014
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,279
about like

2015
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:15,039
human nature here like

2016
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:16,639
whatever the technology is when it

2017
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:17,840
actually starts to

2018
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,039
play

2019
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:23,760
interact with society at scale

2020
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:26,560
like do they have an understanding or an

2021
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,320
intuition about how that happens some of

2022
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,960
that requires studying history some of

2023
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:32,799
that requires like just looking at the

2024
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,000
worst and best

2025
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,840
parts and

2026
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,279
events in human history to understand

2027
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,279
like hey

2028
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:40,719
it doesn't always turn out like

2029
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:43,840
everybody hoped

2030
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:45,760
uh the technology turns out and

2031
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,719
if a person has a depth of understanding

2032
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,039
about

2033
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:51,279
history about uh

2034
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:53,679
human nature then i think

2035
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:55,359
that's the right person to um

2036
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:56,319
to mess with some of this cutting-edge

2037
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:58,960
stuff

2038
01:11:56,319 --> 01:11:59,689
yeah you want marcus aurelius with a phd

2039
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,359
from mit

2040
01:11:59,689 --> 01:12:02,399
[Laughter]

2041
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:04,079
exactly

2042
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:07,198
exactly um

2043
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:08,800
you just small tangent but you mentioned

2044
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:11,439
having a conversation with warren

2045
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:15,119
buffett you spoke really highly of him

2046
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:15,119
as an investor as a human being

2047
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,159
what about him do you admire what uh

2048
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:20,399
what

2049
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:22,639
what from him what insights have you

2050
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:23,599
drawn from him as a as a great investor

2051
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,760
yourself

2052
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,520
well the afternoon that i got to spend

2053
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,159
with him which you know something i'll

2054
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,320
treasure forever look sometimes when you

2055
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:34,319
meet people even that are immensely

2056
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:35,439
successful

2057
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:37,679
you

2058
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:40,079
you may decide that after

2059
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,760
20 minutes or a half hour oh

2060
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:42,960
you were in the right place at the right

2061
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,280
time and

2062
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,039
you know that's that's fine

2063
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:50,079
uh there are other people

2064
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:52,079
that are clearly different special and i

2065
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:53,359
don't care if you made him start from

2066
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:55,119
zero

2067
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:56,880
you know would would end up

2068
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:58,960
in a good place

2069
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,279
and so it was it was a absolute

2070
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,439
privilege to spend the time with him

2071
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:05,759
um

2072
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,678
you know a couple of things that stood

2073
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,560
out in the conversation

2074
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,719
um he is incredibly intellectually

2075
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,760
curious and well-read

2076
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:17,840
and i like how simplistic he likes to

2077
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,360
keep his thought matrix

2078
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:23,360
and then also

2079
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:25,679
instead of trying to outsmart the market

2080
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:26,559
it seems like a simple axiom but just

2081
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,119
look

2082
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:31,280
good companies that are led by talented

2083
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,840
managers

2084
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:36,079
that our good businesses over time

2085
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,239
are gonna get there so i'm not gonna day

2086
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:39,198
trade i'm not i'm just gonna i'm looking

2087
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:42,079
for

2088
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:44,479
uh for value and then just on

2089
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:46,719
life stuff he just

2090
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:48,879
you know and also his

2091
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:50,719
ability to take in

2092
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,159
and then use

2093
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:55,520
information

2094
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:57,839
uh it was incredibly impressive so

2095
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,760
uh i only spent the you know i'd met him

2096
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,199
before but i only spent one afternoon

2097
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,119
with him but it's

2098
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:05,039
you know pretty incredible and one of

2099
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:06,800
the things that stuck out to me

2100
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:07,760
is we were in the middle of talking

2101
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,239
about

2102
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,159
tulco or investing or how we thought

2103
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:15,039
about it and i said uh you know i'm

2104
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,799
trying to be smart about and he stopped

2105
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:18,479
me and he said charlie munger his

2106
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,079
partner of many years charlie and i

2107
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:20,879
don't try to think of the smart thing to

2108
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:23,279
do

2109
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,480
we try to think what's the dumb thing we

2110
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:26,479
could do here

2111
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:29,519
and i kind of laughed and he said no i'm

2112
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:31,839
i'm dead serious we think about it from

2113
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,760
the standpoint of

2114
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,360
what could we do in this situation that

2115
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,280
later we would be like that was a really

2116
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:39,839
dumb thing to do

2117
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:42,559
and i actually thought that was

2118
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,239
me it got in my head and i i still think

2119
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:46,719
a lot about that as i'm as i'm

2120
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:48,879
dissecting problems

2121
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,600
so there is uh

2122
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,520
like

2123
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,920
that's a kind of long-term thinking if

2124
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,480
you just avoid the dumb things

2125
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:59,600
or if you uh if you simplify ever

2126
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:01,599
just focus on those simple steps

2127
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,320
all it takes is just do that for a long

2128
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,640
period of time and you'll be successful

2129
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:08,799
well it certainly worked for him that's

2130
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:11,920
all i can say what what about what about

2131
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:15,119
you uh you've been

2132
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,000
uh a great investor yourself how do you

2133
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:18,158
know

2134
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,600
when when you judge people

2135
01:15:18,158 --> 01:15:21,198
so i

2136
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,719
whenever i go to san francisco i was

2137
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:25,279
thinking of moving to san francisco

2138
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:26,719
that's why that's why i decided to after

2139
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:28,960
really giving us some thought talking to

2140
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,560
people decided to move to austin

2141
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,719
you know um

2142
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:35,120
everybody's dreaming big and they have

2143
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:38,560
big plans and it's actually

2144
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:40,000
i don't envy the job of the investor

2145
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,239
of any kind

2146
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,039
because everybody has big dreams and

2147
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:48,399
it's it's hard to know who exactly

2148
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:50,158
uh what idea is going to materialize

2149
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:52,000
what uh what team is going to

2150
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:53,920
materialize into something great how do

2151
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,719
you make those decisions about people

2152
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,719
about ideas

2153
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:02,000
well if i had any kind of a

2154
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:04,399
lattice work on this

2155
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
it start absolutely starts with the

2156
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:06,639
people and i think the reason for that

2157
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,238
is

2158
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,000
your business plan

2159
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:12,238
is going to change

2160
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,800
right there's very few businesses i know

2161
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:17,519
of that say we're going to make a widget

2162
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:19,039
in this location and 30 years later

2163
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,960
we're successful and we just make a

2164
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:23,119
widget and that's what it is

2165
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:26,000
things happen right and today they

2166
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:27,198
happen with such velocity

2167
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,238
that

2168
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:32,399
you have to be able to make

2169
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:34,079
hard decisions based on imperfect

2170
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:35,599
information

2171
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:37,679
and are you

2172
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,640
how are you going to calculate those

2173
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,679
answers

2174
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:44,800
how self-interested are you going to be

2175
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:46,880
what kind of ethics will you apply

2176
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,760
what's your short-term versus long-term

2177
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:53,359
thinking are you able to give an honest

2178
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:55,760
assessment of a situation

2179
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:58,319
because the thing that you can count on

2180
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,079
is problems are going to happen

2181
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:01,519
things you didn't anticipate are going

2182
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:03,519
to happen

2183
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,320
how pliable are you

2184
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,520
right

2185
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:08,639
how much elasticity is there in in your

2186
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,640
ability

2187
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:14,320
uh to to be successful and i think

2188
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,039
it's important when you invest in

2189
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:19,599
something that you both see

2190
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:21,359
you you you understand the road map

2191
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,800
ahead and agree to it

2192
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:24,639
right doesn't mean there won't be twists

2193
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,400
and turns but you're not like well wait

2194
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,920
a minute what did we do here i this

2195
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:31,039
isn't what was in the

2196
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:33,119
the thing i signed up for um

2197
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:35,679
and then i think

2198
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:37,359
honesty and communication is a huge

2199
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:40,319
thing to me with

2200
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:42,238
you know i always tell people if

2201
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:44,079
bi-directionally

2202
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:45,839
if there's something going on start the

2203
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:48,319
conversation with

2204
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,600
you know lex we have a problem

2205
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:51,439
okay now

2206
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,719
we're i'm sitting up you have my full

2207
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:54,158
attention we're going to talk about

2208
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:56,158
whatever it is

2209
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:57,839
bad news should travel faster than good

2210
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:59,519
news

2211
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,400
and because

2212
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,640
it's going to happen

2213
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:06,879
being in business with someone that is

2214
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:09,360
going to shoot you straight

2215
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,880
and sometimes say i don't know

2216
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:12,479
yeah i don't know what the answer is i

2217
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,279
got to go figure it out

2218
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:17,359
that i can process a lot better

2219
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:19,920
than look i i don't want you mad at me

2220
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:22,079
or disappointed or i i can't handle not

2221
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:25,520
having success so we're just going to

2222
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:27,600
kick the can and i i think especially in

2223
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,719
today's business environment that's very

2224
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,600
very

2225
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:33,760
dangerous so that's a bad sign not just

2226
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,400
because it's uh good to do to

2227
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,079
communicate and be honest but if if

2228
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:40,158
they're not willing to do that then it

2229
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:43,760
goes back to the intellectual honesty

2230
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:45,359
they're probably not also able to be

2231
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,960
brutally honest with themselves when

2232
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:49,759
they look in the mirror about the

2233
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:51,840
direction of the company but look

2234
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,679
i i

2235
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,920
wasn't there so i don't know but i think

2236
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:58,560
if you unpack

2237
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,000
many situations that turned out

2238
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,159
negatively

2239
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,399
most of the people whether you're faking

2240
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:06,319
lab results right you have a biotech

2241
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:08,639
company we have everybody's staring at

2242
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:11,599
theranos these days

2243
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:13,520
do i think in a lot of cases

2244
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,760
you're either the villain like you

2245
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,679
started out saying i'm i'm gonna screw

2246
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:19,280
my shareholders over and i'm gonna be a

2247
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,399
liar

2248
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:22,719
that

2249
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:24,799
that that isn't my experience

2250
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,840
most things are little incremental moves

2251
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,360
that you say

2252
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,400
we're going to get this right next week

2253
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:29,679
but today we got to make the

2254
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:31,519
presentation so we're going to just

2255
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:33,679
tweak things a little bit

2256
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,600
that's a slippery slope

2257
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,760
right and so

2258
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,600
that's why i think from a standpoint of

2259
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:42,000
people

2260
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,760
you want to go into the foxhole with

2261
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,079
folks that

2262
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,760
you know understand

2263
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:49,198
things are going to happen and i'm going

2264
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,760
to let you know about them and we're

2265
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:52,879
going to try to solve them

2266
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,360
together

2267
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,239
and and then just in terms of the idea

2268
01:19:55,359 --> 01:19:58,639
it's

2269
01:19:56,238 --> 01:20:00,959
i always ask like okay if this company

2270
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:02,960
executed the way that's the other thing

2271
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,880
always cracks me up about financials

2272
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,439
whenever somebody pitches you

2273
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:09,760
inevitably they'll say our projections

2274
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:11,198
are really really conservative

2275
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,119
i'm i'm still waiting for somebody to

2276
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:15,198
come in and say look my projections are

2277
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:16,479
wildly optimistic we'll never hit these

2278
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:18,719
numbers but

2279
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:19,919
anyway um

2280
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:22,158
it's uh

2281
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:25,039
you know if this company did what it

2282
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:26,638
says and executes and does it matter

2283
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:29,198
yeah right does it move the needle

2284
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:30,800
enough and and what are the

2285
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:33,119
what are the things that uniquely

2286
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,119
position this company to be successful

2287
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:37,198
and you just have to be able to answer i

2288
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:39,039
think a number of those questions

2289
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:40,479
uh pretty crisply

2290
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:43,039
but at the end of the day it's still a

2291
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:46,879
big risk so you're just trying to

2292
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:50,639
to try to minimize the risk

2293
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,639
let me jump to another topic

2294
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:53,760
you're an incredible

2295
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:55,759
human being that you're involved with

2296
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,960
this your band

2297
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:01,840
ghost hounds is touring with the rolling

2298
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,439
stones so before we talk about your band

2299
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:05,119
let me ask about that

2300
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:07,599
what's that like

2301
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:09,920
playing with the rolling stones

2302
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:13,039
surreal just because

2303
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,639
they're my favorite band of all time

2304
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:16,960
um

2305
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:20,079
there's to me the greatest rock and roll

2306
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:22,800
band it's not even close of all time and

2307
01:21:20,079 --> 01:21:24,960
you know to to share the same stage to

2308
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,800
to be on tour and

2309
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,600
to go out and get that energy from the

2310
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,560
crowd um

2311
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,320
you know

2312
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,840
and every night and come off stage and

2313
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:36,000
later when they go on and you hear that

2314
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,600
iconic ladies and gentlemen the rolling

2315
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,760
stones and then

2316
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,639
it's incredible and you know what's

2317
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:46,400
what's amazing to me about the band next

2318
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:48,000
year will be their 60th anniversary 60

2319
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:49,439
years

2320
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,840
and

2321
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:52,960
it's it's hard to be around anything for

2322
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,480
that long

2323
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:58,719
but making music and packing stadiums

2324
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:00,638
and what's amazing to me they can play a

2325
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:02,960
two-hour set and it's not just that oh

2326
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:06,880
that's a hit or you recognize it

2327
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:08,480
it's like every song is an anthem right

2328
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,960
yeah so

2329
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:13,359
uh so it's it's it's been amazing we got

2330
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:16,079
to play with them in 2019 and when they

2331
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:18,319
ask us to do this uh again

2332
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:20,639
um it's just it's just a

2333
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:23,519
absolute privilege i asked you this

2334
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:25,840
offline so i know you are a kind of rock

2335
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,159
star yeah but

2336
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,960
just me maybe i'm projecting but do you

2337
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:30,238
get

2338
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:32,319
nervous

2339
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:33,599
such a large audience with the rolling

2340
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:34,960
stones

2341
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,920
it feels like there would be a lot of

2342
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,480
pressure

2343
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:40,560
yeah i mean you you definitely don't

2344
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:43,279
want to screw it up i think

2345
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,960
um the band our band

2346
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:47,679
you know is tight-knit and all that

2347
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:50,560
stuff and i think that you

2348
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:52,319
the individual nervousness dissipates

2349
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,239
when you go out as a group and you're

2350
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:55,599
making music together

2351
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:58,000
and you sort of

2352
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,159
okay we're all in this and you know

2353
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,319
we're we're doing a thing which is why

2354
01:23:00,158 --> 01:23:05,599
even in sports i always look at

2355
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:07,519
individual events like ice skating or

2356
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,960
you know anything where it's just you

2357
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,960
out there alone

2358
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,480
and that's that's different than being

2359
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,840
uh with it with a team and nerve

2360
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:14,718
wracking so

2361
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,319
um

2362
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:18,000
i'm sure if it was me with an acoustic

2363
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:19,599
guitar just going out

2364
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,039
it would feel different but absolutely

2365
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,880
you get

2366
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:23,920
the right kind of butterflies i would

2367
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,800
call it

2368
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,880
um

2369
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:30,320
and just the energy

2370
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:32,960
of playing music and having it be this

2371
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:35,679
relationship and you and look i i get it

2372
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,439
i've been to a ton of concerts where i'm

2373
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,560
like look can we just get to the band

2374
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:40,719
please

2375
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,719
but uh what's been great is just an

2376
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,760
amazing reception

2377
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:46,000
um

2378
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,800
and we have this this uh guy named trey

2379
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,719
nation who's the lead singer is just

2380
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,719
incredibly talented i mean

2381
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:54,880
he's just uh

2382
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:57,520
not only an amazing voice but just has

2383
01:23:54,880 --> 01:24:00,159
that charismatic thing yeah so he's

2384
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,719
great it's fun what's it feel like

2385
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:05,039
to play in front of a huge audience

2386
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:06,880
what's uh what's the as a guitarist like

2387
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:08,800
what's uh they feel are you lost in the

2388
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,480
music like you almost don't

2389
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,039
feel the audience

2390
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:15,678
does it add extra energy does it ex

2391
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:17,198
extra anxiety what what is it make

2392
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:19,600
what's it feel like

2393
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:22,319
you know stadiums are interesting just

2394
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,000
because it's so big and cavernous

2395
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:27,279
and because you know you want to protect

2396
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:29,760
your ears so we use an in-ear system so

2397
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:31,439
that you are a little disconnected

2398
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,800
from the crowd because if you're playing

2399
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:35,198
that loud and you're standing in front

2400
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,320
of your amps without ear protection that

2401
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:38,319
that's bad

2402
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:40,559
how are you monitoring the sound are the

2403
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:42,158
in-ear stuff is that producing sound or

2404
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,719
is it strictly ear plugs no it's

2405
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:46,399
producing the sound so

2406
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,000
it's like putting ear pods in and

2407
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:50,238
listening to a song and you're playing

2408
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,079
to it right it's just us playing but it

2409
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:54,319
protects your ears

2410
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:54,319
um

2411
01:24:54,639 --> 01:25:00,480
but the the energy from the crowd when

2412
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:02,479
they when they get going and get into it

2413
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:03,678
which knock on wood so far has been

2414
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:06,158
amazing

2415
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:07,520
um there's nothing like it

2416
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:10,960
i mean there's

2417
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:13,600
it's uh it's just this bi-directional

2418
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,319
thing that happens and um

2419
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,719
i

2420
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:18,719
love music was kind of music and sports

2421
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,399
were you know kind of my first loves and

2422
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:22,079
um

2423
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:24,238
it's uh

2424
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:28,000
yeah it's it's very difficult to

2425
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:31,279
describe i think accurately

2426
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,800
because it's like no other feeling

2427
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:34,479
musically

2428
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,880
how is it different than playing in a

2429
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:38,158
garage with the band by yourself

2430
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,319
practicing

2431
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:42,399
like is that do you do you feel like

2432
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:45,679
you're creating something different

2433
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:45,679
when you're when you're um

2434
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,639
when you got the guitar and the amp and

2435
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,719
just the sound dissipating out into and

2436
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:55,520
everybody's listening was is that

2437
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:57,198
it's uh listen the first time we did it

2438
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:59,280
and there's nobody in the stadium first

2439
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:01,839
time i ever played in the stadium and

2440
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:04,319
i'm just like

2441
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,000
i'm out there in front and just hitting

2442
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:07,599
different chords and playing different

2443
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,600
licks and i'm like

2444
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,760
it's like i won a contest and i get to

2445
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,960
do this

2446
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,880
but uh

2447
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:17,039
you know what's different about it

2448
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,000
and each venue is different so if you if

2449
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:18,800
you

2450
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,960
um

2451
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,719
we went on the road with zz top a few

2452
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,800
years ago which was incredible love

2453
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:28,000
billy gibbons he's a texan

2454
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,800
um incredible person and guitar player

2455
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
but

2456
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,400
you know when you're playing in like

2457
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,479
five to seven thousand seats

2458
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:37,198
it's really i mean it's you know you're

2459
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:40,158
right there with them uh with the crowd

2460
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:42,719
and then when you play in an arena

2461
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:44,799
um for we we toured with uh with bob

2462
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,960
seger on his last tour which was cool

2463
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,440
played some shows with him

2464
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,679
and again the arena like they're all

2465
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:54,879
kind of packed on top of you

2466
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:57,679
and it's super loud which which was cool

2467
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:59,840
um i mean the crowd is stadiums is a

2468
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:01,760
completely different animal

2469
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,159
and uh

2470
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:07,199
it's it's just a completely different

2471
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:10,000
experience do you enjoy it versus like a

2472
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:10,000
smaller room

2473
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:14,719
as a guitarist

2474
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,719
as a musician what's your favorite like

2475
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:19,039
room to play of the size any room

2476
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:19,039
that'll

2477
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:26,238
arenas are the perfect blend yeah if i

2478
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,319
had to say because it's loud and you

2479
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:31,119
know 20 30 000 people

2480
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:32,559
but like right up yeah right up on you

2481
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:35,920
stadium

2482
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:38,239
look playing the stadiums with uh

2483
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:40,000
with the rolling stones is it just is

2484
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:40,959
going to go on the head marker somewhere

2485
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,639
is

2486
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,560
one of the more you know i say this and

2487
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:47,440
i really mean it my my life is like a

2488
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:50,800
punk episode that just hasn't no one's

2489
01:27:47,439 --> 01:27:52,719
burst in yet yeah but um

2490
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:55,039
yeah it's it's as cool as you think it

2491
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:57,279
is so 60 years how do you think mick

2492
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:59,600
jagger still got it

2493
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:01,679
how do you know how do you explain it i

2494
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:03,360
i got to tell you so i mean

2495
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:04,800
the funny thing is

2496
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:06,799
whatever

2497
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:09,600
wherever there is excellence people want

2498
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:12,239
to know how'd you do it yeah right

2499
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:14,560
what's the secret

2500
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:16,959
not only is mick jagger and i think the

2501
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:18,480
songs that keith richards and and mick

2502
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:21,119
jagger wrote together if you go back and

2503
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:22,238
listen to the lyrics

2504
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:24,880
it's just

2505
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:27,279
incredibly poignant and

2506
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,639
i'm just a huge stones fan so

2507
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:32,000
but

2508
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:33,440
he works out like a maniac

2509
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,760
right and it's

2510
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:36,559
it's that 10 000 hours thing and it's

2511
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,639
that

2512
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,960
hey maybe i don't feel my best today but

2513
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:45,039
i'm going to get up and do my routine

2514
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:47,520
and work out so that it you know at his

2515
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:49,920
age which you know i mean you can look

2516
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:52,480
at people at different ages

2517
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,158
chronologically that are

2518
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:56,559
you know maybe we're both at this age

2519
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:57,679
but i'm a lot older than you are vice

2520
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,280
versa

2521
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:01,600
and he just uh

2522
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:02,719
i think it's the combination of raw

2523
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,679
talent

2524
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:06,960
and the ability and he's he's very smart

2525
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:09,840
right like he's

2526
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,520
understands how to have interaction with

2527
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:13,679
a crowd and hold him in the palm of his

2528
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,760
hand and be an entertainer

2529
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:18,960
but then on top of that the reason he

2530
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:21,360
can at this age run around stadiums

2531
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,560
and be just as energetic as he puts the

2532
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:24,639
work in

2533
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:26,719
and that's one thing step that i think a

2534
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:28,400
lot of people miss sometimes where they

2535
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,239
want that magic trick they want to know

2536
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:31,759
what's the shortcut

2537
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:34,479
most of the time the answer is there's

2538
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:36,880
no shortcut yeah you have to

2539
01:29:34,479 --> 01:29:39,039
work hard on the way there and work hard

2540
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,880
to stay on top

2541
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:43,119
that's it and and sometimes it's not

2542
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,119
even like work hard it's just like um

2543
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:48,238
it's like be a professional

2544
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:50,079
which that involves like in his case at

2545
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:52,799
his age with the amount of stuff you

2546
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:55,119
have to do on stage in the way he does

2547
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:58,079
it for two hours you

2548
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:59,840
have this is a professional athlete

2549
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:02,479
a professional athlete

2550
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:04,719
that has to do things that are probably

2551
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:07,198
designed for 20 year olds and 30 year

2552
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,800
olds has to do an older age which means

2553
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:10,158
like what do you have to do well you

2554
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,320
have to probably he probably has like a

2555
01:30:10,158 --> 01:30:14,879
whole physical routine he has to do

2556
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:15,599
diet the whole thing and it's hard

2557
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,199
look

2558
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,280
if you want to do great things you

2559
01:30:17,198 --> 01:30:20,879
probably have to do hard things yeah to

2560
01:30:19,279 --> 01:30:23,840
get there

2561
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:26,639
i'm not gonna make you pick just stick

2562
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:29,119
on the stones for one more minute um

2563
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:30,239
but what are some

2564
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:32,800
great

2565
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:35,919
rolling stones songs that were

2566
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,079
impactful to you lyrically musically

2567
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:41,600
maybe something uh

2568
01:30:38,079 --> 01:30:43,760
you like playing uh like air guitar or

2569
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,840
uh i don't know

2570
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:49,199
probably my favorites i love sympathy

2571
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:51,440
for the devil yeah uh it's a very

2572
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:54,158
i don't know sort of faustian i i love

2573
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:56,079
the lyrics i love the how the almost a

2574
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:57,759
voodoo beat just kind of builds

2575
01:30:56,079 --> 01:30:59,600
throughout the song

2576
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:01,679
um that's that's always been one of my

2577
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:04,719
favorites so in that song he never

2578
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:06,079
mentions devil does he no wait sorry uh

2579
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:08,079
uh

2580
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,000
like you know my name yeah there's a

2581
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:11,439
there's like a flirtation going around

2582
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,319
in the in the lyrics it's kind of

2583
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:14,399
interesting

2584
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:17,279
it's here's all the trouble i've caused

2585
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:18,799
along the way with you humans and i i

2586
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:21,279
just think it's really really great and

2587
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:23,920
musically builds really nicely yeah it's

2588
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:25,920
it's it's like both fun and dark it it's

2589
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:28,158
it's cool it's a

2590
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,158
uh

2591
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:33,920
it's there's a playful nature to it it's

2592
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,199
uh that that's very stones like the only

2593
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,000
they can pull it off because it's like

2594
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:40,158
playful but it's also like dark and

2595
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,399
dangerous dangerous dangerous yeah yeah

2596
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:43,599
and and give me shelter in the shelter

2597
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:46,000
it's just

2598
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:48,159
you know and um to this day when i

2599
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,800
listen to the studio version

2600
01:31:48,158 --> 01:31:52,079
and mary clayton just comes on and sings

2601
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,360
that

2602
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:55,359
epic

2603
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:57,920
iconic part

2604
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:58,719
and uh there's a documentary that was

2605
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,279
done

2606
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:04,560
about uh backup singers

2607
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:06,079
uh phenomenal and it tells the story

2608
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,520
of

2609
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:10,719
that moment in that song with mary

2610
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:13,120
clayton and it's just uh

2611
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:14,560
her voice and and the way it unfolded

2612
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:16,000
they got her out of bed at like 10

2613
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,679
o'clock at night in la and she's like

2614
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,479
the rolling stones what

2615
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:23,520
and went in and just killed it

2616
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:26,718
and um i can't sing at all i'm by

2617
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:29,679
ordinance not a lot around a microphone

2618
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:31,679
so i'm always in awe when someone

2619
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:32,880
can sing like that

2620
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,760
um

2621
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:39,039
but uh you know those are those are some

2622
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:41,679
of my uh my favorite rolling stone songs

2623
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:43,920
and painted blacks awesome i mean i

2624
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:45,920
could go on yeah painted black is great

2625
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:48,079
again a song that builds is badass i

2626
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,840
mean it defines that whole generation

2627
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:52,479
what made you pick up a guitar what made

2628
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,639
you fall in love with the guitar

2629
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:58,559
it's just the coolest instrument

2630
01:32:54,639 --> 01:33:01,840
right i mean when you watched back then

2631
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:03,920
you know and i was kind of an old soul

2632
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:06,319
i was listening

2633
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:09,760
at a fairly young age to

2634
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:14,719
muddy waters robert johnson lightning

2635
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:17,600
hopkins bb king and just the soulfulness

2636
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:20,239
thrill is gone oh my god i mean

2637
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,760
bibi plays five notes and just

2638
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:24,799
kills it

2639
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:26,480
and the emotion that that it evokes so i

2640
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:29,360
i just

2641
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:30,638
was just in awe of the instrument

2642
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:32,719
and uh

2643
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,560
you know i i also there's there's always

2644
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:36,560
somebody

2645
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,880
around who's a musician that just picks

2646
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:41,120
the instrument up and can play

2647
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,880
right and they're just so talented at it

2648
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:45,599
and they can just listen to a record and

2649
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:48,319
play that that was never me

2650
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,600
i i never took formal lessons i had to

2651
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:51,119
grind

2652
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:54,159
you know to just

2653
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:56,639
make it sound like i wanted it to sound

2654
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:58,799
so both technically an ear

2655
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:00,000
everything was hard work yeah i mean i

2656
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,279
could hear it

2657
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
um

2658
01:34:01,279 --> 01:34:03,920
and

2659
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,279
and what they call you know you're you

2660
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:09,840
play so my right hand yeah the you know

2661
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:11,599
the rhythm side of it is uh that's

2662
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:13,199
probably if i have anything my my

2663
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:15,920
strength

2664
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:18,399
but there's something

2665
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:20,639
pretty amazing that happens when you get

2666
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:22,399
together with other people

2667
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:25,840
and play a song

2668
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:27,839
in that moment where it hits the pocket

2669
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:29,039
and you all kind of know it

2670
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,039
and it just

2671
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:33,119
it's just such a cool feeling

2672
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:35,439
and uh it was interesting growing

2673
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:37,599
growing up because i was again i always

2674
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:39,198
had eclectic interest so i loved math

2675
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,280
and physics and science so i had those

2676
01:34:39,198 --> 01:34:43,118
friends and i was an athlete and played

2677
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:45,599
football and baseball and basketball so

2678
01:34:43,118 --> 01:34:47,920
i had my jock friends

2679
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:50,320
uh and then i had my music friends and

2680
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,600
it so it was it was just

2681
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:53,679
kind of that

2682
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,199
and um

2683
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:57,760
so when i was still living in los

2684
01:34:55,198 --> 01:35:01,519
angeles and had uh

2685
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:04,480
legendary i just missed playing

2686
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:07,679
and so i i put this band together

2687
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:11,198
and called it the ghost hounds because

2688
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:13,520
again huge robert johnson fan and that

2689
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:15,919
legend of robert johnson selling his

2690
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:17,600
soul at the crossroads in exchange for

2691
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:19,920
his musical talent you guys have that in

2692
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,320
one of the videos yeah yeah such a cool

2693
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:23,600
video exactly so i always i just thought

2694
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:26,158
like that's

2695
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:28,800
that's such cool lore

2696
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:31,118
um i just love the blues so robert

2697
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:33,360
johnson would often would would talk

2698
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:34,639
about hellhounds on his trail

2699
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:36,000
and so i always

2700
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:38,560
just thought

2701
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:41,359
huh what about ghost towns so that's i

2702
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:43,679
wish it were a more clever deeper story

2703
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:45,198
but that that's about it for that name

2704
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:47,199
that's pretty deep robert johnson is

2705
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:49,439
incredible but you also talk about this

2706
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:50,799
that you you connect to the storytelling

2707
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:53,599
of blues

2708
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:56,480
so what makes a good story in a song

2709
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,239
like what what aspect of storytelling uh

2710
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:01,118
connects with you in song so i'm a big

2711
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:01,919
lyrics guy too i love uh like

2712
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:04,559
deep

2713
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:06,399
lyric people like tom waits and

2714
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,320
uh like people that are like you know

2715
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:10,479
leonard cohen like that are you even bob

2716
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:13,118
dylan that are like

2717
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:14,718
obviously yes poetry and then there's

2718
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:18,479
some people like the rolling stones

2719
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:21,439
there it's like seemingly simpler but

2720
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:23,599
it's still so much more to it it's like

2721
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:25,839
less is often more

2722
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:28,000
it still tells a strong story yeah and

2723
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:29,840
there's there's certain people and

2724
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,800
jagger and mick jagger and keith

2725
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:35,119
richards are in this boat billy gibbons

2726
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:39,199
they just say things in a certain way

2727
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:41,839
yeah they're just cool right it just uh

2728
01:36:39,198 --> 01:36:44,238
and so you know i i write our music and

2729
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:46,239
lyrics um

2730
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:48,238
i have to tell

2731
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:50,479
a story i have to know the characters in

2732
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:52,158
the song i'm not good at just

2733
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:54,638
writing some rhymes and having it match

2734
01:36:52,158 --> 01:36:57,439
up to the right key and the right music

2735
01:36:54,639 --> 01:37:00,319
i i have to understand like

2736
01:36:57,439 --> 01:37:01,919
that's just me i i've and uh

2737
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:04,319
so i think that look if you have three

2738
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:06,480
or four minutes to tell a story

2739
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:09,359
you have to be more efficient

2740
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:11,439
with your your use of language

2741
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:14,079
and you have to understand what you're

2742
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:17,439
building to if anything and evoke

2743
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:20,319
uh emotion and hopefully

2744
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:22,479
for those three minutes get the listener

2745
01:37:20,319 --> 01:37:24,719
to understand not only the point of the

2746
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:26,399
song but where you're coming from and to

2747
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:29,840
make you feel

2748
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:31,920
uh a certain way there's a song that you

2749
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:34,480
know the audiences seem to like a lot on

2750
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:37,199
the new album called good old days and i

2751
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:40,319
wrote that because

2752
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:42,559
especially during covenant reflecting on

2753
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:46,158
what what normalcy looks like and what

2754
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:48,000
it what happens when you're cut off

2755
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:50,158
i i just was kind of taken with this

2756
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,079
idea of

2757
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:53,679
that when you sit around and reminisce

2758
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:55,840
with friends

2759
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:58,079
oftentimes

2760
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:59,199
it's not just like some big event

2761
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:01,760
happened

2762
01:37:59,198 --> 01:38:04,000
it's remember that summer we'd go up to

2763
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,199
the lake all the time and it's who you

2764
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,639
were with

2765
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:09,279
and at the time

2766
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:10,480
it probably seemed pretty pedestrian

2767
01:38:09,279 --> 01:38:12,079
right it just seemed like kind of a

2768
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:13,919
normal day

2769
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:16,719
but it was the company you were keeping

2770
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,800
it was the time in your life it was

2771
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:20,319
whatever it was and i just kind of

2772
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,600
struck me that

2773
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:22,880
right now

2774
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,960
we're doing stuff that you're going to

2775
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,118
reminisce about later that

2776
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:29,039
seems kind of ordinary be like man that

2777
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:30,960
was such a great time

2778
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:32,960
so the idea is be in the moment and all

2779
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,399
that stuff but these are the good old

2780
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:37,679
days

2781
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:39,519
and then enjoy it and soak it in and and

2782
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:41,679
you know kind of be present for it yeah

2783
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:43,520
it's a great perspective to take on the

2784
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:45,039
present because we are in the thing that

2785
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:46,719
will remember we're living through the

2786
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:48,158
thing we'll remember and sometimes the

2787
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:52,000
things we'll remember is the simple

2788
01:38:48,158 --> 01:38:52,000
stuff it's a little stuff yeah

2789
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:57,440
outside of uh

2790
01:38:54,560 --> 01:39:00,080
keith richards who is the greatest

2791
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:02,399
ridiculous question but just indulge me

2792
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:05,519
who is the greatest uh blues guitarist

2793
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:07,118
of all time rock guitarist of all time

2794
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,040
well you got a little bit of a hybrid

2795
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:11,039
with jimi hendrix right because he

2796
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:14,158
played the blues and he played rock and

2797
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:16,319
roll so i i think most guitarists would

2798
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:17,759
say jimi hendrix is pretty yeah

2799
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:19,840
ridiculous

2800
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,760
that that probably for me i'm a huge

2801
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,840
huge huge hendrix fantasy because he

2802
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:26,239
can't you can't i mean

2803
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:28,079
even to this day i don't care technology

2804
01:39:26,238 --> 01:39:30,319
pedals whatever he just

2805
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:31,679
somehow fused

2806
01:39:30,319 --> 01:39:34,079
with the instrument

2807
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:35,840
um i can't be sitting here in austin

2808
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:39,039

2809
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:40,880

all over the place yeah

2814
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:52,880
stevie ray vaughan is another one of

2815
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:55,039
those that is incredible just blows me

2816
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:57,279

uh so uh in both electric and acoustic

2827
01:40:16,238 --> 01:40:20,799
yeah just he's a fast range absolute

2828
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,800
master

2829
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:24,719

mentioned bob seeger that's that's

2831
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:28,800
that's an interesting one he's he

2832
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:31,118
doesn't he almost doesn't get

2833
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:33,199
enough credit i feel like for how great

2834
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:34,799
he is obviously he's super famous but

2835
01:40:33,198 --> 01:40:36,399
now he's

2836
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,320
in his voice

2837
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:40,719
i i also i have the privilege of of

2838
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:43,439
getting friendly with john fogarty

2839
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:46,158
uh you know john fogerty and ccr fame

2840
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:48,799
and he's another one that's just

2841
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:51,759
the way he phrases things and you just

2842
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:54,320
look at the catalog of stuff he wrote

2843
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:56,639
uh an amazing talent

2844
01:40:54,319 --> 01:40:59,519
um i read uh

2845
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:02,480
spring bruce springsteen's book

2846
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:04,639
and was i'm a fan but after reading the

2847
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:07,118
book it was really you go back and

2848
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:10,000
listen to his lyrics and

2849
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:12,238
the way he pours himself out you know is

2850
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,359
uh is pretty incredible

2851
01:41:12,238 --> 01:41:17,439
um

2852
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:19,519
and then again with the old blues guys

2853
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:20,559
i just think the emotion they could get

2854
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,719
out of

2855
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:24,639
playing like this staying on the one

2856
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:26,719
right just playing the same

2857
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:30,000
rhythm john lee hooker

2858
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:33,840
uh you listen to manish boy by uh uh by

2859
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:36,000
muddy waters and it's just

2860
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:38,319
there's something so

2861
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,158
it just draws me in every time and the

2862
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:41,439
emotion they're able to get out of

2863
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:44,319
things

2864
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:48,479
um and i'm also a huge chuck berry fan

2865
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:49,840
i just think that sound is uh i love it

2866
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:50,959
uh do you know how to play johnny be

2867
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,039

2868
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,880
i do

2869
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:57,118
yeah that's good

2870
01:41:54,880 --> 01:42:01,279
maybe you know one of the great moments

2871
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:03,599
at least of my childhood was uh

2872
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:07,118
back to the future yeah and watching

2873
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:08,800
michael j fox plug in yeah and uh

2874
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:10,799
and then at the end play play at the

2875
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:12,560
dance to save his parents with johnny be

2876
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,639
good pretty awesome yeah the guitar is

2877
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:17,280
so much more than a musical instrument

2878
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:20,319
it feels like it's like the

2879
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:23,039
in the 20th century it's like the car

2880
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:25,118
like it defines so much of hollywood so

2881
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:26,800
much of a generation of what it means to

2882
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:28,639
be

2883
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:31,039
i don't know what it means to be a man

2884
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:33,840
what it means to be a human in america

2885
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:35,359
it's it's fascinating emblematic to me

2886
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,840
of

2887
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:40,399
a certain type of music yeah and that

2888
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:42,880
that's uh i made a documentary years ago

2889
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:45,439

2890
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:47,279

and the edge from you too

2896
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:59,920
okay all right well now you have to tell

2897
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:02,319
the story of that one because

2898
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:03,920
how the heck did that all come together

2899
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:07,279
because it's so fascinating such

2900
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:10,239
different musicians all coming together

2901
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:11,840
talking about their story talking about

2902
01:43:10,238 --> 01:43:14,000
how they approach the music and also

2903
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:16,880
playing together a little bit in this

2904
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,760
casual kind of setting well look i one

2905
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:21,118
day i came downstairs and i the rolling

2906
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,480
stone magazine is sitting there and it

2907
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:24,559
was the 50th

2908
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:25,759
was the 50 top guitarist of all time

2909
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,840
their list

2910
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:30,159
and then i had some other financial

2911
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:32,480
report with video games and the top

2912
01:43:30,158 --> 01:43:34,399
video game at the time was guitar hero

2913
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:36,158
right and then there was a third thing i

2914
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:38,079
can't recall it but i just

2915
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:39,759
and i said to myself what is it about

2916
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:41,039
the guitar

2917
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,400
that is so

2918
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:44,399
central

2919
01:43:42,399 --> 01:43:47,359
to the rock and roll whatever you want

2920
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:48,319
to call it like why is that the symbol

2921
01:43:47,359 --> 01:43:50,319
um

2922
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:52,799
and i said to myself

2923
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:55,198
i want to ask jimmy page why he picked

2924
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,079
up the guitar because he's jimmy page

2925
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:59,359
right

2926
01:43:56,079 --> 01:44:01,920
and so i called a friend of mine davis

2927
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:03,920
guggenheim who had directed inconvenient

2928
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,639
truth and i think still is but at the

2929
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:08,319
time was the biggest documentary ever

2930
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:10,639
and i called davis and i said look i

2931
01:44:08,319 --> 01:44:12,880
have this idea i want to make this

2932
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:15,039
movie about the guitar

2933
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:16,239
about different eras and styles and

2934
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:17,600
whatever but i've never made a

2935
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:20,399
documentary i don't i don't know how to

2936
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:21,760
do that so i was just looking for advice

2937
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:23,839
and

2938
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,960
thankfully because he's

2939
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,960
one of the best

2940
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,639
documentarians ever

2941
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,880
davis is like you know what i can't get

2942
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:33,679
this out of my head i'll direct it

2943
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:35,920
which was amazing and we we wrote three

2944
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:38,239
names down that represented

2945
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:39,840
different eras and different styles

2946
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:41,599
rarely do you get

2947
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:44,639
you know you go three for three

2948
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:46,400
but it was it was those three guys

2949
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:48,400
and um

2950
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:50,559
it was just it was just such a

2951
01:44:48,399 --> 01:44:52,319
incredible experience to sit there and

2952
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:54,960
get to know

2953
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:56,158
jimmy page you know i mean it was like

2954
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:58,239
and he was

2955
01:44:56,158 --> 01:44:59,279
he was like gandalf man he was like

2956
01:44:58,238 --> 01:45:02,718
always

2957
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,679
jimmy page yeah and um that's so cool to

2958
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:05,520
see him

2959
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:07,440
gandalf was

2960
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:10,639
there's like a wisdom there's a calmness

2961
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:13,039
to him compared to like the uh

2962
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:14,319
restlessness of uh jack white like the

2963
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:15,760
um

2964
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:17,840
i mean that that combination was just

2965
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:19,760
fascinating it was one of the coolest

2966
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:22,000
experiences ever

2967
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:24,880
and one of the things there was a moment

2968
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,118
where jimmy he was going through his his

2969
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:29,118
guitar case and he had the double neck

2970
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:31,839
from stairway to heaven and he handed it

2971
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:31,839
to me and i was like

2972
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,479
i mean

2973
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:36,319
it's it's like somebody handing you

2974
01:45:34,479 --> 01:45:39,359
excalibur or something yeah yeah

2975
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:41,039
uh amazing experience and the edge

2976
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:42,479
one of the kindest human beings you'll

2977
01:45:41,039 --> 01:45:44,800
ever meet in your life

2978
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:46,238
just an amazing person

2979
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:48,320
um and i think he hit it right in the

2980
01:45:46,238 --> 01:45:50,638
head with jack is he's got that

2981
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:52,079
that energy you know and constantly

2982
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:54,239
pushing himself

2983
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:56,399
but uh it's hard to believe it's been i

2984
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:59,039
think 10 or 11 or maybe even 12 years

2985
01:45:56,399 --> 01:46:01,118
since it came out but after watching it

2986
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:04,000
i realized like

2987
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:06,158
how much it was needed and

2988
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,198
i was almost surprised it didn't already

2989
01:46:06,158 --> 01:46:08,638
exist

2990
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:12,238
it was like

2991
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:13,679
yeah the guitar wasn't quite celebrated

2992
01:46:12,238 --> 01:46:15,599
like explicitly we almost didn't

2993
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:17,679
acknowledge it

2994
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,039
how important it was culturally it's

2995
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:21,520
kind of amazing and the way it closed

2996
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:23,279
from the song uh the the wait it was

2997
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:24,480
it's called the weight yeah by the band

2998
01:46:23,279 --> 01:46:25,599
yeah yeah

2999
01:46:24,479 --> 01:46:27,039
that's because they didn't want to go

3000
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:29,119
home yeah

3001
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:31,039
we were shooting on a warner brothers

3002
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:32,479
sound stage for three days when we

3003
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:34,960
called it the summit where the three of

3004
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:38,000
them came together yeah and the two

3005
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:40,079
things i'll never forget is when jimmy

3006
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,760
starts to play the riff from whole lot

3007
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:44,319
of love yeah

3008
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:45,600
edge and jack ceased to be

3009
01:46:44,319 --> 01:46:48,639
rock

3010
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:51,039
you know rock gods or whatever and

3011
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:53,199
had the same 15 year old kid feeling

3012
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:54,800
that i did you could see in their face

3013
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:56,638
and then at the end they're like hey can

3014
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,000
we play we just want to we don't want to

3015
01:46:56,639 --> 01:47:00,400
go can we just play something

3016
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,840
acoustically yeah so we printed out the

3017
01:47:00,399 --> 01:47:03,759
lyrics that's what they wanted to play

3018
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:06,480
and they just sat there

3019
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:08,239
and sat on those couches and just

3020
01:47:06,479 --> 01:47:09,279
such a good way to end yeah it's

3021
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:11,759
incredible

3022
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:13,920
what's your guitar rig

3023
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,199
setup like you you also you have a few

3024
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:17,199
guitars

3025
01:47:15,198 --> 01:47:20,399
first well let's let's just put on the

3026
01:47:17,198 --> 01:47:21,678
line so what what's uh better les paul

3027
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:23,599
or strat

3028
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:25,118
well i'm not going to get into what's

3029
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:27,760
what's better because i'm sure that'll

3030
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:30,000
start a flood of whatever for me

3031
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,920
i'm going to say it's strat all right

3032
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,719
i'm just going to put out there

3033
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:36,560
my main instrument is is a les paul but

3034
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:39,118
i okay okay let me just put on the table

3035
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:40,719
i'm speaking as somebody who literally i

3036
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:42,559
i i don't think i've ever actually

3037
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:44,800
strummed a chord in the last ball so

3038
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:47,199
i've been i'm not maybe yeah uninitiated

3039
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:48,800
yeah exactly so i don't i i don't speak

3040
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:50,719
from experience but i

3041
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:52,880
it's probably because of hendrix i'm so

3042
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:55,118
deeply influenced by hendricks that sure

3043
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:57,520
i just kind of followed his footsteps

3044
01:47:55,118 --> 01:48:00,960
and clapton and so on the amazing thing

3045
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:02,800
to me is if you look back at leo fender

3046
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:05,198
and what the gibson guitar company and

3047
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:06,639
les paul did in the 50s

3048
01:48:05,198 --> 01:48:09,279
those are still

3049
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:11,600
the shapes and the perfect thing today

3050
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:12,800
right the strat and the telecaster yeah

3051
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,039
the last paul

3052
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:16,480
and it's they got it right way back way

3053
01:48:15,039 --> 01:48:17,439
back then so

3054
01:48:16,479 --> 01:48:20,638
um

3055
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:22,799
i have uh my main guitar you got to name

3056
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:23,760
your guitar so my main guitar is named

3057
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,239
hazel

3058
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:27,119
and it's a 59 les paul

3059
01:48:26,238 --> 01:48:29,439
and

3060
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:32,639
there's something magical

3061
01:48:29,439 --> 01:48:34,000
in that year like a stradivarius

3062
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:35,920
and they're just

3063
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,880
there's something different about them

3064
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:39,679
um

3065
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:41,600
so i i play that and then i play it

3066
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:43,679
through

3067
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,840
sort of my main rig is either a 59

3068
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:49,039
fender

3069
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:50,480
twin uh or a 65 um

3070
01:48:49,039 --> 01:48:51,439
marshall

3071
01:48:50,479 --> 01:48:53,039
and then

3072
01:48:51,439 --> 01:48:55,118
when we're on the road now because when

3073
01:48:53,039 --> 01:48:56,960
you use older vintage stuff you just got

3074
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:59,039
to be super careful the tubes and

3075
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:01,359
everything it has to be reliable so very

3076
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:03,198
nicely the guys from two rock

3077
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:05,359
sent me some of their amps and they're

3078
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:07,118
really because i don't use any new stuff

3079
01:49:05,359 --> 01:49:08,238
but the two rock stuff is is pretty

3080
01:49:07,118 --> 01:49:09,759
great so that's actually what i'm

3081
01:49:08,238 --> 01:49:11,039
talking about it gets close like it's a

3082
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:13,119
close to the sound that you like with

3083
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:14,960
the market yeah yeah it's new and

3084
01:49:13,118 --> 01:49:17,039
reliable so that's what i'm using on the

3085
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:19,679
road right do people use like emulation

3086
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:22,560
do they use software is it still they do

3087
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:24,719
i i personally don't i i go you know i

3088
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,800
don't have many pedals i use a clon an

3089
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:28,960
old you know vintage klon

3090
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:31,119
straight into the amp and go

3091
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:33,118
as old-school as possible yeah is there

3092
01:49:31,118 --> 01:49:34,399
other cool guitars you have that kind of

3093
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:36,639
stand out

3094
01:49:34,399 --> 01:49:40,158
i have uh a bunch of what they call

3095
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:42,639
blackguard telecasters from the 50s um

3096
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:44,559
which are pretty great what are those

3097
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:46,880
black guard telecasters yeah so they're

3098
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:48,000
just notes oh they actually legit have a

3099
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,560
black card

3100
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,639
guard got it uh but they're incredible

3101
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,639
so what's the color of the telecaster

3102
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:56,319
itself most of them are yellow with

3103
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:58,719
black and then they got into different

3104
01:49:56,319 --> 01:50:01,439
configurations but there's something

3105
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:04,000
i have a 51 telecaster

3106
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:05,839
that i i play an open g on and songs

3107
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,560
with open g that just

3108
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:10,079
again there's something

3109
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,480
you know and i'll take all the help i

3110
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:14,719
can get in terms of you know making it

3111
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:17,039
sound great so i'll try to find the

3112
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:18,079
magic ones what's your writing process

3113
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:21,519
like

3114
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:22,960
for uh the music and the lyrics

3115
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:25,119
is there

3116
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:27,520
do you have to go to the uh

3117
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:29,118
the mountains is there whiskey involved

3118
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,480
what do you have to do or do you just

3119
01:50:29,118 --> 01:50:32,639
write a little bit whenever you have a

3120
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:35,198
moment of free time i'm a boring guy

3121
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:37,599
because i don't drink i don't i just uh

3122
01:50:35,198 --> 01:50:39,759
i figure i can screw things up plenty on

3123
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:42,480
my own without adding anything that's a

3124
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:45,520
good call um but uh

3125
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:47,759
you know for me it either starts with uh

3126
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:50,639
with a riff just some

3127
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:53,360
something that i think is an interesting

3128
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:55,599
you know riff or tone that i i can kind

3129
01:50:53,359 --> 01:50:58,880
of sink my teeth into a little bit

3130
01:50:55,599 --> 01:51:01,360
and a lot of times i'll write a title

3131
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:02,319
and love a title and then start to oh

3132
01:51:01,359 --> 01:51:04,799
cool

3133
01:51:02,319 --> 01:51:07,840
so the title is almost like an idea yeah

3134
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:09,920
like this is where i want to be

3135
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:11,760
and and then start kind of writing it

3136
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:13,840
out and again

3137
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,920
i just have to know

3138
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,639
am i writing from a character's point of

3139
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:19,760
view am i writing about someone or

3140
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:22,000
something

3141
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:23,679
you know is like the narrator

3142
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,079
and you know what is this person are

3143
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:28,399
they happy are they sad or they

3144
01:51:26,079 --> 01:51:29,840
where are they in life i i don't know if

3145
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:32,479
all that like

3146
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,639
great writers i'm sure would say

3147
01:51:32,479 --> 01:51:35,598
why don't you just write you don't need

3148
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:38,159
all that

3149
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:39,920
uh but that's for me that's my process

3150
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:42,079
well i'm not so sure about that and i

3151
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:43,440
bet you quite a lot of writers

3152
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:45,760
have

3153
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:48,158
create a world in their mind

3154
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:50,239
before they even put the simplest awards

3155
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:53,279
down so yeah there's

3156
01:51:50,238 --> 01:51:53,279
there's quite a lot to that

3157
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:59,440
what's your favorite song to play

3158
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:02,239
is there some favorites one favorite

3159
01:51:59,439 --> 01:52:06,000
ones you go to but both play and kind of

3160
01:52:02,238 --> 01:52:08,079
i'm sure you love singing no no no no no

3161
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,719
you don't i'm not uh i'm neither

3162
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:12,559
talented nor do i have the the desire

3163
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:14,399
and i think uh

3164
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,320
you know if you come see the show you

3165
01:52:14,399 --> 01:52:18,238
won't see a microphone anywhere near me

3166
01:52:16,319 --> 01:52:20,158
but do you i mean do you hear like when

3167
01:52:18,238 --> 01:52:22,319
you're thinking about lyrics do you hear

3168
01:52:20,158 --> 01:52:24,559
the idea of the words

3169
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:26,639
and especially

3170
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:29,039
what's great you know with trey is i

3171
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:30,960
write for his voice and then we have

3172
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:33,439
these amazing

3173
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:35,840
uh backup singers that that are are just

3174
01:52:33,439 --> 01:52:36,960
and i i can hear all of it i just can't

3175
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:40,719
do it

3176
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:43,279
um and so uh i'd say to

3177
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:46,158
of our stuff there's a song called half

3178
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:47,198
my fault that i play in open g

3179
01:52:46,158 --> 01:52:49,439
that just

3180
01:52:47,198 --> 01:52:50,399
i i love playing the song i love that

3181
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:52,079
energy

3182
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:53,839
and then there's uh we have a new blues

3183
01:52:52,079 --> 01:52:56,719
album coming out

3184
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:56,719
and there's a song

3185
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:02,000
called baby we're through

3186
01:52:59,039 --> 01:53:04,238
and it just stays on the one and for

3187
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,920
non-musicians that means like in a lot

3188
01:53:04,238 --> 01:53:08,000
of rock and roll and blues it's what's

3189
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:10,239
called a one four five

3190
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,079
uh progression from your your kind of

3191
01:53:10,238 --> 01:53:13,519
root note and you would hear if if

3192
01:53:12,079 --> 01:53:15,198
you're a non-musician if you heard it

3193
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:16,400
you'd be like oh yeah that's a lot of

3194
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:18,479
songs

3195
01:53:16,399 --> 01:53:20,719
and this song just stays on the same

3196
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:23,279
groove like uh look range

3197
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:26,319
or shake your hips or any of those songs

3198
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:28,000
and it's just got this unbelievable

3199
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:29,759
energy and it's fun to play but i have

3200
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,639
to keep the same

3201
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:34,560
rhythmic thing going for the whole song

3202
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:36,319
with that simplicity i mean the

3203
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,760
the personality of the song can really

3204
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:39,599
shine i mean trey's

3205
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,639
i mean that guy

3206
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:43,760
um

3207
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:45,199
really cool it just comes through

3208
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:47,360
i mean i guess you need that from a lead

3209
01:53:45,198 --> 01:53:49,279
singer as you said he's just

3210
01:53:47,359 --> 01:53:52,479
you got to have that and my other guitar

3211
01:53:49,279 --> 01:53:54,639
player uh johnny bob is uh

3212
01:53:52,479 --> 01:53:58,158
he's a phenomenal i mean like a

3213
01:53:54,639 --> 01:54:01,359
legitimate guitar slinger

3214
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:03,279
um you know we probably split the lead

3215
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:05,759
70 30

3216
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:07,359
and he is just

3217
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:08,960
you know there's times sometimes i look

3218
01:54:07,359 --> 01:54:10,238
over at him and i'm like i'm being a fan

3219
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:12,639
right now because what you just laid

3220
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:14,399
down is pretty good

3221
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:16,079
from a lead perspective what's the most

3222
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:17,679
fun thing to play

3223
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:19,599
what do you what kind of stuff do you do

3224
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:22,000
like slow do you like i mean if you feel

3225
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:24,079
like thrill is gone there's uh so if you

3226
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,840
look at bb king sometimes one note just

3227
01:54:24,079 --> 01:54:27,760
bending the [ __ ] out of that yeah what

3228
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:29,360
do you call that vibrato yeah if i'm

3229
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:31,760
gonna play the lead it's a certain kind

3230
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:32,639
of feel slow blues is probably my

3231
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,760
favorite

3232
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:35,440
to play

3233
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:37,760
or something that's got a little more of

3234
01:54:35,439 --> 01:54:40,319
that chuck berry drive

3235
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:41,920
where you can be rhythmic in the lead

3236
01:54:40,319 --> 01:54:44,158
um

3237
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:46,079
you know i can't the shredding thing

3238
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:49,359
that those guys do is that that's not

3239
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:50,639
yeah my i was actually always able to do

3240
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:52,479
that

3241
01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:54,480
really well like you mentioned people

3242
01:54:52,479 --> 01:54:56,158
that pick up fat like maybe it's the

3243
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:57,678
classical piano training i could i could

3244
01:54:56,158 --> 01:55:00,079
play super fast and guitar super

3245
01:54:57,679 --> 01:55:02,800
technical but to me the hardest thing

3246
01:55:00,079 --> 01:55:04,639
and the the my favorite things

3247
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:06,320
is just um

3248
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:08,800
has probably less to do with a guitar

3249
01:55:06,319 --> 01:55:10,799
more living on life that's worth playing

3250
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,960
a guitar for

3251
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:15,360
it's like a certain kind of

3252
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:16,880
emotion that you can put into the notes

3253
01:55:15,359 --> 01:55:19,039
and that has to do with bending notes

3254
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:20,239
well like bending nose is a whole other

3255
01:55:19,039 --> 01:55:22,399
art form

3256
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:25,198
of um

3257
01:55:22,399 --> 01:55:27,039
i worked surprisingly a long time on

3258
01:55:25,198 --> 01:55:28,399
comfortably numb

3259
01:55:27,039 --> 01:55:30,800
um

3260
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:32,719
and there's the so so david gilmour is

3261
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:35,279
does a lot of bending and they're simple

3262
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:36,560
there's they they they sound simple

3263
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:40,000
but

3264
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:42,480
they're the the dynamics of them

3265
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,800
to express like a build up in the way

3266
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:46,879
it's held and there's often a vibrato at

3267
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:47,760
the top for for a bit

3268
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:50,000
just

3269
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:52,480
that um

3270
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,399
the the the it's almost like a sigh

3271
01:55:52,479 --> 01:55:55,519
and a sigh of relief and the build up i

3272
01:55:54,399 --> 01:55:57,118
mean it's just the

3273
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,960
that's an art form for him that's hard

3274
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:02,238
to get right it's not just playing a

3275
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:04,800
note playing a note playing a note it's

3276
01:56:02,238 --> 01:56:06,399
it's in that like dynamic movement of a

3277
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,800
note that so much can happen that's

3278
01:56:06,399 --> 01:56:10,879
where the blues just happens to it's

3279
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:12,079
look i'm a huge freddie king fan too

3280
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:15,840
right who and

3281
01:56:12,079 --> 01:56:17,198
you listen to these guys and they're

3282
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:18,800
you sit there and they're like man

3283
01:56:17,198 --> 01:56:22,399
you're you're playing

3284
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:24,079
in a small range on the neck

3285
01:56:22,399 --> 01:56:26,238
but

3286
01:56:24,079 --> 01:56:27,840
in you know it's like i know the notes

3287
01:56:26,238 --> 01:56:28,959
you're playing and i'm playing them too

3288
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:31,520
but

3289
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:33,279
not like that right i mean it's in

3290
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,320
gilmore is certainly one of those guys

3291
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:36,800
that's

3292
01:56:34,319 --> 01:56:38,319
incredible guitar player and yet another

3293
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,320
chapter

3294
01:56:38,319 --> 01:56:42,238
of an amazing life

3295
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:44,079

3300
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:55,598
your love of football

3301
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:57,679
and the fact

3302
01:56:55,599 --> 01:57:00,639
that you are

3303
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:02,880
part owner of the pittsburgh steelers

3304
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:04,319
yeah so i mean where do we start you

3305
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:05,199
start at the beginning let's start at

3306
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:07,759
the end

3307
01:57:05,198 --> 01:57:08,799
why the steelers what attracted you to

3308
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:11,280
the uh

3309
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:13,920
first of all i think

3310
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:16,238
not to be controversial but one of the

3311
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,960
best uniforms in football in terms of

3312
01:57:16,238 --> 01:57:21,759
just like black and gold just

3313
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:23,198
decal only on one side yeah it's great

3314
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,119
yeah the helmet

3315
01:57:23,198 --> 01:57:26,479
look i've bled black and gold since i

3316
01:57:25,118 --> 01:57:29,519
was a little boy

3317
01:57:26,479 --> 01:57:32,079
uh i grew up in upstate new york

3318
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:34,239
and uh the first football game i ever

3319
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:37,118
saw was the steelers in the super bowl

3320
01:57:34,238 --> 01:57:40,000
is a really little kit and it just

3321
01:57:37,118 --> 01:57:41,759
i mean jack lambert and joe green and

3322
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,198
franco harris and those guys were like

3323
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,520
came down from

3324
01:57:43,198 --> 01:57:46,638
uh olympia mount olympus or something

3325
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,480
and

3326
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:50,719
i just was enamored with the team and

3327
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:52,158
because we only had three channels the

3328
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:53,760
only time i'd get to see him is

3329
01:57:52,158 --> 01:57:55,839
occasionally when they were the game of

3330
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:56,960
the week or something

3331
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:58,560
um

3332
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:00,000
and i just

3333
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:02,480
loved

3334
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,719
to me what they stood for the toughness

3335
01:58:02,479 --> 01:58:06,879
and they played football

3336
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:08,880
you know the the way that i thought i

3337
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,400
thought was was great i was a huge jack

3338
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:13,840
lambert fan

3339
01:58:10,399 --> 01:58:16,000
uh our all hall of fame uh linebacker

3340
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:18,079
who just intimidated everybody so that

3341
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:21,359
was like the that was the decade of the

3342
01:58:18,079 --> 01:58:23,439
the steel curtain

3343
01:58:21,359 --> 01:58:26,559
i mean arguably one of the great sort of

3344
01:58:23,439 --> 01:58:28,719
defensive of in in football history and

3345
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:31,360
also one of the greatest

3346
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:34,560
football teams period of in football

3347
01:58:31,359 --> 01:58:35,359
history i've been a lifelong fan

3348
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:39,119
um

3349
01:58:35,359 --> 01:58:41,198
and was very fortunate to meet mr rooney

3350
01:58:39,118 --> 01:58:43,359
uh the the rooney family started the

3351
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:45,519
team in 1933

3352
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:47,279
um got to know him

3353
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:48,880
and uh

3354
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:50,319
just was asked to be part of the

3355
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,400
ownership group i think it was the end

3356
01:58:50,319 --> 01:58:54,399
of 2007.

3357
01:58:52,399 --> 01:58:58,158
first year as part of the group in 2008

3358
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:59,759
we won the super bowl and it was like

3359
01:58:58,158 --> 01:59:03,519
beyond surreal

3360
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:05,840
and just beyond surreal and um

3361
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:09,119
you know it's it's uh

3362
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:11,760
it's amazing to to be able to do i mean

3363
01:59:09,118 --> 01:59:13,118
the rooney family is one of those

3364
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:15,119
most revered

3365
01:59:13,118 --> 01:59:16,719
in sports for the way they they conduct

3366
01:59:15,118 --> 01:59:18,158
themselves um

3367
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:20,639
mr rooney

3368
01:59:18,158 --> 01:59:22,879
uh passed away i think five years ago

3369
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:24,639
now and we lost him but was a champion

3370
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:27,279
help build the league i mean

3371
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:29,039
put the league as we know it together

3372
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:32,238
more importantly was a civil rights

3373
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:33,760
champion um who created what we now call

3374
01:59:32,238 --> 01:59:35,919
the rooney rule

3375
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:38,719
uh to to make sure that we're being fair

3376
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:40,399
about uh giving minority coaches a

3377
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:41,920
chance to get hired

3378
01:59:40,399 --> 01:59:44,719
and um

3379
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:47,840
just just is one of the most kind and

3380
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:50,960
amazing human beings i ever ever met

3381
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:51,840
it's incredible what sport

3382
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:53,679
does

3383
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,920
um

3384
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:58,399
like to bring out the best in people to

3385
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:02,000
give people hope to inspire people there

3386
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:04,799
is something about football that

3387
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,960
has all the elements of a great sport

3388
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:10,159
it's the teamwork

3389
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:13,599
it's the sort of the combat aspect of it

3390
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:15,359
it's like it's the purity of it it's uh

3391
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:18,400
of like

3392
02:00:15,359 --> 02:00:20,719
strength and power and speed

3393
02:00:18,399 --> 02:00:23,759
and all the elements of like

3394
02:00:20,719 --> 02:00:25,039
last minute close calls required to to

3395
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:27,920
win the game

3396
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:29,599
and uh where referee decisions of course

3397
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:31,679
that's essential for a sport can screw

3398
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:34,159
up the whole thing just got all of it

3399
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:37,279
together i think uh just

3400
02:00:34,158 --> 02:00:40,079
i don't know it gives the the drama and

3401
02:00:37,279 --> 02:00:42,559
the triumphs are just beautiful like

3402
02:00:40,079 --> 02:00:44,079
some of my favorite memories i don't

3403
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:45,599
know if it's an accident or this is

3404
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:47,840
common with people

3405
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:51,199
is just with friends watching football

3406
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:53,360
yeah and connecting over that

3407
02:00:51,198 --> 02:00:55,678
yeah well it's look it's an incredible

3408
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:57,679
game because there's nowhere to hide

3409
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:59,279
right you're out there on the field it

3410
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:02,079
you know it's uh

3411
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:03,920
it's a great game that requires

3412
02:01:02,079 --> 02:01:06,479
not only all those attributes that you

3413
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:07,520
said but it's it's incredibly complex

3414
02:01:06,479 --> 02:01:08,799
game

3415
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:11,520
so if you don't know what you're looking

3416
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:13,440
at and you don't understand how complex

3417
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,880
defenses are trying to disguise what

3418
02:01:13,439 --> 02:01:17,678
they're doing

3419
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:20,800
offenses are trying to overcome that and

3420
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:24,319
and you can set up one play the entire

3421
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:26,560
in the entire game but a team

3422
02:01:24,319 --> 02:01:28,238
that plays well together

3423
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:30,480
right knows their plays inside and out

3424
02:01:28,238 --> 02:01:32,319
knows their assignments inside now can

3425
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:34,000
overcome and beat a more physically

3426
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:35,439
gifted team

3427
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,920
because of that

3428
02:01:35,439 --> 02:01:40,319
uh you know work that that aspect of

3429
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:44,158
working together one of the things

3430
02:01:40,319 --> 02:01:45,840
that i always loved about sports is just

3431
02:01:44,158 --> 02:01:47,519
you're out there

3432
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:48,960
there's a set of rules and there's a

3433
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:51,920
scoreboard

3434
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:54,480
so at the end of that game it says and

3435
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:56,960
you can make excuses about the refs or

3436
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:58,879
this happened or that happened but

3437
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:01,599
you know at the end of the day

3438
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:03,520
did you go out and compete

3439
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:05,679
and when you went out

3440
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:07,360
and were a competitor

3441
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:09,520
how did it work out

3442
02:02:07,359 --> 02:02:11,198
right and and the simplicity of that and

3443
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:13,760
the purity of that

3444
02:02:11,198 --> 02:02:15,039
um is something that i always have been

3445
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:17,920
drawn to

3446
02:02:15,039 --> 02:02:19,840
what about the business of sort of uh

3447
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:22,239
owning a team or putting together a team

3448
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:24,000
or trying to like build up a team that's

3449
02:02:22,238 --> 02:02:25,839
going to be a great team like what are

3450
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,439
some interesting aspects that people

3451
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:28,480
might not realize that you can carry

3452
02:02:27,439 --> 02:02:30,158
over from

3453
02:02:28,479 --> 02:02:32,718
all the other

3454
02:02:30,158 --> 02:02:34,638
experience you have in business

3455
02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:38,000
i i think the hardest thing about

3456
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:40,239
professional sports right now it's

3457
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,719
individuals getting paid money to to

3458
02:02:40,238 --> 02:02:45,039
play a sport which is different than

3459
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:48,319
it's certainly different than amateur

3460
02:02:45,039 --> 02:02:50,399
and you know the decisions that are hard

3461
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:52,880
is when you get to know somebody

3462
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:54,399
who's a player on the team

3463
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:56,239
and either they're at the end of their

3464
02:02:54,399 --> 02:02:58,799
career or you need to go in a different

3465
02:02:56,238 --> 02:03:01,279
direction and that person

3466
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:03,039
who's done everything that you've asked

3467
02:03:01,279 --> 02:03:04,800
you know whatever the coaches have asked

3468
02:03:03,039 --> 02:03:06,719
of that person and

3469
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:08,400
you get close to them and then

3470
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:10,880
when they when they have to be traded

3471
02:03:08,399 --> 02:03:15,519
released or whatever happens it's

3472
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:17,920
you know that's sad and being able to

3473
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:20,800
stand back and in some ways be

3474
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:21,920
dispassionate and not be a fan right

3475
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:24,719
there's a

3476
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,760
um i'm on the baseball hall of fame

3477
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:29,039
board

3478
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:30,639
and uh one of the the guys that's on the

3479
02:03:29,039 --> 02:03:32,399
board of me is jerry reinsdorf and i

3480
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:34,319
think it was jerry who said

3481
02:03:32,399 --> 02:03:35,679
you know if you act like a fan you'll be

3482
02:03:34,319 --> 02:03:37,679
sitting with them

3483
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:39,359
um which i thought was kind of funny

3484
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:40,480
well i got to push back on that a little

3485
02:03:39,359 --> 02:03:43,039
bit

3486
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:45,359
as a by way of a fan asking a dumb

3487
02:03:43,039 --> 02:03:45,359
question

3488
02:03:47,359 --> 02:03:51,920
okay let me just give some examples i

3489
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:54,319
it's very common in sport it's funny you

3490
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:56,639
said this example of like

3491
02:03:54,319 --> 02:04:00,719
certain great players going to another

3492
02:03:56,639 --> 02:04:00,719
team right at the end of their career

3493
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:04,800
and uh it always makes me sad it almost

3494
02:04:03,198 --> 02:04:06,799
makes me want to wish that you kind of

3495
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:08,239
retired right there

3496
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:10,719
um

3497
02:04:08,238 --> 02:04:12,158
from a perspective of just like

3498
02:04:10,719 --> 02:04:15,520
d do you ever

3499
02:04:12,158 --> 02:04:17,359
as a as an owner but just in that space

3500
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:20,400
think about like

3501
02:04:17,359 --> 02:04:21,519
the steelers in the full arc of human

3502
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:23,679
history

3503
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:24,400
so not like as a business

3504
02:04:23,679 --> 02:04:26,399
i mean

3505
02:04:24,399 --> 02:04:28,638
okay this is my good news sir i don't

3506
02:04:26,399 --> 02:04:30,879
have to think about it right

3507
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:33,118
you know i'm a minority owner so i can

3508
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:34,880
think about it almost uh as a fan but

3509
02:04:33,118 --> 02:04:36,960
i'm sorry go ahead yeah well that's what

3510
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:40,319
i mean i i suppose this is a dumb

3511
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:43,039
question to think of um

3512
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:46,880
like of a business in that way

3513
02:04:43,039 --> 02:04:49,920
not just investment but like

3514
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:52,078
like legacy of like what footprint would

3515
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:55,039
you leave on this world right on this

3516
02:04:52,078 --> 02:04:57,439
history that is one thing that i can say

3517
02:04:55,039 --> 02:04:59,198
unequivocally and i i only have the

3518
02:04:57,439 --> 02:05:01,919
experience that i have

3519
02:04:59,198 --> 02:05:03,118
but one of the things that i'm so proud

3520
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:05,760
of

3521
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:07,519
um about the way the steelers conduct

3522
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:09,199
themselves is

3523
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:11,520
and that's the rooney family that's the

3524
02:05:09,198 --> 02:05:13,039
legacy of the rooney family is asking

3525
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:15,280
constantly about what's right for the

3526
02:05:13,039 --> 02:05:17,198
league what's right for the players

3527
02:05:15,279 --> 02:05:19,118
you know what what

3528
02:05:17,198 --> 02:05:20,719
what's the right thing to do here and

3529
02:05:19,118 --> 02:05:22,078
that that's something i would hear mr

3530
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:24,880
rooney say

3531
02:05:22,078 --> 02:05:27,039
all the time so i think that legacy is

3532
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:29,520
important because ultimately

3533
02:05:27,039 --> 02:05:31,599
the team belongs to that city right

3534
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:33,199
belongs to those fans

3535
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:35,360
and you know the owners are the

3536
02:05:33,198 --> 02:05:37,519
custodians of that

3537
02:05:35,359 --> 02:05:40,719
so i think

3538
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:43,119
and when you realize what sports teams

3539
02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:45,359
mean to the fans the memories that

3540
02:05:43,118 --> 02:05:46,839
creates the bonds that it creates

3541
02:05:45,359 --> 02:05:50,238
it's a you know it's a

3542
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:52,880
responsibility um

3543
02:05:50,238 --> 02:05:54,479
and i i i think that you do have to

3544
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:56,639
think beyond the

3545
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:59,439
you know certainly not just dollars and

3546
02:05:56,639 --> 02:05:59,440
cents but just

3547
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:04,880
sports is a very big deal in our society

3548
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:07,920
and and it has to be

3549
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:09,840
i think held to a standard

3550
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:12,319
uh that's not just

3551
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,840
uh were we profitable this year or what

3552
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:14,719
that's there are other businesses for

3553
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:16,480
that

3554
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:18,639
it is certainly a business i don't mean

3555
02:06:16,479 --> 02:06:20,319
to romanticize to the the point that

3556
02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:22,319
it's not but

3557
02:06:20,319 --> 02:06:24,158
it to me it's it's more than that or at

3558
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:25,759
least my experience has been that it's

3559
02:06:24,158 --> 02:06:27,519
more than that it's a source of meaning

3560
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:29,199
for millions of people

3561
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:32,079
like and you see that

3562
02:06:29,198 --> 02:06:34,078
most like doing kovitz for example

3563
02:06:32,078 --> 02:06:35,920
when there's so much desperation so many

3564
02:06:34,078 --> 02:06:37,359
people losing a job so many people

3565
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:39,039
having to deal with the uncertainty what

3566
02:06:37,359 --> 02:06:41,359
the future holds that's right there's

3567
02:06:39,039 --> 02:06:44,719
something about those sports that just

3568
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:46,319
unites us that again the the the tragedy

3569
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:49,840
and the triumphs

3570
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:51,679
of sport of united of gathering together

3571
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:55,199
with your friends with family shared

3572
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:56,078
experience of over like this yeah over

3573
02:06:55,198 --> 02:06:58,399
just

3574
02:06:56,078 --> 02:06:59,840
team over rooting for your team for your

3575
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:02,000
city

3576
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,360
and the access you know again as i

3577
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,639
alluded to

3578
02:07:03,359 --> 02:07:06,078
we didn't have anything when i was

3579
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:07,840
growing up but i

3580
02:07:06,078 --> 02:07:10,238
would pour through the box scores i was

3581
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:13,520
a huge yankee fan and steeler fan

3582
02:07:10,238 --> 02:07:15,198
and feeling some ownership of that right

3583
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:16,960
that i could read the box score and

3584
02:07:15,198 --> 02:07:18,799
relive what they did and occasionally

3585
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:19,920
see them on tv

3586
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:22,400
and

3587
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:25,118
feel like i was part of that celebration

3588
02:07:22,399 --> 02:07:27,439
when they won and everything it's a very

3589
02:07:25,118 --> 02:07:29,439
powerful thing

3590
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:31,039
you've been exceptionally successful in

3591
02:07:29,439 --> 02:07:33,118
a bunch of avenues and a bunch of

3592
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:36,399
efforts what advice would you give to a

3593
02:07:33,118 --> 02:07:38,719
young person a day a high school student

3594
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:40,719
a college undergraduate that's thinking

3595
02:07:38,719 --> 02:07:42,399
about

3596
02:07:40,719 --> 02:07:45,039
career

3597
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:47,118
maybe advice not about just career but

3598
02:07:45,039 --> 02:07:49,118
about how to live a life they can be

3599
02:07:47,118 --> 02:07:50,559
proud of

3600
02:07:49,118 --> 02:07:52,719
you know we talked earlier about

3601
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:54,960
intellectual honesty and to me that's

3602
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:57,840
the first step of just saying

3603
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:59,840
to the best of your ability who am i

3604
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:02,880
and what i what what's important to me

3605
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:04,960
and what do i want to do and accomplish

3606
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:08,880
if you can start with that

3607
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:11,359
and develop some sort of rules-based

3608
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:14,000
philosophical here's what i'll

3609
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:15,118
what i'll do but i won't do

3610
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,238
and

3611
02:08:15,118 --> 02:08:18,158
that way

3612
02:08:16,238 --> 02:08:19,839
you can be flexible and pliable and

3613
02:08:18,158 --> 02:08:21,519
you're gonna need to be but if you if

3614
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:22,960
you still have

3615
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:25,040
a compass

3616
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:27,520
that tells you

3617
02:08:25,039 --> 02:08:29,198
hey at least i know this is the path i'm

3618
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:31,040
going to take i think that's very

3619
02:08:29,198 --> 02:08:32,879
important the rules you're referring to

3620
02:08:31,039 --> 02:08:34,399
the principles

3621
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,480
that's kind of like

3622
02:08:34,399 --> 02:08:38,000
underlying integrity so knowing what

3623
02:08:36,479 --> 02:08:39,839
lines you don't cross

3624
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,560
on this path that's exactly right

3625
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:44,319
because if you have those absolutes

3626
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:46,079
there are many decisions that come into

3627
02:08:44,319 --> 02:08:48,880
focus very quickly

3628
02:08:46,078 --> 02:08:51,439
right because hey i'm that's not for me

3629
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:52,400
or hey i i'm willing to do whatever it

3630
02:08:51,439 --> 02:08:54,638
takes

3631
02:08:52,399 --> 02:08:56,158
to to do x y and z and it has to do with

3632
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:57,760
the thing you were talking about

3633
02:08:56,158 --> 02:08:59,920
it's kind of interesting you mentioned

3634
02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:01,599
this earlier in the in the conversation

3635
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:03,279
about slippery slope and that's how

3636
02:09:01,599 --> 02:09:05,599
often it happens

3637
02:09:03,279 --> 02:09:07,679
like how the the the

3638
02:09:05,599 --> 02:09:09,199
slipping into unethical behavior happens

3639
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:11,599
it's a slippery slope of little

3640
02:09:09,198 --> 02:09:15,198
adjustments you put stuff off

3641
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:17,279
and that that i found that to be uh

3642
02:09:15,198 --> 02:09:19,678
i've been fortunate to

3643
02:09:17,279 --> 02:09:21,039
to not have to encounter these moments

3644
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:22,639
very much in my life but i still

3645
02:09:21,039 --> 02:09:24,560
encounter them

3646
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:26,400
that's what integrity i think

3647
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:27,520
looks like is in

3648
02:09:26,399 --> 02:09:29,198
as this

3649
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:30,800
the slippery slope is happening those

3650
02:09:29,198 --> 02:09:34,158
little things

3651
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:35,840
is um without drama without

3652
02:09:34,158 --> 02:09:37,679
making a show of it

3653
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:40,159
making a decision that stands behind

3654
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:43,199
your principles and just walking away

3655
02:09:40,158 --> 02:09:45,439
yeah and besides the big ideas i'm gonna

3656
02:09:43,198 --> 02:09:46,879
change the world i'm gonna

3657
02:09:45,439 --> 02:09:48,078
innovate i'm gonna do all those other

3658
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:51,199
things

3659
02:09:48,078 --> 02:09:53,359
i also start if i'm giving any advice

3660
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:55,759
which you know we can debate whether or

3661
02:09:53,359 --> 02:09:56,639
not you know i should be given advice

3662
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:58,639
but

3663
02:09:56,639 --> 02:10:00,960
just in terms of well let me start with

3664
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:02,719
this are you a good friend

3665
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:04,639
can you be counted on

3666
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:06,960
do you do what you say you're going to

3667
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:09,279
do yeah right

3668
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:11,679
are you accountable to what you sign up

3669
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:13,599
for and do you hold others accountable

3670
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:14,880
right what what does all that look like

3671
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:16,639
and then

3672
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:18,880
i think it's

3673
02:10:16,639 --> 02:10:20,719
being as intellectually curious and

3674
02:10:18,880 --> 02:10:24,078
well-read as you can be we live in a

3675
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:25,359
world that is designed to distract you

3676
02:10:24,078 --> 02:10:27,519
right and

3677
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:30,238
being able to sit with your thoughts or

3678
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:32,480
go on a walk and think deeply about

3679
02:10:30,238 --> 02:10:35,118
something and not just surface

3680
02:10:32,479 --> 02:10:37,198
area you text me i text you back and we

3681
02:10:35,118 --> 02:10:40,799
decide the fate of the world based on a

3682
02:10:37,198 --> 02:10:40,799
couple of text messages or something

3683
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:46,400
um you don't want to lose touch

3684
02:10:44,158 --> 02:10:48,238
i think with being well read

3685
02:10:46,399 --> 02:10:50,638
and understanding

3686
02:10:48,238 --> 02:10:51,519
and standing on great thinker shoulders

3687
02:10:50,639 --> 02:10:55,279
and

3688
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:57,679
learning from uh from from those works

3689
02:10:55,279 --> 02:11:00,238
and then i also think that

3690
02:10:57,679 --> 02:11:02,158
you know there's there's resiliency

3691
02:11:00,238 --> 02:11:04,399
and then there's grit

3692
02:11:02,158 --> 02:11:06,799
and i i heard someone say one time that

3693
02:11:04,399 --> 02:11:08,158
those those are slightly different

3694
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:10,800
and

3695
02:11:08,158 --> 02:11:13,198
you know i'm also i know that there are

3696
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:16,560
all kinds of challenges in life right

3697
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:18,078
that that are tragic that are unfair

3698
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:19,199
there's no question that's the world we

3699
02:11:18,078 --> 02:11:21,439
live in

3700
02:11:19,198 --> 02:11:23,678
but for me personally

3701
02:11:21,439 --> 02:11:25,279
to try as much as possible not to be in

3702
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:26,800
the victim

3703
02:11:25,279 --> 02:11:29,279
mindset

3704
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:30,639
because unfair things are going to

3705
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:31,519
happen

3706
02:11:30,639 --> 02:11:33,679
and

3707
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:35,280
you know we all want to live in an

3708
02:11:33,679 --> 02:11:37,599
idealistic

3709
02:11:35,279 --> 02:11:39,599
just world that that should be what we

3710
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:41,760
aspire to

3711
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:43,840
i'm i haven't seen that yet i haven't

3712
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:45,679
experienced that yet but yet you still

3713
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:48,239
have to function

3714
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:50,480
uh in that world so

3715
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:52,638
you know i i think that that resiliency

3716
02:11:50,479 --> 02:11:54,238
thing is very important

3717
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:56,480
and then

3718
02:11:54,238 --> 02:11:58,158
putting yourself out there

3719
02:11:56,479 --> 02:12:01,198
right because if you play scared and

3720
02:11:58,158 --> 02:12:03,759
you're always afraid to fail

3721
02:12:01,198 --> 02:12:05,759
you know this is probably a dumb way to

3722
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:07,679
get to the end of the podcast but

3723
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:08,560
there are times especially when i'm out

3724
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:11,199
west

3725
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:13,760
uh i love the big sky out in you know

3726
02:12:11,198 --> 02:12:15,919
montana idaho places like that yeah when

3727
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:17,360
you look up at night it's almost like

3728
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:19,520
i've never seen anything like this

3729
02:12:17,359 --> 02:12:22,319
before because there's no

3730
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:24,159
light pollution so to speak

3731
02:12:22,319 --> 02:12:26,000
and sometimes when i look up the most

3732
02:12:24,158 --> 02:12:28,479
daunting problems that i'm experiencing

3733
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,520
i'm like those those things have been

3734
02:12:28,479 --> 02:12:32,399
there

3735
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:34,960
for a billion years or whatever and i'll

3736
02:12:32,399 --> 02:12:38,000
be gone and it doesn't

3737
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:41,039
you know the most famous person on earth

3738
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,039
200 years ago

3739
02:12:41,279 --> 02:12:47,519
so it you know it's pretty fleeting

3740
02:12:44,639 --> 02:12:49,199
and uh so make sure you you have a good

3741
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:50,560
journey and especially coming out of

3742
02:12:49,198 --> 02:12:52,158
covid

3743
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:54,000
i think telling people that you care

3744
02:12:52,158 --> 02:12:56,238
about that you care about them and

3745
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,760
maintaining and cultivating your

3746
02:12:56,238 --> 02:13:00,238
friendships and relationships and

3747
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:03,520
they're not just transactional

3748
02:13:00,238 --> 02:13:05,279
right and and making sure that someday

3749
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:08,079
when you're laying there you can say

3750
02:13:05,279 --> 02:13:10,639
yeah i was good family member i was

3751
02:13:08,078 --> 02:13:12,399
a good uh a good friend i was someone

3752
02:13:10,639 --> 02:13:15,279
that could be counted on i think all

3753
02:13:12,399 --> 02:13:16,638
those things go into the mix of

3754
02:13:15,279 --> 02:13:18,880
you know however you want to take the

3755
02:13:16,639 --> 02:13:20,639
journey so when you look up to the stars

3756
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:22,960
do you think about

3757
02:13:20,639 --> 02:13:24,560
that quickly approaching end of yours do

3758
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:26,158
you think about your own mortality do

3759
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:27,760
you think about your death are you

3760
02:13:26,158 --> 02:13:30,638
afraid of your death

3761
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:32,960
i'm a huge fan of stoicism right i read

3762
02:13:30,639 --> 02:13:33,840
a lot a lot of stoicism

3763
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:35,760
um

3764
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:37,440
i think ryan holliday's done a great job

3765
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,800
of bringing some of that back into the

3766
02:13:37,439 --> 02:13:41,279
forefront

3767
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:41,279
it's just

3768
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:45,678
really thought provoking to me and and

3769
02:13:43,679 --> 02:13:47,599
rings a lot of it rings just hits me and

3770
02:13:45,679 --> 02:13:51,118
says i think that's right

3771
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:53,760
and that moment momento mori thing which

3772
02:13:51,118 --> 02:13:56,158
is hey we're all gonna die so

3773
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:58,639
you should contemplate it

3774
02:13:56,158 --> 02:14:01,198
there's a finality to this thing

3775
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:02,960
and so i think if you can

3776
02:14:01,198 --> 02:14:04,238
rightly frame that

3777
02:14:02,960 --> 02:14:05,760
between

3778
02:14:04,238 --> 02:14:07,198
fretting about it every day and being

3779
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:08,880
afraid

3780
02:14:07,198 --> 02:14:10,559
and being so laissez faire that you

3781
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:13,118
think you know you're gonna

3782
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:14,719
you're gonna live forever

3783
02:14:13,118 --> 02:14:15,759
it'll influence some of the decisions

3784
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:18,399
you make

3785
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:19,599
it will influence the way you attack

3786
02:14:18,399 --> 02:14:20,479
things

3787
02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:21,840
um

3788
02:14:20,479 --> 02:14:23,598
and hopefully

3789
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:25,279
the the way that you live your life so

3790
02:14:23,599 --> 02:14:28,319
yes

3791
02:14:25,279 --> 02:14:30,960
i i wouldn't say i obsess over it and i

3792
02:14:28,319 --> 02:14:33,679
wouldn't say it's omnipresent

3793
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:35,599
um but because i read a lot of stoicism

3794
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:37,679
and just i think it's it's right to

3795
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:40,000
pause and say

3796
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:42,158
who knows right there's going to be an

3797
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,238
expiration date

3798
02:14:42,158 --> 02:14:46,559
and if it happened tomorrow am i have i

3799
02:14:44,238 --> 02:14:50,000
done the things i wanted to do

3800
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:51,920
and am i the person i wanted to to be

3801
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:54,639
and i think it's important along the way

3802
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:56,399
to check those things yeah i try to make

3803
02:14:54,639 --> 02:14:58,719
sure

3804
02:14:56,399 --> 02:15:01,279
that i actually visualize this that i'm

3805
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:03,039
okay dying at the end of the day

3806
02:15:01,279 --> 02:15:04,960
at the end of each day

3807
02:15:03,039 --> 02:15:07,519
like if this is the last thing i do in

3808
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:09,039
my life is talking to you

3809
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:09,690
oh good lord

3810
02:15:09,039 --> 02:15:11,118

02:15:12,399 --> 02:15:17,279
you're i know you're joking but um

3814
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:19,359
you know that um

3815
02:15:17,279 --> 02:15:20,960
yeah i'm happy i get to live the life i

3816
02:15:19,359 --> 02:15:23,039
do and i think momentum more i think the

3817
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:25,118
the stoics have it right

3818
02:15:23,039 --> 02:15:26,319
so you and and you have it right in

3819
02:15:25,118 --> 02:15:28,799
saying

3820
02:15:26,319 --> 02:15:31,679
meditate on death enough to remember

3821
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:33,760
