1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,759
humans are fascinated by violence and

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,679
you've got to ask yourself why is it the

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,199

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,480
greatest of all time in each of their

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,878

00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,359
time

and the greatest submission grappler of

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
all time

25
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,959
gordon ryan

26
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,238
so let me ask the first question

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,640
you guys didn't see the question no

28
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,718
preparation here what is the key to your

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,000
success each of you one thing or

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,960
multiple things that come to mind

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,840
john go first

32
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,639
[Laughter]

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,280
um

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,219
is it the rash guard

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,920
yes

36
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:19,759
[Laughter]

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,079
i like that you choose john right off

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,680
the bat you seem the most nervous please

39
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,840
inspire us to

40
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,759
give the right

41
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:32,320
answer for for me it's about um

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,079
finding a way to work

43
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,118
in a world where

44
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:40,559
most of the answers are already known

45
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:43,519
okay in any developed sport by the time

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,680
you enter that sport most of the basic

47
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,519
precepts the the

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,439
the major techniques the major

49
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,599
mechanical understandings of the sport

50
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,118
are long since worked out

51
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,640
and so

52
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:56,640
in a highly developed world

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,759
the key to success

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,960
is to be able to identify

55
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,840
some area of the industry that you're in

56
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,878
which is currently

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,560
undervalued to do what the other people

58
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,919
are not doing

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,199
deeper than that

60
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,598
your

61
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,238
everyone has a view of okay these are

62
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,000
the the main skills of the industry i

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,000
work in

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,439
at any given time some set of skills

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,719
attributes

66
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,560
um

67
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,400
will always be somewhat undervalued

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,719
they're underappreciated by the people

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,800
in the game

70
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,199
you see that at any in any given

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,080
industry there are always trends

72
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,439
which

73
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,840
change

74
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,560
uh the nature of the industry over time

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,039
so

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
uh fashion trends

77
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,439
in the clothing industry you'll see at

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,360
any given time there's a a a general

79
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,359
wave of fashion which pushes most of the

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,080
people in the industry in a given

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,760
direction at a given time

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,200
what makes people stand out is the

83
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,280
ability to

84
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,439
look at the various possibilities out

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,439
there and say here is something which is

86
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,759
genuinely useful

87
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,439
but which is currently being underused

88
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,759
underutilized

89
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,239
and i want to bring that back in

90
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,959
and develop it

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,000
and because it's an inherently useful

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,598
product it will be very very successful

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,318
in its initial applications against

94
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:26,639
people who aren't currently using it

95
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,639
um

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,760
if you can do this in whatever industry

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,959
you're in i believe you'll be highly

98
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,039
successful

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,878
so this implies both for actual specific

100
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,439
like techniques

101
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:43,039
and the also tactics as well in the case

102
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:45,439
of of jiu-jitsu so for example

103
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,439
in my sport leglocks have always been

104
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,799
around okay there's

105
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,959
no shortage of people you can look back

106
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,959
in history who are applying leg locks

107
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,878
nonetheless as in

108
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,400
across the industry

109
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,158
leglocks were undervalued and

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,599
underappreciated there was a general

111
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,280
sense in which most of the leading

112
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,158
figures of the sport

113
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,759
uh

114
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,519
for most of the history of the sport of

115
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,399
judas who tended to de-emphasize

116
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,080
leglocks and uh

117
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,319
when i looked at them i said there was

118
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,040
there was immense potential but it

119
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,039
wasn't being realized and needed to be

120
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,399
changed um

121
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,400
since then that

122
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,918
has more or less occurred now most

123
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,918
people coming into the sport understand

124
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,680
that leglocks are an important

125
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,039
aspect and they're no longer undervalued

126
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
if anything it's gone too far the other

127
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,520
way and now perhaps they're a little

128
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,400
overvalued

129
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,758
um

130
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,198
and then

131
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,479
this kind of

132
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,520
fashion trend exists in every industry

133
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,599
and

134
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:41,359
the job of anyone who wants to excel in

135
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
a given industry is to be able to

136
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,639
identify okay what are the things that

137
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,279
are currently out of fashion and

138
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,280
undervalued and then

139
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,478
look at what is their actual objective

140
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,679
value

141
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:55,599
and then work uh to to

142
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,759
to bring them back to the forefront so

143
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,120
john brought up fashion uh george is

144
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,879
wearing a really sexy shirt so

145
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,000
assuming that's not the reason is there

146
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,000
um

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,439
is there something that comes to mind as

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,519
the key to the success of your

149
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,600
incredible career well of course

150
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,319
everybody knows the famous sensor that

151
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,120
every athletes are saying oh it could be

152
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,918
genetic i was maybe gifted i had certain

153
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,840
predisposition i worked really hard

154
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,439
but i think

155
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,159
something that

156
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,680
people don't talk enough is when

157
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,560
everybody sometimes go right

158
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,240
i was never afraid to try to go left

159
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,280
and i felt many times

160
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,038
trying to do things that were not

161
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,839
uh

162
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,399
uh

163
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,638
known to be things that would br

164
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,799
brought me success but i i i tried it

165
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,800
you know i was very often i was the

166
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,680
first of trying new things

167
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,840
and i felt many times but certain times

168
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,439
it gave me a certain advantage and

169
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,239
for example

170
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,639
i was sometime fighting guys that had

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,240
much better wrestling background than

172
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,120
than me on paper and nobody before that

173
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,800
fought those guys never nobody had there

174
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,879
to try to

175
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,600
take them down because their wrestling

176
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,600
pedigree were so good and i didn't have

177
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,800
on paper like wrestling pedigree to take

178
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,600
these guys down in a fight but

179
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,600
when everybody

180
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,319
tried to go right i was going left i i i

181
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,599
fought them in a different way and that

182
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,919
was

183
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,360
the blueprint to beat cert some of these

184
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,799
guys you know what i mean you know what

185
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
i mean so yeah so we'll actually talk

186
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,038
about a few fights where you did just

187
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,519
that this is fascinating um but let me

188
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,519
let's stay at the high level so gordon

189
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,038
again sticking on fashion

190
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,799
may compliment your

191
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,199
incredible badass hat trying to fit in

192
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,439
here

193
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,400
we should say we're in texas now so he's

194
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,399
uh

195
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,000
become a texan overnight uh so what is

196
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,079
there something you can speak to that

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,160
you would attribute to as the key to

198
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,598
your success yeah so first of all it has

199
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,680
to be a rule where you don't ask us all

200
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,719
the same questions because

201
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,639
how am i supposed to compete with the

202
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,759
answer john just came that was like

203
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,519
there's nothing i can do that's going to

204
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,639
top that yeah um but uh i think it's uh

205
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,959
there's many things but i think the

206
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,439
number one thing is just is john

207
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,799
when i came in i was a blue belt and i

208
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,399
was beating brown and black belts in

209
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,879
competition already

210
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,399
uh but he really changed my way of

211
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,159
thinking about the sport i would just

212
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,399
come in and if something wasn't working

213
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,919
i would just do it harder and faster and

214
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,038
more aggressively and that just

215
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:35,038
degenerated me into degenerated into

216
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,959
me spastically knee sliding into cross

217
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,159
hashigarami against eddie cummings for

218
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,598
six months and then just getting heal

219
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,840
hooked repeatedly

220
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,120
and uh i'm like this is not working and

221
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,198
eddie like when i met him was like a

222
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,879
chubby librarian looking guy and i'm

223
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,120
like there's i'm like six to like a

224
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,120
jacked like 170. and i'm like there's no

225
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,879
way i'm losing to a guy who looks like

226
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,000
this but he just kept healing me so i

227
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,479
would just go harder and harder and it

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,038
wouldn't work and then john's like well

229
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,878
if you learned leglocks you might you

230
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,639
might have some more success and then i

231
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,240
was like yeah that probably makes sense

232
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,840
and uh from then on i kind of just

233
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,360
changed the way i thought about the

234
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,799
sport instead of doing doing things

235
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,038
harder i would actually try to get

236
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,000
better at jiu jitsu do you remember like

237
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:16,959
a turning point where

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,399
you became as opposed to being mediocre

239
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:24,079
not just in technique but an approach to

240
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,758
uh to great um i think it was somewhere

241
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,439
around brown belt level when i was

242
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,360
training consistently i started training

243
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,120
full-time with john when i was purple

244
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,360
belt mid-level purple belt

245
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,599
and towards the end of my brown belt

246
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,038
days i was beating up like legitimate

247
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,599
like adccc champions in the gym

248
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,838
so i think like brown to black belt was

249
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,160
a big thing for me and then when i won

250
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,480
my first ebi and i was i submitted yuri

251
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,759
who won abcc and i beat roostam so i

252
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,959
think that was like my turning point as

253
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,679
a competitor

254
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,879
but i think i started to to reach world

255
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,159
level a little bit before that i think

256
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,919
somewhere around brown about mid-level

257
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,439
to late level brown belt so is some of

258
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,120
that mental like

259
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
it was there a moment when you like

260
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,240
after a training session

261
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,838
you realize

262
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,159
i could actually do this

263
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,399
like i could be at the top of the world

264
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:13,039
like world class the critical moment for

265
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,559
me was when uh i think it was right

266
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,719
right when i got my black belt maybe a

267
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,359
few months before i got my black belt uh

268
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,920
we had a former adcc champion come into

269
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,360
the gym and uh we did a hard round

270
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,919
together and i think i submitted them

271
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,440
like four or five times and uh no one

272
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,759
who i was i never won anything up until

273
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,200
that point and i was like okay like if

274
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,958
this is like one of the best guys in the

275
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,360
world and i could submit him multiple

276
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,719
times around i think that this is like

277
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,879
something that i actually could do

278
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,240
professionally and make a make a career

279
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,639
out of this

280
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,560
okay so the actual performance was the

281
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:46,720
like you didn't need to uh believe

282
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,199
before you could perform like a lot of

283
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,600
olympic gold medalists

284
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,160
they they have to believe before they

285
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,920
can perform because like they're they're

286
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,000
getting their ass kicked for a long long

287
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,360
long time yeah i think but the best way

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,600
for me to believe in something is to

289
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,120
have repeated success doing it against

290
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,560
high level guys like i'm not gonna just

291
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,278
believe i can do a double leg if i can't

292
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,359
hit a double egg on anybody um so for me

293
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,799
the the belief came from the repeated

294
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,000
success in the gym

295
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,519
yeah but to get to the point where

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
you're submitting somebody like yuri

297
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,440
samoa is like one of the greatest

298
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,360
grapplers ever

299
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,760
it's like a long journey

300
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,959
yeah but i i had the confidence i had

301
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,120
the belief in myself because of the

302
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,838
success that i had in the gym prior to

303
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,440
that got it to that event even and it's

304
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,040
one step at a time first it's the brown

305
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,360
bell it's not it's the black belt it's

306
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,439
world class okay um george was there a

307
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,240
turning point for you when you you

308
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,920
thought like i can actually do this

309
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,959
yes i um

310
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,639
i always dreamed to become champion

311
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,199
but i think the turning point that there

312
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,519
was there was two turning point

313
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,560
and and there were my two losses

314
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,600
uh

315
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,159
first

316
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,399
my losses to matt hughes i went into

317
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,360
that fight

318
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,720
just

319
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,360
to not lose i i was not fighting to win

320
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,480
and it's after the fight when i watched

321
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,320
the

322
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,959
the replay of the fight i realized i was

323
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,120
like i was doing pretty well but during

324
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:14,239
the fight in my own mind

325
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,600
i was not seeing it that way i i thought

326
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,360
i was getting dominated by use like a

327
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,879
hundred percent but when i watched the

328
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,919
replay

329
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,159
i was like man i can i can beat this guy

330
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,240
i was beating him until i made that

331
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,360
stupid mistake so

332
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,600
it was very frustrating but but

333
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:38,480
that's what gave me the mentally the the

334
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,040
championship level mentality and then i

335
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,360
became a little bit overconfident

336
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,159
because i start beating everybody after

337
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,519
that

338
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,240
and

339
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,679
i start to believe the hype of people

340
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,879
when they look at me they were like oh

341
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,879
he's the new upping coming superstar and

342
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,078
he's going to be unstoppable and

343
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:01,360
and then when i became champion i

344
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,479
i lost to to to matt to matt sarah

345
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,480
so

346
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
before i i believe

347
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,839
my first failure was because i had a

348
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,560
lack of confidence

349
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,120
and

350
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:16,078
and my second failure was i was because

351
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,240
i was overconfident so i think it's

352
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,078
there's a perfect uh

353
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,600
center of confidence i mean i mean it's

354
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:24,000
good to be confident

355
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
because john taught me like confidence

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,039
it's it's like money in your bank

357
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,360
account if you you can have all the

358
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,278
skills in in the world right and and if

359
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,680
you're uh if you don't have the

360
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,439
confidence it's like you it's like you

361
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,799
can you can be a millionaire but you

362
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,720
don't have access to your bank account

363
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,679
so so it's that's a little bit the

364
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,920
analogy that john told me so that's how

365
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,519
i feel confidence plays for an athlete

366
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,639
but to be overconfident i think it's

367
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,360
always good to

368
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,039
to be aware to be afraid

369
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,919
of what can happen

370
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,599
so to have a perfect balance of

371
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,559
confidence and fear

372
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,040
to me

373
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:02,159
that's what mentally gave me the edge to

374
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:04,159
become i believe successful in my sport

375
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,480
playing off that uh john gave me a

376
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,399
speech one time and he was like you have

377
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,120
to be able to

378
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,480
like flip a switch and turn it off where

379
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,639
like a guy like mayweather or someone

380
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,560
who goes out who's super confident

381
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,839
and he plays the character of someone

382
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,638
he's like no one can beat me i'm the

383
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
best that there ever was and that's it

384
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,680
but if you look at me actually trains

385
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,600
very hard you can't you can't play the

386
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,799
persona of no one can beat me and have

387
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,839
it translate into your life and just

388
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,278
think that you're so good that you don't

389
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,720
have to do anything and no one can ever

390
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,559
beat you you have to be able to play

391
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,720
that public persona of no one could beat

392
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,159
me but then you have to actually do the

393
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,759
training to make that happen you can't

394
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,439
just you can't believe your own hype and

395
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,559
say say that you know i can just do

396
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,320
whatever i want no one's ever going to

397
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,479
beat me you'd be able to switch between

398
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,240
the persona and the actual athlete and

399
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,199
that made a big difference for me

400
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,799
it's tough because uh like you're

401
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,439
you you dominate

402
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,799
such a large fraction of the world in in

403
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,800
grappling

404
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,039
and george too just the perfect

405
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,359
dominance after those two

406
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:03,519
um it's hard for the confidence not to

407
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,199
just

408
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,959
like how do you avoid the confidence not

409
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,198
becoming a thing that weighs you down

410
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,278
where you completely um

411
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,759
deludes your mind

412
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,639
um for me it's just well number one the

413
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,439
guys in the gym are so tough so the guys

414
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,639
and the

415
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,680
guys in the gym that i train with are

416
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,839
always like nipping at my butt and

417
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,759
always giving me new problems to solve

418
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,920
um and for me it's really just about

419
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,519
trying to learn new stuff over time um

420
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,879
so that keeps it interesting for me and

421
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,198
it's not really about

422
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,480
um you know no one can beat me i don't

423
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,559
have to train i have to do it i can do

424
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,159
whatever i want uh it's more

425
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,599
what keeps me in the gym is more about

426
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:38,879
the fact that i'm learning new stuff all

427
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,399
the time i'm working on something new

428
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,078
and progressing to new levels at all

429
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
times it's not i don't just come in and

430
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,239
do the same thing over and over again

431
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,759
and uh that gets boring you just come in

432
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,120
and you don't learn anything new and you

433
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,958
just do the same stuff for years at a

434
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,320
time and okay okay this is boring but

435
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,638
when you have new stuff to work on and

436
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,879
new goals short-term and long-term goals

437
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,000
to reach then it makes it interesting

438
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,759
it's uh

439
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,240
for me it's a little bit like uh gordon

440
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,319
says is is the fair because sometime in

441
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,079
the gym i even before when i was

442
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,120
competing i was i was getting my butt

443
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:08,638
kicked

444
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,959
but i don't care what happened in the

445
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,159
gym i mean it it hit my ego of course

446
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,479
because i'm a proud person i'm a

447
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,039
competitor even in the gym but it's not

448
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,560
a malicious competition competition in

449
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,078
between each other when you fight you

450
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,439
have to be malicious you go there to

451
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,399
hurt the guy

452
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,040
but it

453
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,480
it hit it hit me in terms of my pride

454
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,319
when i get

455
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,519
beat in a gym of course

456
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,680
but

457
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,639
that fear

458
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,719
that

459
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,959
i don't want it to happen in public

460
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,199
especially not during a fight that what

461
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,078
keeps help me keeps the balance between

462
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,758
confidence and and and and fear you know

463
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:44,719
what i mean it's kind of weird it's a

464
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,959
mix

465
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,079
it's a mixture of both that

466
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,000
i believe

467
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,719
i to me it

468
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,399
helped me uh succeed to have the right

469
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,000
mindset to fight

470
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,679
and i talk so much [ __ ] that i'm like

471
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,720
man if i lose

472
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,638
this is gonna be rough so yeah you put a

473
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,560
lot of i mean that's that's the hard

474
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,480
thing to do when you talk [ __ ] when you

475
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,599
when you play the heel

476
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,039
is so much to perform the pressure is

477
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,278
i mean you have to be good under

478
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,198
pressure it's the conor mcgregor thing

479
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,879
you know the reason i actually started

480
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,198
talking [ __ ] was actually like

481
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,240
indirectly because of george

482
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,319
because

483
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,198
because i would become the opposite of

484
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,240
george

485
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:28,399
i won my first ebi and i i didn't talk

486
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,720
[ __ ] and everyone was like being like oh

487
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,198
you know he only beat yuri because uh

488
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,959
because he was tired or uh

489
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,399
you know this or that and if they have a

490
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,679
rematch under any of the rules that he

491
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,799
would have lost

492
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,958
and am i trying to figure out what i'm

493
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,639
going to do so i'm scrolling through

494
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,879
george's feed one day and he posted a

495
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,560
clip of him beating someone and i look

496
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,240
at the comments and i'm with this in

497
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,000
mind now my george is the nicest person

498
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,000
of all time and if you look at the

499
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,480
comments it's like ten thousand comments

500
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,559
and like nine thousand and nine hundred

501
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,199
are just people calling him like all you

502
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,039
do is lay and pray you [ __ ] you suck

503
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:02,719
you can't finish anybody and i'm just

504
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,639
i'm looking at this and i'm like people

505
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,318
are to say what they're going to say

506
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,679
regardless they're going to talk [ __ ]

507
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,879
regardless so you may as well just say

508
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,880
whatever you want and then just be

509
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,880
yourself

510
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,520
is there some aspect that's mentioning

511
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,280
conor mcgregor he uh he crossed the line

512
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,359
with khabib

513
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,838
at least in the eyes of khabib is there

514
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,599
something you ever regret about crossing

515
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,359
a line or does that you ever feel like

516
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,879
there is a line or do you just keep

517
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,479
pushing the line

518
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,480
uh i i basically play it per per person

519
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,880
i just i basically fire back with like

520
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,319
one step above what what they do it's

521
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,240
always plus one yeah yeah okay

522
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:42,399
um so i go i usually go hard like they

523
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,558
fire a bullet then i drop a duke

524
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,480
and then and then after that initial

525
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,079
shot then we go back and forth and i'll

526
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,839
just keep one upping them

527
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,960
so you know there's a lot of people that

528
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,399
love you

529
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,919
but there's also a lot of people that

530
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,038
love to hate you yeah it's so

531
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,120
like what

532
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,558
do those people like energize you or do

533
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,119
you just

534
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,639
uh or is it funny to you like what as an

535
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,879
athlete as a performer you should not

536
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080
think about them it's like a fun thing

537
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,600
it's like it's just like a fun thing

538
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,199
that keeps me occupied

539
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,279
like because like because most of them

540
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,120
that like talk [ __ ] they like just say

541
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,200
stuff that's factually incorrect so then

542
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,439
i just argue with like actual statistics

543
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,519
yeah it's just like

544
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,720
you suck or you're not gonna beat this

545
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,038
person i'm like i've already submitted

546
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,679
that guy um so it just it riles them up

547
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,960
and

548
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,440
it's just it's just a fun thing for me

549
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,200
to do my down time yeah your responses

550
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
are usually very factual it's very

551
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,679
scientific

552
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,839
i appreciate

553
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,919
like you actually you start by talking

554
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,918
trash but then you respond with science

555
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,640
yeah it's great okay it's good mix

556
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,240
that's a good mix um

557
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,759
i mean on topic of haters are more

558
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,400
specifically sort of

559
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,359

00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:01,119
i was going to ask you another question

565
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,440
but let me just ask you on this on this

566
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,558
topic um are there times in your life

567
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,240
yet uh

568
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,839
you were surrounded by people that that

569
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,919
doubted you

570
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,918
all the time and so what is there

571
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,240
something you could say as in by way of

572
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,080
advice how you overcome

573
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,759
the doubt either yourself or others

574
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:22,558
around you i all the time

575
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:25,119
the first time i i manifest my desire to

576
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,599
become a professional mixed martial art

577
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,678
athlete everybody doubt me

578
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,519
just not even i'm not talking about ufc

579
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,960
just to become a professional fighter

580
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,319
everybody doubt me

581
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,079
and i became a

582
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,639
i became a professional fighter i had

583
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,038
few amateur fight i won them all

584
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,280
then i i fought my first fight in in

585
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,480
montreal i won and i became a

586
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,200
professional

587
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,759
then i i told people that i wanted to

588
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,640
fight in ufc everybody doubt me again

589
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:52,798
so

590
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,400
it's a normal thing

591
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,359
so i worked my way up i beat a few guys

592
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,160
then i

593
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:02,399
at the time uh pete spratt was uh

594
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,960
just knocked knocked out robbie lawler

595
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,640
with leg kick and uh

596
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,519
the person who was my agent at the time

597
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,360
did a great move uh for me so he brought

598
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,599
peace pratt and montreal to fight me

599
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,639
pete spratt came to montreal and i

600
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,319
believe

601
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,240
he didn't know who i was so he thought

602
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,879
that he was coming to collect an easy

603
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,839
paycheck and i and i end up beating him

604
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,720
so that

605
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,319
gave me the opportunity to fight in ufc

606
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,919
then after i was in ufc i wanted to

607
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,839
become champion of the world you know

608
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,480
but matt hughes was there and he seems

609
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:35,199
invincible at the time so

610
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,038
everybody doubt me again and i became

611
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,600
world champion and after when you when i

612
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:42,480
was world champion i wanted to be

613
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,719
i was competing against other world

614
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,679
champion of other weight class

615
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,679
for

616
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,440
the title you know for the legacy and

617
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,519
everything so i was not no longer

618
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,159
competing against my opponent i was you

619
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:56,158
know as a competitor you always you

620
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,159
never wanted to be you never want to be

621
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,720
satisfied because when satisfaction is

622
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,200
the death you know when you're satisfied

623
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,200
you better retire because it's over so

624
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,080
always i have to find motivation what

625
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,600
you can have more i want more don't be

626
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:13,759
satisfied in life so i wanted to be

627
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,079
like the best you know i was i was

628
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,400
competing you know like to become the

629
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:20,720
best and and you know of course people

630
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,440
doubt doubt you all the time every time

631
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,558
you say something that it's outside of

632
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,480
the norm of the normality and when i say

633
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,678
there there's nothing normal but i'm

634
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,640
talking about

635
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,798
when you

636
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,159
you manifest your desire to do something

637
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:38,000
that

638
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,320
takes special attribute to to to succeed

639
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,159
or that is something that is hard to to

640
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:43,678
do it's for sure you're gonna always

641
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,600
have people that doubt you it's so

642
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,280
strange that people don't

643
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,359
they don't lean into supporting like

644
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,678
people that love you too yeah even

645
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:55,759
people that love me used to doubt me and

646
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:58,320
i believe i i you need to use that as

647
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:01,279
a positive positive thing as a

648
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:03,678
motivation to prove them wrong yeah so

649
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:06,639
for me that was a thing when someone

650
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,200
doubted me nothing gave me more

651
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,559
this more energy because i want to prove

652
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,720
him wrong i want to look at him in the

653
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,279
face and say hey you see

654
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,679
i got you man i i did it

655
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,440
so uh john do you ever use this in one

656
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,679
way or the other by saying i don't think

657
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,360
you can do this to motivate them to to

658
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,840
prove you wrong or

659
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,240
more general question

660
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,839
of you know uh the the mental toughness

661
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,440
required to achieve

662
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,199
or confidence required to achieve

663
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,360
greatness like what's your role as a

664
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,519
coach when you have these two athletes

665
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,599
with regards to your your first question

666
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,279
would i ever say to someone

667
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:46,000
you can't do this

668
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,000
as a kind of reverse psychology i know

669
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,200
my job is to prepare people first and

670
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:55,038
foremost with their skills and

671
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,759
as gordon pointed out earlier if you're

672
00:22:55,038 --> 00:23:00,000
in any way a rational human being and

673
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,839
you're noticing that you're getting

674
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,919
tremendous success

675
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,000
with a given move in the gym against

676
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,159
high level opponents who

677
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,038
give a good read on what your actual

678
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,240
opponent in a competition is is like

679
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,798
you would have to be a [ __ ] to

680
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,079
not recognize that kind of success and

681
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,558
say this is something i should be

682
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,240
building into my game and you will carry

683
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:24,879
the confidence that you earned in the

684
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,640
gym into the arena

685
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,400
so i never try to use

686
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,919
reverse psychology i build up

687
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,880
everything i do in terms of confidence

688
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,640
is to give people physical skills i know

689
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,559
people say oh this physicality on the

690
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,080
one hand is mentality on the other and

691
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,158
confidence is

692
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,960
squarely in the the mental aspect of the

693
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,240
game

694
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,360
but all the underpinnings and beginnings

695
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,079
of confidence are physical

696
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:54,000
okay a rational human being will see

697
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:56,399
where they're having success and where

698
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,278
they're having failure and confidence

699
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,038
will

700
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,759
uh surround those areas where they're

701
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,519
having success and will degenerate in

702
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,480
cases where they're having

703
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,879
failure

704
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,960
so my job as a coach is to set them up

705
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,880
for success in the gym

706
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,679
with a given set of skills

707
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,840
and

708
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,759
i don't have to do anything

709
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,278
psychologically after that

710
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,038
i just

711
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,519
if i can set you up to be highly

712
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,599
successful with a given move or a set of

713
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,519
tactics 10 times in a row against

714
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,199
quality opposition in the gym

715
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,440
i don't have to do a damn thing when it

716
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,440
comes to instilling confidence

717
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,558
i i will tell people hey you're doing a

718
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,320
really good job with that move it's

719
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,759
working well for you

720
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:37,918
but

721
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,919
when they're not in agreement i'm not

722
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,520
trying to force anything on them they're

723
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,880
recognized they were they already

724
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,319
recognized that long before the words

725
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,000
came out of my mouth

726
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:48,158
but on the other hand intelligent

727
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,480
rational people will recognize when

728
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,480
they're failing with given moves and no

729
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,319
amount of talk on my part can ever

730
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,720
change that

731
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:59,678
if i teach gordon

732
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,000
uh a given arm lock and

733
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,798
15 times in a row he tries it over a

734
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,240
month and all 15 are failures there's

735
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:07,599
nothing i can say verbally to come up

736
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,798
the goal and say hey you're really good

737
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,119
at that move he's going to look at me

738
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,960
and say [ __ ] i'm terrible at it. and

739
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,319
that will create a crisis of confidence

740
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,159
where gordon no longer believes the

741
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:18,000
words coming out of my mouth

742
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,559
so i will never compromise that but

743
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,519
isn't there a lot you just said 15

744
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,960
you have to believe

745
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,278
that uh

746
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,880
doing this arm lock 15 times over a

747
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:31,200
period of a month is worth it because

748
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,960
eventually you might get it like yeah

749
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,600
that's a separate issue that that's a

750
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,600
separate issue

751
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,720
there are times where i've

752
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:45,359
more or less pushed athletes to

753
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,120
go in a certain direction for example um

754
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,759
when i first met gary tonan he never had

755
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,038
a guillotine strangle and i i would say

756
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,879
don't gary you know

757
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,400
you're a scrambler like one of the

758
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,559
greatest weapons a scrambler can ever

759
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,320
develop as a guillotine like it should

760
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,639
be in your arsenal

761
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,079
and he was like no i just scrambled for

762
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,400
the back and i said well there's gonna

763
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,319
be a day you can't take someone's back

764
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,720
and it's always good about a strangle

765
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,319
from front and back okay of course we

766
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,640
all prefer strangles from the bank that

767
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,000
makes sense but there's going to come a

768
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,000
day where it's going to be useful for

769
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,359
you and so that was one of the few times

770
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,278
where i put my foot down and said you're

771
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,678
learning this shut the [ __ ] up

772
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,759
and um uh he like literally wouldn't

773
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,038
teach him any anything else until he got

774
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:26,158
a guilty and you know gary would like

775
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:28,720
ask him a question he's like let's see

776
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,720
your guillotine

777
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:34,079
and um for the first three months

778
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,959
as gifted as as gary tony is in learning

779
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,480
most moves most moves gary gets it like

780
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,079
in in minutes

781
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,720
there was something going on with gary

782
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:45,599
just couldn't get a guillotine on people

783
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,839
and uh finally after around three months

784
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,119
he started having some success until

785
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,158
ultimately became one of his best

786
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,558
weapons

787
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,960
um we had to go through like 15

788
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,639
different variations of guillotine until

789
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,240
he found one which actually worked

790
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
reliably for him

791
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,159
and that was one of the few times where

792
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,079
i put my foot down and said no

793
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,600
you you have to learn this so the long

794
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,960
search had to do more with the physical

795
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,038
characteristics like you couldn't figure

796
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,480
out the right like it made sense it made

797
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,960
sense in the case of gary tony because

798
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,519
there were more opportunities per minute

799
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,600
of his grappling for guillotines uh that

800
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,359
the investment in time was worth it for

801
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,879
another athlete i might have said well

802
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,158
he hardly ever gets in the situation but

803
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,200
front headlocks are guilty so it's not

804
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,200
even worth

805
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,880
investing the training time

806
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,720
let me ask you a question on the on the

807
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,520
competition side you mentioned haters

808
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,200
and

809
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,918
do you think about this aspect of the

810
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,720
competition with the athletes is this a

811
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,080
great question and um the answer is no

812
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,038
um

813
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,158
uh

814
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,640
i'm

815
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,440
you can see that you could you couldn't

816
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,038
find two more polar opposites

817
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,558
psychologically than

818
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,038
george st pierre

819
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,398
and this monstrosity on my left

820
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,599
and um

821
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,119
i've i've never said to my athletes hey

822
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:58,639
i think this is the

823
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,319
sort of demeanor you should carry

824
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,559
yourself with i'm myself a very flawed

825
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,720
character and i'm the last person on

826
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,599
earth who should be delving out moral

827
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,839
advice to other people um the only thing

828
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,759
is that i i you know of course i believe

829
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,439
some things are off limits but as long

830
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,038
as it's done in the context of sport

831
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,960
where no one's physically attacking

832
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,919
people or doing anything crazy where it

833
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:24,798
just goes completely over the top then i

834
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,240
give almost zero

835
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,720
moral advice to my athletes i'm a

836
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,839
jiu-jitsu coach not a preacher

837
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,480
alex i i if i can if i may

838
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,839
we we are entertainers

839
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,720
you know we're athlete we're

840
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,678
professional athletes but we make

841
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,880
we make

842
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,720
a living because of people or

843
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,320
want to see us perform

844
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,278
same thing an actor or something a

845
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,439
singer

846
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,480
and a lot of the time

847
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:56,480
especially in the fight game

848
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,200
an event is promoted it needs to be

849
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,399
with emotion

850
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,679
love me hate me but do not ignore me

851
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:04,479
um

852
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,919
and

853
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,798
you know it

854
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,799
when it's authentic

855
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,120
it's done well i think me my personal my

856
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,960
my favorite fighters to watch are the

857
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,798
one that are that

858
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,519
that that have a

859
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:21,278
some sort of a bad persona

860
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:22,720
i really enjoy watching those guys

861
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,038
because

862
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,240
they bring an emotion element into a

863
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,839
fight which is great you know i i i feel

864
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,000
to me it's more interesting to watch

865
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:34,558
when there is an emotion involved

866
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,558
and i believe that's why

867
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,639
some fighters make more money than

868
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,480
others you know you know what i mean

869
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,320
that's the reason why we may we can make

870
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,360
a living out of this yeah they're better

871
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,960
entertainers but you're right the

872
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,839
authenticity seems to be really

873
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,880
important

874
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,199
there's actually something very

875
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,480
interesting then um it's time to break

876
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,480
out some some secrets

877
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,159
do you know who like like you think of

878
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,960
george st peter you think of like the

879
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,399
highly technical polished

880
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,840
martial artist that's just gonna be

881
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,119
great do you know

882
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:06,319
who his favorite fighters to watch

883
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,000
were

884
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:09,678
you'd probably be thinking oh probably

885
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,798
someone who's really technically

886
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,159
advanced

887
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,558
actually

888
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,960
it was mark coleman i don't know kevin

889
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,639
randleman and phil baroni

890
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,798
he used to love watching that was a

891
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,278
hammer house that was his favorite he

892
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,119
would love those guys and uh whenever

893
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,240
their fights were on georgie watching

894
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:30,798
the hammerhouse crew and uh

895
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,839
it's funny what you said about how those

896
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:36,000
guys brought an intensity to

897
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,000
to mma that was off the charts have you

898
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,880
ever met those guys in

899
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,679
uh in their prime let me tell you it was

900
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,520
it was something to behold and um i had

901
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,880
this crazy larger than life personality

902
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,798
most of the things they did made no

903
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,960
sense whatsoever but i mean technically

904
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,879
but that was their appeal yeah and and

905
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,558
these guys and george would love to

906
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,480
watch them more than anyone else you

907
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:00,480
never knew what could happen with these

908
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,240
guys i remember when mark coleman won

909
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,399
the pride grand prix it wasn't my living

910
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,919
room i was jumping i was so happy i was

911
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,239
like yeah

912
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,440
he beat igor varchar chef chin i was

913
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,200
like

914
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,399
like for to me it was amazing you know

915
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,080
what i mean

916
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,319
because of the emotion that they they

917
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,639
brought into the fight george is

918
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:21,278
actually very um interested by something

919
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,240
you said that normally when i

920
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,079
um

921
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,519
ask what is the appeal of a given

922
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:29,199
fighter um and what makes people watch a

923
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,960
fight you talked about the idea that

924
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,798
fighters are entertainers and that's

925
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,679
absolutely correct they are

926
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,519
um

927
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,559
it's this weird weird industry where

928
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,679
you're

929
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,240
you're

930
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,919
both an athlete and an entertainer and

931
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,599
you need to be successful in both

932
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,360
regards to become

933
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,798
financially successful

934
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:47,519
insofar as

935
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:49,519
uh

936
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,759
your favorite athletes

937
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,759
to watch at least were people who are

938
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,879
almost like the polar opposite of who

939
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,079
you are

940
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,360
um i've always said that most people

941
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,079
if you look at

942
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:03,678
uh say a million people watch a

943
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,480
pay-per-view event

944
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:10,159
what percentage of those million people

945
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,919
have a genuine technical understanding

946
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,278
of what's happening as they watch a

947
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,679
fight

948
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:19,839
it's tiny

949
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,080
it's absolutely tiny the vast majority

950
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:25,439
of people who watch a professional fight

951
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,599
have almost no technical understanding

952
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,679
of what's going on in front of them so

953
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:32,000
how do they relate to the fight

954
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,559
what's the only way they can

955
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,319
it's through emotion

956
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,398
and so when they get a sense that these

957
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,558
two don't like each other

958
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,879
then they can relate to the fight

959
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,720
but only a tiny percentage of people

960
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,120
watching a given professional fight can

961
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,600
relate to it on a technical level

962
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,199
the overwhelming majority will always

963
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,199
form an emotional attachment to the

964
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,519
fight that's why when you see things

965
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,798
shows like ufc primetime they never

966
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,399
focus on

967
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:00,639
the tactics and the techniques of the

968
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,119
fight they focus on the emotional

969
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,960
elements the preparation the view of

970
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,599
their own family members as athletes get

971
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,519
ready it's always an emotional pull

972
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:12,079
because that's how 99 percent of the

973
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,159
viewers relate to the fight if i even

974
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,720
think about chairs okay

975
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,240
if i have minimal knowledge of two world

976
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,240
champions

977
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,159
coming to to fight each other and

978
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,480
or match up against each other in a game

979
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,278
of chess i know so little about

980
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,960
chess tactics and i can't really form

981
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,480
any kind of technical

982
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,759
appreciation of what's going on on the

983
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,679
board

984
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,960
but if you tell me that these two chess

985
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,640
players hate each other's guts and

986
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,640
they've got a rivalry which goes back

987
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,399
five years and they've said this and

988
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,080
that about each other in public then

989
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:45,359
suddenly my ears prick up and i'm like

990
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:47,599
oh okay this sounds interesting um

991
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,519
because i just don't have the the

992
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,359
knowledge to appreciate what's going on

993
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,720
on the board in a chess game to be able

994
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:57,839
to to appreciate the uh the technical

995
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,679
nuances of what they're doing so any

996
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:00,879
interest that i have in the chess match

997
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,480
is going to have to come from some kind

998
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,039
of emotional level because i'm just not

999
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,200
qualified to make technical assessments

1000
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,838
and that's exactly how it is in the case

1001
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,519
of both grappling and mixed martial arts

1002
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:13,279
that's why the ones who evoke the most

1003
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,759
attention are always the ones who can

1004
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,159
form some kind of emotional appeal conor

1005
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,399
mcgregor was the all-time master of this

1006
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,000
i i believe also

1007
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,759
uh emotion can be used as a weapon

1008
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,320
for example i've learned i've learned

1009
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,440
this from my favorite boxer is sugary

1010
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,599
leonard

1011
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,838
sugary leonard i remember i was very

1012
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,000
young so i watched his fight later when

1013
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,279
i was older but i know that sugary

1014
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
leonard

1015
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,200
was the best boxer of his era to me

1016
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,280
personally

1017
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,678
and i don't think nobody could

1018
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,839
beat him i think it was skill skill wise

1019
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,200
it was the best

1020
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:51,519
however when he fought in montreal

1021
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,559
roberto duran

1022
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,559
roberto zuran

1023
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,639
made it in a way that leonard became

1024
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,440
very emotional he wanted to stand in

1025
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,639
front of duran and fight a different

1026
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,559
fight that

1027
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,879
that he normally does because he wanted

1028
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:11,119
to show that he's a man

1029
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,400
and he lost that fight which was a

1030
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,079
mistake

1031
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,240
so by by

1032
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,960
then later on he beat roberto's around

1033
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,439
in

1034
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,920
quite easy you know the if the fair

1035
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,000
everybody remember the nomas thing but

1036
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,920
my point is

1037
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,280
emotion can be used

1038
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,079
in a way

1039
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,040
that it can make your derail your

1040
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,680
opponent

1041
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,159
out of his game plan and i felt a lot of

1042
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,759
my opponent trying to do that with me so

1043
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:41,279
that's why i never got involved that was

1044
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,760
my way to defend myself against

1045
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,519
some kind of bullying to put like a like

1046
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,040
a shield in front but some other guy

1047
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,599
like uh

1048
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:52,320
gordon he expressed himself differently

1049
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,559
of course there's a language barrier but

1050
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,559
for him he's better at

1051
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,400
giving giving giving back that's his

1052
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,799
he's a better counter attacker you know

1053
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,720
that's the way you respond to to to the

1054
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,359
aggression of of a

1055
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:07,039
of an emotional attack i think everybody

1056
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:08,719
is different in that regard what's

1057
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,039
interesting that john said that he

1058
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:11,039
doesn't

1059
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,920
uh study the tactics of this game or

1060
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,759
maybe you're not interested in the

1061
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,358
tactics of this game because it seems

1062
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,960
like this is more than just being an

1063
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,039
entertainer it seems like it could be an

1064
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,119
effective part of the match yeah i just

1065
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,400
feel like whatever investment you make

1066
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,160
in that

1067
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,838
is

1068
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,199
it's going to get negligible rewards

1069
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:32,960
first of all it's probably only going to

1070
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,279
pertain to one match in front of you

1071
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,240
rather than the totality of your career

1072
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,079
and

1073
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:41,838
whatever gains you get out of

1074
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,320
psychological trickery and play

1075
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:44,320
typically

1076
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,200
don't last long you raised an excellent

1077
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,000
example with sugar ray leonard he did

1078
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,399
fight outside of his usual

1079
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,599
manner in that regard but rather than me

1080
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,800
try to tell

1081
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,119
someone hey

1082
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,039
uh behave like this before a fight i

1083
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,559
would have been probably more forceful

1084
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:04,079
between rounds with an athlete and

1085
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,119
saying no no you're fighting this right

1086
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,760
the wrong way and that would have a much

1087
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,559
more beneficial impact on my athlete

1088
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,960
than

1089
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:16,000
psychological trickery before a fight

1090
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,119
i believe another example of

1091
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,800
emotion that leads to failure is

1092
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,838
jose aldo against conor mcgregor i think

1093
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,560
it was

1094
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:29,358
it was uh on purpose that conor mcgregor

1095
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:31,358
did this try to bait aldo to become over

1096
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:34,400
aggressive to open him himself because

1097
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:37,598
he's an excellent counterpuncher puncher

1098
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,599
that's what i believe and made a mistake

1099
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,119
there's another great one my match

1100
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,760
against cyborg

1101
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,760
2018 nogi worlds where he didn't even

1102
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,880
try to win he just like wanted to smack

1103
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,720
me in the face the whole time because he

1104
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,960
was so angry that was talking [ __ ] to

1105
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,639
him before the match and uh it was like

1106
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,679
the finals of the absolute it was like

1107
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:55,679
the biggest

1108
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,039
match of the weekend and he just didn't

1109
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,480
even try to pass my guard to do anything

1110
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,039
he just wanted to hit me in the face and

1111
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,880
i was like sick i just won

1112
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,199
it was incredibly frustrating it's

1113
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,480
fascinating to watch like a grown man

1114
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:11,039
sort of lose composure

1115
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,679
um gordon one thing i've always

1116
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,440
been very impressed with you and that's

1117
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:18,639
um

1118
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,400
no matter how heated torque gets

1119
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:22,559
before a match with you

1120
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,480
when you go out to grapple you're

1121
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,838
absolutely cold

1122
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,079
like i've you've never gone into a match

1123
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:32,400
carrying anything other than just

1124
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,400
cold-blooded calculation

1125
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,000
and you've always been able to separate

1126
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,800
very well

1127
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,358
the idea of words and deeds and i think

1128
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,599
that's always been one of your um one of

1129
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:46,480
your strongest assets a way i often

1130
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,359
measure this is when a match is over i

1131
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,880
will ask the athlete questions about the

1132
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,039
match

1133
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,880
and if they can't answer the question

1134
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,719
what were you doing in the fourth minute

1135
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,119
okay what was that setup you used in the

1136
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,199
in in the third minute that got you into

1137
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,800
the kimura along if they can't answer

1138
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:04,639
that that tells me

1139
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,440
they were just fighting on instincts and

1140
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:09,440
emotion but with gordon it's like a log

1141
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,880
book you see

1142
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,320
it's like okay in the seventh minute you

1143
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,400
went for that uh

1144
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,079
judy gutami set up from

1145
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,280
on the left side

1146
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,839
what were you thinking he can always

1147
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,240
give an answer he's absolutely stone

1148
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:22,239
cold

1149
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,400
speaking of emotion

1150
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:31,599
gordon you will potentially if you're

1151
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,760
healthy face andre galvao in the adcc

1152
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,920
coming up super fight

1153
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,920
uh who is andre galvao for people who

1154
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,760
don't know can you tell the story of

1155
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,320
your beef with

1156
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,079
uh the the emotional interaction with

1157
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,000
the man yeah so uh andre is uh

1158
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,400
he's considered the greatest

1159
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,559
adcc competitor of all time uh multiple

1160
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,358
time blackbaud world champion uh

1161
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:57,838
winningest abccc champion every has six

1162
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:00,559
six gold medals and uh

1163
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,159
i've been trying to compete against him

1164
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,239
pretty much forever like since i got my

1165
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,719
black belt in 2016 i've been trying to

1166
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,318
get matches with him uh he was in the

1167
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:09,679
first ebi that i did and he ended up

1168
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,199
pulling out and that i've been trying to

1169
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:14,318
get matches with him

1170
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:17,679
and uh he would always say no and give

1171
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:19,519
one reason or another and then uh

1172
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,279
after the last adcc

1173
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:24,400
i was like hey andre said he was

1174
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,119
retiring after this after this uh this

1175
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,800
competition so if he wants to retire you

1176
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,400
know he's he's the greatest adcc

1177
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,839
competitor of all time and

1178
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,039
i think it's great but if he wants to

1179
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,000
compete and that's great i was like

1180
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:37,440
super nice and then he started like

1181
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,800
posting like passive aggressive

1182
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,599
instagram

1183
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,160
uh

1184
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,680
uh captions and uh then we started going

1185
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,598
back and forth on the internet and there

1186
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,919
was like one point where i saw him in

1187
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,359
person when he

1188
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,559
acknowledged he's like i understand like

1189
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:51,920
what you're doing like we're gonna pump

1190
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,358
this fight up and he was like totally on

1191
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,280
board but then there must have been

1192
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,880
something that happened where like it

1193
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,040
changed from like him like going along

1194
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,640
with it to be like actually pissed

1195
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,920
and then uh there was that one night at

1196
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:03,598
flow where i went to go shake his hand

1197
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,440
and he he flipped me off and then he

1198
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,559
followed me backstage and started to try

1199
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,720
to fight me and then i smacked him and

1200
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,480
then he didn't want to fight anymore and

1201
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,799
then we've been going back he's actually

1202
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,318
blocked me on instagram now so he will

1203
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,760
he just won't engage no one from athos

1204
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:19,358
will engage now but

1205
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,119
it's gonna be interesting how he shows

1206
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,199
up if he can keep it under control or

1207
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,318
not do you think how do you explain that

1208
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:28,078
level of emotion is this fear of losing

1209
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:29,759
your throne is it

1210
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,359
or is it just a human being like with

1211
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,000
cyborg just

1212
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:35,759
just becoming emotionally unstable it

1213
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,358
might just be me i just have a way to

1214
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,839
get and get under people's skin it's

1215
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:41,358
just i don't know uh he's he's

1216
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,759
he was he was cool for a while and then

1217
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:45,279
i just i don't know it just

1218
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,880
everyone gets like this they're all so

1219
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,560
emotional by the time they actually step

1220
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,160
up to compete that it's pretty easy to

1221
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:51,679
read them they're either so emotional

1222
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,000
that they want to actually come forward

1223
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,719
and and beat me like like tim spriggs is

1224
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
a perfect example at abcc i posted like

1225
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:59,759
uh

1226
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,760
on my story on instagram like 10 minutes

1227
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,280
before a match uh i said like what i'm

1228
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,599
going to do to tim spriggs is going to

1229
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,920
be criminal and he's like a very staley

1230
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,280
guy and he came he saw that and then he

1231
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,639
came out and actually tried to fight me

1232
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,480
like he came and actually engaged my

1233
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:14,239
guard and i ended up submitting him so

1234
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,240
it either has that effect or it has the

1235
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,159
effect where they know i've talked so

1236
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:20,639
much [ __ ] leading up to the match

1237
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:22,159
that they're so afraid to lose that they

1238
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,358
just get super stally and they move away

1239
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,960
so it either has one effect where they

1240
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,119
come forward and they want to they want

1241
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,400
to beat me beat me or they want to just

1242
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,160
they're so afraid of getting submitted

1243
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,680
that they know if they engage they're

1244
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,039
super cagey and they just back away and

1245
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:35,679
don't really do anything

1246
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:37,039
do you think this match happens

1247
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,199
there's a lot of variables what i have

1248
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,639
to see how my stomach is and two

1249
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:42,318
if i'm actually going to show up and

1250
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:44,318
compete my stomach's healthy i doubt

1251
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:45,920
that andre will actually show up to

1252
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,838
compete i've been trying to compete

1253
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,599
against him for six years and he hasn't

1254
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:51,279
done it so there's no reason to think he

1255
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,440
would now is it possible for you to

1256
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,599
speak to where like your estimates are

1257
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,760
about your stomach or is it too unclear

1258
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,200
for now still too early to tell i have

1259
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,680
this round of treatment that i'm doing

1260
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,838
until late february and i'm pretty sure

1261
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,919
that i need to do the same test i did

1262
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,159
initially to retest all my levels and

1263
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,838
then go from there so i've been feeling

1264
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,799
a little bit better like it's not nearly

1265
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:14,639
as bad as it used to be i was explaining

1266
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,720
to someone the other day like for the

1267
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,400
last four years i would be so nauseous

1268
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,039
that every time i would walk into a new

1269
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,880
room i'd have to actively locate a

1270
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,318
garbage can in case i have to throw up

1271
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,680
so i'm like one step above that right

1272
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,358
now i'm like doing a little bit better

1273
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:28,719
than that um so it's definitely getting

1274
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,880
a little bit better but it's not it's

1275
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,879
not where it needs to be

1276
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,838
can we talk about diet for just a sec

1277
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,280
because uh both of you uh george and and

1278
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:39,440
gordon

1279
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,800
like suffered from stomach issues

1280
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,760
different kind

1281
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,560
and have arrived for now for different

1282
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,079
places so can you maybe george speak to

1283
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,838
um

1284
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,480
the general question of what is the best

1285
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,358
diet for performance for training like

1286
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,199
what have you learned through your

1287
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:58,239
career about this well i i think

1288
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,838
everybody is different um to me

1289
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:00,719
personally

1290
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,719
uh

1291
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:03,838
i implement fasting

1292
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:05,838
um

1293
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,440
time restricted eating and and

1294
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:09,199
prolonged fasting

1295
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,800
what's the longest you've done so far

1296
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:13,039
the longest i've done is five days

1297
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,599
you've done i do it quite often i do i

1298
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,199
do four times a year i do

1299
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,079
three to five days

1300
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,318
uh water fast

1301
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,400
and i i liked it it helps me with

1302
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:25,759
inflammation i think it boosts the

1303
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,160
immune system

1304
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,280
and uh that that's about the i read

1305
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:33,440
papers about about this and i it helps

1306
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,599
me also feel

1307
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,119
feel good it's kind of

1308
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,440
very therapeutic

1309
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,838
physical and mental just mental

1310
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,318
mental and physical because when i eat

1311
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:47,039
my when i break my fast and i sit at the

1312
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:49,440
table with with other people

1313
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,199
it doesn't matter what i eat if we all

1314
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,440
eat the same thing i always tell them i

1315
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:56,879
said my my food right now tastes better

1316
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,760
than all of yours you know because i you

1317
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,160
know i i have this

1318
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,960
thing that i i believe sometimes you

1319
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:07,199
need to put yourself into suffering to

1320
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,280
realize how

1321
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:10,960
pleasurable something is

1322
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,079
and

1323
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,199
i uh

1324
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,920
tend

1325
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,118
personally like diet wise i eat whatever

1326
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,519
i want

1327
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,680
whenever i want i don't i no longer have

1328
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:24,000
any problem with this

1329
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:25,199
but if i would have a competition coming

1330
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,440
up like

1331
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,118
knowing that i what i know now about my

1332
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,200
body i would

1333
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,480
orient myself

1334
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:36,078
more towards an animal based diet

1335
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,240
that's because i've tried different

1336
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,480
things and that's the kind of diet that

1337
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:43,118
i believe helped me

1338
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,679
having less inflammation and feel better

1339
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,599
in terms of performance for for for

1340
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:49,759
doing something physical so high protein

1341
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,200
high fat low carbs

1342
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,880
well

1343
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:54,960
this is is different between

1344
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,200
animal-based diet and keto

1345
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,000
i mean there's carbs there's a lot of

1346
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,719
fruit i get a lot of the the the carbs

1347
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,760
from the fruit okay uh a lot of organs

1348
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:07,838
organs um

1349
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,000
i know a little bit about paleontology

1350
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,119
and in the the past

1351
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,679
on

1352
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,720
about prehistoric human and i i know

1353
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:17,199
that

1354
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,799
um and not not only about that i know

1355
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:20,559
because i have traveled

1356
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,318
certain places in the world i want to to

1357
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,559
visit the maasai in africa the

1358
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,559
hunter-gatherer tribe and i know that

1359
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:29,039
when they kill an animal

1360
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:31,039
they go for the organs first and i know

1361
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,440
i pray most predatory animal they do the

1362
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,358
same thing so organs i believe is

1363
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,358
something that normally in in our

1364
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,960
culture in the western part of the world

1365
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,519
we don't really eat but it's something

1366
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,280
that is very nutritious

1367
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:46,000
have you been able to convince gordon to

1368
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,319
try fasting

1369
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,239
we always talk about diets

1370
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:52,079
it's a different situation i think for

1371
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,519
gordon because he's a heavy weight he

1372
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,839
doesn't want to lose weight you don't

1373
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,920
want to heavy weight the range of uh

1374
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:59,679
like my range was like i was a

1375
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,280
welterweight and middleweight but

1376
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:03,039
heavyweight it's like some of the guys

1377
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,920
that you compete can compete against

1378
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:07,759
their they might be 300 pounds so

1379
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,200
if you lose weight

1380
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,640
it's a it's a big problem you know what

1381
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,480
i mean so it

1382
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,318
and there's things that will work for me

1383
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,159
that might not works for gordon you know

1384
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:17,599
so you have to make his own experience

1385
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,078
and and i told gordon sometimes when

1386
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,838
everybody goes left try to go right see

1387
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,200
how you feel with certain things

1388
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,519
experiment

1389
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:27,759
not not a topic uh

1390
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:30,239
that's part of your optimization

1391
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,240
optimal performance formula well uh what

1392
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,759
i used to do before my stomach issues

1393
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:36,078
and for those of you listening who don't

1394
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,960
know i had recurring staph infections in

1395
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,720
2018 and i took a bunch of oral

1396
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,240
antibiotics and it just completely wiped

1397
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:44,799
out my stomach so

1398
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,719
i just was diagnosed i was misdiagnosed

1399
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,559
as gastroparesis so for those of you

1400
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,159
messaging me on instagram who are just

1401
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,640
watching rogan asking me about my

1402
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:55,039
gastroparesis that's not what i have um

1403
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,639
they misdiagnosed it and uh i did some

1404
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,159
other tests and for four years i didn't

1405
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,000
even know what it was

1406
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:01,679
and then i got this uh i went to this

1407
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,318
doctor in california who

1408
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:06,558
uh diagnosed me with i have h pylori and

1409
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,639
then a fungal and a bacterial overgrowth

1410
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,880
of my small intestines so the issues in

1411
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,960
the small intestines um so what i used

1412
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,200
to do was i used to do like seasons

1413
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,679
where i'd have a very clean season when

1414
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,358
i was competing and i would have a lower

1415
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:20,879
body weight and i would do like an off

1416
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:22,799
season kind of like a bodybuilder where

1417
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,480
i would eat a lot more food and a little

1418
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,559
bit dirtier food and i would have

1419
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,240
cheeseburgers and pizza at night time to

1420
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,680
have the extra calories

1421
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,358
but now i can't eat those foods because

1422
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:32,960
they upset my stomach so now i pretty

1423
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:35,199
much just try to eat whatever i can and

1424
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,280
maintain the weight the best i can

1425
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,399
based on how my stomach feels so right

1426
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,000
now it's like

1427
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,599
rice chicken

1428
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,599
eggs fish

1429
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,880
vegetables fruits

1430
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,880
and pretty much nothing else like

1431
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,358
anything hard to digest

1432
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,079
anything spicy red meat

1433
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:52,799
fast food all that's all that's hard for

1434
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,519
me

1435
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,760
which sucks because in texas

1436
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:59,679
barbecue

1437
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,640
and i mean this diet is really important

1438
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:04,480
for you john i can tell um

1439
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,400
like is it is that something you think

1440
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,800
about for athletes at all again this is

1441
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,358
part of the i've um to be honest with

1442
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,880
you um i've never seen

1443
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,960
any measurable

1444
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,680
improvement in sports performance in

1445
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,000
jiu-jitsu by change of diet

1446
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:21,358
i do believe that diet is important for

1447
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,039
longevity

1448
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,318
in human beings and i do think it makes

1449
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:26,800
a difference especially once you get

1450
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:29,039
past the age of 40

1451
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,039
with regards to longevity

1452
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:33,519
for older athletes i do believe it makes

1453
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:35,440
it some difference but my observation is

1454
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:37,119
in athletes and

1455
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,079
in their youth and working up into their

1456
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,119
prime

1457
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:43,599
i've seen athletes have the worst

1458
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,599
diets

1459
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,199
god bless travis stevens but that guy

1460
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:49,838

1461
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:52,000

youth was just five guys hamburgers gary

1468
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,039
told the same thing

1469
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:10,799
i've worked with japanese judo players

1470
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,039

whatever was put in front of them and

their athletic performance was

1477
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,000
outstanding

1478
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,680
i've worked with other guys who did have

1479
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,800
what would be considered a very clean

1480
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:30,159
diet and

1481
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,318
their performance was no better than

1482
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:33,358
anyone else on the mat so i've i've

1483
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:35,440
never

1484
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:38,318
i've never seen someone say okay i

1485
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,519
changed my diet and because of that

1486
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:43,279
there was a measurable improvement in

1487
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,519
sports performance another way to phrase

1488
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,240
it though is um i have noticed with a

1489
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:50,480
lot of lead athletes what they eat

1490
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:52,479
they begin to believe that that

1491
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,639
either is not a hindrance or it's

1492
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,519
actually good like travis steve is an

1493
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:59,199
example of somebody who eats shitty

1494
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,440
because he believes

1495
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,358
it's like it's like a power because

1496
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,599
whatever he's traveling across the world

1497
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,598
he can't rely on healthy good food to be

1498
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,160
there so i'm going to eat shitty

1499
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:12,000
so that that's that like my body knows

1500
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,598
how to perform under whatever skittles

1501
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,440
or whatever everybody's got mcdonald's

1502
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,960
everywhere's got mcdonald's so that

1503
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,800
makes like and they've convinced

1504
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:22,318
themselves and you talk about russian

1505
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,480
athletes a lot of them have very strong

1506
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:26,880
beliefs about like this

1507
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,719
a particular food being good for them

1508
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,559
but there's no agreement among them

1509
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,239
exactly there's no agreement yeah so

1510
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,319
belief is more important than the actual

1511
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:35,679
diet yeah

1512
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:37,279
if i can

1513
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,759
after

1514
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,519
you know after a a night out when you're

1515
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,680
hanging over

1516
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:46,400
i think the best thing and i'm saying

1517
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:49,199
this in all certain sincerity i think

1518
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,920
the best thing to eat to me was like

1519
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:52,318
like

1520
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,200
cheeseburgers with it's we call that a

1521
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:58,400
puts in back home because it's very fat

1522
00:51:55,199 --> 00:52:00,078
it's greasy so that so the next day

1523
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,680
when you wake up i think you feel better

1524
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,640
because it absorbed the alternative

1525
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,039
there you go

1526
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:05,039
but you

1527
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,599
my mom told me the same story once and

1528
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,160
then i tried i was like i was hungover

1529
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,160
for some party and uh i woke up i was

1530
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,719
like probably i don't know 19 or 20 i

1531
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:18,879
woke up and uh my mom's like yeah just

1532
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:20,480
have it have a cheeseburger go go go eat

1533
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,318
something greasy and i did and i was

1534
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,400
like oh i feel kind of better now

1535
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:26,719
i do not know the science the exact

1536
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,000
science behind it but i i i always

1537
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,439
notice and i don't know if it's

1538
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,159
plausible but i always notice that if i

1539
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,159
if i'm if i'm if i party hard and i've

1540
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:38,159
been drinking a lot

1541
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:40,639
if i don't eat before i go into bed if i

1542
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,960
don't eat shitty food the next day will

1543
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,719
wake up and feel worse than if i eat

1544
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,280
shitty food i feel better i know it

1545
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:49,838
sounds crazy i don't know why but it

1546
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,839
works for me

1547
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,680
yeah but it's also hard to do science on

1548
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:55,838
extreme performers so the discussions

1549
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,000
we're having is amongst the very

1550
00:52:55,838 --> 00:53:00,400
you know that this might not apply to a

1551
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,719
general like recreational athlete but

1552
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,639
for the elite i've just seen champions

1553
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,199
in every kind of combat sport and i've

1554
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,960
never seen a correlation between dietary

1555
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,399
habit and performance in people under

1556
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,000
the age of 30.

1557
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,559
i do believe that diet is important for

1558
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,800
longevity however and

1559
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,880
for that alone it may well be worth

1560
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,039
investing time in it but with regards to

1561
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,800
sports performance at least in jiu-jitsu

1562
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:25,039
i've never seen any significant

1563
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,599
difference well we had a little bit of a

1564
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:29,358
a difference of opinion on this i think

1565
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,039
what about strength training and muscle

1566
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:32,719
building or at least we had a discussion

1567
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:33,838
about this so what do you believe is the

1568
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:35,519
value of

1569
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,679
um

1570
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:40,239
of you know training outside of the

1571
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,799
sport so fitness

1572
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:45,358
lifting heavy lifting explosive

1573
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,440
all kinds of lifting

1574
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:50,639
personally for me i believe and i've

1575
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,039
learned that from from john

1576
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:55,440
i used to to do like

1577
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:57,920
to train like a bodybuilder before

1578
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,838
because i thought in my early days of

1579
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,318
competition that was

1580
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:03,838
the most efficient way to do things to

1581
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:05,440
because it was like i was watching

1582
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:08,078
jean-claude van damme

1583
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,639
arnold schwarzenegger we thought back

1584
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,880
back in the day that was the thing

1585
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:15,199
that that's how we should do it you know

1586
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,800
for to get ready for a fight

1587
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:18,480
but i realized

1588
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,519
later on

1589
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,318
uh

1590
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:24,800
that it's all about efficiency

1591
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:27,920
and some guys they don't lift at all and

1592
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:31,440
they're doing pretty well so i

1593
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:34,318
do cross training mostly for longevity

1594
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,639
more it's mostly for the rapid to rep

1595
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,558
like a therapy it's more therapeutic

1596
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:40,960
than for performance it's to keep my

1597
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,640
body healthy to do a certain movement

1598
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,679
that are different than what i do every

1599
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:47,920
day in the gym in combat sport to keep

1600
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:47,919
me

1601
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,519
healthy and and

1602
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,280
athletic so all the interesting movement

1603
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:54,639
stuff that you've done outside the sport

1604
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,640
that was for

1605
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:58,879
the therapeutic mostly the reputation i

1606
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:01,440
think it does it could

1607
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,440
transcend to performance but it's mostly

1608
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,960
the republic i do not believe that

1609
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,159
squatting

1610
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,559
five plates or bench bench pressing

1611
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,879
three plate will make me a better

1612
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:15,119
fighter i do not i believe actually it

1613
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,838
could hurt me more it could damage me

1614
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:19,119
more than than benefit me

1615
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:21,279
so

1616
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,240
according to somebody who on instagram

1617
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,319
posts

1618
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,679
a lot of pictures of you being shredded

1619
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:28,480
and huge

1620
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:31,358
uh what's the value of of strength so i

1621
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,119
do like a combination of uh

1622
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:35,358
john got us big into like gymnastics

1623
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,119
type movements like toes to bar and

1624
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:38,558
muscle ups and things like that when we

1625
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,559
were young

1626
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,079
like toes to bar because that's like the

1627
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,319
exact motion you have to do when you're

1628
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,480
retaining guard is knees to chest

1629
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:48,960
so i do a lot of that stuff

1630
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,159
in combination with i do a lot of

1631
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,440
opposite of george i do a lot of

1632
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:56,239
bodybuilding workouts um where i do like

1633
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,838
a basic split like a chest and triceps

1634
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:00,798
back and biceps day

1635
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:00,798
and my idea is that

1636
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:05,599
weightlifting should always be a

1637
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,920
supplement to jiu-jitsu so you shouldn't

1638
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:11,119
be missing a jiu-jitsu session to lift

1639
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,358
weights um so i don't do i do probably i

1640
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:15,358
train jiu-jitsu every day and i lift

1641
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:17,039
three to four times a week um i feel

1642
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:18,798
like lifting seven days a week for me is

1643
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:20,159
is too much and the lifting takes a lot

1644
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:22,719
of energy when you do like hard lifts

1645
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:24,719
like that um but my idea is if you want

1646
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:25,679
to get good at jiu jitsu do jiu jitsu

1647
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:29,039
and if you want to be bigger and

1648
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:31,039
stronger lift weights and uh and eat

1649
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:33,440
food and um

1650
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:35,119
i i generally don't go super heavy when

1651
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,280
i lift you start putting crazy weights

1652
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,720
then start tearing muscles and stuff um

1653
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,640
so i usually do moderate weights with a

1654
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:42,879
with a very high rep rep range like four

1655
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:45,598
sets of 20 with a drop set at the end to

1656
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,798
fatigue the muscles break the fibers and

1657
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,000
grow

1658
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:50,159
okay so

1659
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,400
four sets of 20 that's interesting so

1660
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:54,639
that that's more for endurance and raw

1661
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,160
strength yeah and also i think

1662
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:59,039
close to the competition i'll pick the

1663
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:02,480
intensity up and while there's no real

1664
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:04,880
way to get significant gains in vo2 max

1665
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,679
i think that lifting and just getting

1666
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,838
used to mentally redlining

1667
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,519
gets me kind of in competition shape

1668
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:13,119
because a lot of times in jiu jitsu the

1669
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:15,358
guys i'm training with

1670
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,400
they're not on a technical level where

1671
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:17,920
they can

1672
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,280
physically exhaust me to the point where

1673
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,039
i feel like i'm gonna die

1674
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,240
but uh i get most of that like when i'm

1675
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:24,639
wrestling because i'm not as efficient

1676
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,639
in wrestling so i get a lot more tired

1677
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:29,199
and lifting when you do like if you do

1678
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,719
like four sets of 20 leg press to squat

1679
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:33,039
and you go back and forth like you're

1680
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,558
like about to die at the end and

1681
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:36,400
i think i feel like gets me in the

1682
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,119
mental habit of redlining before

1683
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,599
competition but does muscle help you

1684
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:43,440
it's like the actual mass of muscle

1685
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,440
like this so i think being stronger will

1686
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,559
always help in a combat will always help

1687
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,400
yeah

1688
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,400
to some degree it's not going to be

1689
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,039
to a degree where

1690
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,480
it overrides efficiency but i think that

1691
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:56,639
they can't help being strong or can't

1692
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,318
hurt being stronger well there's a bunch

1693
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:01,519
of people who believe depending on the

1694
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:04,079
sport that um

1695
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:06,079
strength can quickly become uh

1696
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,280
that have detrimental effects to

1697
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,119
efficiency

1698
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,760
i like it i agree with that certain kind

1699
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,160
of

1700
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,040
i mean if strength is purely is like

1701
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:17,118
very cleanly purely applied to the exact

1702
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:19,920
movements of the sport so in judo the

1703
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,519
explosiveness you need is very difficult

1704
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,159
to replicate in any kind of way except

1705
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:25,519
by doing judo yeah i mean

1706
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:26,639
for us uh

1707
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:29,358
you always have to understand there's

1708
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:30,719
only so much technique that can overcome

1709
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:32,798
a certain amount of strength like if we

1710
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,078
all try to fight a silverback gorilla

1711
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:36,960
it's going to kill us

1712
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,920
um but that that being said um i do

1713
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,440
think that

1714
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,680
like for example heavyweights are

1715
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,400
usually the least technical because they

1716
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:46,318
rely on their size and strength to beat

1717
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,559
smaller people um but i think that if

1718
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:50,880
you stay with this with the discipline

1719
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,480
of doing everything very precise and i

1720
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,599
train with a lot smaller people most of

1721
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,079
the time so

1722
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,838
i get out of the habit of using uh using

1723
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,200
my strength um i think if you're very

1724
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:01,838
precise with the way that you train i

1725
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:03,838
think that the extra size and strength

1726
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:07,358
can help you quick question how would

1727
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:07,358
you fight a silverback gorilla

1728
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,279
i mean is that which animal do you think

1729
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:12,960
you can actually defeat that would be

1730
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,079
impressive that most people would say

1731
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,079
you can't

1732
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,079
you know i actually

1733
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:20,000
i don't have an an answer to this i

1734
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,160
thought you got to say i want i want i

1735
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,480
want to say that me and john had like a

1736
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:27,039
four hour discussion on this one time

1737
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,798
i'm like what would win bear or gorilla

1738
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,639
and he went like this whole dissertation

1739
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,318
about how like jaguar spin underneath

1740
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:33,838
and like baron barambolo silverbacks and

1741
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:35,679
kill them and like rip their rip their

1742
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:37,440
artery and their legs out it was amazing

1743
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:40,000
i guess okay so before we talk about

1744
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,760
strength john let me ask you what

1745
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,639
do you think people would be surprised

1746
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,480
by if two animals faced one of them

1747
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:47,199
would win and people wouldn't predict

1748
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,480
that

1749
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:50,399
so they would be surprised by the

1750
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,358
effectiveness of certain animal at

1751
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,200
fighting

1752
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:55,279
in the whether it's in the forest in the

1753
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:56,798
jungle so let's

1754
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,160
slow down

1755
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:01,679
so there's two animals of different

1756
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:03,039
species fighting and most people would

1757
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:04,719
pick

1758
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,798
so for example the lion gets a lot of

1759
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:09,519
credit for some reason i'm not exactly

1760
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,880
sure why the king of the jungle

1761
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:12,079
well

1762
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,358
you know a lot of people told me that

1763
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,359
the lion

1764
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:17,199
for example the tiger can

1765
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:20,159
be a lion yeah this is one of those

1766
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:20,159
age-old debates

1767
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:24,479
in grappling in fighting it feels like

1768
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,519
some animals use

1769
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,039
teeth

1770
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:30,400
and some use

1771
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:33,279
other parts of their body also like bear

1772
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:36,000
actually i don't even know how they

1773
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,400
they have extraordinarily powerful

1774
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,119
and long claws and in addition they're

1775
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,039
powerful biters as well so i wonder and

1776
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,720
the same with the silverback

1777
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,400
i don't know how much there i love that

1778
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:48,000
we're having this discussion

1779
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,240
we need joe rogan for this discussion i

1780
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,960
think so yeah i think so um

1781
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:51,919
so

1782
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,000
uh

1783
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,680
your your question has gone in in about

1784
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,639
five different so it started with

1785
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:00,000
strength uh and let's go back there

1786
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:01,118
which is

1787
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,039
do you think

1788
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,039
for for an athlete and you just let's

1789
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:07,199
let's stick to grappling

1790
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:09,759
uh do you think strike strength is

1791
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,199
helpful or detrimental uh i've always

1792
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,319
believed that

1793
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:13,759
two things

1794
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:15,838
will

1795
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,280
create whatever

1796
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:18,960
whatever effectiveness you have in

1797
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,000
grappling those are

1798
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,000
your skill set and your attributes

1799
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,599
and the best athletes are those who

1800
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,798
excel in both

1801
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,039
um

1802
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:30,960
don't kid yourself if someone gets twice

1803
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:32,960
as strong

1804
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,960
by some kind of magic potion they're

1805
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,079
going to be a more effective grappler if

1806
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,679
someone gets

1807
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,760
twice the level of endurance that they

1808
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:41,598
had previously they will be a more

1809
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,960
effective grappler these physical

1810
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:47,920
attributes have a very important outcome

1811
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,760
on the uh sorry a very important effect

1812
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,680
upon the outcome of matches

1813
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,280
um it's always a good thing to be

1814
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:54,960
stronger it's always a good thing to

1815
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,119
have better endurance it's always a good

1816
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:00,159
thing to have better balance or whatever

1817
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:02,798
other attribute you throw out there um

1818
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:05,199
gordon's point was okay everyone agrees

1819
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:07,519
on that but there's a problem in order

1820
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:10,318
to build these things

1821
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:12,239
you have to carve into other elements of

1822
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:14,239
your training regimen and then it

1823
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,479
becomes which becomes more important

1824
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:18,879
increases in strength or increases in

1825
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,880
skill

1826
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,760
there comes a point where investing

1827
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,439
in strength training starts to get

1828
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,039
diminishing returns

1829
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,920
i can't tell the difference between

1830
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:31,680
someone who bench presses 300 pounds on

1831
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,000
the mat versus someone who bench presses

1832
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:36,239
400 pounds but that's a big difference

1833
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,079
that's a hundred pound difference and

1834
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:40,078
for an athlete to go from bench pressing

1835
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,400
300 pounds to vulnerable that would

1836
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:45,039
require a great deal of

1837
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,559
of training effort and focus

1838
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,039
but if i can't tell the difference when

1839
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:51,200
i grapple and then why bother okay once

1840
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,880
you get to a certain strength level

1841
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,439
it doesn't really help that much to go

1842
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:58,000
from a 400 pound bench press to a 450

1843
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,920
pound bench press at that stage you're

1844
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,400
really getting a diminishing returns on

1845
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:05,838
your training investment

1846
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:08,639
now skills on the other hand

1847
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:11,599
experience far far less in terms of

1848
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:12,960
diminishing returns every new skill

1849
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,960
you develop

1850
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,960
can translate

1851
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,798
very very well into big increases in

1852
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,639
performance look at the example of gary

1853
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:23,038
tonen that we talked about earlier

1854
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:26,000
investments in guillotine

1855
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:27,680
made a significant improvement in his

1856
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,199
effectiveness in matches and led

1857
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:30,480
directly to some of his most important

1858
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:31,759
victories

1859
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,679
um

1860
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,839
but if he had invested the same amount

1861
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,598
of training time in developing a bench

1862
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:38,880
press that was 25 pounds more than

1863
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:40,240
previously that would have had no

1864
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,440
outcome no

1865
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:42,639
influence on the outcome of those

1866
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,318
matches

1867
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:46,078
so the question always becomes yep

1868
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:47,038
everyone acknowledges that these

1869
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,920
physical

1870
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,760
uh

1871
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,159
attributes are important and everyone

1872
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:55,200
understands that becoming stronger or

1873
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:56,879
fitter is a desirable thing and every

1874
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:59,038
athlete should work on them the

1875
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,240
interesting question becomes okay at

1876
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,760
what point

1877
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:03,919
do you start to say

1878
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,680
i'm not going to be helped by further

1879
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,838
increases

1880
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:09,679
in in strength training or endurance

1881
01:04:07,838 --> 01:04:13,279
training

1882
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:16,078
and my point with my athletes is in the

1883
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:18,640
overwhelming majority of cases

1884
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,119
if there's any kind of doubt invest more

1885
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:23,038
heavily in skill training than attribute

1886
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,119
training especially once you get to a

1887
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,880
certain level on the attributes well the

1888
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,640
interesting thing that i think you

1889
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,680
should account for with strength

1890
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:31,598
training

1891
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:33,679
is um

1892
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,119
there's instagram

1893
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:37,838
there's the world

1894
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:40,240
it's uh it seems to be more fun

1895
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:41,838
to build muscle mass it's like an

1896
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:44,078
addiction yeah people have

1897
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:46,159
there's also economic elements too like

1898
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,119
most people i i hate to say this but

1899
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:49,279
it's true

1900
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:50,318
most people are more concerned with

1901
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,760
image

1902
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:56,480
than function and

1903
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,280
it's hard to sell

1904
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,920
a fighter or a jiu-jitsu athlete who

1905
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:04,480
doesn't look like one looks like fedor

1906
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,559
yeah it's it's a tough sell now you can

1907
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,400
do it in fighting and jujitsu because

1908
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,000
ultimately it's about whose hand is

1909
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,519
raised at the end of the match and you

1910
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,318
could even use it as a selling point you

1911
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:13,679
can be

1912
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:15,038
a guy that doesn't look like you should

1913
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:16,798
be winning but he is winning that is a

1914
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,760
selling point but if you give most

1915
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:21,199
people a choice between

1916
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,039
looking like arnold schwarzenegger and

1917
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:24,639
winning matches versus looking like

1918
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,720
fader and winning matches most people

1919
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:28,639
will select i wish i'd rather look like

1920
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:31,199
arnold schwarzenegger and so most

1921
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:33,440
athletes feel almost like an economic

1922
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:36,399
compulsion to be in good shape and in

1923
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:39,039
order to advance their marketability

1924
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,240
yeah nike's not gonna sponsor fedor or

1925
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,839
tank abbott

1926
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:42,798
yeah tank habit

1927
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:44,558
no

1928
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:46,239
fatal maybe

1929
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:47,839
but yeah yeah we need at the very top

1930
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,679
there's there's something about

1931
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:51,759
aesthetic

1932
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:54,399
like image of strength and power it's

1933
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,400
also an also a personal thing if you

1934
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:58,160
look at yourself in the mirror do you

1935
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,838
like what what you see you know what i

1936
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:01,759
mean yeah do you find yourself

1937
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:03,440
attractive you know what can you do to

1938
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,200
make you look better and i think to me

1939
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,760
to me it was something one of the

1940
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,279
reasons i work out it's also for that

1941
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,480
well i'm sure if fedor looks in the

1942
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:15,119
mirror he says i look damn good today

1943
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,358
it's also a genetic factor some people

1944
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,400
you know it's harder for them i mean

1945
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,279
yeah

1946
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:24,559
all right so the question on training

1947
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:27,839
you guys john gordon trained

1948
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:30,720
often three times a day every day

1949
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:32,558
um georgia had a different

1950
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:34,318
like um

1951
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,039
a different approach to training so like

1952
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,480
what what is uh for no i don't mean that

1953
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:41,839
in a kind of the opposite or something

1954
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:44,318
it's just not every single day so

1955
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:46,880
and obviously you are

1956
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:48,558
legitimately at the very top

1957
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,798
uh in terms of performance

1958
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,440
accomplishment in in the field so what

1959
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:55,280
have you learned about

1960
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:58,159
what it takes to train

1961
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:00,480
to become not just the lead but the best

1962
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:02,639
well i i um

1963
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,798
a lot of people when you say train they

1964
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:08,639
they see training hard

1965
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:11,599
i believe you need to be very constant

1966
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:13,440
and very disciplined you need to train

1967
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,318
but you don't need to train hard every

1968
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,440
day that's what john taught me

1969
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:19,679
um

1970
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,720
for me is the nervous system sometimes i

1971
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,960
feel if i

1972
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:24,318
load it up too much it comes to a point

1973
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,559
that you're

1974
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:29,038
it's too much there is no no more

1975
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,480
information that i can absorb

1976
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,280
so

1977
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,639
uh

1978
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,798
and i do believe that it's something

1979
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:37,440
that you can train to your the capacity

1980
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:39,599
your capacity of being able to learn of

1981
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,480
absorbing certain thing

1982
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:45,440
and uh i did a lot of volume of training

1983
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:48,719
but when i when i was getting ready for

1984
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:51,039
a fight especially during sparring day

1985
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:53,759
i like to do it quick because my when i

1986
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:56,570
fight it's five round of five minute

1987
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:59,200
i don't like to to spend um

1988
01:07:56,570 --> 01:08:02,798
[Music]

1989
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:05,679
an hour or two hours in a gym because

1990
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:08,639
i need to know how hard i can be

1991
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:10,480
going for 25 minutes you know not for

1992
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:12,719
two hours for 25 minutes

1993
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:15,599
and my last fight

1994
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:15,598
john and i we we

1995
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:20,479
we were thinking of how could we

1996
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:21,599
make me more

1997
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,519
uh

1998
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,880
of a better finisher you know more

1999
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,279
opportunists

2000
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,838
and then john i remember we when we were

2001
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,600
training with gordon jake shill came

2002
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:33,759
gary tony

2003
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,880
my round of grappling were different

2004
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:39,359
than if i would be training for uh

2005
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:41,440
abu dhabi you know for for ebi or like

2006
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,600
some like in grappling the round or

2007
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:46,158
longer but

2008
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,880
in a mixed martial art fight

2009
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:50,719
it's very rare that you're gonna spend

2010
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,798
more than

2011
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,640
four minutes or four minutes and a half

2012
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:56,399
on the ground it's it's very unlikely i

2013
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,199
mean it couldn't can happen but

2014
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:57,920
so

2015
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:59,599
i

2016
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,679
do you remember we did the around three

2017
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,319
minutes we did all the round i was doing

2018
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,920
were three minute round so it gives a

2019
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:08,480
different

2020
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,480
rhythm to the training it forced me to

2021
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,399
be more opportunist

2022
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,318
to be more of a finisher because i had

2023
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,599
only three minutes to to do what i

2024
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,600
needed to do

2025
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,279
so if i if i see something i need to to

2026
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,079
go for the kill right away i cannot be

2027
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:24,080
too over patient you know what i mean

2028
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:26,318
and it it serves me well in my last

2029
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:28,000
fight and i think it that's a good

2030
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,080
blueprint to follow

2031
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,798
um when you're a mixed martial art

2032
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:36,559
fighter i if i would if

2033
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:36,560
the result was great and i think

2034
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,560
maybe i should have done that before it

2035
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:43,120
was a great great idea that we had not

2036
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,400
to do uh be very careful and doing too

2037
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:46,640
much volume

2038
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:48,318
yeah just try to get out and then try to

2039
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,079
focus on finishing and getting getting

2040
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,239
out of it i mean

2041
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:54,640
to build up your foundation i believe

2042
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:56,799
you need a lot of volume but yeah when

2043
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,679
you get ready for competition you need

2044
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:02,239
some to be something that replicate

2045
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,440
what you're gonna be facing what are you

2046
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:04,158
what are we talking about what do you

2047
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:07,039
think

2048
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:09,599
like is there rest days five days a week

2049
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:11,600
twice a day once a day is there any one

2050
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,520
formula like that or no this this i

2051
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,480
don't i do not believe in over training

2052
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:19,040
i believe in under arrest

2053
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:21,759
i believe

2054
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:23,359
you can be under arrest and

2055
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,679
people

2056
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:28,238
always link that immediately to the

2057
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:29,279
volume of their how much volume they

2058
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:31,839
they train

2059
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:34,158
which it could be something else how are

2060
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,600
you feeling um emotionally are you are

2061
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:38,479
you having uh

2062
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,640
problems uh personal problem do you ever

2063
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:43,119
have a hard time sleeping because you

2064
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,159
have a like someone died or yeah i don't

2065
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:46,399
know like

2066
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:47,279
you hold money you're broke or what like

2067
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:48,399
you know what i mean it could be

2068
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,198
anything

2069
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:53,439
uh there's something that can affect you

2070
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:55,519
psychologically or emotionally

2071
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:57,599
that made it in a way that you cannot

2072
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,239
sleep well because you're your stress

2073
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,760
your cortisol level is high

2074
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:03,519
you're you know what i mean all these

2075
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,159
factors need to be take taken in

2076
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,000
consideration it's not only about the

2077
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:09,198
volume of training people

2078
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,198
always think

2079
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,479
the volume of tr the training is not the

2080
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:14,960
only thing

2081
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:17,359
that can affect recuperation which is

2082
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,960
not you know yeah he said to minimize

2083
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:21,439
the amount of stress from all kinds of

2084
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,600
factors it's a very stressful job to be

2085
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:26,559
a professional

2086
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:29,280
combat athlete whether you're a grappler

2087
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,039
a boxer a kickboxer a fighter and you

2088
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:32,158
need to be taking

2089
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:33,519
as a

2090
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:34,879
into account

2091
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,880
is it more or less stressful than

2092
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,119
marriage just kidding

2093
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,199
uh next question uh

2094
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,079
um

2095
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:44,000
so

2096
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:45,679
i don't know how to ask this question

2097
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,800
given what george just said but you're

2098
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:50,719
training three times a day

2099
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,640
and finishing and what what have you

2100
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:55,198
learned about what what brings out the

2101
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:57,760
best in you as as the elite level

2102
01:11:55,198 --> 01:12:00,319
grappler um so over the recent years

2103
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,079
i've actually changed it up a little bit

2104
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:03,519
when i was

2105
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,519
coming up through

2106
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,840
from white to black belt

2107
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,239
i felt that the volume was the most

2108
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,000
important so it would be anywhere from

2109
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:14,319
like three

2110
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,359
to seven sessions a day

2111
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:16,799
um

2112
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,238
going from school to school from new

2113
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,760
york to new jersey

2114
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:23,279
and i think the volume was very

2115
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:24,719
important to build the skills

2116
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:26,639
where i just

2117
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,399
didn't know how to move my body at

2118
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,320
purple belt the way that i should um so

2119
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:32,639
i think that building the skills

2120
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:35,279
is uh is super important i think that

2121
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,039
early on volume is very important

2122
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:39,119
now that i already have the skills built

2123
01:12:37,039 --> 01:12:40,800
i think that acquiring more knowledge is

2124
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:43,198
the most important

2125
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:45,199
so i find that if i do

2126
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:46,799
so many sessions a day like if i do

2127
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:48,799
three sessions a day

2128
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,760
i feel sometimes by the third session

2129
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,119
i'm just like so mentally like there's

2130
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,560
just there's so much information that's

2131
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,920
went through my head the first two

2132
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,239
sessions that i feel like i'm not even

2133
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:01,440
there mentally on the third session

2134
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:04,158
so i feel like doing less volume now but

2135
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:05,599
having more mental clarity per session

2136
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:08,399
is more important because i already have

2137
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:11,199
the foundational skills acquired

2138
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:12,639
so a lot of your training is almost like

2139
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:14,719
just thinking

2140
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,400
like learning a lot of it yeah so i'll

2141
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:18,319
do like i mean our schedule has been

2142
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:20,079
messed up since the pandemic because

2143
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:21,840
henzo's got shut down and they were

2144
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:24,000
using a french gym in puerto rico and

2145
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,000
now we're using a french gym in our in

2146
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,600
in austin but once we have our own

2147
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,198
school we'll have a setup schedule where

2148
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,000
i can pretty much just be there all day

2149
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:31,519
long

2150
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,119
right now i do like a lifting session in

2151
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,239
the morning and then i'll come in and

2152
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:37,198
help teach

2153
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:39,119
at henzo so i'm there mentally i'm

2154
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:40,799
seeing what's going on and i'm playing

2155
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:42,800
around with ideas in my head

2156
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,039
and then i'm there physically and very

2157
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,520
sharp mentally for the competition class

2158
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:49,279
during the 1pm session and then after

2159
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,080
that i'll go home i'll rest and get

2160
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:52,079
ready for the next day

2161
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,480
what have you learned on seeing all

2162
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:58,960
these different athletes is there a

2163
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:01,519
a universal rule that applies or is it

2164
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,359
um athlete specifically uh

2165
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,280
first one thing you need to address is

2166
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:07,039
that george and gordon play very

2167
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:10,158
different sports with very different

2168
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:12,560
athletic demands um gordon can be in

2169
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:13,439
matches that range from anywhere from

2170
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,560
six

2171
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:17,119
minutes to

2172
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:20,560
literally hours long

2173
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:23,439
as a result uh the overall

2174
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,920
uh pacing and intensity of matches is

2175
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:28,479
massively different most obviously there

2176
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:30,480
is no striking in gordon's sport

2177
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:32,639
striking by its very nature is a much

2178
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:35,439
more explosive physical action than

2179
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,880
grappliness grappling is primarily an

2180
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:39,198
isometric

2181
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,600
kind of sport based around isometric

2182
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:44,079
tension and endurance

2183
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,920
georgia sport is

2184
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,760
does feature a significant amount of

2185
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,279
isometric tension but

2186
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,520
the majority of it is based around

2187
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:54,000
explosion so the physical demands of the

2188
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:57,440
two sports are radically different

2189
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,600
in addition the time of application is

2190
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:01,519
is radically different george raised a

2191
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,560
very interesting point his matches seem

2192
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:07,840
long 25 minutes for a championship match

2193
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:10,159
um but always understand that

2194
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,760
a mixed martial arts fight at

2195
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:14,799
championship level

2196
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:18,800
if it goes the distance is really

2197
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:20,800
five five minute matches each round

2198
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,279
is a match in itself and that's exactly

2199
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:26,159
how you're scored you're scored by who

2200
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:28,399
wins the most matches over five matches

2201
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:29,759
as a result the application of the

2202
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,759
techniques especially the grappling

2203
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:35,760
techniques has to be done at a certain

2204
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:37,360
pace as george pointed out realistically

2205
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,119
the maximum application time you're

2206
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:41,519
going to get in most situations is

2207
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:44,079
somewhere between

2208
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:46,080
15 seconds and three minutes

2209
01:15:44,079 --> 01:15:48,319
even for a specialized grappler like

2210
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:50,640
damien meyer there's still a significant

2211
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:53,359
part of each round which is spent in

2212
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,400
setup time to actually get the match to

2213
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:56,719
the ground

2214
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:58,079
um it's very likely that at some point

2215
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,520
your opponent will stand up out of

2216
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:01,920
grappling and you'll have to reinitiate

2217
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:04,239
the entire process again so that even

2218
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,600
for specialized grapplers you might be

2219
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:08,158
spending only

2220
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,199
three minutes out of a five minute round

2221
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:10,719
uh

2222
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:12,158
on the ground

2223
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:13,198
and as a result you've got to get your

2224
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:15,439
work done

2225
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:16,799
in a very short time frame

2226
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:18,559
gordon ryan

2227
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,000
once it goes to the ground and it can go

2228
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,239
to the ground because he chooses to sit

2229
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,560
to the ground

2230
01:16:22,238 --> 01:16:25,678
may spend the entire match in ground

2231
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,440
positions

2232
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:29,520
um

2233
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:30,799
as a result the matches have completely

2234
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,159
different pacing and completely

2235
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,679
different physical demands and the

2236
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:35,679
preparation that the two athletes go

2237
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:36,800
through will reflect that

2238
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,960
uh

2239
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,760
if george st pierre in training for

2240
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,719
mixed martial arts becomes fatigued to a

2241
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,719
point

2242
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,800
where he's no longer physically

2243
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:48,800
effective and able to defend himself the

2244
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,880
consequences for that and mma training

2245
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,719
can be very deep indeed

2246
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,159
okay if you make a mistake in mixed

2247
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:56,079
martial arts because you're fatigued and

2248
01:16:54,158 --> 01:16:58,238
tired and you take a full power

2249
01:16:56,079 --> 01:17:00,800
roundhouse kick to the head

2250
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:02,479
that's some deep consequences a grappler

2251
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:04,239
doesn't have to face that you can be

2252
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:05,678
completely exhausted and grappling and

2253
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:07,759
just sit in the bottom of the mountain

2254
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,520
just practice just survival skills we

2255
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:10,719
just don't get submitted from bottom out

2256
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,239
and that can still be an effective

2257
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,239
training session

2258
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:15,279
complete and utter physical breakdown of

2259
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:16,879
fatigue

2260
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:18,800
can be

2261
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,000
can end an athlete's career in mixed

2262
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,279
martial arts

2263
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,439
the consequences of training through

2264
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:26,960
fatigue and mma are

2265
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:28,719
potentially very deep and very

2266
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,560
disturbing

2267
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:31,760
the consequences of training through

2268
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,800
complete physical exhaustion and

2269
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,159
grappling aren't really that severe okay

2270
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,279
you just tap whenever there's a problem

2271
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:38,319
just tap

2272
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:39,679
um

2273
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:42,000
and so they're very very different

2274
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:42,840
sports in the way you you prepare for

2275
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,920
them

2276
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:48,480
um and a grappling

2277
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,319
athlete like gordon ryan we can take

2278
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:53,359
many more liberties with physical

2279
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:55,359
exhaustion and the amount of hours a day

2280
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:58,319
you spend in training than you could

2281
01:17:55,359 --> 01:18:01,119
with a mixed martial arts athlete like

2282
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:04,238
uh exhaustion as a

2283
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:05,920
as a framework of learning so like from

2284
01:18:04,238 --> 01:18:08,479
a place of exhaustion

2285
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,239
is there any benefit do they you want

2286
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:12,319
you said being at the bottom of mouth

2287
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:14,639
sort of understanding jiu-jitsu or

2288
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:16,880
grappling somehow deeper because you're

2289
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,880
physical absolutely absolutely because

2290
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,719
then the only thing you have left in

2291
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,719
your favor is your technique and then

2292
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:25,119
you'll see how technical you are in

2293
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,600
addition you'll get to explore realms

2294
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:29,760
inside your mind that we don't spend a

2295
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,280
lot of time in and you'll learn a lot

2296
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,360
about yourself and your ability to

2297
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:34,719
endure which will

2298
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:36,719
have uh

2299
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:39,198
potentially great benefits in similar

2300
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:42,158
situations and matches yeah there's uh i

2301
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:43,439
mean for me for a recreational person

2302
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:45,759
getting

2303
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:47,519
exhaustion allows you the great benefit

2304
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,360
to experience what it feels like to

2305
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,600
really get dominated

2306
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:53,439
at an even greater frequency than you

2307
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,960
otherwise would

2308
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:56,559
and that there's something there there's

2309
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,679
some animalistic thing that's very

2310
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,440
unpleasant

2311
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,600
and then afterwards it takes you to a

2312
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:04,479
nice to a place of

2313
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,880
like um humility and

2314
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:09,678
and you get it forces you to rethink

2315
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:11,760
life in positive ways

2316
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:13,520
there's something about dominance it

2317
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:17,280
gives me if you get dominated a few

2318
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:19,280
times you can uh rationalize it somehow

2319
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:21,198
you say okay well i've screwed this up

2320
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:23,439
but when you're exhausted and you have

2321
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:25,919
to do like 30 minutes or 40 minutes or

2322
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:28,000
an hour of just being domi over and over

2323
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,158
and over being submitted

2324
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,319
it uh i don't know it's a very good

2325
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:35,198
process for

2326
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:38,479
for other avenues of life i find

2327
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:40,399
i can't explain why because i'm i'm i'm

2328
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:42,079
uh driving home

2329
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:45,279
crying afterwards listening to bruce

2330
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:46,880
springsteen but afterwards

2331
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:49,119
you this

2332
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,640
afterwards somehow you can think clearly

2333
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,960
you can see clear about what is the

2334
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:56,320
right path through life in all walks of

2335
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,679
life like relationships work but also

2336
01:19:56,319 --> 01:19:58,960
the grappling

2337
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,600
actually the grappling is the hardest

2338
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,640
one to see what you have to do

2339
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:07,199
it clarifies other avenues the humility

2340
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,719
it removes the [ __ ]

2341
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:11,198
it's like we see

2342
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:12,960
the world through some kind of fog and

2343
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:15,279
it just removes it and now you can see

2344
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,039
things clearly i don't know what that is

2345
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:18,800
i think i think it's important like you

2346
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:20,079
mentioned to push yourself like

2347
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,199
sometimes

2348
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:23,039
to see

2349
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:25,599
how far you can go because sometimes you

2350
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:27,279
you can go further than what you think

2351
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,880
and it can boost your confidence you

2352
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:30,158
know you can push yourself through a

2353
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,079
certain limit

2354
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:34,638
and maybe you thought your limit were

2355
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:35,519
was before that point and you pushed to

2356
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:36,239
it

2357
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,239
but

2358
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:40,718
like john just mentioned

2359
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:43,039
it's a risky thing to do in

2360
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:44,960
striking because if you're exhausted

2361
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:46,880
you're gonna get brain damage

2362
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:48,639
and grappling it's

2363
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,079
you know you tap if something wrong but

2364
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:52,159
you can do it also in strength

2365
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:54,158
conditioning i like to run track i do it

2366
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:56,238
all the time and track and fill

2367
01:20:54,158 --> 01:20:59,119
it it helps me to

2368
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:01,919
to to know myself better i think it's

2369
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:03,119
important so it's a good point uh

2370
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,639
it's like it's like the scrimmage

2371
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:06,559
wrestling rounds we do it's like you

2372
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,639
know if you stop moving

2373
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,239
that you're gonna get scored on and you

2374
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,760
know in your mind like there's no

2375
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:13,759
mechanical reason

2376
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,560
why i am why i should give up a score

2377
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,000
here

2378
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,480
but you're so exhausted that you're like

2379
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,880
oh man this is terrible if i if i stop

2380
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:22,399
moving i'm a [ __ ]

2381
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,359
if i don't stop move if i don't stop

2382
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:24,879
moving i'm going to be twice as

2383
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:26,799
exhausted when we actually do stand up

2384
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:29,199
so it's an interesting game you have to

2385
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,199
play inside your mind it's your pride

2386
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:32,238
very often that that

2387
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:34,000
keep you

2388
01:21:32,238 --> 01:21:35,599
that keep you

2389
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,600
sharp you know what i mean because you

2390
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,760
just want to lay down and beat it

2391
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,960
because you're completely exhausted you

2392
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,119
know

2393
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:46,639
what do you think uh is the connection

2394
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:50,559
john between this ego pride thing

2395
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:52,159
martial arts and actual violence in our

2396
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,199
with our ancestors

2397
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:54,960
do you think

2398
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:56,638
you ever plug into that you think

2399
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,399
there's echoes of something going on

2400
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,079
there or like you mentioned you have

2401
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:01,119
flaws and demons

2402
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:02,479
is it

2403
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:04,880
deep in there somewhere do you think

2404
01:22:02,479 --> 01:22:05,759
we're struggling with those demons

2405
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,199
yeah

2406
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,800
you'll need to patch up your question a

2407
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:11,519
little bit though it's going in several

2408
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:13,520
different directions wow that was

2409
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:15,120
not only am i being dominating jiu jitsu

2410
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:17,600
i mean dominating in interviewing no no

2411
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:17,599
no no no no no no no

2412
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:24,480
like okay now we interview you yeah but

2413
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:26,079
you you went down the evolution

2414
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:27,678
i mean do you think

2415
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:29,359
do you um

2416
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:30,960
i don't mean just the line between what

2417
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:32,799
is what is martial arts and what is

2418
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,399
violence i mean there there seems to be

2419
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,079
a gray area

2420
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:38,158
that connects us to

2421
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:40,238
the the evolutionary ancestors

2422
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:42,000
absolutely yeah yeah i mean i i think

2423
01:22:40,238 --> 01:22:44,079
there's a deep

2424
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,960
recognition in all of us

2425
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:46,800
that

2426
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,439
um and this is

2427
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:54,480
the evidence for this is is so easy to

2428
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:54,479
uh to see in in daily life um

2429
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:58,560
if you're walking down the street

2430
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:01,119
and suddenly you hear a commotion and

2431
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,400
two people are fighting

2432
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:05,439
you will see

2433
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:07,119
literally everyone on that street stop

2434
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:09,759
whatever they're doing

2435
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:11,119
and watch the fight

2436
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,719
humans

2437
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:14,399
are fascinated

2438
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:17,198
by violence

2439
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:19,279
and you've got to ask yourself why and

2440
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:21,519
of course it's a recognition

2441
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:23,599
that for a significant part of our

2442
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,679
evolutionary history

2443
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,719
violence was one of the most important

2444
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,119
elements

2445
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:32,239
in human existence

2446
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:35,920
as much as we curse it as much as we

2447
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:38,799
talk badly of it um

2448
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:41,440
the juxtaposition between humans social

2449
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,520
nature and their their need to for each

2450
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:45,039
other to get along and to express

2451
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,679
love amongst the

2452
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:49,600
the various members of a given community

2453
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:51,679
there are

2454
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,760
disputes between humans that can't be

2455
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,760
resolved and ultimately

2456
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,840
throughout history violence has been the

2457
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,600
number one method of

2458
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,480
conflict resolution

2459
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,719
um

2460
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:06,000
for better or for worse and there's a

2461
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:07,920
recognition in all of us that

2462
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,238
this is where we come from

2463
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,639
and there's a reason why

2464
01:24:10,238 --> 01:24:13,678
combat sports have this

2465
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:15,119
thing where

2466
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:17,199
people will watch them and they might

2467
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:19,519
even be repulsed by them but they find

2468
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:21,269
it difficult to take their eyes from it

2469
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,880
and

2470
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:25,679
[Music]

2471
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,600
i do believe that most combat athletes

2472
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:29,199
carry that sense

2473
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,880
of their

2474
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:32,158
even if it's on a subconscious level

2475
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,079
this kind of

2476
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:36,719
belief that

2477
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:39,198
this is who we are um george you use the

2478
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:40,960
word pride and i believe that's a big

2479
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:43,279
part of it i believe that

2480
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,279
um

2481
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:46,879
most

2482
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:49,360
humans have this sense of self-worth and

2483
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:51,760
pride which they're willing to fight for

2484
01:24:49,359 --> 01:24:54,000
and uh if it gets crossed by someone

2485
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,440
else they're willing to stand that

2486
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,359
some people will stand more early and

2487
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:59,678
some people could be pushed further back

2488
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:01,759
but everyone's got that line

2489
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:03,119
beyond which they won't be pushed

2490
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,199
and there's some kind of deep

2491
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:07,760
recognition in all of us that we have

2492
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:10,158
that somewhere within us no matter how

2493
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,360
hard we try to bury it or what have you

2494
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:13,279
and that's why i believe there will

2495
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:15,519
always be this eternal

2496
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:17,279
interest in combat sports

2497
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,400
um

2498
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:20,960
now

2499
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:22,799
i don't believe that most people today

2500
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,279
have any kind of respect for

2501
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,360
unrestricted violence or

2502
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:30,158
non-consensual violence

2503
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:32,479
um i think most people most good people

2504
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:34,960
are repulsed by that now i'm

2505
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:36,479
i'm sure that as humanity

2506
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:39,039
improves out into the future that will

2507
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:42,000
become more and more widespread

2508
01:25:39,039 --> 01:25:44,560
but that's not to say we we can't

2509
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,520
exercise these these

2510
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:49,360
old evolutionary demons inside of us and

2511
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,400
um

2512
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:52,079
and

2513
01:25:50,399 --> 01:25:53,920
sometimes there are just disputes

2514
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:55,920
between different people different

2515
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:58,480
cultures different nations where

2516
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,319
ultimately it's going to come to

2517
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:02,158
into into a shoving match and that will

2518
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:03,599
degenerate further into violence there's

2519
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:06,559
always going to be

2520
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:09,760
a need for humans to be able to

2521
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:11,280
to uh express themselves

2522
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,600
through violent methods and to use

2523
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,599
physical force to get to their their

2524
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,719
goals and objectives

2525
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,560
um

2526
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:20,719
our

2527
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,039
our need as humans is always to find a

2528
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:25,439
balance between

2529
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:26,800
the two forces of conflict and

2530
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:28,879
cooperation

2531
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,560
we need cooperation because humans

2532
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,440
isolated from each other

2533
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,639
more or less helpless and useless

2534
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:37,359
in order to

2535
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:38,639
advance human communities need to build

2536
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:41,439
and grow

2537
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:44,000
and so that sense of cooperation

2538
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:46,559
occurs in most of our daily lives

2539
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,639
but there will also be irresolvable

2540
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:51,520
conflicts where physical force has to be

2541
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:53,600
used to form a resolution and so most

2542
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:55,199
human beings find themselves

2543
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,360
swinging like a pendulum between

2544
01:26:55,198 --> 01:26:59,519
conflict and cooperation

2545
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:02,719
and

2546
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,400
and that is something which

2547
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:06,480
really gives birth i think to combat

2548
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:08,079
sports because sorry

2549
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,399
well i really have to ask you about this

2550
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:13,359
then there's a guy in harvard

2551
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:15,279
uh named richard rangham and there's a

2552
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:17,198
lot of people that believe this he wrote

2553
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:18,399
this book that um

2554
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:20,638
basically there's a lot of people

2555
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:22,479
studying is what happened how do we get

2556
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:24,639
from apes to humans like what was the

2557
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:26,959
magic thing right a lot of people

2558
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,000
attributed to fire and ability to cook

2559
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,920
meat

2560
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,880
there's a lot of different theories

2561
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:34,319
so

2562
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,319
he actually um

2563
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:38,319
his theory

2564
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:41,198
how do i describe this is basically that

2565
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:43,198
that the beta males one

2566
01:27:41,198 --> 01:27:44,158
that the the

2567
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:46,719
the

2568
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:48,719
apes that were able to cooperate

2569
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:51,439
so you you the way you develop

2570
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:52,880
cooperation is that there's a big bad

2571
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:55,919
leader

2572
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:57,600
that uh the the alpha male

2573
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:00,158
that you can only

2574
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:03,600
um knock off their throne if you

2575
01:28:00,158 --> 01:28:05,920
cooperate and so we built big tribes

2576
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,400
that just excelled the cooperation by

2577
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:09,359
practicing the overthrowing the leader

2578
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:11,759
and so

2579
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:14,158
and anytime an alpha male would rise up

2580
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:16,079
they would get we would we would uh

2581
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:17,439
develop our skill further and further of

2582
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:20,479
cooperation

2583
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:22,638
and so we're all just beta males uh the

2584
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:24,319
descendants of beta males that's his

2585
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:27,199
kind of theory that cooperation is

2586
01:28:24,319 --> 01:28:28,559
fundamental and it's so distinct to the

2587
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:30,879
the rest of the

2588
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:33,360
neighboring animal kingdom

2589
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,960
so fascinating i i wonder what you think

2590
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:36,559
about this tension of violence and

2591
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,600
cooperation how important is this

2592
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:42,320
cooperation to the core of yeah uh

2593
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:44,960
if you you can look at it in the uh in a

2594
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:47,439
given training room um

2595
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,520
jujitsu and mixed martial arts is solo

2596
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:51,439
sports a solo athlete steps into the

2597
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:53,600
cage or steps onto the mat

2598
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:55,839
but all of your preparation is done in a

2599
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:58,639
cooperative training environment with

2600
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:01,760
many peers and

2601
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:04,159
as much as it's an individual sport

2602
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,280
all of your preparation is done as part

2603
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:07,599
of a group

2604
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:07,599
um

2605
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,639
there's a sense in which that's

2606
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,319
an interesting metaphor for humanity

2607
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:17,039
itself everything we do in life we do

2608
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:19,439
alone but we grow up in this given

2609
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:21,760
community and and what have you

2610
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:21,759
um

2611
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:28,079
with regards to the whole

2612
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,440
alpha male beta male thing um

2613
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:31,760
humans are

2614
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:32,479
it's true this fellow is correct we you

2615
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,360
know

2616
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:36,158
most

2617
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:37,679
primates do have very strongly defined

2618
01:29:36,158 --> 01:29:40,079
alpha males who

2619
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:42,000
rule the roost and determine the entire

2620
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:42,719
direction of the um

2621
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,039
uh

2622
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:46,719
of of

2623
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:49,279
the community they build around

2624
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,279
themselves

2625
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:52,719
humans on the other hand

2626
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,600
don't have

2627
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:57,600
an alpha male in that strict biological

2628
01:29:55,600 --> 01:30:00,719
sense of someone who's responsible for

2629
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,880
the next generation dominates all the

2630
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,639
female population etc

2631
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:08,239
physically dominates but we do on the

2632
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:09,840
other hand have our own version of alpha

2633
01:30:08,238 --> 01:30:12,238
males as far as we have political and

2634
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:15,279
sociological leaders who have a

2635
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:18,479
disproportionate impact on the direction

2636
01:30:15,279 --> 01:30:18,479
of a community

2637
01:30:19,439 --> 01:30:25,519
so was the cooperation allowed us to

2638
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:27,920
to have a greater scale of hierarchy

2639
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:30,239
with the alpha male on top or the alpha

2640
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:33,600
creature on top yeah yeah

2641
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:36,879
no that's a fascinating theory

2642
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:38,880
okay in in nature were were very weak as

2643
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:41,039
a species so we needed to cooperate

2644
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:44,000
cooperate in order to

2645
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:45,760
to evolve that i think

2646
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,760
made us uh the

2647
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:52,480
top of the food chain if you look at um

2648
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:56,239
humanity in in nature

2649
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:56,238
really the two things that seem to

2650
01:30:56,479 --> 01:31:00,479
more than anything else determine

2651
01:30:58,238 --> 01:31:01,759
whether or not a given human community

2652
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:04,319
will be

2653
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:06,400
successful in a predatory world on

2654
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:08,238
numbers and technology

2655
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:10,158
okay the more your numbers increase and

2656
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:12,319
then the higher the technology of the

2657
01:31:10,158 --> 01:31:13,920
weapons and support systems you have

2658
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:16,880
around you the more successful you'll be

2659
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,800
in a predatory world um

2660
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:20,719
so it's not clear that just

2661
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:24,960
killing off the idea of an alpha male

2662
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:27,840
was the the single biggest thing

2663
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,039
the rise of technology uh and the growth

2664
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,960
of community

2665
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:32,880
after the imposition of language these

2666
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,800
are other things that would have been

2667
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,319
very very important factors and and

2668
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,920
humanity's rise

2669
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:39,439
george you made an interesting point if

2670
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,600
you look at humans

2671
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:43,759
just the raw material of humans we're

2672
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:46,320
we're [ __ ] pathetic

2673
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:49,520
in a predatory animal kingdom we're just

2674
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:51,439
the absolute bottom of the food chain

2675
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,800
we don't have a single

2676
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:54,799
effective

2677
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:57,679
weapon other than better than average

2678
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:59,760
endurance that's about it

2679
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,679
but you put us in a community

2680
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,440
who can talk to each other with language

2681
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:06,158
and give us the time

2682
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:08,559
to come up with technological advances

2683
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:10,238
such as metals

2684
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,520
and suddenly a human

2685
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:13,359
will go from

2686
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:16,560
no combat effectiveness in the animal

2687
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:19,279
kingdom to a a human armed with a simple

2688
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:21,679
metal tip spear can kill

2689
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:23,198
damn near any animal in the uh

2690
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:24,158
in the animal kingdom and working as a

2691
01:32:23,198 --> 01:32:26,719
group

2692
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:29,679
i'll beat your silver back you know how

2693
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:31,520
oh i'll fight him in a deep water pool

2694
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:32,800
because he cannot swim so i don't have

2695
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,800
to touch him

2696
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,960
you'll drown and i i can't get him into

2697
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,239
the pool you know why because someone

2698
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,679
told me because if we live in a

2699
01:32:38,238 --> 01:32:41,919
community someone told me that

2700
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,639
information so i know he passed it on to

2701
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,440
me

2702
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,719
yeah

2703
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:46,479
he taught you

2704
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:48,319
well you have to convince him too

2705
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:49,599
you have to somehow convince him to join

2706
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:52,000
you in the pool which is very difficult

2707
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:55,440
yeah yeah exactly it's a very problem

2708
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,560
very very difficult um

2709
01:32:55,439 --> 01:32:59,039
from a

2710
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,080
technical perspective john you've looked

2711
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:01,840
at

2712
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:03,519
mixed martial arts fighting in general

2713
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,440
and grappling what's the difference

2714
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,440
between fighting and grappling

2715
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:09,439
that's something i'd love to

2716
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:11,599
ask all of you maybe john you can start

2717
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:13,198
like um well uh

2718
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,719
when you talk about fighting you mean

2719
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:17,279
unrestricted

2720
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:19,359
uh mma tough time fighting yeah well

2721
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:22,079
this is funny you said unrestricted mma

2722
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:24,158
type mma type fighting so there's

2723
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:26,639
there's there's stream fighting yep yeah

2724
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:28,638
there's mma fighting and then there's

2725
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:29,920
grappling that's really the sport of

2726
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:31,760
grab you're saying okay what's the

2727
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,840
difference between mma and grappling yes

2728
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:37,679
okay um see that would have been a much

2729
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:39,039
better question yes um well the uh uh

2730
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,000
the single

2731
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:42,158
when you talk about grappling you're

2732
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,840
talking about jujitsu rules or

2733
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:45,359
yeah i mean you could maybe also mention

2734
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,279
different rule sets that somehow

2735
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:49,679
fundamentally chan challenge that

2736
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:51,840
changed the sport you know

2737
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:53,039
in the sport of mixed martial arts

2738
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,600
uh

2739
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:57,760
you've got two

2740
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,079
ways to inflict damage on the human body

2741
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,920
you've you've got kinetic energy which

2742
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:05,198
is done through striking

2743
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:07,359
kicking knees elbows fists

2744
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:10,079
and you've got

2745
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:11,198
isometric tension used along the lines

2746
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:12,880
of

2747
01:34:11,198 --> 01:34:15,039
lever and fulcrum

2748
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,679
which can be used for strangulation and

2749
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:19,920
joint braking

2750
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:21,119
in grappling you lose one of those

2751
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,639
you're no longer allowed to hurt your

2752
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:24,158
opponent with kinetic energy you can do

2753
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:26,319
it accidentally through a throw but

2754
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:27,679
you're not allowed to just

2755
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:29,840
you know knock someone out with a throw

2756
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,840
in most grappling spots it can happen

2757
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,840
but it's relatively rare and it's it's

2758
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:37,440
not encouraged by the rule set

2759
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,440
so um cyborg with uh

2760
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:42,159
yeah he got close um uh

2761
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,439
so

2762
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:45,279
there's a sense in which in mixed

2763
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:46,799
martial arts you got twice as many

2764
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:48,319
problems to deal with

2765
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,679
and

2766
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:51,198
and they occur

2767
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,920
in

2768
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:56,158
a much shorter time frame the single

2769
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:58,158
biggest difference between grappling

2770
01:34:56,158 --> 01:35:00,158
technique as a weapon

2771
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:01,759
in human combat versus striking

2772
01:35:00,158 --> 01:35:03,759
technique is time

2773
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,600
grappling technique takes a huge amount

2774
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,400
of time to apply

2775
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,840
okay

2776
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,000
the great advantage of grappling

2777
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:11,679
technique is certainty of outcome once

2778
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,399
you get there

2779
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:16,158
it takes a huge amount of time to

2780
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:18,238
set up a takedown

2781
01:35:16,158 --> 01:35:20,960
physically take them down

2782
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:22,638
work their way work your way towards a

2783
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,239
dominant position culminating in your

2784
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,560
opponent's back and then apply a

2785
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:27,678
stranglehold that's a long chain of

2786
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:30,480
events

2787
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:30,480
as opposed to

2788
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:35,039
a strong punch or kick which can take a

2789
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:37,759
quarter of a second an application from

2790
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:39,198
start to finish and the match is over

2791
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,320
um

2792
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:43,919
and so

2793
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:44,880
there's a sense in which uh grappling is

2794
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,639
is

2795
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,800
it's

2796
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:50,560
it's fighting for the patient and the

2797
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,239
calculating

2798
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,400
whereas striking

2799
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:56,319
is much more for

2800
01:35:54,399 --> 01:35:58,158
in this short time frame where

2801
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:00,158
everything gets done and

2802
01:35:58,158 --> 01:36:01,920
in the blink of an eye there's a sense

2803
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:04,879
also in which grappling is a much more

2804
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:06,239
forgiving sport you can make a terrible

2805
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,480
mistake

2806
01:36:06,238 --> 01:36:11,359
end up in a terrible position and still

2807
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:13,759
fight your way out and win

2808
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:16,639
in mixed martial arts it's

2809
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:19,039
much much less forgiving

2810
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:21,600
if you get hit and stunned your chances

2811
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:23,679
of recovery are minimal you're going to

2812
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,760
get swarmed on and unless it's right at

2813
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:28,000
the end of the round you it's very very

2814
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:29,360
hard to recover from getting hit and

2815
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,960
swarmed on

2816
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:32,960
um

2817
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:34,399
so there's a sense in which

2818
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:37,198
the biggest difference between them is

2819
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:39,519
time for application of technique

2820
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:41,678
in mixed martial arts it's incredibly

2821
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:43,520
unforgiving in terms of time even the

2822
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:44,880
smallest error can have the deepest

2823
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,960
consequences

2824
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,960
in grappling you can make massive errors

2825
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,760
and still come back and win

2826
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,719
um

2827
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:55,199
grappling will typically be won

2828
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:58,319
in a much higher percentage case by the

2829
01:36:55,198 --> 01:37:00,719
more skilled and conditioned grappler

2830
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:02,639
whereas there is

2831
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:03,679
much more of what they call a punches

2832
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:06,560
chance

2833
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:08,319
in mixed martial arts where

2834
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,039
there's a much higher likelihood of a

2835
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:12,639
lesser athlete defeating a greater

2836
01:37:11,039 --> 01:37:14,639
athlete in mma than there is in

2837
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:16,800
grappling simply because of time of

2838
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:20,079
application of the techniques even the

2839
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:22,400
smallest period of inattention in mma

2840
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:24,399
and the match is over gordon ryan could

2841
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:26,158
fall asleep for 30 seconds

2842
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:28,238
have his opponent mounted on and wake up

2843
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:30,638
and finish him five minutes later it's

2844
01:37:28,238 --> 01:37:33,198
not going to happen in mma

2845
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:34,480
okay so the the stakes so much higher

2846
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:35,919
you could do a lot of damage in a very

2847
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:37,599
small amount of time and just the

2848
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:39,359
dynamic the temporal dynamics of how

2849
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,639
things happen is very different

2850
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:42,319
everything you'll see will be a

2851
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:44,639
reflection of that then you go further

2852
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:46,799
into things like rule sets

2853
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,480
in the sport of grappling if gordon ryan

2854
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,960
comes out and sits down

2855
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:54,718
in the middle of the mat his opponent

2856
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:56,399
must follow him to the ground and engage

2857
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:57,920
in mixed martial arts

2858
01:37:56,399 --> 01:37:59,519
if you come to the center of the cage

2859
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,960
and sit down

2860
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:03,119
the other guy can just walk away from

2861
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,560
you they're completely

2862
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:07,198
oriented in different directions

2863
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,719
grappling is ground-centered mma is

2864
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:10,238
typically standing centered at the

2865
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:13,760
beginning of every round you have to

2866
01:38:10,238 --> 01:38:16,399
start standing again if i disengage from

2867
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,679
a ground grappling situation stand up

2868
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:20,799
and walk away from my opponent my

2869
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:22,639
opponent must follow me up to the feet

2870
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,719
in grappling it's the exact opposite if

2871
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:26,480
i sit to the ground my opponent must

2872
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:28,319
follow me to the ground it's written

2873
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:30,158
into the rule set and so one is

2874
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:32,238
inherently ground oriented and one is

2875
01:38:30,158 --> 01:38:33,679
inherently standing oriented so it's

2876
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:35,678
more it's more difficult to dictate

2877
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,840
where the fight happens in mixed martial

2878
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:39,840
arts yes you have to be able to impose

2879
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:41,679
where the fight is whereas in grappling

2880
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,400
you can simply choose it

2881
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:45,118
so

2882
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:46,319
george what is uh your sense of the the

2883
01:38:45,118 --> 01:38:47,679
difference in terms of how you

2884
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:50,479
approached it

2885
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:53,440
uh between the two sports so you also

2886
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:56,799
are a student of wrestling and grappling

2887
01:38:53,439 --> 01:38:59,678
so in preparing for fights

2888
01:38:56,800 --> 01:39:02,079
what parts of grappling purely the sport

2889
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:03,760
that you have to leave behind

2890
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:06,559
well i i uh

2891
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:09,360
i'm very lucky i had the opportunity to

2892
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:12,800
i i trained with i consider the best

2893
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:13,759
mentor trainer i ever ever had and i

2894
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:16,480
have

2895
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:18,480
some the best grapplers that i can train

2896
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:20,479
with they were they were there to help

2897
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:22,238
me through my career

2898
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:24,718
so

2899
01:39:22,238 --> 01:39:26,718
for my training is

2900
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:30,079
of course because i do not dedicate as

2901
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:31,600
much time in one specific area it's hard

2902
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:32,399
to be

2903
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,800
you know

2904
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:37,279
a world-class athlete and that in in

2905
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,960
only one particular area always

2906
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:41,439
for me

2907
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:44,158
like the idea to be more well-rounded to

2908
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:46,960
be very competent in every of those

2909
01:39:44,158 --> 01:39:49,920
areas striking grappling uh

2910
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:51,359
takedowns and and all those areas then

2911
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,520
being just

2912
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:57,279
very good at one

2913
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:59,840
and not as good at as as others you know

2914
01:39:57,279 --> 01:40:02,319
because i like the idea that

2915
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:03,360
it gives me more option when i fight

2916
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:04,960
someone

2917
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:06,960
i can

2918
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,399
mold myself to become the perfect

2919
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,079
nemesis to

2920
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:11,519
that person better if i'm more

2921
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:13,600
well-rounded

2922
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:16,000
if i do not have those well-rounded

2923
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,000
skill

2924
01:40:16,158 --> 01:40:20,238
i don't have that option you know

2925
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:21,359
you have less tools to work with less

2926
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:24,158
technology

2927
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:25,679
what about you gordon what um

2928
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:27,679
you know what do you think is very

2929
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:30,158
distinct about grappling in the way you

2930
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:31,359
approach it versus fighting i think most

2931
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:34,079
of it was covered but i think that

2932
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:36,880
though the one one of the big things is

2933
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:39,039
the fact that when you're looking at mma

2934
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:41,359
you have a pretty general agreed-upon

2935
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:43,920
and unified rule set where

2936
01:40:41,359 --> 01:40:45,118
if you look at ufc versus bellator there

2937
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:47,679
they have slight differences in the

2938
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:50,158
rules maybe um but it's pretty much the

2939
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:52,158
same thing whereas in grappling you have

2940
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:54,079
ebi rules then you have adcc rules you

2941
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:55,039
have ib gf rules you have no time limit

2942
01:40:54,079 --> 01:40:56,000
rules

2943
01:40:55,039 --> 01:40:58,800
and

2944
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,560
each rule set will play to the skills of

2945
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,279
different athletes

2946
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:05,360
if you have if you do adcc rules

2947
01:41:03,279 --> 01:41:07,039
it generally is slightly biased towards

2948
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:08,238
wrestlers or if they can stall to the

2949
01:41:07,039 --> 01:41:10,800
overtime

2950
01:41:08,238 --> 01:41:12,319
and then hit a takedown in the overtime

2951
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,159
and not really do any jujitsu but they

2952
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:15,679
score a takedown they're going to win

2953
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:17,519
whereas if you have like an ebi for

2954
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:19,600
example you have to finish the guy in

2955
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:22,000
regulation or you start in a jujitsu

2956
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,360
position with your back taken or

2957
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,760
in an arm bar

2958
01:41:23,359 --> 01:41:28,559
so i think that you have

2959
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:32,480
certain rule sets that play in the favor

2960
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:34,239
of certain athletes um and certain

2961
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:36,000
athletes can win in one rule set but

2962
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:37,919
then they just have no chance of winning

2963
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,719
in the other like when i fought yuri the

2964
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:42,560
first time in ebi i beat him in ebi the

2965
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:44,158
chances of me beating him on that night

2966
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,800
under an adcc rule set were probably

2967
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:49,279
pretty low um when i fought leandra lowe

2968
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,880
under an adcc rule set he beat me that

2969
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:52,479
day but the chances of him beating me in

2970
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:54,719
the same day in an ebi rules that were

2971
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:56,959
like next to zero

2972
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:59,439
so i think it's interesting that

2973
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:01,679
in mma you have one unified rule set

2974
01:41:59,439 --> 01:42:03,118
which have small differences but they're

2975
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:05,359
all generally the same

2976
01:42:03,118 --> 01:42:07,439
and in jiu jitsu you have a wide variety

2977
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:09,118
of different rule sets that

2978
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:10,960
have

2979
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:13,359
biases towards

2980
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,719
certain athlete skill sets you mentioned

2981
01:42:13,359 --> 01:42:18,559
andrew lowe

2982
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:21,279
i gotta ask you again about adcc

2983
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:22,400
you have lost very very few times in

2984
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:24,079
your career

2985
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:25,439
uh one

2986
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:27,920
i mean this is the same is true for

2987
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:30,479
george and uh the only person who has

2988
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:33,520
ever submitted you is felipe pena black

2989
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:36,399
belt yeah at blackboard

2990
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:39,600
he is a dcc world champion multiple time

2991
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:42,000
ibj jjf guillotine world champion

2992
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:42,960
you may face some adcc or elsewhere in

2993
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,760
the future

2994
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,600
um

2995
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:49,119
will you beat him

2996
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:50,320
uh yes i mean i have to say yes right

2997
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:51,839
but uh

2998
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:54,319
i fought him initially when i first got

2999
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:58,480
my black belt that i fought him a year

3000
01:42:54,319 --> 01:43:00,399
later so 2016 and 2017 um and despite

3001
01:42:58,479 --> 01:43:01,759
what people remember about the match

3002
01:43:00,399 --> 01:43:03,439
and whenever people talk about it like

3003
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:05,039
oh yeah the guy who strangled gordon but

3004
01:43:03,439 --> 01:43:07,198
no one remembers that the first match

3005
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:08,719
was like a 45 minute war

3006
01:43:07,198 --> 01:43:11,198
um and then the second match with the

3007
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:13,600
full 20 minutes of adcc and if i didn't

3008
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:14,879
get my back taken in like the last

3009
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,719
minute and a half two minutes it would

3010
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:19,840
have went into an overtime that could

3011
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:19,840
change the outcome of the match

3012
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:24,879
i think that if you look at felipe's

3013
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:27,439
performances especially nogi

3014
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:29,679
specifically nogi since then it looks

3015
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:31,439
like he's almost gotten worse whereas

3016
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:33,279
since that match

3017
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:35,519
uh in 2017

3018
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:38,960
uh the only match i lost after that was

3019
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,760
against vinny magalesh by my points and

3020
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,600
uh

3021
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:44,000
i'm on like a 55

3022
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,920
match win streak um over the course of

3023
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,880
four years um winning all the major

3024
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:51,920
tournaments nogi and uh felipe since

3025
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:53,279
that match i think is like five and two

3026
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:55,520
uh nogi

3027
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:57,359
and he's lost his last two match matches

3028
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,880
one was convincingly where he was

3029
01:43:57,359 --> 01:44:01,279
dominated by andre and one was by

3030
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:03,840
submission so i don't think that he's

3031
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:05,759
progressed nearly as fast if anything he

3032
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,760
looks like he's worse than he was when

3033
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:09,119
he beat me in 2017 based on his previous

3034
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:10,159
performances

3035
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:11,039
that being said i know he's going to

3036
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:12,960
come in

3037
01:44:11,039 --> 01:44:14,639
training very hard for this one and he's

3038
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,000
going to be prepared but i just don't

3039
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:16,880
think

3040
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,960
that

3041
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:21,600
in terms of technical ability he's

3042
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:23,198
anywhere near my level and

3043
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:25,760
he was much bigger than me

3044
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:26,960
both times we fought um the first time

3045
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,039
he was much bigger than me the second

3046
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,158
time he was one-way class above me

3047
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:32,000
so now there's not going to be an

3048
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:33,359
advantage in

3049
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,279
technicality and it's also not going to

3050
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:38,479
be a physicality advantage so i think

3051
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:38,479
he's just going to be beat everywhere

3052
01:44:40,158 --> 01:44:44,638
this is uh this is a good example of the

3053
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:47,679
scientific response to a um

3054
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:50,480
to a comment to a question yeah so he's

3055
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:50,480
not um

3056
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:55,118
that that's a match you're you're not

3057
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:57,920
deeply concerned with

3058
01:44:55,118 --> 01:44:59,839
in terms of the set of opponents because

3059
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:01,679
you have and you will be facing a lot of

3060
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:02,880
really difficult

3061
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:04,560
that's actually in my opinion one of the

3062
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:06,480
easier matches because of the fact that

3063
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,520
we're relatively the same size

3064
01:45:06,479 --> 01:45:10,799
um if i show up at 230 pounds like a lot

3065
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:13,840
of the guys are

3066
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:15,440
260 270 plus so that extra weight does

3067
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:17,440
make a difference i think out of that

3068
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:18,559
entire bracket

3069
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:19,919
felipe is probably going to be the one

3070
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:22,159
of the easiest matches because of the

3071
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,520
fact that i can easily take him down and

3072
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:25,839
if i take him out i'm going to pass his

3073
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:27,280
guard whereas i feel like the other guys

3074
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,119
because they're so much bigger and

3075
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:31,198
they're very cagey

3076
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:33,439
it may take me a while to actually

3077
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:34,879
take them to the ground

3078
01:45:33,439 --> 01:45:36,559
and get on top of them and i think it

3079
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,920
may be they may be longer drawn out

3080
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,920
matches because of the fact that they're

3081
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,840
so much bigger and stally it's hard to

3082
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:44,960
take them down but felipe is relatively

3083
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:46,239
my size and as wrestling is atrocious so

3084
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,480
and i've already taken them down in the

3085
01:45:46,238 --> 01:45:50,000
last adcc match so i'm pretty sure i can

3086
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:51,759
just easily put them down pass them and

3087
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,679
then finish them

3088
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:56,079
well i'm not sure what response i was

3089
01:45:53,679 --> 01:46:00,399
expecting but uh that was

3090
01:45:56,079 --> 01:46:02,479
that was phrased beautifully um

3091
01:46:00,399 --> 01:46:03,759
we talked about the thiago alves fight

3092
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:07,198
that george had

3093
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:09,199
and john barred up in class yesterday

3094
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:10,638
i believe but the point is we're talking

3095
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:13,919
about wrestling and i think that that's

3096
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:15,199
a fascinating fight that um

3097
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,520
there's an incredible display of

3098
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:19,279
strategy of skill of heart

3099
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:21,520
uh george could you maybe

3100
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:24,559
talk about that by john maybe too what

3101
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:28,080
lessons you gained from that fight

3102
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:30,800
go ahead it was your fight not mine

3103
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:32,639
well oh maybe it also tell what happened

3104
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,960
in terms of your injury i think they're

3105
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:37,359
around oh yeah um

3106
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:40,319
so i was fighting tiago alves and uh in

3107
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:42,559
the third round i um

3108
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:44,559
tear my adductor muscle

3109
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,239
um it happened when i was on the bottom

3110
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:49,360
and he i think he pushed my knee down

3111
01:46:46,238 --> 01:46:50,479
tried to pass my guard and i heard a pop

3112
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:52,000
i don't know what i think you were going

3113
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:53,519
for an umba

3114
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,679
you were on his back you switched to

3115
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:57,280
armbar and he cleared the leg by pushing

3116
01:46:55,679 --> 01:46:59,359
on your leg and you went in with the

3117
01:46:57,279 --> 01:47:02,960
pre-existing injury and it tore

3118
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:05,279
yes and and it it it got worse and and i

3119
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:07,679
heard a pop i don't know what it was but

3120
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:09,279
i know it really hurt so i came back

3121
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:10,560
standing up and

3122
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:12,719
there's a

3123
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,719
famous video one that goes on the

3124
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:17,359
internet about when i go back in the

3125
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:19,439
corner and i tell my coach i'm like i

3126
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:22,559
don't know what it is i think i tore my

3127
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:24,479
my my adductor muscle and greg jackson

3128
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,880
is like i don't care hit him with your

3129
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:26,879
groin

3130
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:32,158
i was very worried because i wasn't pain

3131
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,199
but i didn't i did not know what what i

3132
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:35,599
had

3133
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:39,519
so i didn't know the gravity of it and

3134
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:41,280
it it plays on your mind so but i had to

3135
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:42,960
bite down my mouthpiece and finish the

3136
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:45,439
fight you know i knew i was ahead on the

3137
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:48,399
on the scorecard and now i need to

3138
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:50,238
finish finish strong so what was your

3139
01:47:48,399 --> 01:47:52,479
strategy there in terms of strikes in

3140
01:47:50,238 --> 01:47:54,799
terms of wrestling so he's exceptionally

3141
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:58,238
difficult opponent to take down yeah

3142
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:01,520
well at first i i i knew i would had a

3143
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:03,519
good jab a good you know to stay always

3144
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:06,080
from the outside you know fight him from

3145
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:07,920
the outside and use my footwork because

3146
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:08,880
he was like a tank he was much bigger

3147
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,480
and much

3148
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:11,920
stronger than me

3149
01:48:10,479 --> 01:48:13,599
and uh

3150
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:16,000
i didn't want never wanted to stay in

3151
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,920
front of him so it was all the way out

3152
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,600
or all the way in and when i was coming

3153
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:22,239
all the way in it was with my uh

3154
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:23,520
proactive or reactive takedown

3155
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:26,959
where i

3156
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:29,600
myself initiated the takedown by uh

3157
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:30,639
using a distraction like a jab to make

3158
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:33,679
it is

3159
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:35,279
and goes up and then i go with a

3160
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:38,079
single double leg

3161
01:48:35,279 --> 01:48:40,639
or uh to react like baiting him for him

3162
01:48:38,079 --> 01:48:42,800
to come hit me and then

3163
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:44,319
while he's coming to hit me i go change

3164
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,679
level and

3165
01:48:44,319 --> 01:48:47,920
that's the way i like to take my

3166
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:50,079
opponent down you know some guys for

3167
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:52,239
example like like uh cabbie for example

3168
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:54,079
he is very good at at

3169
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:56,079
bringing his opponent to defense and use

3170
01:48:54,079 --> 01:48:58,639
chain wrestling to to take his opponent

3171
01:48:56,079 --> 01:49:00,639
down i find that for me for myself i

3172
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:02,480
specialize more into

3173
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:04,319
explosive take down in the center of the

3174
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:07,759
actagon because i found it

3175
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:07,759
more economical for me

3176
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:12,000
what did you see you were you're

3177
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:14,319
commenting john about the wrestling

3178
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,000
those that was quite interesting i mean

3179
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:18,158
also can you generally comment on the

3180
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,399
fact that george saint pierre who don't

3181
01:49:18,158 --> 01:49:22,719
i don't think you wrestled

3182
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:24,799
i wrestle i started saying i was 19

3183
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:26,560
years old but i wrestled some very good

3184
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:29,039
russian guys so they took me underneath

3185
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:31,840
their wing and but

3186
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:33,760
my ability to cover distance

3187
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:36,079
come from karate does not come from

3188
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:39,360
wrestling wrestling is how i finish once

3189
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:41,039
i get the leg how i finish the takedown

3190
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:42,960
so the the timing and the movement and

3191
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:44,479
the explosion required for the squad

3192
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:46,800
yeah

3193
01:49:44,479 --> 01:49:49,198
i think an important distinction to make

3194
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:50,239
here is um one which

3195
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:52,719
george

3196
01:49:50,238 --> 01:49:53,919
uh made throughout his career and i

3197
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:56,800
believe george you were the greatest

3198
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:58,639
innovator in mma history

3199
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,719
with regards to this

3200
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:03,039
and this is uh

3201
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:06,319
the creation of what george calls shoot

3202
01:50:03,039 --> 01:50:08,238
boxing which is the amalgamation of

3203
01:50:06,319 --> 01:50:09,679
striking technique in george's case

3204
01:50:08,238 --> 01:50:12,158
mostly karate because that was his

3205
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:14,560
martial arts background

3206
01:50:12,158 --> 01:50:15,920
into grappling and in particular

3207
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,679
takedowns

3208
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:19,920
uh

3209
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:22,319
when most people say

3210
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:25,118
so-and-so has better wrestling

3211
01:50:22,319 --> 01:50:26,960
in mixed martial arts

3212
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:29,519
you have to be very careful what they

3213
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:31,359
mean by this there are many highly

3214
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,199
credentialed wrestlers

3215
01:50:31,359 --> 01:50:35,759
in the early days of mixed martial arts

3216
01:50:33,198 --> 01:50:36,879
who went in and truly struggled to hit a

3217
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:39,360
takedown

3218
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:41,599
now these are very very good wrestlers

3219
01:50:39,359 --> 01:50:43,359
who in a wrestling match would easily

3220
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:44,639
put down their opponent

3221
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:47,198
but

3222
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:49,199
in a striking situation where the ranges

3223
01:50:47,198 --> 01:50:51,919
are completely different and the setups

3224
01:50:49,198 --> 01:50:53,919
are entirely different the stances are

3225
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:55,599
different even the

3226
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:58,158
the overall conditions are different

3227
01:50:55,599 --> 01:51:00,480
you're no longer wearing shoes people

3228
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:02,158
underestimate just what an impact it is

3229
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:04,319
for a wrestler to take the shoes off you

3230
01:51:02,158 --> 01:51:07,759
lose like 20 of your forward drive the

3231
01:51:04,319 --> 01:51:10,799
minute you take off the shoes

3232
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:12,239
all of these make massive differences

3233
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:13,679
in whether or not you're going to be

3234
01:51:12,238 --> 01:51:16,959
able to even make contact with an

3235
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:19,440
opponent for a takedown

3236
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:21,599
as george pointed out the true value of

3237
01:51:19,439 --> 01:51:24,238
wrestling in mma is finishing the

3238
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:26,400
takedown once you've established contact

3239
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:28,158
but that's only about 20 percent of the

3240
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:30,238
action of a of a mixed martial arts

3241
01:51:28,158 --> 01:51:33,519
takedown 80 percent of it is an

3242
01:51:30,238 --> 01:51:34,399
understanding range rhythm set up

3243
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,000
opportunity

3244
01:51:34,399 --> 01:51:37,359
etc etc

3245
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,599
and

3246
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:41,279
that's not part of wrestling at all you

3247
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:42,400
even the overall conditions are

3248
01:51:41,279 --> 01:51:44,559
completely different in the sport of

3249
01:51:42,399 --> 01:51:46,638
wrestling you start at very close range

3250
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:48,960
in a very bent over stance and you're

3251
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:51,359
expected to wrestle for in international

3252
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:53,840
styles for three minutes at a time

3253
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:55,359
um now suddenly you're completely

3254
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,400
upright

3255
01:51:55,359 --> 01:51:57,839
uh

3256
01:51:56,399 --> 01:51:59,598
and

3257
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:01,599
you're not wearing shoes all the

3258
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:03,679
conditions the the the rhythm and speed

3259
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:06,079
of it is different the counters are

3260
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:07,840
completely different it's just an

3261
01:52:06,079 --> 01:52:10,158
entirely different animal

3262
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:11,599
and so george was an early recognizer of

3263
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:13,920
this

3264
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:17,039
and started to put the emphasis on

3265
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:20,158
direct training for shoot boxing

3266
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:21,920
in addition to wrestling so he practiced

3267
01:52:20,158 --> 01:52:23,519
with very good wrestlers in the montreal

3268
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:26,158
wrestling club

3269
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:27,679
just the sport of wrestling and that's

3270
01:52:26,158 --> 01:52:30,158
what made him very good at finishing

3271
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:31,440
takedowns but it was in a shoot box in

3272
01:52:30,158 --> 01:52:33,679
training

3273
01:52:31,439 --> 01:52:36,079
which he himself largely developed

3274
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:39,118
remember george started at a time when

3275
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:41,039
mma was pretty damn young

3276
01:52:39,118 --> 01:52:43,039
and um

3277
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:44,960
he we were when when you entered the

3278
01:52:43,039 --> 01:52:47,118
sport of mixed martial arts george it

3279
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:48,719
wasn't even allowed on tv

3280
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:51,759
like it was completely banned it was in

3281
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:53,679
his country it was physically banned uh

3282
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:55,520
they had to fight on indian reservations

3283
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:57,279
and oh and this is way back in the wild

3284
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:59,199
west days of mma

3285
01:52:57,279 --> 01:53:01,039
and so as a as a young developing

3286
01:52:59,198 --> 01:53:03,839
athlete he had to

3287
01:53:01,039 --> 01:53:05,279
more or less do this by himself if you

3288
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,279
ever want to hear some incredible

3289
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:08,319
stories talk about teenage george st

3290
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:10,559
pierre

3291
01:53:08,319 --> 01:53:14,158
had a coach who used to make him

3292
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:16,159
put on boxing gloves now he was 16 17

3293
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:18,238
years old and just put him on a hardwood

3294
01:53:16,158 --> 01:53:19,920
floor against a professional boxer who

3295
01:53:18,238 --> 01:53:22,638
was in his

3296
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:24,079
late 20s at the peak of his career and

3297
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:25,520
he said george you're not allowed to

3298
01:53:24,079 --> 01:53:27,439
punch you just got to take him down

3299
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:29,920
while he tries to knock you out

3300
01:53:27,439 --> 01:53:32,399
and there was a it was crazy like

3301
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:34,719
darwinism yeah he was like

3302
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:36,638
it's like you're gonna you're gonna

3303
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:38,880
adapt or you're gonna die

3304
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:40,880
literally and he could have been very

3305
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,920
bad but it turns out to be great it

3306
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,920
admitted

3307
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:46,480
but there's a sense here in which

3308
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:49,039
people think oh you know what determines

3309
01:53:46,479 --> 01:53:50,479
your takedown ability in mma is your

3310
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:51,760
wrestling skill

3311
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:53,439
that

3312
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:56,159
your wrestling skill will determine your

3313
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:58,960
finishing ability on takedowns but

3314
01:53:56,158 --> 01:53:59,839
there's so much more to it than that

3315
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:01,920
um

3316
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,360
whenever people say you know what what

3317
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:05,920
are the broad

3318
01:54:03,359 --> 01:54:08,799
elements that determine the outcome of a

3319
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:10,480
mixed martial arts fight okay on the

3320
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:13,039
broadest possible level i always give

3321
01:54:10,479 --> 01:54:16,238
the same three things

3322
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:17,840
the athlete who can dominate the pace

3323
01:54:16,238 --> 01:54:19,359
of the match

3324
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:22,000
the athlete who can dominate the

3325
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:24,479
direction of the match and the athlete

3326
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:27,118
who can dominate the setups will win the

3327
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:28,559
vast majority of fights they're in

3328
01:54:27,118 --> 01:54:31,118
those three things

3329
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:33,599
the direction the pace and the setups

3330
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:35,759
you dominate all three of those

3331
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:37,039
you're going to win 90 of the matches

3332
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:39,039
you're in

3333
01:54:37,039 --> 01:54:40,960
um george could always dominate the

3334
01:54:39,039 --> 01:54:42,960
direction of the fight because he could

3335
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:45,198
stop the other guy taking him down

3336
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,439
and he could impose his own takedowns at

3337
01:54:45,198 --> 01:54:49,598
any point in a match so whether it went

3338
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:51,919
to ground or whether it stayed standing

3339
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:53,679
was always up to him

3340
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:56,399
george had the most sophisticated array

3341
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:59,679
of setups into takedowns

3342
01:54:56,399 --> 01:55:01,519
that i've personally ever witnessed

3343
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:03,920
the whole distinction between reactive

3344
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:06,560
and proactive takedowns came very early

3345
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:09,199
in george's career and he excelled in

3346
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,560
both most people tend to favor one or

3347
01:55:09,198 --> 01:55:13,759
the other

3348
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:15,760
most athletes have a very hard time

3349
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:17,280
imposing

3350
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:19,119
their setups on an opponent and as a

3351
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:21,840
result they have to use

3352
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:23,598
the cage as a crutch for their for their

3353
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,199
setups where they just pull someone

3354
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:27,119
towards the cage and then put them down

3355
01:55:25,198 --> 01:55:29,279
on the cage george is one of the very

3356
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:31,598
few people who was equally good against

3357
01:55:29,279 --> 01:55:33,519
the cage or in the open and could do so

3358
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:36,319
in both proactive and reactive

3359
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:36,320
situations

3360
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:45,199
and the scary thing is that as good as

3361
01:55:41,279 --> 01:55:47,118
all of you saw him look in the octagon

3362
01:55:45,198 --> 01:55:49,519
anyone who knows george

3363
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:51,759
as a coach will tell you he was twice as

3364
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:53,360
good as that in the gym where he would

3365
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:55,840
often go against people's several weight

3366
01:55:53,359 --> 01:55:58,639
divisions above himself i could sit here

3367
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:59,920
all day i won't name names but i always

3368
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:01,199
laugh when people say oh this is the

3369
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,880
greatest

3370
01:56:01,198 --> 01:56:05,198
uh pound for pound guy of all time and

3371
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:06,639
i've personally seen george

3372
01:56:05,198 --> 01:56:07,919
take that guy down and crush him in the

3373
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:09,520
gym and i can't say anything because

3374
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:11,760
it's rude to talk about that in public

3375
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:13,199
because it's just training but i've seen

3376
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,639
george go with people all the way up to

3377
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:16,238
light heavyweights some of the greatest

3378
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:17,840
names in the history of the sport put

3379
01:56:16,238 --> 01:56:19,198
them down

3380
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:21,520
advanced position on the ground and

3381
01:56:19,198 --> 01:56:25,198
dominate them in training it's it's what

3382
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:27,199
he did during that time i uh george i

3383
01:56:25,198 --> 01:56:28,960
gotta say i deeply admire

3384
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:30,399
many of the things i saw you do not just

3385
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:33,039
in the octagon but

3386
01:56:30,399 --> 01:56:35,519
in training as well it's um

3387
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:36,639
the the the impact that you had

3388
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:38,639
on

3389
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:40,639
uh

3390
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:42,960
the degree to which

3391
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:45,118
takedowns where we use this sport was

3392
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:46,719
absolutely inspirational that's why one

3393
01:56:45,118 --> 01:56:48,559
of one of the reasons why i always say

3394
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:50,000
you're one of the only athlete i ever

3395
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:52,400
met who taught me

3396
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,639
more than than i taught you because you

3397
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:57,039
opened my eyes to a whole new world of

3398
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:59,920
of shoot boxing and how

3399
01:56:57,039 --> 01:57:01,118
i grew up in a time when uh you i was

3400
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,880
laughing before when you talked about

3401
01:57:01,118 --> 01:57:04,319
sugar ray leonard i was a kid watching

3402
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:06,400
that match and

3403
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:08,799
i grew up in a time where there was

3404
01:57:06,399 --> 01:57:09,920
boxing and there was kickboxing and then

3405
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:11,920
i came to america and i learned

3406
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:13,599
grappling and

3407
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:15,039
this young man here was the innovator

3408
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:15,920
when it came to the integration of the

3409
01:57:15,039 --> 01:57:17,679
two

3410
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:19,118
well then i have to ask because george

3411
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:20,960
sits here uncomfortably being

3412
01:57:19,118 --> 01:57:21,920
complimented

3413
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:24,800
um

3414
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:26,880
if george st pierre and khabib

3415
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:28,400
nurmagomedov face each other in their

3416
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:30,319
prime who wins

3417
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:32,158
cool that's it very very loaded

3418
01:57:30,319 --> 01:57:34,559
questions how yeah like what are the

3419
01:57:32,158 --> 01:57:37,039
different trajectories you see

3420
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:38,960
okay how does each one win in your view

3421
01:57:37,039 --> 01:57:41,679
if one wins or the other one with what

3422
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,599
happens interestingly they're actually

3423
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:44,480
very similar in size despite the fact

3424
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:46,079
that

3425
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:48,479
george fought it welterweight and could

3426
01:57:46,079 --> 01:57:49,760
be fought at a lightweight if you

3427
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:51,839
actually see them stand next to each

3428
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:54,800
other they're of similar height khabib's

3429
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:56,000
actually a little more thick set

3430
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:58,000
yeah he's actually heavier than you

3431
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,000
walking around um

3432
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,800
george walked around most of his career

3433
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,079
between 188 and

3434
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:06,480
191 pounds

3435
01:58:04,079 --> 01:58:07,279
and so khabib actually would ironically

3436
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:09,759
have

3437
01:58:07,279 --> 01:58:11,118
a kind of size and strength advantage uh

3438
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:13,280
despite being in the lighter weight

3439
01:58:11,118 --> 01:58:14,799
division that's been the general trend

3440
01:58:13,279 --> 01:58:16,880
as mma

3441
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:18,960
has grown is that athletes will come

3442
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:21,760
further down and wait to make weight

3443
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:23,039
divisions um

3444
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:26,000
uh

3445
01:58:23,039 --> 01:58:27,760
i believe that george has the best

3446
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,560
takedowns in history

3447
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:33,520
uh in the open in the cage

3448
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:34,960
um khabib was his great strength was

3449
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:37,280
using the fence

3450
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:39,599
to facilitate takedowns

3451
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:39,599
um

3452
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:42,560
khabib's

3453
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:44,239
other great strength was not only his

3454
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:46,800
ability to take people down but to keep

3455
01:58:44,238 --> 01:58:48,959
people down for extended periods of time

3456
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:51,599
both of them were

3457
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:54,079
powerful strikers on the ground and

3458
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:55,679
could do terrible damage to opponents

3459
01:58:54,079 --> 01:58:58,800
on the floor so

3460
01:58:55,679 --> 01:59:00,639
they're both very similar in that regard

3461
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,719
khabib was mostly a

3462
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:04,880
puncher from the back george is mostly

3463
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:06,880
an elbow from the front

3464
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:07,920
but both of them could lay waste to

3465
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:09,760
opponents

3466
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:12,960
with strikes on the floor

3467
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:14,639
um both of them were highly competent

3468
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:16,079
with submissions on the ground there

3469
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:18,639
weren't submission specialists in the

3470
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:20,000
sense of someone like gordon ryan but

3471
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:22,159
they were

3472
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,639
certainly um

3473
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:26,158
no slouches with submission holds

3474
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:28,639
um

3475
01:59:26,158 --> 01:59:30,479
yeah it's just a fascinating idea so

3476
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:33,199
it's almost like who gets the first take

3477
01:59:30,479 --> 01:59:34,319
down yeah i do believe

3478
01:59:33,198 --> 01:59:36,079
that

3479
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:37,118
they could probably stand up on each

3480
01:59:36,079 --> 01:59:38,639
other

3481
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:40,238
i don't think either one of them would

3482
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:41,599
be able to hold the other down for a

3483
01:59:40,238 --> 01:59:43,678
whole round

3484
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:46,639
um both of them are notoriously

3485
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:48,158
difficult people to hold down so i don't

3486
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:49,520
think that whoever won the first date

3487
01:59:48,158 --> 01:59:50,479
and wins the match i don't think it's

3488
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:53,440
like that

3489
01:59:50,479 --> 01:59:55,919
um i do believe that george would hold a

3490
01:59:53,439 --> 01:59:59,118
decisive advantage in striking and

3491
01:59:55,920 --> 02:00:01,840
distance management um the few times

3492
01:59:59,118 --> 02:00:03,279
that khabib did look shaky is

3493
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:05,520
when he

3494
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:07,599
could be was either advancing forward

3495
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:09,760
menacingly but when he had to

3496
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:11,599
to fight moving backwards

3497
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:13,199
there was a definite asymmetry between

3498
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:15,119
his ability to fight going forwards

3499
02:00:13,198 --> 02:00:16,399
which is very good and his ability to

3500
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:17,598
fight going backwards which was

3501
02:00:16,399 --> 02:00:18,719
noticeably

3502
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:21,679
weaker

3503
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:23,760
um george would often fight both

3504
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:25,279
forwards and backwards and with thiago

3505
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:27,920
elvis fight

3506
02:00:25,279 --> 02:00:29,279
most of the standing time yeah was was

3507
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:30,960
going backwards

3508
02:00:29,279 --> 02:00:31,840
um

3509
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:33,439
that's

3510
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,119
probably the the single biggest

3511
02:00:33,439 --> 02:00:36,879
difference between that two athletes and

3512
02:00:35,118 --> 02:00:37,920
skill level would be in the standing

3513
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,800
position

3514
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:41,679
um

3515
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:44,000
on the ground uh

3516
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:46,319
khabib slight edge and takedowns on the

3517
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,599
fence george slight edge and takedowns

3518
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:50,319
in the center

3519
02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:52,639
um ability to inflict damage on the

3520
02:00:50,319 --> 02:00:54,880
floor roughly equal ability to fight off

3521
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:56,800
the back roughly equal

3522
02:00:54,880 --> 02:01:00,319
ability to stand up from bottom roughly

3523
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:02,560
equal it's a very very hard match

3524
02:01:00,319 --> 02:01:04,000
in terms of the biggest

3525
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:06,000
difference in skill level is going to be

3526
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,279
in a standing position and so it would

3527
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,359
come down to

3528
02:01:07,279 --> 02:01:10,639
um that doesn't necessarily mean that

3529
02:01:09,359 --> 02:01:11,920
khabib would lose in the standing

3530
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:14,719
position he might just push it to the

3531
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,920
fence and just use match tactics where

3532
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:17,840
he

3533
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:20,960
kept the fight on the fence for

3534
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:22,880
significant periods of time

3535
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:25,198
and you can win rounds in that fashion

3536
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:27,520
so it's a match that could go either way

3537
02:01:25,198 --> 02:01:28,719
both of them are uh absolutely the best

3538
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,320
that you'll ever see i've always

3539
02:01:28,719 --> 02:01:31,520
believed the three greatest mixed

3540
02:01:30,319 --> 02:01:32,559
martial artists i've ever seen in my

3541
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:34,800
life were

3542
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:36,719
george st pierre khabib nurmagomedov and

3543
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:38,560
jon jones

3544
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:40,719
the three of them have some interesting

3545
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:43,039
similarities and differences

3546
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:46,880
all three

3547
02:01:43,039 --> 02:01:49,519
beat every single person they ever faced

3548
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:52,319
i i know john jones officially has a

3549
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:54,080
loss by dq but no one believes that was

3550
02:01:52,319 --> 02:01:57,279
a loss um

3551
02:01:54,079 --> 02:01:58,158
uh george does have two losses but he

3552
02:01:57,279 --> 02:02:00,960
uh

3553
02:01:58,158 --> 02:02:03,279
defeated both athletes decisively uh in

3554
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:04,399
rematches gabe did it by having no

3555
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:07,118
losses

3556
02:02:04,399 --> 02:02:09,519
interestingly all three athletes have at

3557
02:02:07,118 --> 02:02:13,118
least one match which is controversial

3558
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:15,440
in terms of who won and who lost um

3559
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:16,559
jon jones has had several matches which

3560
02:02:15,439 --> 02:02:20,158
could have gone either way on the

3561
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:21,679
judge's scorecard khabib's uh

3562
02:02:20,158 --> 02:02:23,920
match against grayson thibault could

3563
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:26,319
have gone either way uh george's match

3564
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:28,880
with hendrix was could have gone either

3565
02:02:26,319 --> 02:02:30,960
way they all had matches that they won

3566
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:32,480
which people would dispute the outcome

3567
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:33,760
so that was a similarity between the

3568
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:34,718
three of them

3569
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:37,520
um

3570
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:37,520
all three of them

3571
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:41,840
have had the ability

3572
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:43,920
to dominate the direction of fights when

3573
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:45,440
they want it to go down it goes down

3574
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:46,480
when they don't want it to go down it

3575
02:02:45,439 --> 02:02:47,598
doesn't

3576
02:02:46,479 --> 02:02:49,279
um

3577
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:51,520
that's why i put such a heavy emphasis

3578
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:53,359
on that idea that a mixed martial arts

3579
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:54,800
champion must be able to determine the

3580
02:02:53,359 --> 02:02:57,118
direction of a fight it's the single

3581
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:58,320
most important attribute that they all

3582
02:02:57,118 --> 02:02:59,519
must have

3583
02:02:58,319 --> 02:03:01,359
um

3584
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:02,880
as to which of the three

3585
02:03:01,359 --> 02:03:04,799
is the best it's going to come down to

3586
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:07,840
criteria

3587
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:09,679
you you can't pull them apart

3588
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:11,119
which answer you give as to which of

3589
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:12,800
those three is the greatest of all time

3590
02:03:11,118 --> 02:03:13,759
will come down to the criteria that you

3591
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:15,840
use

3592
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:17,360
okay is it being undefeated

3593
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:19,360
um

3594
02:03:17,359 --> 02:03:21,039
is it the amount of time was it the

3595
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:22,719
quality of the opponents that they had

3596
02:03:21,039 --> 02:03:24,319
if you do it by quality of opponents i

3597
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:26,399
think you probably have to give it to

3598
02:03:24,319 --> 02:03:29,439
george if you do it by

3599
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:30,719
um uh measured dominance through not

3600
02:03:29,439 --> 02:03:32,960
being defeated and it has to go to

3601
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:34,800
compete

3602
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:36,800
arguably you could say the same with jon

3603
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:39,360
jones since his won

3604
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:39,360
losses

3605
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:43,760
by dq but then you could also say the

3606
02:03:42,079 --> 02:03:45,519
last three or four fights that john's

3607
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:48,159
had haven't been the same measure of

3608
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:49,280
dominance as as we saw previously so

3609
02:03:48,158 --> 02:03:50,719
ultimately

3610
02:03:49,279 --> 02:03:53,198
you've got those three guys in my

3611
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:55,520
opinion and which one you choose will

3612
02:03:53,198 --> 02:03:57,919
come down to who it says more about who

3613
02:03:55,520 --> 02:04:00,159
you are as a viewer than it does about

3614
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:01,520
the respective level of the athletes you

3615
02:04:00,158 --> 02:04:04,879
could throw a blanket over them the

3616
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:07,280
three of them are just that good and um

3617
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:09,118
uh and which one you select will

3618
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:11,039
probably say more about who you are as a

3619
02:04:09,118 --> 02:04:12,319
viewer than it does about them

3620
02:04:11,039 --> 02:04:15,840
as athletes

3621
02:04:12,319 --> 02:04:17,840
i i believe the best fighter the goat is

3622
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:18,719
not even born

3623
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:20,800
because

3624
02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:21,840
the generation

3625
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,880
that is

3626
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:25,760
present

3627
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:28,000
benefit of a huge advantage

3628
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:29,760
they have knowledge technology that we

3629
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,920
didn't have before

3630
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:35,360
and we had the the knowledge that the

3631
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:36,560
other generation did not have before

3632
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:38,719
but

3633
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:41,199
i believe the best the goat is not even

3634
02:04:38,719 --> 02:04:42,480
born yet as good as they are today i

3635
02:04:41,198 --> 02:04:44,399
think you

3636
02:04:42,479 --> 02:04:46,959
in sport where you can measure the

3637
02:04:44,399 --> 02:04:50,238
performance uh track and field

3638
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:52,239
olympic lifting you can you know someone

3639
02:04:50,238 --> 02:04:53,598
is better than the other one because you

3640
02:04:52,238 --> 02:04:56,399
can measure the performance fighting

3641
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:57,840
it's all subjective we always debate of

3642
02:04:56,399 --> 02:04:59,039
who would win

3643
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:01,679
but

3644
02:04:59,039 --> 02:05:02,719
10 the tendency in sport

3645
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:04,319
is that

3646
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:05,840
performance get better i don't think

3647
02:05:04,319 --> 02:05:07,840
it's because the athlete necessarily get

3648
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:10,000
better is because they have access to

3649
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:13,840
better technology knowledge

3650
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,279
and they learn from their predecessor

3651
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:16,159
as long as that knowledge is transferred

3652
02:05:15,279 --> 02:05:17,920
forward

3653
02:05:16,158 --> 02:05:20,559
something tells me that the greatest of

3654
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:22,480
all time lived a few thousand years ago

3655
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:25,360
and it's forgotten some of the greatest

3656
02:05:22,479 --> 02:05:27,678
warriors like you imagine the kind of

3657
02:05:25,359 --> 02:05:29,519
grapplers we just the history didn't

3658
02:05:27,679 --> 02:05:31,520
record them

3659
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:34,239
there could have been small tribes where

3660
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:36,079
they developed many ufcs and they've

3661
02:05:34,238 --> 02:05:38,959
developed the kind of things we you have

3662
02:05:36,078 --> 02:05:41,039
to think of like uh the gracies just a

3663
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:43,679
small family was able to develop so much

3664
02:05:41,039 --> 02:05:45,679
so quickly i i often

3665
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:47,359
as this this discussion with johnny i

3666
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:50,078
think it's very important like to

3667
02:05:47,359 --> 02:05:53,439
mention i asked you very several times

3668
02:05:50,078 --> 02:05:56,319
like what would happen if we would take

3669
02:05:53,439 --> 02:05:58,399
a fighter of modern days facing the

3670
02:05:56,319 --> 02:05:59,920
champion of pancreation this is an

3671
02:05:58,399 --> 02:06:02,719
interesting question and you you brought

3672
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:04,719
something incredible good point and and

3673
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:08,078
people don't don't realize it you know

3674
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:10,800
yeah no i think um one of the great

3675
02:06:08,078 --> 02:06:12,639
tragedies of martial arts history is our

3676
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:15,360
loss of

3677
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:18,159
uh the historical records of pancration

3678
02:06:15,359 --> 02:06:20,399
like most of what we know was uh from

3679
02:06:18,158 --> 02:06:22,960
what i'm told is actually lost in the

3680
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:25,039
fires of the library of alexandria and

3681
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:28,399
we're left with only a pitiful amount of

3682
02:06:25,039 --> 02:06:31,519
information on uh pancreation managers

3683
02:06:28,399 --> 02:06:32,399
but what we do know is that there was a

3684
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:33,360
very

3685
02:06:32,399 --> 02:06:35,519
large

3686
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:36,479
uh participation in the sport and that

3687
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:39,199
it was

3688
02:06:36,479 --> 02:06:41,279
widely considered the most popular

3689
02:06:39,198 --> 02:06:43,039
sport in the ancient olympics and that

3690
02:06:41,279 --> 02:06:46,238
it was represented in the ancient

3691
02:06:43,039 --> 02:06:47,840
olympics for many hundreds of years plus

3692
02:06:46,238 --> 02:06:50,399
a long period of time before its

3693
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:52,719
introduction into the ancient olympics

3694
02:06:50,399 --> 02:06:54,158
and so the development time

3695
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:56,880
that it may have had would have been

3696
02:06:54,158 --> 02:06:59,439
very significant it

3697
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:01,118
uh as far as we know most of the

3698
02:06:59,439 --> 02:07:03,598
development would have been in the major

3699
02:07:01,118 --> 02:07:05,598
greek city states for

3700
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:08,560
uh literally hundreds of years of

3701
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:10,400
development um given its prestige as an

3702
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:12,239
olympic sport then the best athletes

3703
02:07:10,399 --> 02:07:15,359
would have been doing it some of the

3704
02:07:12,238 --> 02:07:17,198
sharpest minds that we know of

3705
02:07:15,359 --> 02:07:18,158
in human history were involved in the

3706
02:07:17,198 --> 02:07:22,399
sport

3707
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:22,399
um plato the great philosopher

3708
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:28,880
was a pancreaticist in his youth in fact

3709
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:32,158
his name plato is a nickname

3710
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:33,520
platus is like plate it means broad or

3711
02:07:32,158 --> 02:07:36,078
big guy like

3712
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:38,719
the big guy and um

3713
02:07:36,078 --> 02:07:40,960
uh he spoke often about pain creation

3714
02:07:38,719 --> 02:07:43,920
and his written works

3715
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:45,920
um imagine people with the intelligence

3716
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:47,760
of plato

3717
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:49,440
thinking about

3718
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:51,599
grappling technique for hundreds of

3719
02:07:49,439 --> 02:07:53,198
years in the most popular olympic sport

3720
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:55,440
of that time

3721
02:07:53,198 --> 02:07:57,519
significant numbers of people with

3722
02:07:55,439 --> 02:07:59,678
financial backing as city-states put

3723
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:02,079
great prestige upon olympic success they

3724
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:04,158
would have funneled athletes in

3725
02:08:02,078 --> 02:08:06,319
bought in the best coaches and they had

3726
02:08:04,158 --> 02:08:08,559
that for many hundreds of years like

3727
02:08:06,319 --> 02:08:10,880
it's quite conceivable that the best

3728
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:13,039
pancreasian athletes were of the

3729
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:16,480
absolute first quality

3730
02:08:13,039 --> 02:08:18,319
and um uh it it's

3731
02:08:16,479 --> 02:08:20,879
it's so sad to think we'll never know

3732
02:08:18,319 --> 02:08:22,078
what was their skill level and

3733
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:23,760
it's interesting to think about what

3734
02:08:22,078 --> 02:08:25,279
kind of techniques that developed

3735
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:27,360
whether

3736
02:08:25,279 --> 02:08:28,800
there's stuff we haven't discovered yet

3737
02:08:27,359 --> 02:08:29,839
in class you were talking about the most

3738
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:31,599
effective

3739
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:33,520
takedown strategy in wrestling in

3740
02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:35,599
collegiate wrestling so maybe let me ask

3741
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:36,400
first because we offline talked about

3742
02:08:35,599 --> 02:08:38,000
this too

3743
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:40,960
what is the highest percentage

3744
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:43,118
submission in grappling overall you have

3745
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:44,800
to go with the rare naked strangle

3746
02:08:43,118 --> 02:08:47,198
strangles from the back

3747
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:48,480
if you look at most tournaments in most

3748
02:08:47,198 --> 02:08:51,919
rule sets

3749
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:53,598
it has success across all rule sets um

3750
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:56,480
all weight divisions

3751
02:08:53,599 --> 02:08:59,360
all body types it doesn't require any

3752
02:08:56,479 --> 02:09:00,718
kind of specific physical advantage such

3753
02:08:59,359 --> 02:09:03,039
as height

3754
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:05,039
in order to be effective

3755
02:09:03,039 --> 02:09:07,519
it works equally well in both fighting

3756
02:09:05,039 --> 02:09:09,760
and grappling um

3757
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:11,199
it will work regardless of how

3758
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:14,079
physically and mentally tough your

3759
02:09:11,198 --> 02:09:16,319
opponent is okay a heel hook is a very

3760
02:09:14,078 --> 02:09:19,359
high percentage technique in in modern

3761
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:20,960
day competition but if your opponent

3762
02:09:19,359 --> 02:09:22,960
simply makes up his mind that he's not

3763
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:24,399
going to tap and is willing to take the

3764
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:27,439
physical damage

3765
02:09:24,399 --> 02:09:29,039
it won't result in the end of a match uh

3766
02:09:27,439 --> 02:09:30,638
a stranglehold by

3767
02:09:29,039 --> 02:09:32,639
contrast will always end the match

3768
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:33,679
regardless of your opponent's mental

3769
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:34,560
toughness

3770
02:09:33,679 --> 02:09:37,199
so

3771
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:38,800
um i believe it's fair to say that at

3772
02:09:37,198 --> 02:09:40,559
the end of the day the single most high

3773
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:42,719
percentage

3774
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:44,400
method of uh submitting people and

3775
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:45,760
grappling is a rare naked strength so

3776
02:09:44,399 --> 02:09:48,238
when you look at an athlete maybe gordon

3777
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:50,320
you can speak to this like what

3778
02:09:48,238 --> 02:09:51,678
what's the best uh you mentioned gary

3779
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:53,840
with the guillotine

3780
02:09:51,679 --> 02:09:56,399
what's the best submission to really

3781
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:58,000
invest in is it the rear nicky choke

3782
02:09:56,399 --> 02:09:59,598
to really invest your development like

3783
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:01,840
understanding the entirety of the system

3784
02:09:59,599 --> 02:10:03,279
that leads into that

3785
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:04,800
i think that i mean you have to do them

3786
02:10:03,279 --> 02:10:06,800
all obviously but if i had like one

3787
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:08,000
submission that i would only one

3788
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:09,199
submission i could pick for the rest of

3789
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,560
my life it would definitely be a rear

3790
02:10:09,198 --> 02:10:13,678
naked

3791
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:16,159
can you explain maybe some of the actual

3792
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:18,399
technical details of why that's the case

3793
02:10:16,158 --> 02:10:20,638
well as john spoke about they're

3794
02:10:18,399 --> 02:10:22,960
different in joint locks whereas

3795
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:24,639
you don't have to tap you can just let

3796
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:27,599
your leg break and then keep going with

3797
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:29,359
the strangle there's there's no uh

3798
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:31,199
there's none of that um and then it's

3799
02:10:29,359 --> 02:10:33,679
just an inherent

3800
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:35,519
advantage you have being behind someone

3801
02:10:33,679 --> 02:10:37,039
um whereas if you go for an armbar you

3802
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:38,239
stop you start from top mount and you're

3803
02:10:37,039 --> 02:10:40,158
facing the guy and then you put them

3804
02:10:38,238 --> 02:10:42,158
down and you're not directly behind them

3805
02:10:40,158 --> 02:10:43,759
with leg locks you're facing the guy

3806
02:10:42,158 --> 02:10:45,598
whereas when you're on someone's back

3807
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:47,199
you have them in a pin where you can

3808
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:48,719
your chest to back you have a body

3809
02:10:47,198 --> 02:10:50,559
triangle and you you're pinning the guy

3810
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:52,480
in place you can't explode out he can't

3811
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:53,920
grease his way out most of the time

3812
02:10:52,479 --> 02:10:55,678
and there's an inherent advantage you

3813
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:58,319
have being behind them due to the fact

3814
02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:59,920
that we're poorly set up to deal with

3815
02:10:58,319 --> 02:11:02,158
threats behind us

3816
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:04,078
so would you say that's the most

3817
02:11:02,158 --> 02:11:05,519
dominant position jiu jitsu like more

3818
02:11:04,078 --> 02:11:06,960
than mount

3819
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:09,360
more than yeah

3820
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:12,000
side control more than i think uh if you

3821
02:11:09,359 --> 02:11:14,078
look at most matches historically

3822
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:15,599
most guys who get stuck in positions for

3823
02:11:14,078 --> 02:11:18,319
long amounts of time are guys that

3824
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:20,000
they're back taken um if you get

3825
02:11:18,319 --> 02:11:21,840
an explosive guy from bottom mountain he

3826
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,198
can bridge and he can off bound to you

3827
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:25,119
and lock half guard maybe and then work

3828
02:11:23,198 --> 02:11:26,879
back to guard but someone locks a body

3829
02:11:25,118 --> 02:11:28,719
triangle on your back that's where you

3830
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:31,199
see most guys getting pinned in place

3831
02:11:28,719 --> 02:11:33,920
for long amounts of time

3832
02:11:31,198 --> 02:11:36,078
was uh was the body triangle like a well

3833
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:38,078
understood thing

3834
02:11:36,078 --> 02:11:41,599
was that an invention at some point like

3835
02:11:38,078 --> 02:11:43,118
it's just as a system as a as a um

3836
02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:45,039
perhaps some of your your listeners can

3837
02:11:43,118 --> 02:11:46,960
correct me on this but i believe there

3838
02:11:45,039 --> 02:11:50,319
was a technique banned in judo called

3839
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:51,840
doji main which involved crossing feet

3840
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:53,759
or locking a triangle around the

3841
02:11:51,840 --> 02:11:57,279
abdominals from the back and it was

3842
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:59,920
banned in judo i believe because

3843
02:11:57,279 --> 02:12:02,238
of intestinal injuries which occurred in

3844
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:03,440
the early developmental days of of of

3845
02:12:02,238 --> 02:12:04,559
judo

3846
02:12:03,439 --> 02:12:06,879
and

3847
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:09,039
in the modern era when i first began

3848
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:10,800
jujitsu body triangles were relatively

3849
02:12:09,039 --> 02:12:11,760
rare they were not a standard part of

3850
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:12,800
class

3851
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:15,760
um

3852
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:18,239
and sometime around the late 1990s early

3853
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:20,719
2000s people started to realize hey this

3854
02:12:18,238 --> 02:12:21,839
is a stronger method of control

3855
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:23,039
um

3856
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:25,039
it

3857
02:12:23,039 --> 02:12:26,319
it greatly increases the amount of

3858
02:12:25,039 --> 02:12:28,639
control you have of your of your

3859
02:12:26,319 --> 02:12:29,679
opponent's hips and torso over regular

3860
02:12:28,639 --> 02:12:31,760
hooks

3861
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:33,760
uh it's not for all athletes it's

3862
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:36,320
difficult for most people who are of

3863
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:37,119
shorter thicker statue

3864
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:39,039
to

3865
02:12:37,118 --> 02:12:40,960
employ on on on big people if your

3866
02:12:39,039 --> 02:12:42,639
opponent is very broadly built through

3867
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:43,840
the stomach it's almost impossible to

3868
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:46,078
apply

3869
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:48,000
and so because it can't be applied by

3870
02:12:46,078 --> 02:12:50,000
all people it tends not to be taught

3871
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,118
much at beginner level

3872
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:54,960
and

3873
02:12:51,118 --> 02:12:57,439
so as a result it was always seen as a

3874
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:59,118
kind of a specialist move for taller

3875
02:12:57,439 --> 02:13:00,799
athletes at a higher level of

3876
02:12:59,118 --> 02:13:03,359
competition rather than a broad-based

3877
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:05,599
move for everyone or every body type in

3878
02:13:03,359 --> 02:13:07,439
every class to employ so it just didn't

3879
02:13:05,599 --> 02:13:10,159
get emphasized that much but in top

3880
02:13:07,439 --> 02:13:12,158
level competition now i think you would

3881
02:13:10,158 --> 02:13:13,920
see that it's very apparent that the

3882
02:13:12,158 --> 02:13:16,238
vast majority of athletes whenever they

3883
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:19,440
have the opportunity or a choice between

3884
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:20,959
body triangle and regular rear mounts

3885
02:13:19,439 --> 02:13:22,638
the majority of modern athletes would

3886
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:24,158
choose a body triangle

3887
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:25,920
so we also had this conversation about

3888
02:13:24,158 --> 02:13:28,319
wrestling and maybe george you can

3889
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:29,840
comment on like what's the uh the

3890
02:13:28,319 --> 02:13:31,599
highest percentage

3891
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:32,960
not statistically speaking perhaps

3892
02:13:31,599 --> 02:13:34,639
that's also interesting as john talked

3893
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:37,118
about but just for you

3894
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:39,440
in terms of mastery of the takedown

3895
02:13:37,118 --> 02:13:41,198
what's what's the best way to take down

3896
02:13:39,439 --> 02:13:43,198
a human being

3897
02:13:41,198 --> 02:13:45,919
in wrestling well i i

3898
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:47,678
personally for me it depends

3899
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:50,560
for every fighter are different they

3900
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:51,679
they have a different set of skill

3901
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:54,159
for me i

3902
02:13:51,679 --> 02:13:56,000
when i look someone

3903
02:13:54,158 --> 02:13:58,960
want to bring down a tree

3904
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:01,198
a big strong high tree

3905
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:01,920
he cut it from the base

3906
02:14:01,198 --> 02:14:04,319
so

3907
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:07,359
the legs that that's what we stand

3908
02:14:04,319 --> 02:14:09,198
on so it was to attack the leg but is it

3909
02:14:07,359 --> 02:14:12,158
single leg double leg is it we talked

3910
02:14:09,198 --> 02:14:14,000
about like uh well there's also the the

3911
02:14:12,158 --> 02:14:15,519
john smith low single

3912
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,158
actually i don't even know if that's

3913
02:14:15,520 --> 02:14:19,920
applicable for jiu jitsu at all

3914
02:14:18,158 --> 02:14:22,238
you can use it but it runs the problem

3915
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:25,279
with submission halls yeah it's it's not

3916
02:14:22,238 --> 02:14:26,799
impossible to use but without shoes and

3917
02:14:25,279 --> 02:14:28,399
in a situation where there's a whole

3918
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:30,880
plethora of submission holds in the

3919
02:14:28,399 --> 02:14:32,479
scoring that

3920
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:33,679
it's a little more difficult to use you

3921
02:14:32,479 --> 02:14:36,158
know

3922
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:37,920
it is interesting something being a high

3923
02:14:36,158 --> 02:14:39,920
percentage in terms of effectiveness

3924
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:41,679
tells a story you're saying that every

3925
02:14:39,920 --> 02:14:44,800
athlete is different but

3926
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:46,319
if it's more effective for most people

3927
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:48,239
i mean it's interesting it's it's

3928
02:14:46,319 --> 02:14:49,198
interesting what john talked about is

3929
02:14:48,238 --> 02:14:51,279
that

3930
02:14:49,198 --> 02:14:53,359
the highest percentage thing

3931
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:54,719
is actually

3932
02:14:53,359 --> 02:14:56,238
in collegial wrestling that he was

3933
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:58,719
talking about is

3934
02:14:56,238 --> 02:15:00,799
on the defensive side so blocking your

3935
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:02,480
takedown and spinning around to the to

3936
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:05,199
the back

3937
02:15:02,479 --> 02:15:07,039
so that's an interesting idea then also

3938
02:15:05,198 --> 02:15:08,960
there's all of these kind of going in

3939
02:15:07,039 --> 02:15:10,158
for a single and switching to a double

3940
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:12,239
or

3941
02:15:10,158 --> 02:15:13,920
wizard position and doing knee tap like

3942
02:15:12,238 --> 02:15:16,238
there's all these kinds of combinations

3943
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:18,158
that seem to be effective when you look

3944
02:15:16,238 --> 02:15:19,919
at the statistics and it seems like

3945
02:15:18,158 --> 02:15:22,399
there's maybe it's a scientific way of

3946
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:24,960
thinking but it seems like there is some

3947
02:15:22,399 --> 02:15:27,359
conclusion to be drawn there oh yeah i

3948
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:29,279
believe you need to the high percentage

3949
02:15:27,359 --> 02:15:30,639
move there's a reason why it works i

3950
02:15:29,279 --> 02:15:31,840
think it's

3951
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:35,039
it's made

3952
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:37,599
for a bigger amount of people um

3953
02:15:35,039 --> 02:15:38,800
for example i i one of my main

3954
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:40,400
strength

3955
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:43,119
uh athletic strength is i'm i'm an

3956
02:15:40,399 --> 02:15:45,439
explosive person so i'll use technique

3957
02:15:43,118 --> 02:15:47,679
that are explosive if i get a single leg

3958
02:15:45,439 --> 02:15:50,799
my my one of my thing i like to do is to

3959
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:51,840
go for the double power double but for

3960
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:54,320
uh

3961
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:57,039
someone else who got for example in a

3962
02:15:54,319 --> 02:15:59,439
single leg position maybe he likes

3963
02:15:57,039 --> 02:16:01,599
like body true better he's more a greco

3964
02:15:59,439 --> 02:16:04,479
guy like so he or he's a judo guy he's

3965
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:06,800
going to go for some something else so

3966
02:16:04,479 --> 02:16:08,879
but there is move that are i would say

3967
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:11,760
like you just mentioned are universal

3968
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:13,760
like statistically speaking they're

3969
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:15,760
the highest percentage move that works

3970
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:18,880
for pretty much everybody everybody

3971
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:20,560
pretty much can do a an adequate jimmy

3972
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:22,719
you know it's very easy

3973
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:25,679
but it's not everybody that can lock a

3974
02:16:22,719 --> 02:16:28,078
triangle with their legs so

3975
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:30,639
so those move like a rear naked choke a

3976
02:16:28,078 --> 02:16:33,679
dakajimi is the highest percentage move

3977
02:16:30,639 --> 02:16:35,760
because it's maybe more accessible

3978
02:16:33,679 --> 02:16:37,439
it's accessible for a bigger range yeah

3979
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:39,120
based on the physical characteristics of

3980
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:41,679
the people do you draw in your wisdom

3981
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:44,479
from these high percentages john uh for

3982
02:16:41,679 --> 02:16:46,960
like in terms of what to focus on yeah

3983
02:16:44,478 --> 02:16:49,920
absolutely um jiu jitsu has an ocean of

3984
02:16:46,959 --> 02:16:51,759
moves and you can get lost on that ocean

3985
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:53,679
you can drift for a long period of time

3986
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:56,398
and and end up with very little to show

3987
02:16:53,679 --> 02:16:58,159
for it so my whole thing is focus we

3988
02:16:56,398 --> 02:17:00,079
only live one lifetime

3989
02:16:58,159 --> 02:17:02,239
and your training lifetime is even

3990
02:17:00,079 --> 02:17:03,120
shorter than your actual lifetime

3991
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:04,638
so

3992
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:07,679
in that time

3993
02:17:04,638 --> 02:17:09,518
i must die on the mat

3994
02:17:07,679 --> 02:17:10,398
that's just the same

3995
02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:13,760
um

3996
02:17:10,398 --> 02:17:15,679
uh i i put a very high

3997
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:17,599
value on

3998
02:17:15,679 --> 02:17:20,000
choosing what i believe to be the most

3999
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:22,159
high percentage

4000
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:24,318
moves and putting an extraordinary

4001
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:26,398
amount of focus on them

4002
02:17:24,318 --> 02:17:27,920
the only problem is that in one

4003
02:17:26,398 --> 02:17:29,679
generation a move which can be

4004
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:31,359
considered low percentage might actually

4005
02:17:29,679 --> 02:17:33,760
turn out to be high percentage in

4006
02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:35,679
another generation for example we talked

4007
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:36,960
earlier about leg locks when i was first

4008
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:40,159
started you said they were considered

4009
02:17:36,959 --> 02:17:41,839
the ultimate low percentage move and

4010
02:17:40,159 --> 02:17:43,920
a big part of my career has been

4011
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:45,760
convincing people that in fact that was

4012
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:47,679
that was incorrect that they can be a

4013
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:49,359
high percentage move if we just change

4014
02:17:47,679 --> 02:17:50,398
our approach to them

4015
02:17:49,359 --> 02:17:52,079
um

4016
02:17:50,398 --> 02:17:53,760
so we can't just

4017
02:17:52,079 --> 02:17:55,359
follow tradition

4018
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:57,120
and say oh this is low percentage this

4019
02:17:55,359 --> 02:17:58,079
is a high percentage it has to be part

4020
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:00,719
of

4021
02:17:58,079 --> 02:18:02,398
a fairly systematic study where you

4022
02:18:00,718 --> 02:18:05,119
investigate

4023
02:18:02,398 --> 02:18:07,439
what are the reasons why it's high

4024
02:18:05,120 --> 02:18:09,120
percentage or low percentage with

4025
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:11,120
regards to takedowns

4026
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:13,280
if you look at what

4027
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:15,280
we can consider the most high percentage

4028
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:16,960
takedowns if you're in front of someone

4029
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:18,319
the single most high percentage way of

4030
02:18:16,959 --> 02:18:19,518
taking them down is to get a hold of

4031
02:18:18,318 --> 02:18:20,879
both of their legs and push them

4032
02:18:19,519 --> 02:18:22,398
backwards

4033
02:18:20,879 --> 02:18:24,558
okay if you get a hold of one of their

4034
02:18:22,398 --> 02:18:26,079
legs and put a force on them they can

4035
02:18:24,558 --> 02:18:28,159
use their other leg to defend themselves

4036
02:18:26,079 --> 02:18:29,439
and hop around and funk their way out of

4037
02:18:28,159 --> 02:18:31,280
takedowns and cause all kinds of

4038
02:18:29,439 --> 02:18:32,800
problems for you i don't care how

4039
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:34,639
athletic your opponent is if you get a

4040
02:18:32,799 --> 02:18:36,239
hold of firm grip

4041
02:18:34,638 --> 02:18:37,679
of both of his legs and start pushing

4042
02:18:36,239 --> 02:18:38,478
him backwards he's going to fall down to

4043
02:18:37,679 --> 02:18:39,840
his butt

4044
02:18:38,478 --> 02:18:42,398
now he might be able to recover from

4045
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:44,478
there but he will fall down

4046
02:18:42,398 --> 02:18:45,519
even easier than that is to be behind

4047
02:18:44,478 --> 02:18:47,199
someone

4048
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:49,200
take downs for in front of someone are

4049
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:51,359
difficult you go right into their hips

4050
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:52,719
their head their hands you go into all

4051
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:55,120
their defensive weapons if you're

4052
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:57,039
already behind someone and you're doing

4053
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:59,760
what in america they refer to as a matt

4054
02:18:57,040 --> 02:19:01,920
return this is significantly easier than

4055
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:03,679
taking someone down from the front

4056
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:06,159
if you have control of their head in a

4057
02:19:03,679 --> 02:19:08,000
front headlock position

4058
02:19:06,159 --> 02:19:09,599
you've already closed distance on your

4059
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,718
opponent you already have close contact

4060
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:12,719
you don't have to worry about shooting

4061
02:19:10,718 --> 02:19:13,518
anymore there's no sprawl out of that

4062
02:19:12,718 --> 02:19:15,598
you don't have to worry about

4063
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:17,200
guillotines kimuras or the

4064
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:19,439
standard defenses those will

4065
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:21,280
intrinsically be easier takedowns out of

4066
02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:23,040
front headlock and so if we're going to

4067
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:25,359
talk about high percentage technique i

4068
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:27,120
always go back to the mechanics of it

4069
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:29,439
rather than just historical tradition

4070
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:32,000
because historical tradition can be

4071
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:34,239
wrong it was wrong about leglocks it

4072
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,000
could be wrong about other things too so

4073
02:19:34,239 --> 02:19:37,920
my primary thing is okay talk to me

4074
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:39,040
about mechanics

4075
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:40,318
that's what ultimately is going to

4076
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:42,800
determine whether something is high

4077
02:19:40,318 --> 02:19:44,159
percentage or not um

4078
02:19:42,799 --> 02:19:45,920
gordon pointed out earlier that when

4079
02:19:44,159 --> 02:19:47,519
you're behind someone you have innate

4080
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:48,398
physical advantages over the other guy

4081
02:19:47,519 --> 02:19:51,439
the human

4082
02:19:48,398 --> 02:19:53,519
the human body is set up entirely to

4083
02:19:51,439 --> 02:19:56,079
defend threats from the front

4084
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:57,920
we are poorly adapted to defending

4085
02:19:56,079 --> 02:19:59,359
threats from the rear we don't have eyes

4086
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:01,040
in the back of our head we can't apply

4087
02:19:59,359 --> 02:20:03,600
pushing strength backwards

4088
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:05,280
if you get behind someone take downs are

4089
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:06,399
ten times easier from behind someone

4090
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:07,439
than they are when you're in front of

4091
02:20:06,398 --> 02:20:09,039
someone

4092
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:10,880
if you have to take someone down from

4093
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:11,760
the front get a hold of both of their

4094
02:20:10,879 --> 02:20:12,959
legs

4095
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:14,719
if you can get a hold of both of the

4096
02:20:12,959 --> 02:20:18,239
legs and a part of pushing force you

4097
02:20:14,719 --> 02:20:18,239
will almost always knock them down

4098
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:23,359
if you can get a hold of their head

4099
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:25,200
and work take downs from there again

4100
02:20:23,359 --> 02:20:27,359
it's much easier because most of the

4101
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:29,040
defensive apparatus has been taken away

4102
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:31,040
from them before the takedown even

4103
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:32,399
begins and so

4104
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:34,640
for me the most high percentage

4105
02:20:32,398 --> 02:20:37,199
takedowns will always be from the front

4106
02:20:34,639 --> 02:20:38,879
double legs from any takedown from the

4107
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:40,880
back is going to be significantly easier

4108
02:20:38,879 --> 02:20:42,799
than any takedown from the front so all

4109
02:20:40,879 --> 02:20:45,759
manner of mat return takedowns are going

4110
02:20:42,799 --> 02:20:47,599
to be very high percentage

4111
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:49,280
and takedowns done out of situations

4112
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:50,720
where the opponent is broken down in

4113
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:52,800
front of you and you have either front

4114
02:20:50,719 --> 02:20:54,239
headlock or front chest right position

4115
02:20:52,799 --> 02:20:56,398
are going to be significantly easier

4116
02:20:54,239 --> 02:20:57,439
than takedowns from the open

4117
02:20:56,398 --> 02:21:00,000
of course

4118
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:01,840
you have to consider the full

4119
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:04,398
spectrum of mechanics involved here it's

4120
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:06,079
possible that an outside low single

4121
02:21:04,398 --> 02:21:08,398
leading to a double leg is much higher

4122
02:21:06,079 --> 02:21:10,559
percentage it's like there's a lot of

4123
02:21:08,398 --> 02:21:12,559
chain wrestling yet you know that needs

4124
02:21:10,559 --> 02:21:14,000
to be considered as a possibility maybe

4125
02:21:12,559 --> 02:21:15,279
a straight-on double and part of this

4126
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,040
cultural too

4127
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:18,800
are people afraid of this kind of thing

4128
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:21,680
that they came to be the case with

4129
02:21:18,799 --> 02:21:23,358
leglocks are people aware of this

4130
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:25,520
are they worried about this are they

4131
02:21:23,359 --> 02:21:28,159
training for this to defend this

4132
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:29,359
and then his opponent specific of course

4133
02:21:28,159 --> 02:21:30,799
that um

4134
02:21:29,359 --> 02:21:32,318
you know with jordan barros people are

4135
02:21:30,799 --> 02:21:34,799
preparing for the double which is why he

4136
02:21:32,318 --> 02:21:36,879
had to develop

4137
02:21:34,799 --> 02:21:38,559
a whole other kinds of different stuff

4138
02:21:36,879 --> 02:21:40,478
and then the head to all the different

4139
02:21:38,559 --> 02:21:42,398
controls all the different ties

4140
02:21:40,478 --> 02:21:43,920
within the rule set

4141
02:21:42,398 --> 02:21:46,079
and that's where it's so fascinating to

4142
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:49,600
see the effect of rule set and all this

4143
02:21:46,079 --> 02:21:52,000
judo over the past i think 20 years went

4144
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:53,280
through this every olympics different

4145
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:55,200
changes to the rule set like

4146
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:56,720
fundamentally different in terms of

4147
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:58,319
what's allowed to grip whether you're

4148
02:21:56,719 --> 02:22:01,920
allowed to touch the legs at all that

4149
02:21:58,318 --> 02:22:03,199
was a big one in 2012 i think

4150
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:05,359
and and that changes the sport

4151
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:07,760
completely and so interesting it's so

4152
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:10,239
interesting to watch how tiny change in

4153
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:12,079
the rule can change in sport

4154
02:22:10,239 --> 02:22:14,559
at the highest when you're talking about

4155
02:22:12,079 --> 02:22:18,000
people competing at the highest level

4156
02:22:14,559 --> 02:22:19,840
and the cool thing there is

4157
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:21,520
the rule change happens on a scale of

4158
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:23,920
every four years

4159
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:25,439
so you get to see people that are at the

4160
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:27,840
top of their game

4161
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:28,880
have to like recompute

4162
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:30,079
so it's not like you have a new

4163
02:22:28,879 --> 02:22:31,679
generation of people coming up with the

4164
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:33,840
rules they have to figure oh [ __ ] you're

4165
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:35,439
not allowed to like it's it's the

4166
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:37,680
equivalent of saying you're not allowed

4167
02:22:35,439 --> 02:22:39,439
to kick anymore in mma

4168
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:41,359
because you were not allowed to grab

4169
02:22:39,439 --> 02:22:44,318
legs anymore in judo

4170
02:22:41,359 --> 02:22:45,840
interestingly if you look at the

4171
02:22:44,318 --> 02:22:48,478
case of judo

4172
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:51,040
if you look at the world rankings

4173
02:22:48,478 --> 02:22:53,760
of athletes when they went through one

4174
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:56,319
of the most significant rule changes in

4175
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:58,639
judo history where they banned any form

4176
02:22:56,318 --> 02:23:01,119
of grabbing the legs

4177
02:22:58,639 --> 02:23:02,639
the ranking of athletes didn't change

4178
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:04,560
much

4179
02:23:02,639 --> 02:23:06,000
yeah that tells you that they're um

4180
02:23:04,559 --> 02:23:08,159
there's a reason why those guys are at

4181
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:10,559
the top yeah and it doesn't have to do

4182
02:23:08,159 --> 02:23:13,200
that they're specific to a rule set

4183
02:23:10,559 --> 02:23:14,959
yeah think about that in terms of

4184
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:17,120
imagine for example in mixed martial

4185
02:23:14,959 --> 02:23:18,879
arts if they just said hey

4186
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:20,240
starting next week

4187
02:23:18,879 --> 02:23:22,000
instead of having three five minute

4188
02:23:20,239 --> 02:23:23,199
rounds it's going to be 15 minutes

4189
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:25,280
straight

4190
02:23:23,200 --> 02:23:27,680
that would massively change the

4191
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:29,280
preparation of the athletes

4192
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:30,960
it's a different game at that point and

4193
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:33,760
judo literally was a different game

4194
02:23:30,959 --> 02:23:35,199
before 2010 and after 2010

4195
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:37,439
and yet

4196
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:39,439
the international rankings didn't really

4197
02:23:37,439 --> 02:23:40,800
change that much the countries that were

4198
02:23:39,439 --> 02:23:42,880
dominant before

4199
02:23:40,799 --> 02:23:46,719
remain dominant the athletes that

4200
02:23:42,879 --> 02:23:48,719
remained before largely remain the same

4201
02:23:46,719 --> 02:23:50,478
you would think with such a massive

4202
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:53,279
change all the rankings would have been

4203
02:23:50,478 --> 02:23:55,920
thrown upside down but they weren't and

4204
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:58,000
uh again it goes back to this idea that

4205
02:23:55,920 --> 02:24:00,079
there's a reason why the guys at the top

4206
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:01,280
are at the top

4207
02:24:00,079 --> 02:24:04,079
and now for something completely

4208
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:06,960
different we talked about aliens earlier

4209
02:24:04,079 --> 02:24:08,239
say uh george brought up bob lazar i i

4210
02:24:06,959 --> 02:24:10,079
um

4211
02:24:08,239 --> 02:24:11,510
we'll likely probably talk to bob lazar

4212
02:24:10,079 --> 02:24:13,120
on this podcast and then

4213
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:15,680
[Music]

4214
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:18,240
and then john had a skeptical look on

4215
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:20,800
his face about about aliens so let me

4216
02:24:18,239 --> 02:24:23,039
ask uh john and gordon

4217
02:24:20,799 --> 02:24:24,799
uh do you think there's intelligent

4218
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:27,920
alien civilizations out there in the

4219
02:24:24,799 --> 02:24:31,519
universe outside of our own the universe

4220
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:34,559
is unimaginably large the idea that we

4221
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:35,840
are the only life forms in a cosmos as

4222
02:24:34,559 --> 02:24:37,840
large as this

4223
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:39,920
is

4224
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:41,840
i think naive and foolish

4225
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:43,760
um

4226
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:46,478
there's a very high likelihood that if

4227
02:24:43,760 --> 02:24:48,478
life could evolve on this planet that it

4228
02:24:46,478 --> 02:24:50,639
could have done so on many many other

4229
02:24:48,478 --> 02:24:53,599
planets around the uh around the

4230
02:24:50,639 --> 02:24:55,279
consoles i think anyone who puts even a

4231
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:56,559
moment's thought into this would realize

4232
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:58,640
that there's

4233
02:24:56,559 --> 02:24:59,760
almost certainly other forms of life out

4234
02:24:58,639 --> 02:25:02,639
there

4235
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:05,200
the real question with regards the alien

4236
02:25:02,639 --> 02:25:07,439
community is um have they got here and

4237
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:10,479
are they surfing our planet

4238
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:12,398
in um little silver sources and making

4239
02:25:10,478 --> 02:25:13,358
observations and periodically stealing

4240
02:25:12,398 --> 02:25:15,199
people

4241
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:16,960
for experimentation purposes doesn't

4242
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:19,840
have to be silver saucers it could be

4243
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:21,839
different other color saucers um and

4244
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:26,159
that question i'm i'm i'm not all

4245
02:25:21,840 --> 02:25:27,200
convinced no i didn't recently um navy

4246
02:25:26,159 --> 02:25:29,200
footage

4247
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:31,359
has come out showing

4248
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:33,760
some very interesting phenomena if you

4249
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:36,079
talk to almost any experienced pilot

4250
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:38,079
they will tell you they've seen things

4251
02:25:36,079 --> 02:25:40,159
in the upper atmosphere that are very

4252
02:25:38,079 --> 02:25:41,520
difficult to explain uh i'll be the

4253
02:25:40,159 --> 02:25:42,959
first one to agree with you on this

4254
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:44,640
there are some things out there that are

4255
02:25:42,959 --> 02:25:48,000
extremely difficult to explain like

4256
02:25:44,639 --> 02:25:49,680
literally ufos unidentified yeah i mean

4257
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,318
we just don't know what they are but to

4258
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:55,040
go from the idea that there's things out

4259
02:25:52,318 --> 02:25:56,159
there that we don't understand to

4260
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,120
this

4261
02:25:56,159 --> 02:25:59,920
like

4262
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:01,760
little creatures running around and um

4263
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:02,879
and these somehow exist

4264
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:05,439
uh

4265
02:26:02,879 --> 02:26:06,959
i just reserve judgment i just say i'm

4266
02:26:05,439 --> 02:26:08,960
agnostic about these things i think it's

4267
02:26:06,959 --> 02:26:10,719
possible but

4268
02:26:08,959 --> 02:26:12,959
all the evidence that i've been shown so

4269
02:26:10,719 --> 02:26:15,438
far was insufficient to come to any kind

4270
02:26:12,959 --> 02:26:18,318
of definite conclusions until

4271
02:26:15,439 --> 02:26:20,479
aliens land in central park on tuesday

4272
02:26:18,318 --> 02:26:22,398
afternoon at 3 p.m and get out with

4273
02:26:20,478 --> 02:26:24,398
little alien ray guns and start shooting

4274
02:26:22,398 --> 02:26:26,478
people i didn't believe in

4275
02:26:24,398 --> 02:26:28,478
many of the stories that get told

4276
02:26:26,478 --> 02:26:30,559
well what about if it's not little

4277
02:26:28,478 --> 02:26:32,639
aliens with ray guns but something very

4278
02:26:30,559 --> 02:26:35,119
different very very difficult to detect

4279
02:26:32,639 --> 02:26:36,959
for us humans that's very human

4280
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:39,120
at that point it's a it's a fascinating

4281
02:26:36,959 --> 02:26:41,759
idea and it's certainly possible but

4282
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:44,319
show me the evidence

4283
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:46,559
all right what about you gordon

4284
02:26:44,318 --> 02:26:49,920
do you do you uh look at the cosmos and

4285
02:26:46,559 --> 02:26:52,000
ponder the stars often i think it's fair

4286
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:53,200
points john raised

4287
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,799
something really interesting i saw the

4288
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:56,399
other day was uh

4289
02:26:54,799 --> 02:26:59,438
someone posted like

4290
02:26:56,398 --> 02:27:01,920
if an alien organ or civilization

4291
02:26:59,439 --> 02:27:03,760
65 million light years away somehow

4292
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:04,879
managed to look

4293
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:06,398
at earth

4294
02:27:04,879 --> 02:27:08,318
they would theoretically see the

4295
02:27:06,398 --> 02:27:10,159
dinosaurs because they're 65 million

4296
02:27:08,318 --> 02:27:11,119
light years away so like imagine us

4297
02:27:10,159 --> 02:27:12,559
looking at

4298
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:14,479
galaxies that are 100 million light

4299
02:27:12,559 --> 02:27:16,318
years away that's 100 million years ago

4300
02:27:14,478 --> 02:27:17,679
you have no idea what it looks like now

4301
02:27:16,318 --> 02:27:19,359
so that's what's super interesting to me

4302
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:22,079
about it

4303
02:27:19,359 --> 02:27:24,159
yeah the the expanse is huge

4304
02:27:22,079 --> 02:27:26,000
and so much cool stuff could be going

4305
02:27:24,159 --> 02:27:27,840
out there

4306
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:31,520
the scary thing of course is if they

4307
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:33,600
haven't visited us yet the

4308
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:35,920
there has to be a good reason for it

4309
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:38,079
and the the set of scary reasons of all

4310
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:39,760
the fact that they maybe once you get

4311
02:27:38,079 --> 02:27:41,760
sufficiently advanced in your

4312
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:43,280
development you destroy yourself

4313
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:44,800
naturally as humans seem to be

4314
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:46,319
approaching now

4315
02:27:44,799 --> 02:27:48,559
we more and more have the tools to

4316
02:27:46,318 --> 02:27:51,199
distort ourselves completely

4317
02:27:48,559 --> 02:27:52,959
in terms of our weapon systems

4318
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:54,399
um and we're developing them more and

4319
02:27:52,959 --> 02:27:55,358
more and they're becoming better and

4320
02:27:54,398 --> 02:27:56,959
better

4321
02:27:55,359 --> 02:27:59,040
and we're starting to get angry and

4322
02:27:56,959 --> 02:28:00,719
angry on twitter and instagram with each

4323
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:03,439
other

4324
02:28:00,719 --> 02:28:05,760
those are good points you're raising

4325
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:07,840
history has taught us that

4326
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:11,120
everything that lives one day will die

4327
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:12,880
so we will we will perish one day yeah

4328
02:28:11,120 --> 02:28:15,200
there's also just the the sheer

4329
02:28:12,879 --> 02:28:16,639
difficulty of um

4330
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:19,520
of

4331
02:28:16,639 --> 02:28:23,039
of travel through space like space is an

4332
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:27,399
unimaginably inhospitable environment

4333
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:27,399
and to the best of our knowledge

4334
02:28:27,439 --> 02:28:33,520
this even the theoretical speeds that we

4335
02:28:30,318 --> 02:28:34,879
can attain in space even if we could

4336
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:37,600
travel at the speed of light we're not

4337
02:28:34,879 --> 02:28:39,599
even remotely close to that

4338
02:28:37,600 --> 02:28:42,318
still the distances that need to be

4339
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:44,318
traveled to get to even relatively close

4340
02:28:42,318 --> 02:28:47,760
solar systems are

4341
02:28:44,318 --> 02:28:49,519
very very long if you look at astronauts

4342
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:52,239
who have spent significant amounts of

4343
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:54,479
time and space just orbiting the earth

4344
02:28:52,239 --> 02:28:56,000
it has severe health effects on them

4345
02:28:54,478 --> 02:28:57,199
which is not built for space we're

4346
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:59,760
supposed to be

4347
02:28:57,200 --> 02:29:01,760
in a gravitational environment but we

4348
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:04,159
you're referring to your biological mean

4349
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:06,478
bag that's containing the essence

4350
02:29:04,159 --> 02:29:08,398
of the mind that is john donahue maybe

4351
02:29:06,478 --> 02:29:11,840
we can transfer the mind

4352
02:29:08,398 --> 02:29:13,599
alone so the the the the bag the me the

4353
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:15,520
meat bag is not designed for space but

4354
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:17,439
maybe the game this is all confidence of

4355
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:19,600
the mind that's

4356
02:29:17,439 --> 02:29:21,760
that's possible but what do you think of

4357
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:24,000
concrete evidence you folks who like

4358
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:26,239
difficult things

4359
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,280
uh what do you think about elon musk

4360
02:29:26,239 --> 02:29:30,559
going to colonize mars

4361
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:32,880
is this something you find an

4362
02:29:30,559 --> 02:29:36,199
interesting or

4363
02:29:32,879 --> 02:29:36,199
a um

4364
02:29:36,318 --> 02:29:41,199
pursuit i think it's a must or a

4365
02:29:38,879 --> 02:29:43,199
salvation we need to leave at some point

4366
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:45,280
the planet because historically in the

4367
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:48,240
past we know that we've been bombarded

4368
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:50,159
by asteroid volcano

4369
02:29:48,239 --> 02:29:51,920
their crazy things happen here it's very

4370
02:29:50,159 --> 02:29:53,439
unstable you know we

4371
02:29:51,920 --> 02:29:55,520
if you look at it to

4372
02:29:53,439 --> 02:29:58,079
through a lifetime of a human being it's

4373
02:29:55,520 --> 02:30:00,399
nothing but just look 12 000 years ago

4374
02:29:58,079 --> 02:30:02,799
what happened you know so there is

4375
02:30:00,398 --> 02:30:04,398
cataclysm that happen all the time it's

4376
02:30:02,799 --> 02:30:06,478
very unstable so

4377
02:30:04,398 --> 02:30:09,119
if we want to survive as a species i

4378
02:30:06,478 --> 02:30:10,639
think it's it's we need to get out to be

4379
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:12,079
able to get out and

4380
02:30:10,639 --> 02:30:14,079
spread our seed

4381
02:30:12,079 --> 02:30:15,439
so these are the early steps on on a

4382
02:30:14,079 --> 02:30:18,239
really long journey but is there

4383
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:20,239
something about like

4384
02:30:18,239 --> 02:30:22,478
you know we don't get that exploration

4385
02:30:20,239 --> 02:30:23,680
from most modern society you know the

4386
02:30:22,478 --> 02:30:26,239
kind of exploring that people did

4387
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:27,520
throughout the centuries of uh you know

4388
02:30:26,239 --> 02:30:30,239
coming to the

4389
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:32,720
north america just throughout we were

4390
02:30:30,239 --> 02:30:34,239
shrouded in physical uncertainty of

4391
02:30:32,719 --> 02:30:35,920
what's out there

4392
02:30:34,239 --> 02:30:37,520
and now we get to do the same kind of

4393
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:40,159
exploration with mars

4394
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:41,760
is there so i mean is there any aspect

4395
02:30:40,159 --> 02:30:43,680
of you that wants to

4396
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:44,800
travel out to space that wants to travel

4397
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:45,680
to mars

4398
02:30:44,799 --> 02:30:47,519
there

4399
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:49,200
you know the goal is to allow civilians

4400
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:51,040
to travel

4401
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:53,040
perhaps in our lifetime

4402
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:54,800
meaning affordably you can do so now

4403
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:56,560
unaffordably

4404
02:30:54,799 --> 02:30:57,279
traveling to space and traveling to mars

4405
02:30:56,559 --> 02:30:58,639
are

4406
02:30:57,280 --> 02:31:00,720
two different things i think i would

4407
02:30:58,639 --> 02:31:02,559
like to travel into space

4408
02:31:00,719 --> 02:31:04,318
i don't know if i would like to travel

4409
02:31:02,559 --> 02:31:06,159
all the way to mars because of the risks

4410
02:31:04,318 --> 02:31:07,760
involved

4411
02:31:06,159 --> 02:31:08,879
just because

4412
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:10,559
boring

4413
02:31:08,879 --> 02:31:11,920
is there some part of you that enjoys i

4414
02:31:10,559 --> 02:31:13,600
think that if i was like towards the end

4415
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:15,520
of my life i would like to travel to

4416
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:16,960
mars because that's just just the

4417
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:18,079
experience yeah but if i go to mars i'm

4418
02:31:16,959 --> 02:31:19,519
not coming back

4419
02:31:18,079 --> 02:31:21,920
like that's it

4420
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:23,600
one-way ticket

4421
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:25,520
with the technology we have now maybe in

4422
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:27,600
the future maybe our

4423
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:30,880
the children of our children will will

4424
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:32,479
be able to to experience that to go to

4425
02:31:30,879 --> 02:31:34,000
well the the weekend

4426
02:31:32,478 --> 02:31:36,318
on mars

4427
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,239
uh well the whole design of the starship

4428
02:31:36,318 --> 02:31:40,239
that the spacex is working on is

4429
02:31:38,239 --> 02:31:42,079
supposed to come back

4430
02:31:40,239 --> 02:31:44,079
it's supposed to be reusable so it's not

4431
02:31:42,079 --> 02:31:46,159
it's not a one-way ticket that's the

4432
02:31:44,079 --> 02:31:47,840
whole point just it's always going back

4433
02:31:46,159 --> 02:31:51,280
and forth back and forth what's the time

4434
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:53,680
frame between two planets like to travel

4435
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:55,439
from i think the current thing you'd be

4436
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:56,639
stuck on mars for two years

4437
02:31:55,439 --> 02:31:58,720
but how long does it take to get from

4438
02:31:56,639 --> 02:32:00,079
earth to mars oh it's pretty

4439
02:31:58,719 --> 02:32:01,279
i'm not exactly sure but it's pretty

4440
02:32:00,079 --> 02:32:03,359
quick

4441
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:05,600
that's pretty quick like i don't know on

4442
02:32:03,359 --> 02:32:07,359
the scale of months not scale of years

4443
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:08,960
you might not be healthy when you come

4444
02:32:07,359 --> 02:32:11,120
back you know all the astronauts they

4445
02:32:08,959 --> 02:32:13,279
experience health issues you know they

4446
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:14,079
lose a lot of muscle mass bone density

4447
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:15,760
so

4448
02:32:14,079 --> 02:32:17,520
yeah i don't think the technology is

4449
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:19,439
good right now i mean

4450
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:22,560
let's say that if it is i would love to

4451
02:32:19,439 --> 02:32:24,639
be doing it for a weekend if it's safe i

4452
02:32:22,559 --> 02:32:26,799
will

4453
02:32:24,639 --> 02:32:29,119
or a professional fighter who sacrificed

4454
02:32:26,799 --> 02:32:31,679
his body for something so there's some

4455
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:33,120
sacrifice we do in life right i don't

4456
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:35,120
want to be there first i wouldn't want

4457
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:36,800
to i leave the other one but when i know

4458
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:38,479
it's it's safe

4459
02:32:36,799 --> 02:32:39,840
okay count me in so one of the things

4460
02:32:38,478 --> 02:32:41,199
that people say and this is something i

4461
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:42,880
wonder about is

4462
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:45,200
it's like having children or something

4463
02:32:42,879 --> 02:32:47,039
once you see once you're out in space

4464
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:48,800
and you look out and you see earth you

4465
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:50,960
look back at earth that's an experience

4466
02:32:48,799 --> 02:32:52,639
it's unlike anything else like you can't

4467
02:32:50,959 --> 02:32:55,519
replicate it here

4468
02:32:52,639 --> 02:32:56,799
um is is to look back at that like blue

4469
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:59,840
dot

4470
02:32:56,799 --> 02:32:59,840
and that's nerve-wracking

4471
02:33:00,799 --> 02:33:03,279
you see like earth disappear into the

4472
02:33:02,318 --> 02:33:06,000
distance

4473
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:07,439
yeah yeah disappear into the distance

4474
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,639
and then you get this actually stand on

4475
02:33:07,439 --> 02:33:10,398
mars and see

4476
02:33:08,639 --> 02:33:12,239
and just to look you're standing on the

4477
02:33:10,398 --> 02:33:13,760
ground and you're looking out

4478
02:33:12,239 --> 02:33:14,879
and you see the planet from which you

4479
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:16,719
came and

4480
02:33:14,879 --> 02:33:18,159
where you might not be coming back but

4481
02:33:16,719 --> 02:33:20,879
there's a challenge to the whole thing

4482
02:33:18,159 --> 02:33:21,680
whereas the risk is tremendous

4483
02:33:20,879 --> 02:33:23,519
and

4484
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:25,120
i don't know i find that risk really

4485
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:27,280
compelling for some reason but that

4486
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:29,040
could be just the exploration

4487
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:31,680
i guess that's a genetic thing too how

4488
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:33,439
much do you want to explore

4489
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:35,280
there's a sense though in which even in

4490
02:33:33,439 --> 02:33:37,840
the best case scenario where they did

4491
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:38,640
get the technology to whisk you to mars

4492
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:41,359
and

4493
02:33:38,639 --> 02:33:44,159
in a fairly short period of time

4494
02:33:41,359 --> 02:33:46,000
it's kind of an inauthentic sense of

4495
02:33:44,159 --> 02:33:49,039
exploration because

4496
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:51,040
your participation in it is

4497
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:53,680
no more exciting than

4498
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:56,160
your participation in an airline flight

4499
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:57,359
to a foreign country you basically

4500
02:33:56,159 --> 02:33:59,680
you didn't have anything to do with the

4501
02:33:57,359 --> 02:34:02,318
creation of the of the vessel you're not

4502
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:04,159
in command of the vessel you're not in

4503
02:34:02,318 --> 02:34:06,000
any way shape or form important to the

4504
02:34:04,159 --> 02:34:08,079
mission you're just the person sitting

4505
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,520
in a passenger seat and you get off in a

4506
02:34:08,079 --> 02:34:11,280
destination the same way you would if

4507
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:14,239
you flew to singapore or london or some

4508
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:15,840
place like that well there's a hierarchy

4509
02:34:14,239 --> 02:34:17,039
of there's a leadership and then there's

4510
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:19,040
a bunch of people and they all have

4511
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:21,520
roles you don't get to go to mars

4512
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:23,359
without having a skill set but

4513
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:25,200
you made it sound like space tourism

4514
02:34:23,359 --> 02:34:26,640
where you just pay a ticket i don't i

4515
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:28,960
think it's a long time before you have

4516
02:34:26,639 --> 02:34:30,799
space tourism to mars where you have

4517
02:34:28,959 --> 02:34:32,318
nothing to contribute

4518
02:34:30,799 --> 02:34:33,679
okay like you will have to what do you

4519
02:34:32,318 --> 02:34:35,359
do you go through like a training

4520
02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:36,880
program you go training program and then

4521
02:34:35,359 --> 02:34:38,399
there's uh there's technical things

4522
02:34:36,879 --> 02:34:39,358
you'll be contributing so there they

4523
02:34:38,398 --> 02:34:40,478
would bring

4524
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:42,239
people

4525
02:34:40,478 --> 02:34:43,920
you know in terms of agriculture i don't

4526
02:34:42,239 --> 02:34:45,520
know okay so this is this is better this

4527
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:47,520
sounds like they're actual they're more

4528
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:50,159
like explorers like if you you talked

4529
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:52,319
before about explorers and and human

4530
02:34:50,159 --> 02:34:53,920
history where magellan sets off on his

4531
02:34:52,318 --> 02:34:55,760
boat and every person on the boat had a

4532
02:34:53,920 --> 02:34:56,960
specific function they were they were

4533
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:58,719
all

4534
02:34:56,959 --> 02:35:00,318
into the mission in a very authentic

4535
02:34:58,719 --> 02:35:01,760
fashion if they weren't on the boat the

4536
02:35:00,318 --> 02:35:04,398
performance of the crew would somehow

4537
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:06,719
suffer so this sounds much better and

4538
02:35:04,398 --> 02:35:08,879
with just with like with magellan i

4539
02:35:06,719 --> 02:35:12,799
think most of the crew died

4540
02:35:08,879 --> 02:35:16,159
a significant number did yeah

4541
02:35:12,799 --> 02:35:18,079
and from uh yeah from bacteria i mean

4542
02:35:16,159 --> 02:35:20,719
from things that are unexpected and so

4543
02:35:18,079 --> 02:35:22,719
on and if we discover life on mars i

4544
02:35:20,719 --> 02:35:25,519
mean who knows what that entails because

4545
02:35:22,719 --> 02:35:27,358
that's like a manned mission to mars

4546
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:30,479
would likely be very driven by the

4547
02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:32,960
research to do all the kind of

4548
02:35:30,478 --> 02:35:35,119
exploration required to define life

4549
02:35:32,959 --> 02:35:37,358
now from

4550
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:39,439
mr musk's

4551
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:40,880
point of view as a developer presumably

4552
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:42,479
there has to be some kind of financial

4553
02:35:40,879 --> 02:35:43,679
incentive here too

4554
02:35:42,478 --> 02:35:46,398
is there

4555
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:48,800
some kind of financial benefit to mars

4556
02:35:46,398 --> 02:35:50,398
missions is

4557
02:35:48,799 --> 02:35:51,279
presumably

4558
02:35:50,398 --> 02:35:52,879
um

4559
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:54,720
there wouldn't be that many people on

4560
02:35:52,879 --> 02:35:56,478
earth that could afford a ticket to pay

4561
02:35:54,719 --> 02:35:58,318
for the kind of research and development

4562
02:35:56,478 --> 02:36:00,639
that would require this is there some

4563
02:35:58,318 --> 02:36:02,318
kind of mining on mars of minerals that

4564
02:36:00,639 --> 02:36:04,239
would be useless i think there's a lot

4565
02:36:02,318 --> 02:36:06,000
of answers to this but the only honest

4566
02:36:04,239 --> 02:36:07,520
answer is the one that looks back into

4567
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,280
human history where we did a lot of

4568
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:10,239
things just because we

4569
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:12,239
could

4570
02:36:10,239 --> 02:36:14,000
a lot of hard things just because we

4571
02:36:12,239 --> 02:36:15,920
could and that led to a lot of

4572
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:18,478
innovation that ultimately made our life

4573
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:19,840
better so this is more this is why you

4574
02:36:18,478 --> 02:36:21,679
have nasa this is why you have

4575
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:24,159
government organizations like what's the

4576
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:26,398
purpose of nasa nasa would answer that

4577
02:36:24,159 --> 02:36:28,719
by saying okay well we're helping

4578
02:36:26,398 --> 02:36:30,639
launch satellites up there all they'll

4579
02:36:28,719 --> 02:36:33,199
have a bunch of answers but the reality

4580
02:36:30,639 --> 02:36:34,159
is the programs

4581
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:36,800
were

4582
02:36:34,159 --> 02:36:38,639
funded in large part by our desire to

4583
02:36:36,799 --> 02:36:40,799
explore the unknown

4584
02:36:38,639 --> 02:36:42,719
and um there's some aspect to which we

4585
02:36:40,799 --> 02:36:44,639
have to all invest into that because

4586
02:36:42,719 --> 02:36:46,478
historically speaking

4587
02:36:44,639 --> 02:36:47,599
that has produced a lot of cool things

4588
02:36:46,478 --> 02:36:51,039
along the way they were totally

4589
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:54,640
unexpected like uh but nasa is funded by

4590
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:57,760
public funding the taxpayer uh how is mr

4591
02:36:54,639 --> 02:37:00,239
musk going to fund this well currently

4592
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:01,600
most of the funding was the spacex is

4593
02:37:00,239 --> 02:37:02,639
nasa giving

4594
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:06,159
money

4595
02:37:02,639 --> 02:37:08,799
uh to so they're making a competition

4596
02:37:06,159 --> 02:37:10,318
who can who can get our satellites we

4597
02:37:08,799 --> 02:37:11,599
need to go to

4598
02:37:10,318 --> 02:37:14,239
um

4599
02:37:11,600 --> 02:37:16,318
you know was for the space station to uh

4600
02:37:14,239 --> 02:37:18,239
resupply the space station or we need to

4601
02:37:16,318 --> 02:37:20,318
launch satellites up who's going to

4602
02:37:18,239 --> 02:37:22,079
carry those quote-unquote payloads they

4603
02:37:20,318 --> 02:37:23,439
just need so nasa is paying whoever the

4604
02:37:22,079 --> 02:37:24,959
heck wants to

4605
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:28,639
uh get

4606
02:37:24,959 --> 02:37:31,119
kilograms of thing up into space

4607
02:37:28,639 --> 02:37:33,119
why did this is nasa's specialty why did

4608
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:35,439
they just give up on that well they why

4609
02:37:33,120 --> 02:37:37,760
are they realizing where mr musk came

4610
02:37:35,439 --> 02:37:39,680
along and then bezos and others that

4611
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:41,359
said we can do it for one tenth the

4612
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:43,760
price

4613
02:37:41,359 --> 02:37:45,600
so why did the why should the taxpayers

4614
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:46,800
pay for the why don't you nasa do what

4615
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:48,800
you do well

4616
02:37:46,799 --> 02:37:50,879
which is like test out cutting edge

4617
02:37:48,799 --> 02:37:52,079
stuff make sure they're safe

4618
02:37:50,879 --> 02:37:54,559
and now

4619
02:37:52,079 --> 02:37:55,760
that we've developed

4620
02:37:54,559 --> 02:37:59,519
a car

4621
02:37:55,760 --> 02:38:01,120
let us let us ups and fedex take care of

4622
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:02,319
doing this at scale doing it cheaper

4623
02:38:01,120 --> 02:38:03,840
doing it better

4624
02:38:02,318 --> 02:38:05,760
i mean that's the argument

4625
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:08,318
and nasa took what they realized is it

4626
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:10,239
took way way too long to do stuff

4627
02:38:08,318 --> 02:38:12,799
when you're investing millions as

4628
02:38:10,239 --> 02:38:13,680
billions of dollars into a project

4629
02:38:12,799 --> 02:38:16,000
the

4630
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:17,920
the bureaucracy builds up

4631
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:19,760
and the conservatism builds up to where

4632
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:22,318
you're i mean you really have to test

4633
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:23,600
everything out so projects take years

4634
02:38:22,318 --> 02:38:26,079
and then you have somebody like elon

4635
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:27,520
musk coming along and says well let's do

4636
02:38:26,079 --> 02:38:28,879
launches every

4637
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:30,319
every week

4638
02:38:28,879 --> 02:38:32,239
and as opposed to

4639
02:38:30,318 --> 02:38:34,318
just throwing away the rocket will reuse

4640
02:38:32,239 --> 02:38:36,239
the rocket that was one of the sort of

4641
02:38:34,318 --> 02:38:39,119
cutting edge inventions

4642
02:38:36,239 --> 02:38:41,039
it's a dumb obvious idea

4643
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:42,800
like elon says why do you throw away the

4644
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:44,960
pla it's the equivalent as if you flew a

4645
02:38:42,799 --> 02:38:46,478
plane every time you threw it away why

4646
02:38:44,959 --> 02:38:48,559
are we every time throwing away the

4647
02:38:46,478 --> 02:38:49,840
plane but nasa's tried that kind of

4648
02:38:48,559 --> 02:38:52,318
thing with the space shuttle since the

4649
02:38:49,840 --> 02:38:54,478
1970s yes well they did that with the

4650
02:38:52,318 --> 02:38:56,639
space shuttle but not not at the scale

4651
02:38:54,478 --> 02:38:58,079
here that uh it was the space shuttle

4652
02:38:56,639 --> 02:39:01,039
was seen as this

4653
02:38:58,079 --> 02:39:03,200
like majestic amazing thing that

4654
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:05,359
requires a huge amount of investment but

4655
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:06,319
the elo musk is like no every basic

4656
02:39:05,359 --> 02:39:08,559
rocket

4657
02:39:06,318 --> 02:39:09,920
should be reusable

4658
02:39:08,559 --> 02:39:12,079
cut cost

4659
02:39:09,920 --> 02:39:13,840
do you do you think like

4660
02:39:12,079 --> 02:39:16,318
the more technology we have the more

4661
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:17,920
advanced we become the more specialized

4662
02:39:16,318 --> 02:39:19,519
we need to be like is that for that

4663
02:39:17,920 --> 02:39:21,439
reason that now they

4664
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:23,280
there is different branch like you just

4665
02:39:21,439 --> 02:39:25,359
explained now nowadays there's precise

4666
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:27,280
in this but they're left you know other

4667
02:39:25,359 --> 02:39:28,880
branch yeah there's there's greater and

4668
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:31,439
greater specialization as we build up

4669
02:39:28,879 --> 02:39:34,159
more stuff which is fascinating because

4670
02:39:31,439 --> 02:39:35,120
is is it making us

4671
02:39:34,159 --> 02:39:37,600
more

4672
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:39,680
dumb in a way do you think like

4673
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:41,120
like yeah i don't know like

4674
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:42,720
you you know

4675
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:44,560
i use a cell phone but i don't know how

4676
02:39:42,719 --> 02:39:46,478
to build it up from yeah

4677
02:39:44,559 --> 02:39:49,039
i mean it's that beta male is building

4678
02:39:46,478 --> 02:39:51,519
up this whole society um because we're

4679
02:39:49,040 --> 02:39:53,439
this collective intelligence we rely on

4680
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:54,399
each other more and more

4681
02:39:53,439 --> 02:39:55,280
and

4682
02:39:54,398 --> 02:39:57,039
it

4683
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:58,560
i do also see sort of the rise of

4684
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:01,840
conspiracy theories and all those kinds

4685
02:39:58,559 --> 02:40:03,600
of things because

4686
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:05,520
like i've been talking to a few folks

4687
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:06,559
about flat earth recently it's

4688
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:07,920
fascinating

4689
02:40:06,559 --> 02:40:09,119
it's fascinating there's a large

4690
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:11,520
community of people that believe the

4691
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:13,760
earth is flat and

4692
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:15,600
that idea takes hold in this day and age

4693
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:18,239
of all the ideas that's the one that

4694
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:19,680
takes hold for a large number of people

4695
02:40:18,239 --> 02:40:21,520
and

4696
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:23,279
i think that's the consequences this

4697
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:25,120
kind of specialization where it's just

4698
02:40:23,279 --> 02:40:27,439
huge amount of experts

4699
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:30,399
but if you look out into our world and

4700
02:40:27,439 --> 02:40:32,720
try to reason simply about our existence

4701
02:40:30,398 --> 02:40:33,760
we we are losing the skills to do that

4702
02:40:32,719 --> 02:40:35,760
because more and more people are

4703
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:38,398
specialized as opposed to general

4704
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:41,840
thinkers we're like extremely good at

4705
02:40:38,398 --> 02:40:45,358
specific things are we capable now to do

4706
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:47,359
uh a robot that is self-aware

4707
02:40:45,359 --> 02:40:49,439
that's that's one the legged one i need

4708
02:40:47,359 --> 02:40:50,960
uh it's self-aware like it's not

4709
02:40:49,439 --> 02:40:53,200
self-aware it's been listening but it's

4710
02:40:50,959 --> 02:40:56,000
it's not self-aware but do you think a

4711
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:57,359
human being is self-aware or that's a

4712
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:59,040
good question

4713
02:40:57,359 --> 02:41:03,840
i mean i ask this question all the time

4714
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:05,520
when the robots move there's a sense of

4715
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:07,840
when they turn on

4716
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:11,920
something entered that robot

4717
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:13,680
wow and when it turns off something left

4718
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:15,600
if they move in a certain kind of way

4719
02:41:13,680 --> 02:41:17,359
and if they're if they surprise you

4720
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:19,600
there's certain elements

4721
02:41:17,359 --> 02:41:21,760
that enable us

4722
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:24,079
to see the magic in

4723
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:26,719
in a living being and some of them i

4724
02:41:24,079 --> 02:41:27,520
mean we can character we can maybe list

4725
02:41:26,719 --> 02:41:30,239
them

4726
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:32,720
but it's the ability to surprise you

4727
02:41:30,239 --> 02:41:32,719
it's the

4728
02:41:32,879 --> 02:41:37,519
ability to make mistakes and learn from

4729
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:39,359
them visibly there's a bunch of things

4730
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:41,120
that you just

4731
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:43,040
i don't know it just feels

4732
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:46,000
like it has the magic of what is a

4733
02:41:43,040 --> 02:41:47,920
living being and which is what humans

4734
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:50,799
have and i try to think about how do you

4735
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:53,200
replicate that into a machine so so when

4736
02:41:50,799 --> 02:41:55,599
you turn it on enough you feel like it

4737
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:57,439
dies every time and it re reborn right

4738
02:41:55,600 --> 02:42:00,318
so for most machines we don't feel that

4739
02:41:57,439 --> 02:42:02,079
way we don't when we unplug things

4740
02:42:00,318 --> 02:42:03,760
we don't feel that way i don't know why

4741
02:42:02,079 --> 02:42:05,120
we don't feel that way that's an

4742
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:08,239
interesting question

4743
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:08,240
but i think when

4744
02:42:08,639 --> 02:42:13,840
when the robot has certain qualities

4745
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:16,879
like memory

4746
02:42:13,840 --> 02:42:18,159
like ability to recognize you

4747
02:42:16,879 --> 02:42:20,000
yeah you start to feel like you're

4748
02:42:18,159 --> 02:42:21,920
turning off an organism

4749
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:23,439
so so whenever i have like the robots

4750
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:24,719
that recognize me

4751
02:42:23,439 --> 02:42:27,200
and remember

4752
02:42:24,719 --> 02:42:29,119
this is important that all the things

4753
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:31,200
we've experienced together

4754
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:33,439
then it's like holy [ __ ]

4755
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:35,279
that's a that's a living thing but does

4756
02:42:33,439 --> 02:42:36,880
he really feels it feels like a living

4757
02:42:35,279 --> 02:42:39,279
thing does he remember

4758
02:42:36,879 --> 02:42:42,239
your robot does he remember things that

4759
02:42:39,279 --> 02:42:44,000
happened before you unplugged in is it

4760
02:42:42,239 --> 02:42:46,719
like he's sleeping

4761
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:49,279
like is he wake up or is he like that so

4762
02:42:46,719 --> 02:42:50,799
right now start to zero everything uh no

4763
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:52,159
it doesn't start at zero remember it

4764
02:42:50,799 --> 02:42:55,119
remembers everything that's the key

4765
02:42:52,159 --> 02:42:56,639
every time you like you you unplug wow

4766
02:42:55,120 --> 02:42:58,880
it's storing the story in the memory but

4767
02:42:56,639 --> 02:43:01,760
the memories are basic they're like okay

4768
02:42:58,879 --> 02:43:04,079
we walked around the kitchen and then

4769
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:05,680
um you looked at me i mean the memories

4770
02:43:04,079 --> 02:43:07,359
it's like data it's just

4771
02:43:05,680 --> 02:43:08,720
it's not like we've experienced it's

4772
02:43:07,359 --> 02:43:10,800
able to actually

4773
02:43:08,719 --> 02:43:14,318
uh experience anything deep like we

4774
02:43:10,799 --> 02:43:17,119
humans can but just the fact of memory

4775
02:43:14,318 --> 02:43:19,519
it's like the toaster or the microwave

4776
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:21,200
don't don't give a [ __ ] about me

4777
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:23,920
they don't know me they don't know me by

4778
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:25,760
name they wouldn't recognize my face

4779
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:27,439
as being different from gordon's they

4780
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:28,398
wouldn't know the difference and they

4781
02:43:27,439 --> 02:43:29,439
wouldn't

4782
02:43:28,398 --> 02:43:31,439
remember

4783
02:43:29,439 --> 02:43:33,520
the microwave currently doesn't remember

4784
02:43:31,439 --> 02:43:36,639
you know the times i've been sad or

4785
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:38,239
happy like what food i put into it it

4786
02:43:36,639 --> 02:43:40,079
doesn't remember this

4787
02:43:38,239 --> 02:43:42,879
when i was being a fat ass or what i was

4788
02:43:40,079 --> 02:43:44,799
being in good shape and all all just

4789
02:43:42,879 --> 02:43:46,799
those memories are enough to make you

4790
02:43:44,799 --> 02:43:47,840
feel when you turn a thing off

4791
02:43:46,799 --> 02:43:50,159
it's like

4792
02:43:47,840 --> 02:43:51,840
[ __ ] wow that's a little that's that

4793
02:43:50,159 --> 02:43:52,799
that's a living thing disappearing of

4794
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:55,680
course that's kind of an

4795
02:43:52,799 --> 02:43:57,840
anthropomorphism we do to each other

4796
02:43:55,680 --> 02:43:59,760
but uh that's something

4797
02:43:57,840 --> 02:44:01,359
it's you know that

4798
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:05,120
that's some that makes me believe it's

4799
02:44:01,359 --> 02:44:07,040
possible to create um

4800
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:08,800
systems with which we can have a

4801
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:11,840
connection that are non-human

4802
02:44:08,799 --> 02:44:13,039
like similar to dogs and cats and so on

4803
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:14,398
it just makes me

4804
02:44:13,040 --> 02:44:16,080
and that's what's interesting to me

4805
02:44:14,398 --> 02:44:17,599
because ultimately i feel like they'll

4806
02:44:16,079 --> 02:44:19,840
help us understand

4807
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:19,840
ourselves

4808
02:44:20,159 --> 02:44:25,359
and maybe practice grappling moves

4809
02:44:22,079 --> 02:44:25,359
anyway um

4810
02:44:26,639 --> 02:44:32,000
well let me ask the uh advice question

4811
02:44:29,680 --> 02:44:34,720
uh now that we're together i've asked

4812
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:36,639
i've spoken to john i spoke to george

4813
02:44:34,719 --> 02:44:38,000
what what advice would you give to young

4814
02:44:36,639 --> 02:44:39,680
folks whether

4815
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:42,559
we're talking about

4816
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:44,639
sport like excelling becoming great at

4817
02:44:42,559 --> 02:44:46,079
grappling becoming great at fighting

4818
02:44:44,639 --> 02:44:48,719
becoming great at whatever sport they

4819
02:44:46,079 --> 02:44:50,000
take on or life in general whether

4820
02:44:48,719 --> 02:44:50,959
they're maybe in high school or in

4821
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:53,600
college

4822
02:44:50,959 --> 02:44:55,199
what advice would you give them to uh

4823
02:44:53,600 --> 02:44:57,279
excel

4824
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:59,279
at that thing they take on i don't know

4825
02:44:57,279 --> 02:45:01,920
if i'm qualified to answer this because

4826
02:44:59,279 --> 02:45:03,840
i'm only 26 so

4827
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:06,159
you're at the top you said giving advice

4828
02:45:03,840 --> 02:45:08,000
to young people um

4829
02:45:06,159 --> 02:45:09,200
for me i think the two biggest things

4830
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,359
are

4831
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:14,800
find something that you're both talented

4832
02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:17,040
in and you enjoy um i think that if you

4833
02:45:14,799 --> 02:45:18,239
enjoy something but you're terrible at

4834
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:19,520
it it's going to be hard for you to be

4835
02:45:18,239 --> 02:45:22,719
successful

4836
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:24,479
in life at that given in that given area

4837
02:45:22,719 --> 02:45:27,679
and it's going to be hard to do

4838
02:45:24,478 --> 02:45:29,438
something for long amounts of time

4839
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:31,120
if you're talented at it but you don't

4840
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:32,800
enjoy doing it

4841
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:33,760
it's easy to come in

4842
02:45:32,799 --> 02:45:34,799
and

4843
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:37,279
train

4844
02:45:34,799 --> 02:45:38,239
hard for a month or two months or for a

4845
02:45:37,279 --> 02:45:40,079
year

4846
02:45:38,239 --> 02:45:41,600
you can be very talented at it but if

4847
02:45:40,079 --> 02:45:43,840
you come in it's but it's a different

4848
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:45,439
story to come in every day for five

4849
02:45:43,840 --> 02:45:48,719
years in a row for 10 years in a row for

4850
02:45:45,439 --> 02:45:49,840
15 years in a row so i think

4851
02:45:48,719 --> 02:45:51,760
i think finding something that you're

4852
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:54,079
both talented in

4853
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:56,159
and something you enjoy are probably the

4854
02:45:54,079 --> 02:45:58,079
two biggest things for me how do you

4855
02:45:56,159 --> 02:46:00,799
find the joy in it so you've been

4856
02:45:58,079 --> 02:46:02,799
training insane amount you know a lot

4857
02:46:00,799 --> 02:46:04,959
you've been doing it for a long time is

4858
02:46:02,799 --> 02:46:06,079
there's is there ways to rediscover the

4859
02:46:04,959 --> 02:46:08,079
joy in it

4860
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:09,200
yeah for me initially

4861
02:46:08,079 --> 02:46:11,600
it was just

4862
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:13,520
learning new stuff you know you come in

4863
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:14,720
as a white belt and every day you learn

4864
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:16,640
you see a different move and you're like

4865
02:46:14,719 --> 02:46:17,438
oh man that's that's awesome

4866
02:46:16,639 --> 02:46:19,358
um

4867
02:46:17,439 --> 02:46:21,920
and then when i started to compete more

4868
02:46:19,359 --> 02:46:22,880
seriously towards my professional career

4869
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:25,840
it was

4870
02:46:22,879 --> 02:46:27,519
uh the joy of doing camps and seeing the

4871
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:29,120
result of those camps and beating

4872
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:30,880
high-level athletes

4873
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:32,479
and then i got to a point where

4874
02:46:30,879 --> 02:46:33,759
i've beaten all the high-level athletes

4875
02:46:32,478 --> 02:46:36,159
already so

4876
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:38,880
who am i going to compete against

4877
02:46:36,159 --> 02:46:39,840
so now for me the joy is just

4878
02:46:38,879 --> 02:46:42,639
being

4879
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:45,439
the best athlete i can possibly be until

4880
02:46:42,639 --> 02:46:48,159
i reach my prime which i'm hoping is

4881
02:46:45,439 --> 02:46:49,439
somewhere between 35 and 40. um so

4882
02:46:48,159 --> 02:46:50,799
instead of competing against the other

4883
02:46:49,439 --> 02:46:52,079
athletes

4884
02:46:50,799 --> 02:46:53,920
i'll be bored already because i already

4885
02:46:52,079 --> 02:46:55,760
beat all the rest of the guys

4886
02:46:53,920 --> 02:46:57,600
um but

4887
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:59,840
i know that now i know that i can be

4888
02:46:57,600 --> 02:47:02,239
better in a year from now or two years

4889
02:46:59,840 --> 02:47:04,239
from now than i am today and that for me

4890
02:47:02,239 --> 02:47:05,920
is exciting

4891
02:47:04,239 --> 02:47:08,239
by the way is there some aspect of

4892
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:09,760
teaching that's exciting to you yeah

4893
02:47:08,239 --> 02:47:11,439
yeah because you've become a

4894
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:13,680
better and better teacher over the years

4895
02:47:11,439 --> 02:47:15,279
yeah yeah i i definitely uh i enjoy

4896
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:17,600
teaching and

4897
02:47:15,279 --> 02:47:20,079
i used to teach um

4898
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:21,760
a lot before i met john and then i met

4899
02:47:20,079 --> 02:47:23,359
john and i was like yeah i just have no

4900
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:25,120
idea how to teach um so that's like a

4901
02:47:23,359 --> 02:47:27,439
completely different element

4902
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:29,279
of the sport um you know doing things

4903
02:47:27,439 --> 02:47:30,559
and being good at doing things or being

4904
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:31,920
good at winning

4905
02:47:30,559 --> 02:47:34,719
and actually being able to communicate

4906
02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:36,559
those skills and knowledge to to a vast

4907
02:47:34,719 --> 02:47:38,318
amount of people is two completely

4908
02:47:36,559 --> 02:47:40,879
different things

4909
02:47:38,318 --> 02:47:42,799
george advice for young people

4910
02:47:40,879 --> 02:47:43,920
like yourself

4911
02:47:42,799 --> 02:47:47,438
well

4912
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:49,840
first i was i would tell them find

4913
02:47:47,439 --> 02:47:50,800
what you want to become what you want to

4914
02:47:49,840 --> 02:47:52,559
do

4915
02:47:50,799 --> 02:47:54,239
and long term

4916
02:47:52,559 --> 02:47:56,559
use certain things maybe sometimes you

4917
02:47:54,239 --> 02:47:58,799
don't love but where you want to propel

4918
02:47:56,559 --> 02:48:00,799
yourself at the future not what your

4919
02:47:58,799 --> 02:48:04,079
parents your your friend wants you to

4920
02:48:00,799 --> 02:48:07,199
become what you you you want to become

4921
02:48:04,079 --> 02:48:08,318
so one once you find it

4922
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:11,520
you cannot

4923
02:48:08,318 --> 02:48:13,199
doing it by yourself everything better

4924
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:15,600
that is big achievement in life we

4925
02:48:13,200 --> 02:48:18,000
cannot do it doing it by ourselves so

4926
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:19,680
what i would say is second thing is

4927
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:22,000
try to build up your team and try to

4928
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:24,239
build up your team to be able to achieve

4929
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:26,639
your goal

4930
02:48:24,239 --> 02:48:28,639
of people that are competent

4931
02:48:26,639 --> 02:48:31,358
and people that you trust

4932
02:48:28,639 --> 02:48:32,719
you need both competency and trust

4933
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:34,720
i sell a lot of people sometime in

4934
02:48:32,719 --> 02:48:35,599
business for example they hire people

4935
02:48:34,719 --> 02:48:37,920
they

4936
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:39,600
that are that they trust but they turns

4937
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:41,359
out to be incompetent

4938
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:43,279
so now you have to fire a friend or

4939
02:48:41,359 --> 02:48:45,359
otherwise your business going down the

4940
02:48:43,279 --> 02:48:46,800
same problem if you do the opposite uh

4941
02:48:45,359 --> 02:48:48,640
you're someone that is competent but you

4942
02:48:46,799 --> 02:48:50,159
cannot trust is gonna it's gonna screw

4943
02:48:48,639 --> 02:48:52,000
you you know

4944
02:48:50,159 --> 02:48:53,840
so it's very important to stay away from

4945
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:56,639
the negative build up your team people

4946
02:48:53,840 --> 02:48:59,439
you trust and that are competent

4947
02:48:56,639 --> 02:49:02,318
and i would say the third one is to work

4948
02:48:59,439 --> 02:49:04,479
to work hard to sacrifice yourself yeah

4949
02:49:02,318 --> 02:49:06,239
you have to go through hell sometime but

4950
02:49:04,478 --> 02:49:08,478
yeah you have to see the light at the

4951
02:49:06,239 --> 02:49:09,920
end of it you know to

4952
02:49:08,478 --> 02:49:11,358
keep your dream in mind it's going to

4953
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:13,359
give you the motivation to go through

4954
02:49:11,359 --> 02:49:15,120
the tough times nothing easy to go work

4955
02:49:13,359 --> 02:49:18,000
work work is nothing you can accomplish

4956
02:49:15,120 --> 02:49:18,000
without hard work

4957
02:49:18,318 --> 02:49:22,959
the fourth one i would say

4958
02:49:20,398 --> 02:49:24,879
to invest on yourself constantly

4959
02:49:22,959 --> 02:49:26,799
if you do not invest on your cell phone

4960
02:49:24,879 --> 02:49:27,679
whatever you are in which business and

4961
02:49:26,799 --> 02:49:29,840
sport

4962
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:32,639
the game will catch up to you

4963
02:49:29,840 --> 02:49:35,200
for example if you're if you become

4964
02:49:32,639 --> 02:49:37,519
champion at something and if you stop

4965
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:38,960
improving the other guys that are trying

4966
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:39,760
to be champion are going to catch up to

4967
02:49:38,959 --> 02:49:41,759
you

4968
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:43,279
so you need to invest on yourself and

4969
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:44,719
most people

4970
02:49:43,279 --> 02:49:46,640
most athlete they make the mistake when

4971
02:49:44,719 --> 02:49:48,559
they start to having money

4972
02:49:46,639 --> 02:49:50,639
they buy luxury stuff

4973
02:49:48,559 --> 02:49:52,318
and that's one thing i didn't do when i

4974
02:49:50,639 --> 02:49:54,478
started making money i was investing of

4975
02:49:52,318 --> 02:49:56,959
on traveling to new york training with

4976
02:49:54,478 --> 02:49:59,438
john garden and the guys to learn

4977
02:49:56,959 --> 02:50:04,000
what is new in the the game of jiu jitsu

4978
02:49:59,439 --> 02:50:04,000
i used to go in thailand train muay thai

4979
02:50:04,719 --> 02:50:07,760
in los angeles to perfect my boxing

4980
02:50:06,799 --> 02:50:09,599
skill

4981
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:12,719
so instead of taking that money to buy

4982
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:15,359
me jewelry cars and to do what a lot of

4983
02:50:12,719 --> 02:50:17,199
guys do because it's a mistake

4984
02:50:15,359 --> 02:50:19,120
i i invested on myself because i know

4985
02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:21,040
there were people coming they don't want

4986
02:50:19,120 --> 02:50:22,960
my place so i want i didn't want them to

4987
02:50:21,040 --> 02:50:24,960
catch me

4988
02:50:22,959 --> 02:50:26,159
and the last one i would say it seems

4989
02:50:24,959 --> 02:50:28,159
weird

4990
02:50:26,159 --> 02:50:29,359
i would say

4991
02:50:28,159 --> 02:50:31,600
to give back

4992
02:50:29,359 --> 02:50:32,880
and it's not because i'm a nice guy and

4993
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:36,079
it's not that

4994
02:50:32,879 --> 02:50:39,278
i don't say that to look good i say that

4995
02:50:36,079 --> 02:50:39,279
when you you make it

4996
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:44,799
it creates opportunity where you can

4997
02:50:41,680 --> 02:50:46,880
help certain group of people

4998
02:50:44,799 --> 02:50:49,438
but when i say give back not give back

4999
02:50:46,879 --> 02:50:52,239
to everybody to anybody give back only

5000
02:50:49,439 --> 02:50:53,120
to the the cause that you want i give

5001
02:50:52,239 --> 02:50:54,559
back

5002
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:56,160
not because i'm a nice guy i'm kind of

5003
02:50:54,559 --> 02:50:58,639
it's kind of selfish i only give back to

5004
02:50:56,159 --> 02:51:00,639
the people that i want to give back

5005
02:50:58,639 --> 02:51:02,959
because i give back to them and i know

5006
02:51:00,639 --> 02:51:04,719
that if i'm more successful i'm going

5007
02:51:02,959 --> 02:51:07,358
gonna be able to give back to people i

5008
02:51:04,719 --> 02:51:10,318
loved the cars that that that count for

5009
02:51:07,359 --> 02:51:12,399
me so it's it brings me more motivation

5010
02:51:10,318 --> 02:51:14,398
because i don't compete

5011
02:51:12,398 --> 02:51:16,799
for myself anymore i compete to help

5012
02:51:14,398 --> 02:51:19,519
people i love in a way

5013
02:51:16,799 --> 02:51:22,239
so when you you reach the top in your

5014
02:51:19,520 --> 02:51:24,159
game you need to find new motivation if

5015
02:51:22,239 --> 02:51:26,318
you satisfy is

5016
02:51:24,159 --> 02:51:28,318
is the end of it your success will go

5017
02:51:26,318 --> 02:51:30,559
down so you need to

5018
02:51:28,318 --> 02:51:32,478
to find new motivation what can motivate

5019
02:51:30,559 --> 02:51:34,559
you you know what do you want i want to

5020
02:51:32,478 --> 02:51:35,760
help this so i need to to be successful

5021
02:51:34,559 --> 02:51:38,079
i want to

5022
02:51:35,760 --> 02:51:40,318
you know you need to find reason who you

5023
02:51:38,079 --> 02:51:41,760
what do you want to do with your success

5024
02:51:40,318 --> 02:51:44,159
so when i say give back it's not because

5025
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:46,639
i'm not because i'm necessarily it's not

5026
02:51:44,159 --> 02:51:48,079
to be to look like a nice guys to keep

5027
02:51:46,639 --> 02:51:49,519
your motivation

5028
02:51:48,079 --> 02:51:52,879
to be able to

5029
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:55,040
keep climbing the ladder even more

5030
02:51:52,879 --> 02:51:56,159
that's beautiful george um

5031
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:57,120
john

5032
02:51:56,159 --> 02:51:59,439
um

5033
02:51:57,120 --> 02:52:01,279
first off the two responses given so far

5034
02:51:59,439 --> 02:52:04,079
covered i think the most important

5035
02:52:01,279 --> 02:52:06,640
things or already um

5036
02:52:04,079 --> 02:52:09,439
gordon talked about the the need for

5037
02:52:06,639 --> 02:52:10,799
an underlying passion and enjoyment if

5038
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:12,159
you don't have that

5039
02:52:10,799 --> 02:52:15,039
you're not going to have the longevity

5040
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:16,959
that is required in order to build

5041
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:18,000
skills which is ultimately everything's

5042
02:52:16,959 --> 02:52:19,278
going to come down to your ability to

5043
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:21,600
build skills you've got to have some

5044
02:52:19,279 --> 02:52:23,120
kind of underlying passion and enjoyment

5045
02:52:21,600 --> 02:52:24,000
which will keep you in the game long

5046
02:52:23,120 --> 02:52:26,000
enough

5047
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:27,760
to build world championship skills it's

5048
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:29,920
going to take a minimum of five years

5049
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:32,000
and quite possibly considerably longer

5050
02:52:29,920 --> 02:52:33,680
than that

5051
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:35,680
george talked about the idea of

5052
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:37,120
community you're not going to make it by

5053
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:39,120
yourself so you've got to be able to

5054
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:41,760
build people around you and

5055
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:43,520
and build a trusted environment around

5056
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:44,960
you to develop those skills

5057
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:47,040
um

5058
02:52:44,959 --> 02:52:50,000
what i would add to the the excellent

5059
02:52:47,040 --> 02:52:51,439
points that both already raised

5060
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:53,760
alludes to what i said at the start of

5061
02:52:51,439 --> 02:52:55,120
this podcast you've got to be able to

5062
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:57,840
identify

5063
02:52:55,120 --> 02:53:00,399
some kind of undervalued

5064
02:52:57,840 --> 02:53:02,559
elements in whatever industry you're in

5065
02:53:00,398 --> 02:53:03,840
and show the world what their true value

5066
02:53:02,559 --> 02:53:05,600
is

5067
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:08,159
in addition

5068
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:11,040
you can't go through life

5069
02:53:08,159 --> 02:53:13,439
doing the same things as everybody else

5070
02:53:11,040 --> 02:53:16,000
and expecting to get different results

5071
02:53:13,439 --> 02:53:18,079
this is straightforwardly irrational and

5072
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:20,159
worse it's even arrogant it's

5073
02:53:18,079 --> 02:53:21,680
essentially the statement that i'm going

5074
02:53:20,159 --> 02:53:23,760
to do the same thing as everyone else

5075
02:53:21,680 --> 02:53:25,840
but i believe i'm different

5076
02:53:23,760 --> 02:53:27,840
and so they'll work for me

5077
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:30,239
but they didn't work for everyone else

5078
02:53:27,840 --> 02:53:32,478
that's like saying no i'm special

5079
02:53:30,239 --> 02:53:33,920
no you're not special we're all pretty

5080
02:53:32,478 --> 02:53:34,879
much the same

5081
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:37,120
and

5082
02:53:34,879 --> 02:53:39,278
in order to be special you're going to

5083
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:42,240
have to exhibit skills that other people

5084
02:53:39,279 --> 02:53:42,239
simply don't have

5085
02:53:42,959 --> 02:53:47,039
thirdly i would say if you want to

5086
02:53:44,639 --> 02:53:49,840
become something truly impressive in

5087
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:51,680
life you've got to be able to focus on

5088
02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:53,359
one or two things

5089
02:53:51,680 --> 02:53:55,600
that you do better than anyone else in

5090
02:53:53,359 --> 02:53:57,840
your industry

5091
02:53:55,600 --> 02:54:00,159
you can't learn everything but you can

5092
02:53:57,840 --> 02:54:03,279
take one or two skills and the more

5093
02:54:00,159 --> 02:54:05,359
innovative those skills are the better

5094
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:08,319
and you can truly excel at them for

5095
02:54:05,359 --> 02:54:10,318
example at the peak of his career

5096
02:54:08,318 --> 02:54:12,478
no one in the world was better than

5097
02:54:10,318 --> 02:54:14,000
george st pierre at integrating striking

5098
02:54:12,478 --> 02:54:15,920
and takedowns

5099
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:17,680
no one in the world was better at

5100
02:54:15,920 --> 02:54:18,879
integrating grappling and striking on

5101
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:20,800
the ground

5102
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:23,199
he had two things that he could

5103
02:54:20,799 --> 02:54:25,438
confidently say he was the best in the

5104
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:27,120
world at was he the best at every mma

5105
02:54:25,439 --> 02:54:28,318
skill nope

5106
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:30,640
but he was

5107
02:54:28,318 --> 02:54:32,398
absolutely the best at those two skills

5108
02:54:30,639 --> 02:54:34,639
and those two skills were skills which

5109
02:54:32,398 --> 02:54:36,879
he used throughout his career to win the

5110
02:54:34,639 --> 02:54:38,799
vast majority of his matches

5111
02:54:36,879 --> 02:54:40,478
gordon ryan at the onset of his career

5112
02:54:38,799 --> 02:54:41,840
could confidently say

5113
02:54:40,478 --> 02:54:44,079
there's no one in the world better than

5114
02:54:41,840 --> 02:54:45,920
me at leglocks

5115
02:54:44,079 --> 02:54:47,439
he could also say there's no one better

5116
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:49,600
in the world than me at late stage

5117
02:54:47,439 --> 02:54:52,318
defense

5118
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:54,640
to submission holds across the board

5119
02:54:52,318 --> 02:54:56,879
as he went through his career he started

5120
02:54:54,639 --> 02:54:58,318
adding more and more elements it's

5121
02:54:56,879 --> 02:55:00,239
gotten to an extraordinary degree now

5122
02:54:58,318 --> 02:55:02,318
where you could absolutely say he's the

5123
02:55:00,239 --> 02:55:03,520
best at guard passing the best of guard

5124
02:55:02,318 --> 02:55:05,439
retention

5125
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:06,880
the less this keeps going on and that

5126
02:55:05,439 --> 02:55:08,079
goes back to what

5127
02:55:06,879 --> 02:55:09,519
um

5128
02:55:08,079 --> 02:55:11,359
gordon said earlier about keeping things

5129
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:13,760
interesting over time because we're

5130
02:55:11,359 --> 02:55:15,439
always introducing new skill sets the

5131
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:17,520
day you start saying

5132
02:55:15,439 --> 02:55:19,040
i'm satisfied with my skill set is the

5133
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:21,680
day you get bored

5134
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:24,080
and bored boredom to an athlete is a

5135
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:26,479
precursor to

5136
02:55:24,079 --> 02:55:28,159
death by boredom um

5137
02:55:26,478 --> 02:55:30,478
as long as you're still growing in those

5138
02:55:28,159 --> 02:55:32,719
directions you'll stay in the game

5139
02:55:30,478 --> 02:55:35,760
for very long periods of time so the

5140
02:55:32,719 --> 02:55:38,398
main thing i would add to these uh

5141
02:55:35,760 --> 02:55:39,840
statements by gordon and george is this

5142
02:55:38,398 --> 02:55:41,278
idea of

5143
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:42,799
finding something which is currently

5144
02:55:41,279 --> 02:55:45,840
undervalued and showing the world what

5145
02:55:42,799 --> 02:55:45,840
its true value is

5146
02:55:46,159 --> 02:55:50,239
understanding

5147
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:52,239
that you can't just use the same

5148
02:55:50,239 --> 02:55:53,760
training methodologies as everyone else

5149
02:55:52,239 --> 02:55:55,840
and somehow expect to be different from

5150
02:55:53,760 --> 02:55:58,079
everyone else you've got

5151
02:55:55,840 --> 02:56:00,000
almost every great rise in human

5152
02:55:58,079 --> 02:56:02,559
civilization whether it be groups of

5153
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:04,719
people or individuals requires some kind

5154
02:56:02,559 --> 02:56:06,959
of innovation you've got to look for

5155
02:56:04,719 --> 02:56:08,478
that new angle okay george st pierre

5156
02:56:06,959 --> 02:56:09,679
found it with shoot boxing early on in

5157
02:56:08,478 --> 02:56:10,959
his career

5158
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:12,800
uh gordon ryan found it with leg

5159
02:56:10,959 --> 02:56:14,398
leglocks early on in his career and they

5160
02:56:12,799 --> 02:56:17,119
branched out from that

5161
02:56:14,398 --> 02:56:17,119
from that angle

5162
02:56:18,079 --> 02:56:23,920
add to this the idea that you want to

5163
02:56:20,719 --> 02:56:26,478
become the absolute best in the world in

5164
02:56:23,920 --> 02:56:27,920
your industry and one or two things that

5165
02:56:26,478 --> 02:56:30,318
make a difference

5166
02:56:27,920 --> 02:56:33,680
find out what they are and focus on

5167
02:56:30,318 --> 02:56:34,639
those things and you'll go far

5168
02:56:33,680 --> 02:56:36,800
john

5169
02:56:34,639 --> 02:56:39,199
