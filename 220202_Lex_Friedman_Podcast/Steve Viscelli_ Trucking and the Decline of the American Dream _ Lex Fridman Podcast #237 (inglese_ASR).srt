leselli

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,679
you wrote a book about trucking called

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,079
the big rig trucking and the decline of

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,920
the american dream and

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,799
you're currently working on a book about

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,800
autonomous trucking called driverless

26
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,479
autonomous trucks and the future of the

27
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,919
american trucker

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,119
i have to bring up some johnny cash to

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,040
you because i was just listening to this

30
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,959
song he has a ton of songs about

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,400
trucking but one of them i was just

32
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,359
listening to

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
it's called all i do is drive

34
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,640
where he's talking to an old truck

35
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,359
driver it goes

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,280
i asked him if those trucking songs tell

37
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,319
about a life like his

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,320
he said

39
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,000
if you want to know the truth about it

40
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,039
here's the way it is

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,280
all i do is drive drive drive

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,360
try to stay alive that's the course

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,280
and keep my mind on my load keep my eye

44
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,560
upon the road i got nothing in common

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,200
with any man

46
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,280
who's home every day at five all i do is

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,640
drive drive drive

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,640
drive drive drive drive so i got to ask

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,599
you uh same thing that he asked the

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,599
trucker

51
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,679
you worked as a trucker for six months

52
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,959
in in uh while working on the previous

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,240
book

54
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,798
um

55
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,839
what's it like to be a truck driver

56
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,040
i think that captures it

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,478
it really does

58
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,600
um can you take me through the whole

59
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,840
experience

60
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,919
what it takes to uh become a trucker

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,399
what actual day-to-day life was on day

62
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,280
one week one and then over time how that

63
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,560
changed

64
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
yeah

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,800
well the book is really about how that

66
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,680
changed over time

67
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,520
so my experience and i'm an ethnographer

68
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,319
right so i go in

69
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,879
uh i live with people i work with people

70
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,719
i talk to them i try to understand

71
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,399
you know their world

72
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,560
ethnographer by the way

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,280
what is that the science and art of

74
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,039
capturing a uh

75
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,959
the spirit of a people

76
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,318
yeah life ways you know i think that

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,719
would be a good way to capture it you

78
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,759
know try to understand

79
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:47,199
what makes them unique um

80
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,560
as a as a society maybe as a subculture

81
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,318
right what

82
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,959
makes them tick that might be different

83
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:54,318
than the way you and i are

84
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,479
sort of wired

85
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,958
and to really sort of thickly describe

86
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,039
it would be at least one component of it

87
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
that's sort of the basic essential and

88
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,079
then

89
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,000
for me i want to you know exercise what

90
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,280
c wright mills called the sociological

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,759
imagination

92
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,199
which is to you know put that individual

93
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,479
biography

94
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:19,439
into the long historical sweep of

95
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,919
humanity if at all possible

96
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,239
my goals are typically more modest than

97
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:26,958
sea right mills is and to you know then

98
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,120
put that biography in

99
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
the larger social structure right to try

100
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,799
to understand

101
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,519
that person's life and the way they see

102
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,519
the world um their decisions in light of

103
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,680
their interests relative to others and

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,200
conflict and power and all these things

105
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,760
that i find interesting in the context

106
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,318
of society and in the context of history

107
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,840
yeah and a small tangent what does it

108
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,158
take to do that

109
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,039
to uh capture

110
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,399
the uh this particular group the spirit

111
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,479
the music

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,840
the full landscape of experiences that a

113
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,598
particular group

114
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,680
goes through in the context of

115
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,518
everything else you only have limited

116
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,879
amount of time and you come to the table

117
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,560
probably with

118
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,719
preconceived notions that are then

119
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,959
quickly destroyed all that whole process

120
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,560
so it's i don't know if it's more art or

121
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,400
science but what does it take to be

122
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,120
great at this

123
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,120
i do think the my first book was

124
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,079
a success as you know relative to my

125
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
goals

126
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,040
of trying to really you know get at the

127
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,319
heart of of sort of the central issues

128
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,759
and and the lives being led by people if

129
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,199
i

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,120
have a a resource a talent it's that i'm

131
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
a good listener um

132
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,600
i can

133
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
you know

134
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
talk with anybody

135
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,959
you know my wife's you know loves to

136
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
remark on this that you know i can i can

137
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,959
sort of sit down with anyone

138
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,759
uh i think i learned that from my dad

139
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,918
who uh worked at a factory and actually

140
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,600
had a lot of truckers go through the

141
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,599
gate that he operated

142
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,919
and he always had a story you know a

143
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,240
joke for everybody kind of got to know

144
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,918
everyone individually and he just you

145
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,519
know taught me that like

146
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,639
essentially everyone has something to

147
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,839
teach you

148
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,560
and i try to embody that like that's

149
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:13,119
that's the rule is for me is

150
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,639
every single person i interact with can

151
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,720
teach me something

152
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,560
i gotta ask you i'm sorry to interrupt

153
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,960
because i'm clearly of the two of us the

154
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,280
poorer listener

155
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,879
uh you i think you're a great listener

156
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,559
i've i've been listening to the podcast

157
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,918
i think you're a great listener i really

158
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,918
appreciate that

159
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,918
um you've done a large number of

160
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,359
interviews like you said of truckers for

161
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,478
this book

162
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,400
so i'm just curious um

163
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,719
what are some lessons you've learned

164
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,478
about what it takes to

165
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,280
listen to a person

166
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,439
enough maybe guide you know the

167
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,599
conversation enough to get to the core

168
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,120
of the person the idea again the

169
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,919
ethnographer

170
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,800
goal to get to the get to the core

171
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,240
yeah

172
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
i i think

173
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,199
it's it doesn't happen in the moment

174
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,400
right so

175
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,439
i

176
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,638
i'm a ruminator you know i i just sit

177
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,120
with the data

178
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,240
you know for years i i sat with the

179
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,160
trucking data for almost 10 full years

180
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,840
and just thought it thought about the

181
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,800
problems and the questions

182
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:19,119
using everything that i possibly could

183
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,478
and so in the moment you know my ideal

184
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,439
interview is

185
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,439
you know

186
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,800
i open up and i say tell me about your

187
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,560
life as a trucker and they never shut up

188
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,560
and they and they keep telling me the

189
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,360
things that i'm interested in no it

190
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,560
never

191
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,560
works out that way because they don't

192
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,519
know what you're interested in right and

193
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,280
so it's um a lot of it is the

194
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,519
as you know as a i think you're a great

195
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,000
interviewer you know prep right i mean

196
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,399
so you try to get to know a little bit

197
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,160
about the person and sort of understand

198
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,918
you know kind of the the central

199
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,160
questions you're interested in that that

200
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,318
they can help you explore

201
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,680
um and so

202
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,400
i've done hundreds of interviews with

203
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,560
truck drivers um at this point and

204
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,318
i i should really go back and read the

205
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,918
original ones they're probably terrible

206
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,680
what's the process like you're sitting

207
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,519
down do you have an audio recorder and

208
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,439
also taking notes or do you do no audio

209
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,918
records just notes or yeah audio

210
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,680
recorder and you know social scientists

211
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:15,359
always have to struggle with sampling

212
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,439
right like who do you interview where do

213
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,840
you find them how do you recruit them

214
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,680
i just happen to have a sort of

215
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,439
natural place to go that gave me

216
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
essentially the population that i was

217
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,038
interested in you know so all these

218
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,800
long-haul truck drivers that i i was

219
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,839
interested in they have to stop and get

220
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,240
fuel and get services at truck stops

221
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,758
so i picked a you know truck stop

222
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,960
at the juncture of a couple major

223
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,199
interstates

224
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,719
went into the lounge that drivers have

225
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,919
to walk through you know with my

226
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,160
clipboard

227
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,560
and everybody who came through and i

228
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,400
said hey you know are you on break

229
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,240
and that was sort of the first

230
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:53,279
you know criteria was do you have time

231
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,680
right um and if they said yes i said you

232
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,000
know i'd say i'm a graduate student you

233
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,079
know at indiana university i'm doing a

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
study i'm trying to understand more

235
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,800
about truck drivers you know will you

236
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,360
sit down with me and i think the first i

237
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,240
think i probably asked like 104 103

238
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,639
people

239
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,800
to get the first 100 interviews

240
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,519
that's pretty good odds it's amazing

241
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,000
right

242
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,359
for you know any response rate like that

243
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,879
for inter i mean these are people who

244
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,439
sat down and gave me

245
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,599
an hour sometimes more of their time

246
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,240
just randomly at a truck stop and it

247
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,159
just tells you something about like

248
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,160
truckers have something to say

249
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,360
they're alone a lot

250
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,120
and so

251
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
i had to figure out how to kind of turn

252
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,080
the spigot on you know

253
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,399
and

254
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,158
i got pretty good at it i think yeah

255
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,759
so they have good stories to tell and

256
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,278
they have an active life of the mind

257
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,278
because they spend so much time on the

258
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,958
road just basically thinking

259
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,240
yeah there's a there's a lot of

260
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,518
reflection

261
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,759
um a lot of struggles you know and it's

262
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,959
they take different forms you know uh

263
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,958
one of the things that they talk about

264
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,719
is the impact on their families

265
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,799
they say truckers have the same rate of

266
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,879
divorce as everybody else and that's

267
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,639
because trucking saves so many marriages

268
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:08,879
because you're not around and ruins so

269
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,559
many and so yeah it ends up being awash

270
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:13,039
so

271
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,039
you know i had this experience um i met

272
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,559
another person he recognized me from a

273
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,879
podcast

274
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,958
and he said you know i'm a fan of yours

275
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,120
and a fan of joe rogan

276
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,199
but you guys never talk you always talk

277
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,440
to people know about prizes you always

278
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,879
talk to these kind of people you never

279
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,040
talk to

280
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,360
us regular folk

281
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,599
and uh that guy really stuck with me

282
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,320
first of all the idea of regular folk is

283
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,399
a silly notion i think people that win

284
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,480
nobel prizes are often more boring than

285
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,639
the people these regular folks in terms

286
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,879
of stories in terms of richness of

287
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,919
experience in terms of the ups and downs

288
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,080
of life

289
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,360
and uh

290
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,200
you know that really stuck with me

291
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,959
because i i set that as a goal for

292
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,839
myself to make sure i

293
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:01,199
i talk to regular folk

294
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,040
and you did just this talking again

295
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,879
regular folk

296
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,838
it's human beings

297
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,559
um

298
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,200
all of them have experiences

299
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,838
if you were to recommend

300
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,079
uh to talk to uh to talk some of these

301
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,800
folks with stories how would you find

302
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,559
them yeah so i i do do this sometimes

303
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:21,759
for journalists who you know will come

304
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,359
and they want to write about sort of

305
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,879
what's happening right now in trucking

306
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,480
you know um

307
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:27,759
and i send them to truck stops you know

308
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,079
i say you know

309
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,360
yeah there's a town called effingham

310
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,919
illinois

311
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,000
and it's just this place where you know

312
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,159
a bunch of huge truck stops tons of

313
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,759
trucks and really nothing else

314
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,879
out there you know it's in the middle of

315
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,319
corn country um and you know again

316
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,320
truckers in this

317
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,000
you know sadly i think you know the

318
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,160
politics of the day

319
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,600
it's changing a little bit

320
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,919
i think there's a little the

321
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,159
polarization is getting

322
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,319
to the trucking industry and in ways

323
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,559
that um you know maybe we're seeing in

324
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,240
other parts of of our

325
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,639
social world

326
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,680
but truckers are generally you know real

327
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,600
open sort of friendly folks

328
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,639
some of them ultimately like to work

329
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,000
alone and be alone that's a relatively

330
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,639
small subset i think um but all of them

331
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
are generally you know kind of open you

332
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,559
know trusting

333
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,399
willing to have a conversation and so

334
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,838
you go to the truck stop and

335
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,200
you go in the lounge and and they're

336
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,240
usually there's usually a booth down

337
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
there and somebody's sitting at their

338
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,600
laptop or on their phone

339
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,799
um and willing to strike up a

340
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,440
conversation you should try that you

341
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,319
should

342
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
100 we'll try this uh

343
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,240
just again we're just going from tangent

344
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,360
to tangent we've returned to the main

345
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,039
question but

346
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,519
what do they listen to

347
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,519
do they listen to talk radio

348
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,200
did they listen to podcast audio books

349
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,799
do they listen to music do they listen

350
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,800
to silence

351
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,679
everything everything everything some i

352
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,078
mean

353
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,399
and some still listen to the cb which

354
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:00,319
you know it's a it's an ever-dwindling

355
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,559
group um they'll call it the original

356
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,320
internet citizen's band you know they

357
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,359
they back in the 70s they thought it was

358
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,920
going to be the

359
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,399
the medium of democracy um and they love

360
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,120
to just get on there and you know cruise

361
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,039
along uh one truck after the other and

362
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,879
chat away usually it's guys who know

363
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,799
each other from the same company or

364
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,958
happen to run into each other but other

365
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,199
than that it's everything under the sun

366
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:25,759
um you know and and that's it's probably

367
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,079
one of the stereotypes and it's i think

368
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:30,720
it was more true in the past um you know

369
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,679
about the sort of heterogeneity of truck

370
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,680
drivers

371
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,519
um they're a really diverse group now

372
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,958
you know there's definitely

373
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,440
a large

374
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:42,239
still a large component of rural white

375
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,399
guys who work in the industry

376
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,159
but there's a huge growing

377
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,440
chunk of the industry that's that's

378
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,799
immigrants

379
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,279
people of color

380
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,039
and even some women still huge barriers

381
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,039
to women women entering it but it's a

382
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,879
much more diverse place than than most

383
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,120
people think

384
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,320
so let's return to your journey as a

385
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,720
truck driver

386
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,320
what uh what did it take to become a

387
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,399
truck driver what were the early days

388
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,639
like yeah so this is i mean this is a

389
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,759
central part of the story right that i

390
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,839
uncovered

391
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,159
and the the good part was that i went in

392
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,040
without knowing what was going to happen

393
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,439
so i i was able to experience it

394
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,000
as a new truck driver would is one of

395
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,079
the important stories in the book is how

396
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,278
that experience is constructed by

397
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,879
employers to sort of you know help you

398
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,159
think the way that they would like you

399
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,399
to think about the job and about the

400
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,360
industry and about the social relations

401
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,120
of it

402
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,440
um it's super intimidating uh

403
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,198
i say in the book you know pretty handy

404
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,880
guy you know familiar with tools

405
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,359
machines like you know comfortable

406
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,639
operating stuff like from from time i

407
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,278
was a kid

408
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,839
the truck was just like a whole other

409
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,399
experience i mean as as i think most

410
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,040
people think about it it's this big huge

411
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,399
vehicle right it's it's really long it's

412
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:02,639
70 feet long it can weigh 80 000 pounds

413
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,839
you know it does not stop like a car it

414
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,919
does not turn like a car um

415
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,399
but at least when i

416
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,838
started um and this this is changing

417
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,958
it's part of the technology story of

418
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,160
trucking

419
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,679
the first thing you had to do was learn

420
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,399
how to shift it

421
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,759
and

422
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,240
it doesn't shift

423
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,240
like a manual car the clutch isn't

424
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,839
synchronized so you have to do what's

425
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,240
called double clutch

426
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,079
and it's it's basically the foundational

427
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,360
skill that a truck driver used to have

428
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,078
to learn

429
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,440
so you would you know accelerate say

430
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,519
you're in first gear

431
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,920
you push in the clutch you pull the

432
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,440
shifter out of first gear you let the

433
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,799
clutch out and then you let the rpms of

434
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,279
the engine drop

435
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,278
an exact amount then you put push the

436
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,159
clutch back in and you put it in second

437
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,039
gear

438
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:53,198
if your timing is off those gears aren't

439
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,879
going to go together and so

440
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,639
if you're in an intersection you're just

441
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,679
going to get this horrible grinding

442
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,440
sound as you coast you know to a dead

443
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,759
stop in the you know underneath the

444
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,440
stoplight or whatever it is so the first

445
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,278
thing you have to do is learn to shift

446
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,519
it and so

447
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,639
at least for me and a lot of drivers who

448
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,240
are going to

449
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,480
private companies cdl schools what

450
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,440
happens is it's kind of like a boot camp

451
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,759
they ship me three states away from home

452
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,000
send you a bus ticket and say hey we'll

453
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,838
put you up for two weeks you sit in a

454
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,120
classroom you sort of learn the theory

455
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,279
of shifting

456
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,360
the you know theory of kind of how you

457
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,879
fill out your logbook

458
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,480
rules of the road

459
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,919
you know you do that maybe half the day

460
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,320
and then the other half you're in this

461
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,719
giant parking lot with one of these old

462
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,040
trucks and just like you know destroying

463
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,440
what's left of the thing you know just

464
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,439
and it's lurching and belching smoke and

465
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,880
just making horrible noises and like

466
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,320
rattling i mean in these things like

467
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,480
there's a lot of torque

468
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,480
and so if you do manage to get it into

469
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,159
gear but the engine's lugging i mean it

470
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
can throw you right out of the seat

471
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,240
right so it's this it's like you know

472
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,879
this bull you're trying to ride and it's

473
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,919
super intimidating um and the thing

474
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,720
about it is that for everybody there

475
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,319
it's

476
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,519
almost everybody there it's super high

477
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,320
stakes

478
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,639
so trucking has become a job of last

479
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,759
resort for a lot of people

480
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,519
and so they you know they lose a job

481
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,759
in manufacturing they

482
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,519
they get too old to do construction any

483
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,839
longer right the knees can no longer

484
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,440
handle it um

485
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,839
they get replaced by a machine their job

486
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,440
gets you know offshored and they end up

487
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,639
going to trucking because

488
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,720
it's a place where they can maintain

489
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,440
their income and so

490
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,800
it's super high stress like they've left

491
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,079
their family behind maybe they quit

492
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,679
another job

493
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,078
they're typically being charged a lot of

494
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,919
money so that first couple weeks like

495
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,439
you might get charged eight thousand

496
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,599
dollars by the company that you have to

497
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,519
pay back if you don't get hired

498
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,320
and so the stakes are high and this

499
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,078
machine is huge and it's intimidating

500
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,879
and so it's super stressful i mean i

501
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,559
watched you know men grown men break

502
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,759
down crying about like how they couldn't

503
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,198
go home and

504
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,879
tell their son that they'd been telling

505
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,558
they were gonna you know go become a

506
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,480
long-haul truck driver that they'd

507
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:09,119
failed and it's kind of this super high

508
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,720
stress system it's designed that way

509
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,038
partly because as one of my trainers

510
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,318
later told me it's basically a two-week

511
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,759
job interview

512
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,279
like they're testing you they're seeing

513
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,000
like you know how's this person going to

514
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,519
respond when it's tough you know when

515
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,640
they have to do the right thing and it's

516
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,000
slow

517
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,759
and you know they need to learn

518
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,759
something are they going to rush

519
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,558
you know or are they going to kind of

520
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,319
stay calm figure it out you know nose to

521
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:33,839
the grindstone because when you're in

522
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,200
your truck driver you're unsupervised

523
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,720
you know and that's what they're really

524
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,440
looking for is that kind of

525
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,759
quality of conscientious work

526
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,919
that's going to carry through to the job

527
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,720
the truck is such an imposing part of a

528
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,960
traffic scenario yeah so you said like

529
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,640
like turning it it stresses me out every

530
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,880
time i look at a truck because they i

531
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,840
mean the geometry of the problem is so

532
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,760
tricky

533
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,439
and so if you combine the fact that they

534
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,720
have to like everybody basically all the

535
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,400
cars in the scene are staring at the

536
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,759
truck and they're waiting often in

537
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,320
frustration

538
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,679
yeah and in that mode you have to then

539
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,960
shift gears

540
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,880
perfectly and move perfectly and if when

541
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,319
you're new especially

542
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,559
like you'll probably for somebody like

543
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,240
me it feels like it would take years to

544
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,399
become calm and comfortable in that

545
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,440
situation as opposed to be exceptionally

546
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,360
stressed under under the eyes of the

547
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,798
the road everybody looking at you

548
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,159
waiting for you is that the

549
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,918
psychological

550
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,000
pressure of that is that something that

551
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,880
was really difficult yeah absolutely

552
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,960
again just i i saw people freeze up you

553
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,360
know in that intersection as you know

554
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,038
horns are blaring and the trucks

555
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,558
grinding you know gears and you just

556
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:41,919
can't you know and they just shut down

557
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,200
they're like this isn't for me i can't

558
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:48,080
do it um you're right it takes years

559
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,840
if you know trucking is not considered a

560
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,798
skilled occupation

561
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,480
but you know my six months there and i i

562
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,879
was a pretty good rookie but when i

563
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,360
finished i was i was still a rookie even

564
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,000
shifting definitely backing

565
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,839
um tight corners and situations you know

566
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,519
i could drive competently

567
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,839
but the difference between me and

568
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,960
someone who had you know two three years

569
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,439
of experience um was

570
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,240
a it was a giant gulf between us and

571
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,080
between that and the really skilled

572
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,480
drivers who've been doing it for 20

573
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,558
years um you know is still another step

574
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,798
beyond that so it is highly skilled

575
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,519
would it be fair to break trucking into

576
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,359
the task of truck of driving a truck to

577
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,200
two categories one is like the local

578
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,519
stuff getting out of the parking lot

579
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,200
getting into getting into you know

580
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,279
driving down local streets and then

581
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,880
highway driving those two

582
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,798
those two tasks

583
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,640
what are the challenges associated with

584
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,519
each task you kind of emphasize the

585
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,720
first one uh what about the actual like

586
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,440
long haul

587
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,558
highway driving yeah so i mean they are

588
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,558
very different right um and and the the

589
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:59,359
key with the long-haul driving is really

590
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,798
a set of um the way i i came to

591
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,479
understand it was

592
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:07,119
a set of habits right um we have a sense

593
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,880
of driving particularly men i think have

594
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,959
a sense of driving as like

595
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,640
being really skilled is like the goal

596
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,720
and you you can kind of maneuver

597
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,440
yourself out of in and out of tight

598
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,120
spaces with great speed and breaking and

599
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,279
acceleration you know um for a really

600
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,439
good truck driver it's about

601
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,519
understanding traffic

602
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,360
and traffic patterns and making good

603
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,319
decisions so you never have to use those

604
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,199
skills

605
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,839
and the really good drivers

606
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,279
you know the the mantra is always leave

607
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,439
yourself an out

608
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,158
right so always have that safe place

609
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,919
that you can put that truck in case that

610
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,919
four-wheeler in front of you who's

611
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,559
texting loses control

612
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,200
um you know what are you going to do

613
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,000
in that in that situation and

614
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,519
what

615
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,720
really good truck drivers do on the

616
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,038
highway

617
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,360
is they just keep themselves out of

618
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:02,400
those situations entirely

619
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,678
they see it they slow down they you know

620
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,080
they avoid it

621
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,759
um and then the local driving is is

622
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,720
really something that takes just

623
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:13,440
practice and routine to learn you know

624
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,120
this quarter turn it feels like the back

625
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,558
of the truck sometimes is on sometimes

626
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:17,599
it's on delay when you're backing it up

627
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,918
so it's like all right i'm going to do a

628
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,240
quarter turn of the wheel now

629
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,720
and to get the effect that i want like

630
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,880
five seconds from now and where that

631
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,960
tail of that trailer is going to be and

632
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,799
there's just no i mean some people have

633
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,720
a natural talent for that you know

634
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,960
spatial visualization and kind of

635
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,759
calculating those angles and everything

636
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,840
but there's really no escaping the fact

637
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,279
that you've gotta just do it over and

638
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,798
over again before you're gonna learn how

639
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,359
to do it well

640
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,519
do you mind sharing how much you were uh

641
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,678
getting paid how much you were making as

642
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,960
a truck driver in your time as a truck

643
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,000
driver yeah i started out at 25 cents a

644
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,240
mile

645
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,960
uh and then i got bumped up to 26 cents

646
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,720
a mile so um

647
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,880
we had a minimum

648
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,480
pay which was sort of a new

649
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,840
pay scheme that the industry had started

650
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,759
to introduce

651
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,000
to you know because there's there's lots

652
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,000
of unpaid work and time

653
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,079
and so we had a minimum pay of 500 a

654
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,480
week that you would you would get if you

655
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,439
didn't drive enough miles to exceed that

656
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,279
um you get paid in sort of

657
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,120
so you get paid when you turn the bills

658
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,918
in which are which is the paperwork that

659
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:28,399
goes with the load so you know you have

660
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,240
to get that back to your company and

661
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,000
then that's how they build a customer

662
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,400
and so you might get a bunch of those

663
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,960
bills that kind of bunch up in one week

664
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,759
so you know i might get a paycheck for

665
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,480
you know 1200 and i mean i was a poor

666
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:45,759
graduate student so this was real real

667
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,919
money to me um and so i i i had this

668
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:51,279
sort of natural incentive to you know

669
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,600
earn a lot uh or to maximize my pay

670
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:54,480
some weeks were that minimum 500 very

671
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,158
few

672
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,159
and then some i'd get 1200 1300 bucks

673
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,080
pay has gone up

674
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,159
you know typical drivers now starting in

675
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:07,279
the 30s you know in the kind of job that

676
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,880
i was in uh 30s you know cents per mile

677
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,359
30 to 35.

678
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,400
so can we can we try to reverse engineer

679
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,399
that math how that maps the actual hours

680
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,919
so there's the hours connected to

681
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,759
driving are so

682
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,679
widely dispersed as you said some of

683
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,599
them don't count as actual work some of

684
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,600
it does that's a very interesting

685
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,879
discussion that we'll then continue when

686
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,918
we start talking about autonomous

687
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,120
trucking

688
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,559
but uh

689
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,798
you know you're saying all these cents

690
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,678
per mile kind of thing what

691
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:38,000
uh how does that map to like hourly

692
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,960
average hourly wage

693
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,119
yeah so i mean and this is kind of the

694
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,960
this is also an interesting technology

695
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,839
story in the end and it's the technology

696
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,558
story that didn't happen um so pay per

697
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,480
mile was you know invented by companies

698
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:53,519
when you couldn't surveil drivers you

699
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,960
didn't know what they were doing right

700
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,918
and you wanted them to have some skin in

701
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,840
the game

702
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,679
and so you'd say you know here's the

703
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,079
load it's going from

704
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,000
you know for me i might start in you

705
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,519
know the northeast maybe in upstate new

706
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,599
york with a load of beer

707
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,440
and say here's this load of beer bring

708
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,519
it to this address in michigan we're

709
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,360
going to pay you by the mile right if i

710
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,359
was being paid by the hour i might just

711
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,399
pull over at the diner and have

712
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:17,119
breakfast

713
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,360
so

714
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,278
you're paid by the mile uh but

715
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,479
increasingly

716
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:23,679
over time

717
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,919
the

718
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,480
the typical driver is spending more and

719
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,159
more time doing non-driving tasks lots

720
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,480
of reasons for that

721
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,400
one of which is railroads captured a lot

722
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,000
of freight that goes long distances now

723
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,080
another one is traffic congest

724
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,919
congestion um and the other one is that

725
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,918
drivers are pretty cheap and they're

726
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,320
they're almost always the low people on

727
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,559
the totem pole in some segments

728
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:50,240
and so their time is used really

729
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:53,440
inefficiently um so i might go to that

730
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,640
brewery to pick up that load of of bud

731
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,679
light

732
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,720
and you know their doc staff may may be

733
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,038
busy

734
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,038
loading up five other trucks and they'll

735
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,640
say you know go over there and sit and

736
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,400
wait we'll we'll call you on the cb when

737
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,759
the dock's ready so you wait there a

738
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,440
couple hours

739
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,720
they bring you in you know you never

740
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,080
know what's happening in the truck

741
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,240
sometimes they're loading it with a

742
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,240
forklift maybe they're throwing 14

743
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,000
pallets on there full of kegs but

744
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,278
sometimes it'll take them hours

745
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,519
you know and you're sitting in that

746
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:22,558
truck and you're you're essentially

747
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,679
unpaid

748
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,079
you know

749
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,080
then you pull out you've got control

750
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,079
over what you're gonna get paid based on

751
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:31,278
how you drive that load um and then on

752
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,199
the other end

753
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,759
you got a similar situation of kind of

754
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,000
waiting so so if that's the way truck

755
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,558
drivers are paid then there's a low

756
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,960
incentive for the optimization of the

757
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,759
supply chain to make them more efficient

758
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,880
right to uh to utilize truck labor more

759
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,919
efficiently

760
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,640
absolutely

761
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,038
and so that's the technology uh problem

762
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,840
that uh one of several technology

763
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:57,200
problems that could be

764
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:58,480
addressed um

765
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,640
i mean

766
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,558
what so what did uh

767
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,480
if we just linger on it what are we

768
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,359
talking about in terms of

769
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,519
uh dollars per hour is it close to

770
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,079
minimum wage is it you know there's

771
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,119
something you talk about there was a

772
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,918
uh

773
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,479
a conception or a misconception

774
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,559
that uh truckers get paid a lot

775
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,679
for their work do they get paid a lot

776
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:22,798
for their work

777
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,880
some do

778
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,639
uh and i think that's

779
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,960
part of the complexity so you know what

780
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,278
interested me as an ethnographer about

781
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,120
this was you know i'm interested in the

782
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,679
kind of economic conceptions that people

783
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,359
have in their heads and and how they

784
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,519
lead to certain decisions in labor

785
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,918
markets you know why some people become

786
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,480
an entrepreneur and and other people

787
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,840
become a wage laborer or you know why

788
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,599
some people want to be doctors and other

789
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,158
people want to be truck drivers

790
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,519
that conception right is is getting

791
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,760
shaped in these labor markets is the

792
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,720
argument of of the book

793
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,359
and

794
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,200
the fact that drivers can hear or

795
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:00,879
potential drivers can hear about these

796
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,558
you know workers who make a hundred

797
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,000
thousand dollars plus which which

798
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:05,200
happens regularly in the trucking

799
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,798
industry there are

800
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,200
many truck drivers who make more than a

801
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,918
hundred thousand dollars a year um you

802
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,880
know is an attraction but the industry's

803
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,520
highly segmented um and and so

804
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,679
the entry level segment and and we can

805
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,599
probably get into this but you know the

806
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,320
industry is dominated by

807
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,959
uh you know a few dozen really large

808
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:29,278
companies that are self-insured and can

809
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,278
train new drivers so if you want those

810
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:32,640
good jobs you've got to have several

811
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,319
years

812
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,600
up until recently now the labor market's

813
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,918
becoming tighter but you had to have

814
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,879
several years of accident-free

815
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,038
you know

816
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,559
perfectly clean record driving to get

817
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,398
into them

818
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,079
the other part of the segment you know

819
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:47,678
those drivers often don't make minimum

820
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,199
wage

821
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,360
but this leads to one of the sort of

822
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,759
central issues that has been in the

823
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,240
courts and in the legislature

824
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,839
um in some states

825
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,038
is you know what should truck drivers

826
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:03,519
get paid for right the industry you know

827
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:05,759
for the last 30 years or so has said

828
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,240
essentially it's the hours that they log

829
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:09,759
for safety reasons for the department of

830
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,200
transportation

831
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,119
right

832
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,399
now since the drivers are paid by the

833
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,479
mile

834
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,558
they try to minimize those because those

835
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,679
hours are limited by the federal

836
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:21,839
government so the federal government

837
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,320
says you can't drive more than 60 hours

838
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,918
in a week as a long-haul truck driver

839
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,639
and so you want to drive as many miles

840
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,640
as you can in those 60 hours and so you

841
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,679
under report them

842
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,399
right

843
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,640
and so what happens is the companies say

844
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,519
well that guy you know he only said he

845
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,520
logged 45 hours of work that week or 50

846
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,440
hours of work that's all we have to pay

847
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,200
him minimum wage for

848
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,440
when in fact typical truck driver in

849
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,120
these in these jobs will work according

850
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,320
to most people would sort of define it

851
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,678
as like okay i'm at the customer

852
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:53,918
location i'm waiting to load i'm doing

853
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,360
some paperwork you know i'm inspecting

854
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,278
the truck i'm feeling it

855
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,158
um just waiting to you know get put in

856
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:02,720
the dock 80 to 90 hours would be sort of

857
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,278
a typical work week for one of these

858
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,720
these drivers um just when you look at

859
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:08,798
that does they don't make minimum wage

860
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,519
oftentimes right just to be clear what

861
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,200
we're dancing around here is that a

862
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,679
little bit over a little bit under

863
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,759
minimum wage is nevertheless most

864
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,200
truck drivers seem to be making close to

865
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:20,879
minimum wage

866
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,759
like this is this

867
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,080
so like we maybe haven't made that clear

868
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,720
there's a there's a few that make quite

869
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:31,278
a bit of money but like you're

870
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,600
as an entry and for years you're

871
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:36,960
operating essentially

872
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,639
uh minimum wage and potentially far less

873
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,720
than minimum wage if you actually count

874
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,038
the number of hours

875
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,600
that are taken out of your life due to

876
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:47,839
your dedication to trucking

877
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,319
well if you count like the hours taken

878
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,558
out of your life um then you got to go

879
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,200
you know maybe a full 24.

880
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:58,240
that's right yeah from family from yeah

881
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,278
from the high quality of life parts of

882
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,519
your life

883
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,759
yeah and there's a whole nother set of

884
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,398
rules that the department of labor has

885
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,558
which basically say that a truck driver

886
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,479
who's dispatched away from home

887
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,480
for more than a day should get minimum

888
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,599
wage 24 hours

889
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,319
a day and that could be a state minimum

890
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,398
wage but typically what it would work

891
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:22,558
out to for most drivers is that you know

892
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:25,038
a minimum the minimum wage for a truck

893
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,678
driver should be 50s to thousands you

894
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,960
know 55 60 000 should be the minimum

895
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,080
wage of a truck driver and you've

896
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,440
probably heard about the truck driver

897
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,599
shortage like if you know uh which i

898
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,919
hope we can talk about um

899
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:40,158
if the minimum wage for truck drivers is

900
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,679
as it should be on the books at you know

901
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,799
around sixty thousand dollars we

902
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:44,159
wouldn't have a shortage of truck

903
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,240
drivers

904
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,799
oh wow

905
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,200
and to me sixty thousand is not a lot of

906
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,240
money for this kind of job

907
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,840
because you're

908
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,399
this isn't

909
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,918
this is essentially two jobs

910
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:02,000
and two jobs where you don't get to

911
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,360
sleep with your wife or see your kids

912
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,159
at night

913
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:09,439
that's 60 000 is a very little money for

914
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,440
that but you're saying if it was 60 000

915
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,960
you wouldn't even have the shortage if

916
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,960
that was the minimum if that was the

917
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,519
minimum and i think that's what now we

918
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,079
have drivers who start in the 30s

919
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,240
um wow but yeah and i mean so we're

920
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,759
talking two three jobs really when you

921
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,359
look at the total hours that people are

922
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,879
working it you know

923
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,038
they can work over a hundred if they're

924
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,799
a trainer you know um training other

925
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,679
truck drivers well over a hundred hours

926
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,158
a week

927
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,360
so a job of last resort

928
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,600
maybe you can

929
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,678
jump around from tangent to tangent this

930
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,519
is such a fascinating

931
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,880
and difficult topic

932
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,599
i heard that there's a shortage of

933
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,679
truck drivers so there's more jobs than

934
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,359
truck drivers willing to take on the job

935
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,120
is that the state of

936
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,879
affairs currently

937
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,918
i mean i think the way that you you just

938
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,919
put that is is right

939
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,038
we don't have a shortage of people who

940
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,559
are currently licensed to do the jobs so

941
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,000
i'm working on a project for the state

942
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,839
of california to look at the shortage of

943
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,359
agricultural drivers and the the first

944
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,678
thing that

945
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,558
the dmv commissioner of the state wanted

946
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,320
to

947
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:15,918
look at was you know is there actually a

948
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,158
shortage of licensed drivers he's like

949
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,600
i've got a database here of all the

950
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,039
people who have a commercial driver's

951
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,079
license who could potentially have the

952
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:27,038
credential to do this um

953
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:30,079
there are about 145 000

954
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:32,398
jobs in california that require a

955
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,678
class a cdl which would be that that

956
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:35,278
commercial driver's license that you

957
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,159
need for the big trucks

958
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:39,519
um

959
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,440
about 145 000 jobs the industry in their

960
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,798
you know regular

961
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,960
promotion of the idea that there's a

962
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,679
shortage is always projecting forward

963
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,399
and says you know we're going to need

964
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:53,200
165 000 or so in the next 10 years

965
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,518
they're currently like 435 000 people

966
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,080
licensed in the state of california to

967
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,679
drive one of these big trucks so so it

968
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:03,519
is not at all an absence of people who

969
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,519
i mean and again going back to what we

970
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,038
were talking about before

971
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,599
getting that license is not something

972
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:12,000
that you just walk down to the dmv and

973
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,918
take the test like this is somebody who

974
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,759
probably quit another job

975
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,360
was unemployed

976
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,919
and took months

977
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:22,240
to go to a training school right paid

978
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,640
for that training school oftentimes left

979
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,558
their family for months right invested

980
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,880
in what they thought was going to be a

981
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:31,678
long-term career and then said you know

982
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,440
what forget it i can't i can't do it you

983
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,679
know

984
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,440
so yeah so it's not just skill it's like

985
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,200
they were psychologically invested

986
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,919
potentially from months if not years

987
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,080
into this kind of position as perhaps a

988
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,080
position that if they lose their current

989
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,918
job they could fall to

990
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,439
okay so that's an indication that

991
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,320
there's something deeply wrong with the

992
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,000
job

993
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,240
if so many licensed people are not

994
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,240
willing to take it what are the biggest

995
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,120
problems of

996
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,120
uh the job of truck driver currently

997
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,359
yeah the the job the problems with the

998
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,759
job and the labor market right but let's

999
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,359
um let's start with the job which is you

1000
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,679
know again

1001
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:11,598
just so much time that's that's not

1002
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,398
compensated directly for the amount of

1003
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,119
time

1004
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:16,719
um and that's just psychologically and

1005
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,639
this was a big part of what i you know

1006
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,678
sort of i studied and for the first book

1007
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,399
was

1008
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,960
you know

1009
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,000
that conception of like what's my time

1010
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,358
worth

1011
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
right and like

1012
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:30,319
what truck drivers love is

1013
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,199
oftentimes is that tangible

1014
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:36,240
uh outcome-based compensation so they

1015
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:38,398
say you know what you know honest days

1016
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,719
work i work hard i get paid for what i

1017
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,398
do i drive 500 miles today that's what

1018
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,239
i'm gonna get paid for

1019
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,799
and then you get to that dock and they

1020
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:49,598
tell you sorry the load's not ready

1021
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,720
go sit over there and you stew

1022
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,399
and that weight can break you

1023
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:54,559
psychologically because your

1024
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:58,319
your uh your time

1025
00:34:54,559 --> 00:35:00,000
every second becomes more worthless yeah

1026
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,160
or worth less

1027
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,199
yeah and again the the industry's gonna

1028
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,399
say

1029
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,759
for instance

1030
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,119
okay well you know they've got skin in

1031
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,839
the game right that argument about sort

1032
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,760
of compensation based on sort of output

1033
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,358
right um but that's a holdover from when

1034
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,200
you couldn't observe truckers now they

1035
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,960
all have you know satellite-linked

1036
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,399
computers in the trucks that tell these

1037
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,559
large companies

1038
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,639
this driver was you know at this gps

1039
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,880
location for four and a half hours right

1040
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,559
so if you wanted to compensate them for

1041
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,240
that time directly and the trucker can't

1042
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,838
control what's happening on that

1043
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,919
customer location you know they're

1044
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:34,960
waiting for that you know firm that

1045
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,159
customer to tell them hey pull in there

1046
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,079
and so

1047
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,639
what it becomes is just a way to shift

1048
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,440
the inefficiencies and the cost of that

1049
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:46,239
onto that onto that driver

1050
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,079
no it's competitive for customers so if

1051
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:49,759
you're walmart you might have your

1052
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,119
choice of a dozen different

1053
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,000
trucking companies that could move your

1054
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,920
stuff

1055
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,079
and if one of them tells you hey you're

1056
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,240
not moving our trucks in and out of your

1057
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,079
docks fast enough we're going to charge

1058
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,838
you for how long our truck is sitting on

1059
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,359
your lot if you're walmart you're going

1060
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:04,880
to say i'll go see what the other guy

1061
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,519
says right

1062
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,358
and so companies are going to allow that

1063
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,119
customer to essentially waste that

1064
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,719
driver's time

1065
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,559
you know in order to to keep that

1066
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,719
business

1067
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:18,400
can you try to describe the economics

1068
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:20,959
the labor market of the situation you

1069
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,039
mentioned freight and railroad

1070
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,838
what is the

1071
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,838
sort of the

1072
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:29,759
dynamic uh financials the economics of

1073
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:31,199
this that allow for

1074
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,119
such

1075
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,598
low

1076
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,519
low salaries to be paid to truckers like

1077
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,200
what what's the competition what's the

1078
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:42,000
alternative to

1079
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:43,519
transporting goods via trucks like what

1080
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,838
seems to be broken here from an

1081
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:48,639
economics perspective yeah so it's uh

1082
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,519
well nothing it's it's it's a perfect

1083
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,679
market

1084
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,519
okay right i mean so for economists this

1085
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,279
is how it should work right um but the

1086
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:59,280
inefficiencies like you said sorry to

1087
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,599
interrupt are pushed to the truck driver

1088
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,599
doesn't that like spiral doesn't that

1089
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,440
lead to a poor performance on the part

1090
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,838
of the truck driver and just like make

1091
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,838
the whole thing more and more

1092
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:12,159
inefficient in it and it results in

1093
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,639
lower payment to the truck driver and so

1094
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:16,879
on it just feels like

1095
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:19,679
in capitalism

1096
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,760
you should have a competing solution

1097
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,598
in terms of uh truck drivers like

1098
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,920
another company that provides

1099
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,599
transportation via trucks that are that

1100
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,400
creates a much better experience for

1101
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,838
truck drivers making them more efficient

1102
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,599
all those kinds of things

1103
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,639
or how is the competition being

1104
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,440
suppressed here yeah so it is the

1105
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:41,358
competition is based on who's cheaper um

1106
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,119
and this is this is the cheapest way to

1107
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:44,960
move the freight now you know they're

1108
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,000
externalities right i mean this so this

1109
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,880
is the

1110
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,960
explanation that i think is is obvious

1111
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,838
for this right there there are lots of

1112
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,679
um

1113
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:55,119
there are lots of costs that you know

1114
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,440
whether it's that driver's time whether

1115
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,838
it's the you know um time without their

1116
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,679
family whether it's the you know

1117
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,880
the fact that they drive through

1118
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,399
congestion and and spew lots of diesel

1119
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,400
particulates into

1120
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,480
cities where kids have asthma and make

1121
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,480
our commutes longer rather than more

1122
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,000
efficiently use their time by sort of

1123
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,838
routing them around

1124
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
congestion and rush hour and things like

1125
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:22,239
that um it this is the cheapest way to

1126
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,320
to move freight um and so it's it's the

1127
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,679
most competitive a big part of this is

1128
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,000
public subsidy

1129
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:29,759
of training so when those workers are

1130
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,800
not paying for

1131
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,240
um the training you and i often are

1132
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,359
so if you you know lose your job because

1133
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:42,639
of um you know foreign trade or

1134
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:46,799
um you're you're a veteran using your gi

1135
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:48,239
benefits um you may very well be offered

1136
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,000
you know training

1137
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,078
publicly subsidized training to become a

1138
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,639
truck driver and so all these are

1139
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,000
externalities that you know the the

1140
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:57,440
companies don't have to pay for and so

1141
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,559
this makes it the most profitable way to

1142
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,400
move freight

1143
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,880
so trucks is

1144
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,200
way cheaper than uh trains

1145
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,760
well over the long so one of the big

1146
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:10,078
stories for these for these companies is

1147
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,359
that the average length of haul um which

1148
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,519
which becomes very important for

1149
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:16,319
self-driving trucks the average length

1150
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:19,519
of haul has been steadily declining

1151
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,359
um over the last 15 years or so you know

1152
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:22,639
this industry collected data from sort

1153
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,880
of the you know the big firms that

1154
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,279
report it but you know roughly been cut

1155
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:32,720
in half from typically about a thousand

1156
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:36,160
miles to under 500. um and under 500 is

1157
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,118
what a driver can move in a day right so

1158
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:38,239
you can get

1159
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,760
loaded

1160
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:44,399
drive and unload you know around 400

1161
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,480
miles or something like that

1162
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,000
i'm gonna steal a good question from the

1163
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,599
pen gazette

1164
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,358
interview you did which people should

1165
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,838
read it's a great interview

1166
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,639
was there a golden age for long-haul

1167
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:59,440
truckers in america and if so this is

1168
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:01,440
just a journalistic question and if so

1169
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,480
what enabled it and what brought it to

1170
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,318
an end

1171
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,318
wow i i might have to have you read my

1172
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,079
answer to that

1173
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:09,279
that was a few years ago be interesting

1174
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,599
to compare

1175
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,400
what i'll say but um i mean one bigger

1176
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,480
question to ask i guess is like

1177
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,639
uh you know johnny cash wrote a lot of

1178
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,760
songs about truckers there used to be a

1179
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,559
time

1180
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,480
when um perhaps falsely perhaps it's

1181
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,318
part of the kind of perception that you

1182
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,800
study with the labor markets and so on

1183
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,559
there was a perception of truckers being

1184
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,920
first of all a lucrative job and second

1185
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,318
of all a job

1186
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,159
uh to be desired

1187
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:37,679
yeah so i mean

1188
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,679
this is a

1189
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:41,039
the trucking industry to me is is

1190
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,078
fascinating but i think it should be

1191
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:47,199
fascinating to a lot of people um so the

1192
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,440
the golden age was really two different

1193
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,439
kinds of um

1194
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,039
of markets as well right today we have

1195
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,240
really good jobs and and some really bad

1196
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:59,440
jobs uh we had the teamsters union that

1197
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:02,559
that controlled the vast majority of

1198
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,760
employee jobs and even where they had

1199
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:07,440
they had something called the national

1200
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,440
master freight agreement and this was um

1201
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,240
you know jimmy hoffa who who led the

1202
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,920
union through its its sort of critical

1203
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:17,679
um period by

1204
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,559
the mid 60s had unified essentially the

1205
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:24,000
entire nations trucking labor force

1206
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:26,159
under one contract now you were either

1207
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,239
you know covered by that contract or

1208
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:29,358
your employer paid a lot of attention to

1209
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,879
it

1210
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:35,039
and so by the end of the 1970s

1211
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,400
the typical truck driver was making well

1212
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:37,920
more than a hundred thousand dollar

1213
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,200
typical truck driver was making more

1214
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:42,800
than a hundred thousand dollars in

1215
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:45,199
today's dollars and was home every night

1216
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,440
that was without a doubt

1217
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:51,519
and even more than unionized auto

1218
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,838
workers steel workers um 10 20 more than

1219
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,759
than those workers made

1220
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:58,000
that was the golden age force of job

1221
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,240
quality wages teamster power they were

1222
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,039
without a doubt the most powerful union

1223
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:05,679
in the united states at that time

1224
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:07,039
at the same time in the 1970s you had

1225
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,279
the um

1226
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:11,519
the mythic long-haul trucker

1227
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,839
and these were the guys who were you

1228
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,358
know kind of on the margins of the

1229
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:17,119
regulated market which is what the

1230
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,440
teamsters controlled a lot of them were

1231
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,280
in agriculture which was never regulated

1232
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,039
so in the new deal when they decided to

1233
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,400
regulate trucking they didn't regulate

1234
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,318
agriculture because they didn't want to

1235
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,400
drive up food prices which would hurt

1236
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:30,400
workers in urban areas so they

1237
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,160
essentially left agricultural

1238
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,358
truckers out of it

1239
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,559
and that's where a lot of the kind of

1240
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:36,000
outlaw

1241
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,239
you know uh

1242
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,800
uh asphalt cowboy

1243
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,959
um you know imagery that we get

1244
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,880
and um you know i grew up i know you

1245
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,960
didn't grow up in in the us at this sort

1246
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,800
of you know as a young child

1247
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,358
when and i'm a bit older than you but

1248
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,480
you know in the late 70s you know there

1249
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:56,880
were movies and tv shows and cbs were

1250
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,880
crazed and and it was all these kind of

1251
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,640
outlaw truckers who were out there

1252
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,079
hauling some unregulated freight they

1253
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,480
weren't supposed to be trying to avoid

1254
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:07,200
the bears you know who are the cops and

1255
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,599
um you know with all this salty language

1256
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:11,679
and these like you know um terms that

1257
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,680
only they understood and you know the

1258
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,838
partying at diners and popping pills you

1259
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,078
know the california turnarounds so

1260
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,239
asphalt cowboys truly

1261
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,960
so yeah it's like another form of cowboy

1262
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,919
movies oh absolutely yeah absolutely and

1263
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,920
i think

1264
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,519
that sort of masculine ethos of like

1265
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,440
you got 40 000 pounds of something you

1266
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,559
care about i'm your guy you know you

1267
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,720
need it to go from new york to

1268
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,880
california don't worry about it i got it

1269
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,399
yeah that's appealing and it's tangible

1270
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,559
right you think about people who don't

1271
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,400
want to be paper pusher and they deal

1272
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,440
with office politics like just give me

1273
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,440
what you care about and i'll take care

1274
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,440
of it you know just pay me fair you know

1275
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,358
uh and that that appeals you mentioned

1276
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,440
unions teamsters jimmy hoffa

1277
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,679
big question maybe difficult question

1278
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,838
what are some pros and cons of unions

1279
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,719
historically and today in the trucking

1280
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:00,318
space

1281
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,759
yeah um

1282
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:04,159
well if you're you're a worker there

1283
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,839
there are a lot of pros um and i don't

1284
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:07,598
you know and this is one of the things i

1285
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:09,440
talked to truckers about a lot yeah

1286
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,680
what's their perception of jimmy hoffa

1287
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,000
for example and of unions

1288
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,279
yeah so and this was probably one of the

1289
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,280
central

1290
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,359
hypotheses that i had going in there and

1291
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,200
it may sound you know um

1292
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:23,598
someone who does hard science right you

1293
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,199
mean if they hear a social scientist you

1294
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,119
know sort of use that terminology even

1295
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:29,199
other social scientists hypothesis yeah

1296
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:31,838
you know they they don't like it but i i

1297
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:34,159
do like to think that way and my initial

1298
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:35,199
hypothesis was that you know and it's

1299
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,078
very simple

1300
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,239
that you know that the tenure of the

1301
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,200
driver in the industry would have a

1302
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,879
strong effect on how they viewed unions

1303
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,118
that you know somebody who had

1304
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,838
experienced unions would be more

1305
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,200
favorable and someone who had not would

1306
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:53,440
not be right

1307
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,639
um and that turned out to be the the

1308
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,960
case

1309
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:57,920
without a doubt but in in an interesting

1310
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,159
way

1311
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,318
which was that even the drivers who were

1312
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:05,440
not part of the union

1313
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,960
um who in the in the kind of

1314
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,000
public debate

1315
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,440
of

1316
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,760
deregulation

1317
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,440
uh were portrayed as these kind of small

1318
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,400
business truckers who were getting shut

1319
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,920
out by the big regulated monopolies and

1320
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,519
the teamsters union you know the corrupt

1321
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,920
teamsters union

1322
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:23,920
even those drivers longed for the days

1323
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,800
of the teamsters

1324
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,119
because they recognized the overall

1325
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,599
market impact that they had that that

1326
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,480
trucking just naturally

1327
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,559
tended toward excessive competition that

1328
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,880
meant that there was no profit to be

1329
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:42,480
made and oftentimes you'd be operating

1330
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,640
at a loss and so even these you know the

1331
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,480
asphalt cowboy owner operators from back

1332
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,799
in the day would tell me when the

1333
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,000
teamsters were in power i made a lot

1334
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,400
more money

1335
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,800
um and you know this is

1336
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,119
you know unions at least those kinds of

1337
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,160
unions like like the teamsters

1338
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,079
you know

1339
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:01,759
there's i think a lot of misconceptions

1340
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,680
today sort of popularly about what

1341
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,720
unions did back then

1342
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:09,519
they tied wages to productivity like

1343
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:11,838
that was the central thing that the

1344
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:14,000
teamsters union did and you know there

1345
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,759
were great accounts of sort of jimmy

1346
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,800
hoffa's perspective

1347
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,319
for all his portrayal as sort of corrupt

1348
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,400
and criminal and there's you know i'm

1349
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:24,318
not disputing that he broke a lot of

1350
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,318
laws um

1351
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:27,440
he was remarkably open

1352
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:29,920
about

1353
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,079
who he was and what he did he actually

1354
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,760
invited a pair a husband and wife team

1355
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,760
of harvard economists

1356
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,000
to follow him around

1357
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,960
and like opened up the teamsters books

1358
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,760
to them

1359
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,240
so that they could see how he was you

1360
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,359
know thinking about negotiating with the

1361
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,358
employers

1362
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:51,358
and the teamsters and this goes back

1363
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:53,039
well before hoffa back to the you know

1364
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,960
1800s

1365
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,639
they understood that

1366
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,318
workers did better if their employers

1367
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:59,838
did better and the only way the

1368
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,759
employers would do better was if they

1369
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,759
controlled the market

1370
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,319
and so oftentimes the corruption and

1371
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,920
trucking was initiated by employers who

1372
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:09,519
wanted to limit competition and they

1373
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,119
knew they couldn't limit competition

1374
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:12,960
without the support of labor and so

1375
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,519
you'd get these collusive arrangements

1376
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,199
between employers and labor to say no

1377
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:19,199
new trucking companies

1378
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,279
there are 10 of us that's enough we

1379
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:24,639
control seattle we're going to set the

1380
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,720
price and we're not going to be undercut

1381
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:29,039
when there's a shortage of trucks around

1382
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,838
it's great rates rates go up but you get

1383
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,000
too many trucks it's very often that you

1384
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:36,000
end up operating at a loss just to keep

1385
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,920
the doors open you know you don't have

1386
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,760
any choice you can't it's what

1387
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,280
economists call derived demand you can't

1388
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,720
like make up a bunch of trucking

1389
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,640
services and store it in a warehouse

1390
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:46,959
right you gotta you gotta keep those

1391
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,118
trucks moving to pay the bills

1392
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,280
can we also lay out the kind of jobs

1393
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,119
that are in trucking what are the best

1394
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,200
jobs in trucking what are the worst jobs

1395
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,800
in trucking what are we how many jobs

1396
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:00,879
we're talking about today

1397
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,920
yeah uh and what kind of jobs are there

1398
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,599
so

1399
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,240
um there there are a number of different

1400
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,160
segments and the the sir the first part

1401
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:09,598
would be you know are you offering the

1402
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,078
first question would be are you offering

1403
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,079
services to the public or are you moving

1404
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,680
your own freight right so are you

1405
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,119
a retailer say walmart um or uh you know

1406
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:20,879
a paper company or something like that

1407
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,920
that's operating your own

1408
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,960
uh fleet of trucks that's private

1409
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,119
um

1410
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,880
trucking for hire

1411
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,559
are are the folks who you know offer

1412
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,480
their services out to other other

1413
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:36,640
customers so you have private and for

1414
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,159
hire in general for hire uh pays pays

1415
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:39,759
less

1416
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:41,598
is that because of the something you

1417
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,520
talk about what employee versus

1418
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:48,880
contractor situation or are they all

1419
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:51,119
tricked or led to become contractors

1420
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,838
that can become a part of it um as a

1421
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,640
strategy but the the fundamental reason

1422
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:59,119
is competition so those private carriers

1423
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,558
don't um aren't in competition with

1424
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,880
other trucking fleets right for their

1425
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:05,359
own in-house services yeah so you know

1426
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,599
they tend to and and this you know if

1427
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:09,759
the question of why private versus for

1428
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:12,800
hire because for hire is cheaper right

1429
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:15,200
um and so if you need that if that

1430
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,280
trucking service is central to what you

1431
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:19,118
do and you cannot afford disruptions or

1432
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,720
volatility in the price of it you keep

1433
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,240
it in-house you should be willing to pay

1434
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:23,838
more for that because it's more valuable

1435
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,519
too and you keep it in-house and that so

1436
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:27,358
that's an interesting distinction what

1437
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,358
about and this is kind of moving towards

1438
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:30,480
our conversation what can and can't be

1439
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:31,759
automated

1440
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,679
um

1441
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,160
how else does it divide

1442
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:38,239
yeah the the different trucking jobs so

1443
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,639
it's the next big chunk is kind of how

1444
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:43,679
much stuff are you moving right

1445
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:44,960
and so we have what's called truckload

1446
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,759
and truckload means you know you can

1447
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,559
fill up a trailer either by volume or by

1448
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,480
weight and then less than truckload less

1449
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,440
than truckload the official definition

1450
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,559
is like less than ten thousand pounds

1451
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,639
you know this is going to be a couple

1452
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,880
pallets of this a couple pallets of that

1453
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,960
the process looks really different right

1454
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,079
so that truckload is you know point a to

1455
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,880
point b

1456
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,599
i'm buying you know a truckload of of

1457
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,000
bounty paper towels i'm bringing it into

1458
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,920
you know my distribution center go pick

1459
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,519
it up at the at the bounty plant bring

1460
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,000
it to my distribution center right

1461
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,838
nowhere in between do you stop um at

1462
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,318
least process that freight less than

1463
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:23,838
truckload what you've got is terminal

1464
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:25,920
systems and this is what you had under

1465
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:27,358
under regulation too

1466
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,039
and so these terminal systems what you

1467
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:31,838
do is you do a bunch of local pickup and

1468
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:33,440
delivery maybe with smaller trucks

1469
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:35,358
and you pick up two pallets of this here

1470
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,280
four pallets of this there you bring it

1471
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:39,920
to the terminal you combine it based on

1472
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:43,200
the destination you then create a full

1473
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,639
truckload you know um uh trailer and you

1474
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,879
send it to another terminal where it

1475
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:48,318
gets broken back down and then and then

1476
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,200
out for local delivery that's gonna look

1477
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:54,239
a lot like if you send a package by

1478
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:55,679
by ups right they pick all these parcels

1479
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:57,519
right figure out where they're all going

1480
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,960
put them on planes or or in trailers

1481
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:00,239
going to the same destination then break

1482
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,639
them out to put them in what what they

1483
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:05,679
call package cars

1484
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:08,318
before i ask you uh about autonomous

1485
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:11,199
trucks it's just pause for um your

1486
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:13,199
experience as a trucker

1487
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:15,519
did it get lonely like can you talk

1488
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:17,838
about some of your experiences of what

1489
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:20,079
it was actually like did it get lonely

1490
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:21,759
yeah no i mean it was um

1491
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:25,039
i didn't have kids at the time now now i

1492
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,440

1493
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:28,719
uh you know i've been married for

1494
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,200
five years

1495
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:34,399
at the time my wife hated it i hated it

1496
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,879
uh you know i describe in the book

1497
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,760
the experience of being stuck

1498
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,599
if i remember correctly was like ohio

1499
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,800
uh at this truck stop in the middle of

1500
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:47,200
nowhere and like you know sitting on

1501
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,960
this concrete barrier and just watching

1502
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:51,838
fireworks in the distance and like

1503
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,679
eating chinese food on the 4th of july

1504
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:55,279
and you know my wife calls me from like

1505
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:57,358
the family barbecue

1506
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,200
and our anniversary is july 8th and

1507
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:00,159
she's like are you gonna be home and i'm

1508
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:02,159
like

1509
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:03,118
i don't know you know

1510
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:04,480
um

1511
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,000
i have a

1512
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,559
uh cousin

1513
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,318
whose husband drove

1514
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,000
drove truck as a truck driver would say

1515
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:13,358
drove truck for a while

1516
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,358
um

1517
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,519
and he told me before i went into it he

1518
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:19,119
was like the the advantage you have is

1519
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:20,960
that you know that you're not going to

1520
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,480
be doing this long term

1521
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,960
like and lex i can't even like

1522
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,199
the emotional content of some of these

1523
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,039
interviews i mean i would sit down at a

1524
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,759
truck stop with somebody i had never met

1525
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:36,639
before and you know you open the spigot

1526
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,400
and the the the last question i would

1527
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:40,159
ask drivers was

1528
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,200
that by the time i really sort of

1529
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:43,199
figured out how to do it the last

1530
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:45,919
question i i would ask them is you know

1531
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:49,439
what advice would you give to somebody

1532
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,119
your nephew you know a family friend

1533
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,559
asks you about what it's like to be a

1534
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,000
driver and should they do it what advice

1535
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,000
would you give them

1536
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,679
and this question

1537
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,800
some of these you know grizzled old

1538
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:03,118
drivers you know tough tough guys

1539
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,119
would that question would like some of

1540
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,720
them would break down and they would say

1541
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,358
i would say to them

1542
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:11,598
you better have everything that you ever

1543
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:12,558
wanted in life already

1544
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,720
because

1545
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:17,519
i've had a car that i've had for 10

1546
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,318
years it's got 7000 miles on it i own a

1547
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,759
boat

1548
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:25,039
that hasn't seen the water in five years

1549
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,200
my kids i didn't raise them like i i'd

1550
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,480
be out for two weeks at a time

1551
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,480
i'd come home

1552
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,960
my my wife would give me two kids to

1553
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,480
punish a list of things to do you know

1554
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,318
on saturday night

1555
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,559
and i might leave out sunday night or

1556
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:41,679
monday morning you know i come home dead

1557
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:44,559
tired my kids don't know who i am

1558
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:46,318
and you know it was just like

1559
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,800
it was heartbreaking to hear those

1560
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,800
stories and before you know it

1561
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,400
uh you know life is short and just the

1562
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,559
years run away

1563
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,559
yeah

1564
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:00,559
hard question to ask in that context but

1565
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,838
what's the best what was the best part

1566
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,839
of being a truck driver

1567
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:09,280
was there moments uh that you truly

1568
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,719
enjoyed on the road oh absolutely there

1569
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,559
was um

1570
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:14,639
there's definitely a pride and mastery

1571
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,880
of you know even basic confidence of

1572
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:18,480
sort of piloting this thing safely

1573
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,200
there's a lot of responsibility to it

1574
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,358
that thing's dangerous and you know it

1575
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:25,439
so there's there's some pride there for

1576
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,598
me personally and i know for a lot of

1577
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,440
other drivers it's just like seeing

1578
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,680
these behind the scenes places that you

1579
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,400
know exist in our economy

1580
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:37,838
um and i think we're all much more aware

1581
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,599
of them now after covet and supply chain

1582
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:41,519
mess that we have i don't know if we'll

1583
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,960
talk about that but you know

1584
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:44,960
you get to see those places you know you

1585
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,639
get to see those ports you get to see

1586
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,880
the the place where they make the

1587
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:51,440
cardboard boxes that the huggy diapers

1588
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:54,318
go in huggies diapers going or the

1589
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:56,880
warehouse full of bud light i moved bud

1590
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:59,279
light from like upstate new york and the

1591
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,358
first load like went to atlanta

1592
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,680
you know and then a couple months later

1593
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:06,880
i circled back through that same brewery

1594
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,159
and i brought a load of bud light out to

1595
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,400
michigan

1596
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,960
and i was like holy all the bud

1597
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,559
light like you know for this whole giant

1598
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,798
swath of the united states comes from

1599
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,119
this one plant this cavernous plant with

1600
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,880
like kegs of beer and you see that part

1601
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,680
of the economy and it's like you're

1602
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,000
almost like you're an economic tourist

1603
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:27,519
um and i think all everybody kind of

1604
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,679
appreciates that like kind of it's

1605
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:30,480
almost like a behind-the-scenes tour

1606
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:32,318
um

1607
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,159
that wears off after a few months you

1608
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:36,000
know you start to see new things less

1609
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:37,838
and less frequently at first

1610
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,838
everything's novel and sort of life on

1611
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:42,400
the road and then it becomes just

1612
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:44,960
endless miles of white lines and yellow

1613
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,680
lines and truck stops and

1614
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,679
the days just blur together um you know

1615
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:52,318
it's one loading dock after another so

1616
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,558
you lose the magic of being on the road

1617
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:56,880
yeah it's it's very rare the driver that

1618
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,880
doesn't

1619
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:03,358
you mentioned covet and supply chain

1620
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,760
while being this

1621
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:07,759
for a brief time this member of the

1622
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,839
supply chain what have you come to

1623
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,160
understand about

1624
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:13,199
our supply chain united states and

1625
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:17,039
global

1626
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:19,439
and its resilience against uh strategies

1627
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:23,119
catastrophes in the world like kovid for

1628
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:26,720
example yeah i mean we we have built

1629
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:29,280
really long really lean supply chains

1630
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,798
and and just by definition

1631
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,200
they're fragile

1632
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,239
um you know the the current mess that we

1633
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:37,519
have

1634
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:39,358
it's not going to clear by christmas it

1635
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,880
will be lucky if it clears by next

1636
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:42,078
christmas can you describe the current

1637
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,358
medicine supply chain that you're

1638
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:48,640
referring to yeah so we've got pileups

1639
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:51,920
of of ships off the the coast of

1640
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:54,318
california long beach and and la in

1641
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,000
particular and in bad shape

1642
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:58,719
um you know last i checked it was around

1643
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,199
60 ships all of which are holding

1644
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,959
thousands of containers full of stuff

1645
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:07,279
that retailers were hoping was going to

1646
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:09,920
be on shelves for the holiday season

1647
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,680
meanwhile the port itself has stacks and

1648
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,639
stacks of containers that they can't get

1649
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,960
rid of

1650
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:17,759
the truckers aren't showing up to pick

1651
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,199
up the containers that are there so they

1652
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,640
can't offload

1653
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:24,480
the the ships that are that are waiting

1654
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,078
and why aren't the

1655
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,599
why aren't the truckers picking it up

1656
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,359
partly because there's a long history of

1657
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,920
inefficiency and maybe making them wait

1658
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,639
but it's because the warehouses are full

1659
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,039
so

1660
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:37,358
and so we've had all these perverse you

1661
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:39,440
know outcomes that no one really

1662
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:41,279
expected like in the middle of all these

1663
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,159
shortages

1664
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,798
people are stockpiling stuff so

1665
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:49,519
there are suppliers who used to keep two

1666
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:50,559
months of supply of bottled water on

1667
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:52,719
hand

1668
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:55,440
and after going through covid and not

1669
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,399
having supply to send to their customers

1670
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,079
they're like

1671
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,559
we need three months

1672
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,519
well our system is not designed for

1673
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,160
major

1674
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:05,599
storage of goods to go up 50 in a

1675
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,118
category it's lean

1676
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:09,200
if you're a warehouse operator you know

1677
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,358
you want to be 90 plus you don't want a

1678
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:14,159
lot of open bays sitting around so

1679
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:16,480
we don't have you know 10 percent extra

1680
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:19,039
capacity in warehouses you know we don't

1681
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,960
have 10 of them trucking capacity can

1682
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,838
fluctuate a bit but you know

1683
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,880
you don't have that kind of of slack and

1684
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:26,639
and now

1685
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,160
i mean we saw this right when people

1686
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,679
shifted consumption and i get a little

1687
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:33,679
i had a little mad when people talk

1688
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:35,759
about panic buying as kind of the you

1689
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:38,399
know the the reason that we had all

1690
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,400
these shortages and it really like it's

1691
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,960
preventing us from understanding you

1692
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,280
know the real problem there which is

1693
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,358
that that lean supply chain sure there

1694
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,798
was some panic buying you know no doubt

1695
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:53,199
about it but we had an enormous shift in

1696
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:54,719
people's behavior so i

1697
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:56,159
with uh with my sister and

1698
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:59,039
brother-in-law i own a couple of small

1699
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:01,920
businesses and we serve food right so we

1700
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:02,719
we get you know food from cisco

1701
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,559
um

1702
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:06,239
cisco couldn't get rid of food right

1703
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,359
because nobody's eating out so they've

1704
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:10,959
got you know 50 pound sacks of flour

1705
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:12,400
you know uh sitting in their warehouse

1706
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,639
that they can't get rid of they've got

1707
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,280
cases of lettuce and meat and everything

1708
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:19,358
else that's just going to go bad

1709
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,119
so that panic buying certainly

1710
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:23,199
exacerbated some things like toilet

1711
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,318
paper and whatever but we saw just a

1712
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:28,399
massive change in demand and our supply

1713
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:31,279
chains are based on historical data

1714
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,358
right so you know that stuff leaves asia

1715
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,720
you know months before you you want to

1716
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:36,880
have it on the shelves and you're

1717
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:39,679
predicting based on last year you know

1718
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,720
what you want on that that shelf um

1719
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:45,118
and so it's a it's a you know i guess at

1720
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:48,480
its best it's a beautiful symphony of

1721
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,920
lots of moving parts um

1722
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,079
but now

1723
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,318
everyone can't get on the same page of

1724
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,519
music but it's not resilient to changes

1725
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:58,239
in uh

1726
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,239
on mass

1727
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,358
human behavior so even like um i read

1728
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,798
somewhere

1729
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:06,318
maybe you can tell me if this true in

1730
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:08,159
relation to food

1731
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:10,318
it's just the change of human behavior

1732
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:11,759
between going out to restaurants versus

1733
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:14,480
eating at home

1734
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,040
as a as a species we consume a lot less

1735
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,318
food that way apparently what i read in

1736
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:20,000
restaurants

1737
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:22,558
like there's a lot of food just thrown

1738
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,280
out it's part of the business model

1739
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:27,119
yeah and so like you then have to move a

1740
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,280
lot more food through the whole supply

1741
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,559
chain and now

1742
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,319
because you're

1743
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,559
consuming you know there's leftovers at

1744
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:35,599
home you're consuming much more of the

1745
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,760
food you

1746
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:40,240
you're getting when you're eating at

1747
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,920
home that's creating these bottleneck

1748
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:43,759
situations problems as you're referring

1749
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,920
to too much in a certain place not

1750
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,000
enough in another place and it's just

1751
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,519
the supply chain is not robust those

1752
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,039
kind of dynamic

1753
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:54,000
shifts in who gets what where

1754
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:56,079
yeah

1755
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,400
yeah i mean so and i have worked in

1756
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:02,000
agriculture a bit on sort of the

1757
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:04,240
supply side um you know and there are

1758
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,400
product categories right where 30 of the

1759
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:08,239
crop raised does not

1760
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,480
get used right it just gets plowed under

1761
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:12,558
or or wasted but

1762
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,318
here's the importance of this in sort of

1763
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,400
getting this right you know like that

1764
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:18,558
not that like panic buying you know

1765
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,119
blame the irrational consumer

1766
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:23,359
you know look at the hard sort of truth

1767
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,039
of the way we've we've set up our

1768
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:27,519
economy and

1769
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:30,079
i'll i'll ask you this lex i know

1770
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:33,358
um you you're a hopeful optimistic

1771
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,960
person 100 yes yeah i am too i mean i

1772
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:37,119
write about problems all the time and so

1773
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,039
people think i'm sort of like a just a

1774
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,920
debbie downer you know

1775
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:44,318
pessimist but i'm a i'm a glass half

1776
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,400
full kind of guy like i want i want to

1777
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:47,279
identify problems so so we can solve

1778
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,880
them

1779
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:52,880
so let me ask you this we've got these

1780
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:54,240
long lean supply chains in the

1781
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,838
future

1782
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:56,879
do you see

1783
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,239
more

1784
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,400
environmental

1785
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,838
problems that could disrupt them

1786
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,880
more

1787
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:06,798
geopolitical problems that could disrupt

1788
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,440
trade from asia

1789
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:12,159
you know um other

1790
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,440
institutional failures do those things

1791
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:15,279
seem

1792
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,159
you know potentially more likely in the

1793
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,920
future

1794
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:19,440
than they have been in say the last 20

1795
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,440
years yeah

1796
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,119
it almost absolutely seems to be the

1797
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,920
case so you then have to ask the

1798
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,358
question of uh how do we

1799
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,000
change

1800
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:32,239
our supply chains whether it's making

1801
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,880
more resilient or make them

1802
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:35,679
less densely connected

1803
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,079
um

1804
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:38,719
you know building uh it's like a what is

1805
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,839
it

1806
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:42,318
you know

1807
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:44,239
the the tesla model for in the

1808
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:46,239
automotive sector of like trying to

1809
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:47,759
build every like

1810
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:50,798
trying to get the factory to do as much

1811
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,559
as possible with as little reliance on

1812
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:54,480
widely distributed

1813
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,000
uh sources of the supply chain as

1814
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,798
possible so maybe

1815
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,760
like rethinking how much we rely on the

1816
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:03,679
infrastructure of the supply chain

1817
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,799
yeah i mean you know there's some basic

1818
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:09,440
and i i assume right that that there are

1819
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:11,920
a lot of folks in corporate boardrooms

1820
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,960
looking at risk and saying that didn't

1821
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,119
go well

1822
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,400
and maybe it could have even gone worse

1823
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,119
um

1824
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,559
maybe we need to think about reshoring

1825
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:22,000
right um

1826
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:23,359
at the very least

1827
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,119
one of the things that i'm hearing about

1828
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:28,000
anecdotally is that they're storing

1829
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:30,240
stuff up you know when they can right um

1830
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,639
which is that's not that's probably not

1831
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,000
sustainable right i mean at some point

1832
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:35,279
somebody in that corporate boardroom is

1833
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,639
going to say

1834
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,400
you know guys inventory is getting kind

1835
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:39,920
of heavy the cost of that is like do we

1836
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,079
can we really justify that much longer

1837
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,680
to the shareholders right um we should

1838
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,440
we can back off and start you know back

1839
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:47,440
things are back to normal let's lean out

1840
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,119
what uh my hope is that there's a

1841
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,798
technology solution to a lot of aspects

1842
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,920
of this so one of them on the supply

1843
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:57,119
chain side is collecting a lot more data

1844
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,280
like having much uh more integrated and

1845
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:00,640
accurate representation of the inventory

1846
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:02,559
all over the place

1847
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:05,118
and the available transportation

1848
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:07,440
mechanisms the trucks the all kinds of

1849
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,880
freight and how

1850
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,559
in the different models of the possible

1851
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,000
catastrophic catastrophes that can

1852
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:16,079
happen

1853
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,400
what like how will the system respond so

1854
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:20,079
having a really solid model that you're

1855
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,440
operating under as opposed to just kind

1856
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:26,400
of being in in emergency response mode

1857
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:29,440
under poor incomplete information which

1858
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,400
is what seems like is more commonly the

1859
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,960
case

1860
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,200
except for things like you said walmart

1861
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,199
and amazon they're trying to internally

1862
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:39,038
get their stuff together on that front

1863
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:41,038
but that doesn't help the rest of the

1864
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,920
economy so

1865
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,079
um

1866
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,079
another exciting technological

1867
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:49,119
development as you write about as you

1868
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,200
think about is autonomous trucks

1869
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:54,960
so these are often brought up in

1870
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:57,279
different contexts as the examples of ai

1871
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:01,519
and robots taking our jobs

1872
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:03,599
how true is this should we be concerned

1873
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:06,239
i think they've really come to epitomize

1874
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:09,119
this anxiety over automation right just

1875
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:11,759
it's such a simple idea

1876
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,798
right truck that drives itself you know

1877
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,440
classic

1878
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:18,239
blue-collar job that pays well

1879
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,960
you know um guy maybe with not a lot of

1880
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:23,118
other good options right um to sort of

1881
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,519
make that same income easily

1882
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,559
right and you build a robot to

1883
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:29,280
take his job away right um

1884
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,680
so

1885
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,839
i think

1886
01:05:30,679 --> 01:05:35,519
2016 or so that was that was the sort of

1887
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:36,558
big question out there and that that's

1888
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:38,798
actually how i

1889
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,920
started studying it right i just wrapped

1890
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:41,920
up the book

1891
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,920
just so happened that somebody was

1892
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,079
working at uber uber had just bought

1893
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,358
otto saw the book and was like hey can

1894
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:50,160
you come out and

1895
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:52,159
talk to our engineering teams about what

1896
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:54,558
life is like for truck drivers and maybe

1897
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:57,199
how our technology could make it better

1898
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,480
and you know at that time

1899
01:05:57,199 --> 01:05:59,838
there were a lot of different ideas

1900
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,599
about how they were going to play out

1901
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:03,440
right so

1902
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,039
while the press was saying you know all

1903
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,039
truckers are going to lose their jobs

1904
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,880
there were a lot of people in in

1905
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,079
these engineering teams who thought okay

1906
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,680
you know if we've got an individual

1907
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,318
owner operator

1908
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:16,399
you know and and they can only drive

1909
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:18,558
eight or ten hours a day

1910
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,559
you know they hop in the back

1911
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:22,880
they get their rest and the asset that

1912
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:25,680
they own works for them mm-hmm right

1913
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,519
sort of sort of perfect right um

1914
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:29,598
and at that time you know there were a

1915
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:30,880
bunch of reports that came out and so

1916
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,798
basically what people did was they they

1917
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,039
took the category of truck driver you

1918
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:37,119
know some people took a larger category

1919
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,640
from bls of you know sales and delivery

1920
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,599
workers that was about three and a half

1921
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:41,519
million

1922
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,000
workers and and others took the heavy

1923
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:46,559
duty truck driver category which was at

1924
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,239
the time about 1.8 million or so

1925
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,359
and they you know picked a start date

1926
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:51,038
and a slope

1927
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:52,239
and said you know

1928
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:54,400
let's assume that all these jobs are

1929
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:55,358
just going to disappear and

1930
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,960
um

1931
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:58,558
really smart researcher annetta

1932
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,559
bernhardt at the

1933
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:03,599
labor center at uc berkeley

1934
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,960
was sort of looking around um for people

1935
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:07,599
who were sort of

1936
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,639
deeply into industries to complicate

1937
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,960
those

1938
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:12,159
analyses right yeah and reached out to

1939
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,838
me and was like what do you think of

1940
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:15,358
this and i said the industry's super

1941
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:17,279
diverse you know this is just i haven't

1942
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:19,119
given a ton of thought but it can't be

1943
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,760
that you know it's not that simple you

1944
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:24,160
know it never is um and so she was like

1945
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,520
well you you know will you do this and i

1946
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:26,879
i was like ready to move on to another

1947
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:29,280
topic you know i had like been in

1948
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,760
trucking for 10 years um and that that's

1949
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:35,440
how it i started looking at it and it is

1950
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:37,359
it's a lot more complicated and the

1951
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,519
the initial impacts and here's the

1952
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:41,199
challenge i think and it's not just a

1953
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:44,480
research challenge it's it's the

1954
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:46,879
fundamental public policy challenge is

1955
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,920
we look at the existing industry

1956
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,358
and the impacts the potential impacts

1957
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,960
they're not

1958
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:55,119
you know nothing

1959
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,440
for for some communities and some kinds

1960
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:58,880
of drivers they're going to be hard and

1961
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,798
there and there are a significant number

1962
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,119
of them nowhere near what people thought

1963
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:04,079
you know i i estimate like around 300

1964
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,838
000

1965
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,920
but that's a static picture of the

1966
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:11,440
existing industry

1967
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,798
and here's the the key with this is

1968
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,480
at least in my

1969
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:17,198
my conclusion is this is a

1970
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:19,600
transformative technology

1971
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:21,599
we are not going to swap in

1972
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,319
self-driving trucks for human-driven

1973
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:27,279
trucks and all else stays the same this

1974
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:29,440
is going to reshape our supply chains

1975
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,359
it's going to reshape landscapes it's

1976
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:33,599
going to affect our ability to fight

1977
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:36,079
climate change

1978
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,719
this is a really important technology in

1979
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:41,278
this space do you think it's possible to

1980
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,079
predict the future

1981
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:44,319
of

1982
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:46,640
the kind of opportunities it will create

1983
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:50,159
how it will change the world

1984
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:52,079
so like when you have the internet

1985
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:54,719
you can start saying like all the kind

1986
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:57,039
of ways that office work all jobs will

1987
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,920
be lost because it's easy to network and

1988
01:08:57,039 --> 01:08:59,278
then

1989
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,199
software engineering allows you to

1990
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:04,719
automate a lot of the tasks that

1991
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:07,919
microsoft excel does you know

1992
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:09,520
but it opened up so many opportunities

1993
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,279
even with things that are difficult to

1994
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,839
imagine like with the internet i don't

1995
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:17,679
know wikipedia which is widely making

1996
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:20,479
accessible information and that uh

1997
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:22,798
increased the general education globally

1998
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:25,278
by a lot all those kinds of things like

1999
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:27,119
and then the the ripple effects of that

2000
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:28,960
in terms of your ability to

2001
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:32,399
find other jobs

2002
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:34,880
is probably immeasurable so is it is it

2003
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,318
just a hopeless pursuit to try to

2004
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,798
predict

2005
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:41,600
uh if uh you talk about these six

2006
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:42,399
different uh trajectories that we might

2007
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,279
take

2008
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:47,679
in automating trucks but like as a

2009
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,199
result of taking those trajectories is

2010
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,600
it a hopeless pursuit to predict what

2011
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:52,960
the future will result in yeah

2012
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,440
it is

2013
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:58,079
it absolutely is because it's the wrong

2014
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:59,279
question yeah the question is

2015
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:01,039
what do we want the future to be and

2016
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:04,000
let's shape it

2017
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:06,158
right um and and i think this is you

2018
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,238
know and this is the only point that i

2019
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:10,319
really want to make in my work you know

2020
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:12,238
for the foreseeable future

2021
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:15,359
is that you know

2022
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:16,479
we have got to get out of this

2023
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:18,799
mindset

2024
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:19,919
that we're just going to let technology

2025
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,520
kind of

2026
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,359
go and it's a natural process and

2027
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,840
whatever pops out will fix the problems

2028
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:28,799
on the back side and and and we've got

2029
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,600
to recognize that one that's not what we

2030
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,640
do

2031
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:34,719
right um you know and self-driving

2032
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,039
vehicles is just such a perfect example

2033
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,640
right we would not be sitting here today

2034
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:39,760
if the defense department right if

2035
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:44,239
congress

2036
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:47,039
in 2000 had not written into legislation

2037
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:48,718
funding for the darpa challenges which

2038
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,399
followed actually i think the funding

2039
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,880
came a couple years later but the

2040
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:55,439
priority that they wrote in 2000 was

2041
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,239
let's get a third of all ground vehicles

2042
01:10:55,439 --> 01:11:00,000
in our military forces unmanned right

2043
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:02,000
and this was before

2044
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,279
aerial unmanned vehicles had really sort

2045
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,439
of proven their worth they would come to

2046
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:06,719
be incredibly like you know just blow

2047
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:08,479
people out of the

2048
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:10,480
blow people's minds in terms of their

2049
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,959
additional capabilities the lower cost

2050
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:14,158
you know keeping you know uh soldiers

2051
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,319
out of harm's way now of course they

2052
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:17,519
raised other problems and considerations

2053
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:18,319
that i think we're still wrestling with

2054
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,920
but

2055
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:21,039
that was even before that they had this

2056
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,800
priority

2057
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:25,039
we would not be sitting here today if

2058
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,279
congress in 2000 had not said let's

2059
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:28,960
bring this about

2060
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:30,479
so they already had that vision actually

2061
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,640
i didn't know about that so for people

2062
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:33,759
who don't know the upper challenges

2063
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,239
is the

2064
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,360
the events that were just kind of like

2065
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:39,678
these

2066
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,960
seemingly small scale challenges that

2067
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:42,800
brought together some of the smartest

2068
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,439
roboticists in the world and that

2069
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,039
somehow created enough of a magic

2070
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:49,919
where uh

2071
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:51,439
ideas flourished both engineering and

2072
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,039
scientific

2073
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:55,279
that eventually then

2074
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:56,640
uh was the catalyst for creating all

2075
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:58,719
these different companies that took on

2076
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,880
the challenge some failed some succeeded

2077
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,880
some are still fighting the good fight

2078
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,880
that somehow just that little bit of

2079
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,920
challenge was the was the essential

2080
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,560
spark

2081
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,679
of uh progress that now resulted in this

2082
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,320
beautiful

2083
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:14,719
up and down wave of hype and

2084
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:16,000
and uh profit and all this kind of weird

2085
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,319
dance where

2086
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,238
the b word billions of dollars have been

2087
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:22,399
thrown being thrown around and we still

2088
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:24,319
don't know and the t word trillions of

2089
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:25,920
dollars in terms of transformative

2090
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,158
effects of autonomous vehicles and all

2091
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,480
that started from darp and those initial

2092
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:32,319
that initial vision of i guess as you're

2093
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,879
saying of automating part of the

2094
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:36,319
military uh supply chain

2095
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,920
yeah i did not know that that's

2096
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:40,479
interesting so they had the same kind of

2097
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,199
vision for the military as we're not

2098
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:44,639
talking about a vision for the civilian

2099
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:46,960
whether it's trucking whether it's

2100
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,920
autonomous vehicle sort of ride-sharing

2101
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,158
kind of application yeah i mean what an

2102
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,960
incredible spark right

2103
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:56,079
um

2104
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:58,560
and and it just the story of

2105
01:12:56,079 --> 01:13:01,119
what it produced right i mean

2106
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,880
um your own work on self-driving right i

2107
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:05,679
mean you you've studied it as an

2108
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,279
academic right how many great

2109
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:08,480
researchers and minds have been

2110
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:11,279
harnessed

2111
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:13,279
by this outcome of that spark right and

2112
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:14,559
i think this is sort of theoretically

2113
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:17,039
about technology right this is what

2114
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,480
makes it so great is that it's what

2115
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:19,359
makes us human in my opinion right is

2116
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:21,198
that you

2117
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:23,439
you conceive of something in your mind

2118
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:25,839
and then you bring it into reality right

2119
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:28,559
i mean that that's what is so great

2120
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:31,440
about it um sometimes you're too dumb to

2121
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,360
realize how difficult it

2122
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:34,879
right is then eventually you're you're

2123
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:36,639
too uh

2124
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,119
you're in too deep

2125
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,960
you might as well solve the problem well

2126
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:43,119
and maybe we're in that situation right

2127
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,960
now with self-driving but you know and

2128
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:46,479
so let me throw this out there i i'd be

2129
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,640
curious to hear your thoughts on it but

2130
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:50,399
uh the truck drivers always always ask

2131
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,400
me like is this for real like is this

2132
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:54,158
really do like it's harder than they

2133
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:55,599
think like right and they're they can't

2134
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:58,559
really do this

2135
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,640
and you know at first i was like look

2136
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,360
you know this is like the defense

2137
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,440
department and like basically the top

2138
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:09,679
computer science and real robotics

2139
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:12,559
departments in the world um and now

2140
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:15,359
silicon valley with billions of dollars

2141
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:18,400
in funding and just you know some of the

2142
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:21,039
smartest hardest working most visionary

2143
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:23,920
people focused on what is clearly

2144
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:24,719
you know a gigantic market

2145
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,520
right

2146
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:31,039
and what i tell them is like if the if

2147
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:33,040
if self-driving vehicles don't happen

2148
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,960
i think this will be the biggest

2149
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:37,039
technology failure story in human

2150
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,840
history i don't know of

2151
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:41,840
anything else that is just galvanized i

2152
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,440
mean you've had people in garages or

2153
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,119
weird inventors work on things their

2154
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:46,879
whole lives and come really close and it

2155
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,760
never happens and it's a great failure

2156
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:52,480
story right but never have we had like

2157
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:54,560
whole i mean we're talking about gm

2158
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:56,479
right and these are not you know these

2159
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,199
are not tech companies right these are

2160
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:01,359
industrial giants right what what were

2161
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:03,198
in the 20th century the pinnacle of

2162
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:04,479
industrial production in the world in

2163
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:07,439
human history

2164
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:08,158
right and they're focused on it now so

2165
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:10,559
if

2166
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:12,559
we don't pull this off it's like

2167
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,719
wow it's fascinating to think about i've

2168
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,719
never thought of it that way i there was

2169
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:19,679
a mass hysteria

2170
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:21,520
oh on a level in terms of excitement and

2171
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,760
hype on a level that's probably

2172
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,440
unparalleled in technology space like

2173
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,199
i've seen that kind of hysteria just

2174
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:30,559
studying history when you talk about

2175
01:15:27,198 --> 01:15:32,559
military conflict so we often wage war

2176
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,159
with a dream of making a better world

2177
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,560
and then realize it cost trillions of

2178
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:38,399
dollars and then we step back and like

2179
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,120
and go wait a minute what do we actually

2180
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:40,000
get

2181
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:41,760
for this

2182
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
but in the space of technology it seems

2183
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,520
like all these kind of large efforts

2184
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,960
have paid off

2185
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,679
this you're right

2186
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:51,439
it seems like um

2187
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:53,520
it seems like giving gm and ford and all

2188
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:54,399
these companies now are a little bit

2189
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,560
like

2190
01:15:54,399 --> 01:16:01,679
hey um or toyota and uh even tesla

2191
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,560
like are we uh are we sure about this

2192
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,319
yeah

2193
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,480
and it's fascinating to think about when

2194
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:08,479
you tell the story of this this could be

2195
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:10,238
one of the big

2196
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:13,039
the first perhaps

2197
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:14,000
but by far the biggest failures of the

2198
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:16,079
dream

2199
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,760
in the space of technology

2200
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:20,880
that's really interesting to think about

2201
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:22,800
i was a skeptic for a long time

2202
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,640
because of the human factor

2203
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,239
because for business to work in the

2204
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,159
space you have to work with humans and

2205
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:30,079
you have to work with humans at ever at

2206
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:31,519
every level so in the truck driving

2207
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,439
space you have to work with the truck

2208
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,440
driver but you also have to work with a

2209
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:37,678
society that has a certain conception of

2210
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:39,359
what driving means and also have to have

2211
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:40,158
work with businesses that are not used

2212
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:42,559
to

2213
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:45,039
this extreme

2214
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,320
level of technology you know

2215
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:48,399
in um

2216
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:49,599
in the basic operation of their business

2217
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:51,519
so i thought it would be really

2218
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:53,120
difficult to uh to move to autonomous

2219
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,000
vehicles in that way

2220
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:55,599
but

2221
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,520
then i realized that there's certain

2222
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,199
companies that are just

2223
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,159
willing to take big risks and really

2224
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:01,599
innovate

2225
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:03,759
i think uh

2226
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,760
the first impressive company to me was

2227
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,360
waymo or what was used to be the google

2228
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,199
self-driving car

2229
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:10,079
and and i saw

2230
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:11,919
okay

2231
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:14,319
here's a company that's willing to

2232
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:17,679
really think long term and really try to

2233
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:21,279
solve this problem hire great engineers

2234
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:23,600
uh then i saw tesla with mobile eye when

2235
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,599
they first had i thought would actually

2236
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,360
mobilize the thing that impressed me

2237
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,800
when i sat down i thought because i'm a

2238
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:30,639
computer vision person i thought there's

2239
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,440
no way

2240
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,119
a system could keep me in lane

2241
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:36,479
long enough for it to be a pleasant

2242
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,079
experience for me

2243
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:39,359
so from a computer vision perspective i

2244
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:40,960
thought there'd be too many failures

2245
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:42,960
it'd be really annoying it'd be a

2246
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,640
gimmick a toy it wouldn't actually

2247
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,399
create a pleasant experience

2248
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,239
and when i first was gotten the tesla

2249
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:50,799
with mobileye the initial mobilize

2250
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:53,519
system it actually held to lane for

2251
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,119
quite a long time to where i could relax

2252
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,880
a little bit and it was a really

2253
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:58,719
pleasant experience i couldn't exactly

2254
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,159
explain why it's pleasant because it's

2255
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:02,480
not like i still have to really pay

2256
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:05,279
attention but i can relax my shoulders a

2257
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:06,959
little bit i'm i'm i can be

2258
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,198
i can look around a little bit more and

2259
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:12,719
for some reason i was really

2260
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:14,399
reducing the stress and then over time

2261
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,840
tesla with uh with a lot of the

2262
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:18,158
revolutionary stuff they're doing on the

2263
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,079
machine learning space made me believe

2264
01:18:18,158 --> 01:18:22,238
that there's uh

2265
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:24,640
opportunities here to innovate to come

2266
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:26,238
up with totally new ideas another very

2267
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,679
sad story

2268
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:30,079
that i was really excited about is

2269
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:32,399
cadillac super crew system it is a sad

2270
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:34,079
story because i think i vaguely read in

2271
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:37,599
the news they just said they're

2272
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:39,679
discontinuing super cruise but it's a

2273
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:42,480
nice innovative way of doing driver

2274
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:45,039
attention monitoring and also doing lane

2275
01:18:42,479 --> 01:18:47,359
keeping and it's just innovation could

2276
01:18:45,039 --> 01:18:49,600
solve this in ways we don't predict the

2277
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:51,279
same with the in the trucking space it

2278
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,760
might not be as simple as like

2279
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:55,679
journalist and vision a few years ago

2280
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,719
where everything's just automated it

2281
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,480
might be

2282
01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:01,039
gradually

2283
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:02,559
helping out the truck drive in some ways

2284
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:04,719
that make their life

2285
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:06,320
more efficient more effective

2286
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,480
more pleasant

2287
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:09,920
make the like remove some of the

2288
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:12,559
inefficiencies that we've been talking

2289
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:15,920
about in totally innovative ways and

2290
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:17,760
that i still have that dream that uh i

2291
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,440
believe to solve the fully autonomous

2292
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,320
driving problem we're still many years

2293
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:22,799
away

2294
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:24,960
but on the way to solving that problem

2295
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,719
it feels like there could be

2296
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,198
if there's bold

2297
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,960
risk takers and innovators in the space

2298
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:31,759
there's an opportunity to come up with

2299
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,359
uh

2300
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,119
like subtle

2301
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:37,279
technologies that make all the

2302
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:38,719
difference that's that's actually just

2303
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:41,279
what i realized

2304
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:42,800
is sometimes little design decisions

2305
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:45,599
make all the difference

2306
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,719
it's the blackberry versus the iphone

2307
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,800
you know

2308
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:50,640
why is it that you have a glass and

2309
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:52,640
you're using your finger

2310
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,199
for all of the work versus the buttons

2311
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:57,119
makes all the difference this idea that

2312
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:58,319
now you have a giant screen

2313
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:00,399
so that

2314
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:02,479
every part of the experience is now a

2315
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:04,399
digital experience so you can have

2316
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:06,158
things like apps that change everything

2317
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,119
like you can't

2318
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:08,960
you know when you're first thinking

2319
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:11,439
about do i want a keyboard or not on a

2320
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:13,198
smartphone you think it's just the

2321
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,519
keyboard decision

2322
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:17,759
but then you later realize

2323
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:21,040
by removing the keyboard

2324
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:23,039
you're enabling a whole ecosystem of

2325
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:24,319
technologies that are inside the phone

2326
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:27,279
and now you're making the smartphone

2327
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:29,920
into a computer and that same way

2328
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:32,000
who knows how you can transform trucks

2329
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,800
right by like automating some parts of

2330
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,600
it maybe uh adding

2331
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,000
some uh displays maybe it allows you to

2332
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,480
maybe giving the the truck driver some

2333
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,359
control in the supply chain to make

2334
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:48,238
decisions all those kinds of things yeah

2335
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,920
uh so i don't know so what's where where

2336
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:51,599
are you on the

2337
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,639
spectrum of hope

2338
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:56,800
for

2339
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:59,440
uh the role of automation in trucking

2340
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:02,639
i i think automation is is inevitable

2341
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:05,039
and again i think the this is really

2342
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:06,239
going to be transformative and it's

2343
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:08,960
going to be

2344
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:10,799
i i've studied the history of trucking

2345
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,239
technology as much as i can there you

2346
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,000
know there's not a lot a lot of great

2347
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:16,000
stuff written and you kind of have to

2348
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,920
you know uh there's a lot of data and

2349
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,319
places to know sort of volumes of stuff

2350
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,520
and how they're changing etc but

2351
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:25,039
the big

2352
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:27,920
revolutionary changes in in trucking are

2353
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:29,760
because of constellations of factors

2354
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,679
it's it's not just one thing right so

2355
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,079
daimler builds you know a motorized

2356
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,279
truck and i think it's 1896.

2357
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:37,279
right um

2358
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:38,639
intercities trucking

2359
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:40,880
that so basically what they use that

2360
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:42,800
truck for is just to swap out horses

2361
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,800
right they basically do the same thing

2362
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:47,679
the service doesn't really change you

2363
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:50,000
know um and then world war one really

2364
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:53,199
spurs the development of bigger larger

2365
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,600
trucks like spreads you know air air

2366
01:21:53,198 --> 01:21:57,439
filled tires and then

2367
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,560
we start paving roads

2368
01:21:57,439 --> 01:21:59,919
right and

2369
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,920
paved roads

2370
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:04,319
right air filled tires

2371
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:07,440
and the internal combustion engine

2372
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:09,119
now you got a winning mix now it met

2373
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:10,319
with demand for people who wanted to get

2374
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:11,760
out from under the thumb of the

2375
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:14,158
railroads

2376
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,119
right so there was all of this pent-up

2377
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:18,319
demand to get cheaper freight from the

2378
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:20,719
countryside

2379
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:23,198
into cities and between cities

2380
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,639
that typically had to go by rail and so

2381
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:25,919
now you know

2382
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:28,319
40 years

2383
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,639
after that internal combustion engine

2384
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,639
it becomes this absolutely essential

2385
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:35,600
right this necessary but not sufficient

2386
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:37,440
piece of technology to create the modern

2387
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:40,719
trucking industry

2388
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:42,399
in the 1930s and i think self-driving is

2389
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:44,719
going to be self-driving trucks are

2390
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:47,599
going to be part of that and the idea i

2391
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:49,279
don't i guess we we credit jeff bezos

2392
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,800
the idea is

2393
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:53,039
you know um

2394
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,880
okay so sam walton if we can do it like

2395
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:56,319
a slight tangent on sort of the

2396
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,000
importance of trucking to business

2397
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:00,799
strategy and sort of how it has

2398
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,359
transformed our our world

2399
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:06,320
the central insight that sam walton had

2400
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:08,639
that made him the giant that he was in

2401
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:10,319
influencing the way that so many people

2402
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:12,480
get stuff

2403
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:15,759
was a trucking insight

2404
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:18,158
and so if you look at the way that

2405
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,880
he developed his system you build a

2406
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:22,319
distribution center and then you ring it

2407
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:25,039
with stores

2408
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:26,719
those stores are never further out from

2409
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:28,000
that distribution center than a human

2410
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:31,679
driven truck

2411
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:34,238
can drive back and forth in one day

2412
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:36,239
and so rather than the way all of his

2413
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:37,919
competitors were doing it with

2414
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:40,158
sending trucks all over the place and

2415
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:43,199
having people sleep overnight and sort

2416
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:45,198
of making the trucking service fit

2417
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:48,559
where they had stores

2418
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:51,279
he designed the layout of the stores

2419
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,520
right to fit what trucks could do

2420
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:55,039
and so transportation and logistics

2421
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:57,679
right become

2422
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:59,760
walmart's you know edge right and allows

2423
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:02,560
them to to dominate the space that's the

2424
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:05,360
challenge that amazon has now they've

2425
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,800
they've mastered the digital part of it

2426
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:08,960
right and now they got to figure out

2427
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,520
like how do we you know

2428
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,039
dominate the actual physical movement

2429
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,440
that complements

2430
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:16,560
that um others are obviously going to

2431
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:18,960
follow

2432
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,280
but the capabilities of these trucks is

2433
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,800
completely different than

2434
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:23,519
the capability of a human-driven truck

2435
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,000
so

2436
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:29,360
if you're smith-packing right and you've

2437
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,439
got you know uh a bunch of meat in a

2438
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:33,599
warehouse and it's going to

2439
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:35,198
grocery distribution centers

2440
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,120
you know you have that trucker probably

2441
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:39,519
come in the night before

2442
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:41,599
and you make him wait so that he has

2443
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,920
you know a full 10 hour break which is

2444
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:46,400
what the law requires so that he can get

2445
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,920
to the furthest reaches that he can of

2446
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:50,399
one of those stores

2447
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,000
right so he can drive his full 11 hours

2448
01:24:50,399 --> 01:24:53,679
and and bring that meat so it doesn't

2449
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,840
have to sit overnight in that

2450
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:58,800
refrigerated trailer right and so their

2451
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:02,079
system is based on that now what happens

2452
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,880
when that truck can now travel

2453
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:05,840
two

2454
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:07,679
times as far right three times as far

2455
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,800
now you don't need the warehouses where

2456
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:11,039
they were

2457
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,880
now you can go super lean with your

2458
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:14,560
inventory instead of having

2459
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,199
meat here meet there meet there you can

2460
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,080
put it all right here and if it's cheap

2461
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:20,238
enough

2462
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:22,479
substitute those transportation costs

2463
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:24,718
for all that warehousing costs right so

2464
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:28,559
this is going to remake landscapes in

2465
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:30,399
the same way that big box supply chains

2466
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:32,400
did right and then of course the further

2467
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:35,279
complement of that is

2468
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:36,799
you know how do you then get it to

2469
01:25:35,279 --> 01:25:38,880
two people at their door

2470
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,480
right and you know the big box supply

2471
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,159
chain it moves

2472
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:45,198
very few items

2473
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:46,399
in really large quantities to very few

2474
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:47,678
locations

2475
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:49,279
pretty slowly

2476
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:52,158
right um

2477
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:53,599
ecommerce aspires you know to do

2478
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:56,879
something completely different right

2479
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:59,199
move huge varieties of things in small

2480
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,239
quantities virtually everywhere as fast

2481
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:03,039
as possible

2482
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:04,799
right and so that is

2483
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:07,439
like that inter-city

2484
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:10,480
trucking under the you know in the um

2485
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:13,839
era of of railroad monopolies right the

2486
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:16,319
demand for that is potentially enormous

2487
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:19,199
right and and that so there's there's

2488
01:26:16,319 --> 01:26:21,599
such a so right now i think a lot of the

2489
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:22,960
the business plans for sort of automated

2490
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,880
trucks right and sort of the way that

2491
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:27,520
the journalistic accounts portray it is

2492
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,760
like okay if we swap out a human for a

2493
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,880
computer what are the labor costs per

2494
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:34,000
mile and like oh here's the

2495
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:36,159
profitability of self-driving trucks

2496
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,158
like this is transformative technology

2497
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:40,238
we're going to change the way we get

2498
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:42,158
stuff so we could actually get a lot

2499
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:43,599
more trucks period with like with

2500
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:45,759
autonomous trucks because they would

2501
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,760
enable if a very different kind of

2502
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,199
transportation networks you think yeah

2503
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:53,440
here's and this is where it's like uh oh

2504
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:55,039
like yeah so

2505
01:26:53,439 --> 01:26:57,279
wait we really thought we were gonna be

2506
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:59,279
electrifying trucks

2507
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:01,599
if they're going twice as far if they're

2508
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:03,359
moving three times as much if they're

2509
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,920
going three times as far right what does

2510
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,920
that mean for how far we are behind on

2511
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,440
batteries right we've got sort of these

2512
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,119
you know ideas about like man we you

2513
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:13,279
know here's how far how close we could

2514
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:15,119
get to meet this demand that demand is

2515
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:17,439
going to radically change right these

2516
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,519
trucks are you know so then we've got to

2517
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:21,919
think about all right if it's not

2518
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:24,000
battery you know how how are we powering

2519
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,199
these things and how many of them are

2520
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,439
they're going to be

2521
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:30,079
like right now we've got five million

2522
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:32,960
containers that move from la and long

2523
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:34,079
beach to chicago on

2524
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:37,439
rail

2525
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:40,399
rail is three or four times at least

2526
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:42,479
more efficient than trucks in terms of

2527
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:44,559
greenhouse gas emissions

2528
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:47,279
and on that lane it varies a lot

2529
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:50,239
depending on demand but maybe rail has a

2530
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:52,000
20 advantage in cost maybe 25 but it's a

2531
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:54,479
couple days slower

2532
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,359
so now you cut the cost of that truck

2533
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:59,439
transportation per mile by 30 percent

2534
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:01,679
now it's cheaper than rail and it gets

2535
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:04,479
the stuff there five days faster than

2536
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:06,560
rail how many millions of containers are

2537
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:08,718
going to leave la and long beach on

2538
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,800
self-driving trucks and go to chicago

2539
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:11,679
and it might look very much like a train

2540
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,279
if

2541
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:18,480
if we go with the platooning solution

2542
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:21,039
you have just these rows of like

2543
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:22,879
imagine like rows of like 10 like dozens

2544
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:26,079
of trucks or like hundreds of trucks

2545
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:29,440
like some absurd situation just going

2546
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:31,840
from la to chicago yeah just this train

2547
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:33,519
but taking up a highway

2548
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,520
i mean uh

2549
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:38,000
this is probably a good place to talk

2550
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,600
about various scenarios

2551
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,600
but before we get there can i can i just

2552
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,199
make one one interesting observation

2553
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,280
that i made as

2554
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:46,960
a driver um when you're in a truck

2555
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:48,639
you're up higher you know so you can you

2556
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,000
can see further and you can see the

2557
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:51,119
traffic patterns

2558
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,238
and

2559
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,760
um cars move them packs

2560
01:28:54,238 --> 01:28:57,279
i'm sure there's academic research on

2561
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,679
this right but they move in packs they

2562
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:01,439
kind of bunch up behind a slower car and

2563
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:03,359
then a bunch of them break free and this

2564
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:05,119
is sort of on almost free-flowing

2565
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:07,439
highways they kind of move in packs and

2566
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:09,198
you can kind of see them in the truck

2567
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:11,678
so you know rather than platoons we

2568
01:29:09,198 --> 01:29:13,839
might have like hives you know of trucks

2569
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:15,920
right so you have like 20 trucks moving

2570
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:18,159
in some coordinated fashion right and

2571
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,279
then maybe the self-driving cars are you

2572
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:21,279
know because people don't like to be

2573
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:23,039
around them or whatever it is right you

2574
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:24,719
might have a pod of you know 20

2575
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:26,960
self-driving cars sort of moving in a

2576
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:29,198
packet behind them you know this is what

2577
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,399
if the aliens came down or were just

2578
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:32,879
observing

2579
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:34,559
cars which is one of the uh

2580
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,400
sort of prevalent characteristics of

2581
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,480
human civilization is there seems to be

2582
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:40,319
these cars like moving around

2583
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:41,839
that would do this kind of analysis of

2584
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:45,439
like huh what's the interesting

2585
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:45,440
clustering of situations here

2586
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:50,239
especially with autonomous vehicles i

2587
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:52,800
like this okay so

2588
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:55,119
what technologically speaking do you see

2589
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:58,000
are the different scenarios

2590
01:29:55,119 --> 01:30:00,800
of increasing automation in in trucks

2591
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,520
what are some ideas that you think about

2592
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:05,440
for the most part i have no

2593
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,520
i i have no influence on sort of what

2594
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:10,399
these ideas were so what the what the

2595
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:12,400
project was that i did was um

2596
01:30:10,399 --> 01:30:15,519
i said technology is created by people

2597
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:17,519
they they solve for x and they have some

2598
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:19,360
conception of what they want to do

2599
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:21,440
and that's where we should start in sort

2600
01:30:19,359 --> 01:30:23,279
of thinking about what the you know

2601
01:30:21,439 --> 01:30:26,158
impacts might be so i went and i talked

2602
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:27,679
to everybody i could find who was

2603
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:29,679
you know thinking about developing a

2604
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:32,000
self-driving truck and the question was

2605
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:33,119
essentially you know what do you what

2606
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,600
are you trying to build like what do you

2607
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:37,840
envision this thing doing

2608
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:39,360
it turned out that

2609
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:42,000
that for a lot of them was an

2610
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:44,000
afterthought they knew the the sort of

2611
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,359
technological capabilities that a

2612
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,039
self-driving vehicle would have and

2613
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:48,880
those were the problems that they were

2614
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:51,279
tackling you know they were engineers

2615
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,440
and computer scientists and oh robotics

2616
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:56,158
people i love you so much

2617
01:30:53,439 --> 01:30:57,919
this is i i i could i could talk forever

2618
01:30:56,158 --> 01:30:59,359
about this but yes there's a technology

2619
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,800
problem let's focus on that we'll figure

2620
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:02,880
out the actual

2621
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,239
uh impact on society how it's actually

2622
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:06,880
going to be applied how it's actually

2623
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:08,799
going to be integrated from a policy and

2624
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,480
from a human perspective from a business

2625
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,159
perspective later first let's solve the

2626
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:14,479
technology problem that's not how life

2627
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:16,879
works friends but okay i'm sorry yeah

2628
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:18,638
yeah so i mean i mean i'm sure you know

2629
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,760
the division of labor in these companies

2630
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,359
right there's sort of a business

2631
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,880
development side you know and then

2632
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:24,399
there's the engineering side right and

2633
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:25,760
the engineers are like oh my god what

2634
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:29,119
are these business development people

2635
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,119
you know why are they involved

2636
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:34,319
in this process so i ended up sort of

2637
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:36,879
coming up with a few different ideas

2638
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:40,079
that people seem to be batting around

2639
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:41,679
and then really try to zero in on a

2640
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:43,439
layman's understanding of the

2641
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:45,760
limitations right and

2642
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:47,359
it it turns out that's really obvious

2643
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,840
and and quite simple

2644
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:52,158
highway driving's a lot simpler right um

2645
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,800
so you know the the plan is simplify the

2646
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:56,879
problem right um and focus on highways

2647
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:59,760
because city driving is

2648
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,800
is so um so much more complicated

2649
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,119
so

2650
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:06,639
from that i i came up with basically six

2651
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:08,559
scenarios actually i came up with five

2652
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:10,880
that the developers were talking about

2653
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,880
and then one that i thought was a good

2654
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:16,639
idea that i had read about

2655
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:18,719
um i think in like 2013 or 2014

2656
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:21,440
which was actually something that the us

2657
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:23,679
military was looking at i actually first

2658
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:26,079
heard about the idea of this kind of

2659
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:29,119
automation at least in in um in

2660
01:32:26,079 --> 01:32:31,519
sketched-out form in like 2011 i guess

2661
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:34,719
it was with peloton which was this sort

2662
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:36,880
of early technology entrant into the

2663
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:39,119
trucking industry which was working on

2664
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:41,119
platooning platooning trucks

2665
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:43,119
and and all they were doing was you know

2666
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:45,679
a cooperative adaptive cruise control as

2667
01:32:43,119 --> 01:32:48,399
they they came to call it um

2668
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:50,560
and we ended up on a panel together and

2669
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:52,960
it's it's kind of interesting because i

2670
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,120
was on that panel because

2671
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,039
i was thinking about how we got the best

2672
01:32:55,119 --> 01:32:58,319
return on investment for fuel efficient

2673
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:00,639
technologies

2674
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:02,719
and if it's cool i'll sort of set set

2675
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:03,840
this up because it does it comes into

2676
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:05,600
sort of the story of some of these

2677
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:07,360
scenarios

2678
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,199
so

2679
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:11,279
when i studied the drivers

2680
01:33:09,198 --> 01:33:13,039
you had this like

2681
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:14,960
complete difference in

2682
01:33:13,039 --> 01:33:16,719
the driving tasks

2683
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:20,079
like we were talking about before with

2684
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:21,760
long haul and city right and

2685
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:24,719
you're not paid in the city you've got

2686
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:27,600
congestion the turns are tight

2687
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,319
um there's lots of you know pedestrians

2688
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,159
you know all the things that

2689
01:33:28,319 --> 01:33:33,920
self-driving trucks don't like truckers

2690
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:36,000
don't like right and they're not paid

2691
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,920
there's lots of waiting time and then in

2692
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,920
the highway they get to cruise they're

2693
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,840
getting paid they have control they go

2694
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,039
at their own pace they're making money

2695
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,039
they're happy

2696
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:47,279
well it turned out i guess it was around

2697
01:33:45,039 --> 01:33:48,960
2010 this is still when we were thinking

2698
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:50,559
about regenerative braking you know and

2699
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,600
hybrid trucks being sort of like the

2700
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,280
solution

2701
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,239
um

2702
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:56,399
the

2703
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:58,718
problems with them sort of and the

2704
01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:00,399
advantages you know also split on what i

2705
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:02,480
was thinking of kind of the rural urban

2706
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:04,960
divide at that time right so like you

2707
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:06,638
got the regenerative braking right um

2708
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:09,039
you can make the truck lighter you can

2709
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:11,039
keep it local right um you don't get any

2710
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:13,119
benefit from that you know hybrid

2711
01:34:11,039 --> 01:34:13,920
electric in the

2712
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:15,920
uh

2713
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:17,840
on the rural highway you want

2714
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:19,840
aerodynamics right

2715
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:22,000
there you want low rolling resistance

2716
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,000
tires and these super aerodynamic sleek

2717
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,560
trucks right where we know with

2718
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,319
off-the-shelf technology today we could

2719
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,480
double the fuel economy more than double

2720
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:33,198
the fuel economy of the typical truck in

2721
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:35,919
that highway segment if we segmented the

2722
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:37,359
duty cycle right and so in the urban

2723
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,279
environment you want a clean burning

2724
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:40,960
truck so you're not giving kids asthma

2725
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:43,279
you want it lighter so it's not

2726
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,520
destroying those those less

2727
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:47,439
strong pavements right um you're not you

2728
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:49,119
can make tighter turns you don't need a

2729
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:51,118
sleeper cab because the driver you know

2730
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:53,039
hopefully is getting home at night right

2731
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:54,559
in the long haul you want that super

2732
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:56,079
aerodynamic stuff now that doesn't get

2733
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,679
you anything in the city and in fact it

2734
01:34:56,079 --> 01:34:59,198
causes all kinds of problems because you

2735
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:01,359
turn too tight you crunch up all the

2736
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:03,678
aerodynamics that connect the the

2737
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:05,839
tractor and the trailer so

2738
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:08,079
the idea that i had was like okay what

2739
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:10,400
if we deliberately segmented it like

2740
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:12,399
what if we created these drop lots

2741
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:13,279
outside cities

2742
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:15,359
where

2743
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:17,759
you know a local city driver who's paid

2744
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:19,039
by the hour kind of runs these trailers

2745
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,239
out once they're loaded you know it

2746
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:21,679
doesn't sit there and wait while it's

2747
01:35:20,238 --> 01:35:23,039
being loaded they drop off a trailer

2748
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:24,560
they go pick up one that's loaded they

2749
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:25,920
run it out when it's loaded they call

2750
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:28,320
them and they just run them out there

2751
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:31,039
and stage them it's like an uber driver

2752
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:33,118
but for uh truckloads yeah we have like

2753
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:34,560
intermodal we have like we have

2754
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:36,960
basically this would be the equivalent

2755
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,480
of like rail to truck inner motor right

2756
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,840
so you put it on the rail and then you

2757
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:41,359
know a truck trucker picks it up and

2758
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,880
delivers it right so instead of having

2759
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:45,920
the rail you'd have these super

2760
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:47,600
aerodynamic hopefully platoons or or

2761
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,359
what was at the time was called long

2762
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,880
combination vehicles which is basically

2763
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:52,559
two trailers connected together right

2764
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:55,118
because this is like a huge productivity

2765
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,880
gain right um and then instead of that

2766
01:35:55,118 --> 01:35:58,399
driver like me i would pick up something

2767
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,159
in upstate new york drive to michigan

2768
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:01,759
drive to alabama you know drive to

2769
01:36:00,158 --> 01:36:03,759
wisconsin drive to florida you know i

2770
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:06,079
get home every two weeks if i'm just

2771
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,360
running that you know um

2772
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:09,118
that double

2773
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:11,759
trailer i might be able to go back and

2774
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:13,279
forth from chicago to detroit right take

2775
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:16,000
two trailers there pick up two trailers

2776
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:17,519
going back right and be home every night

2777
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,439
now the problem with that at the time or

2778
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,520
one of them was you know

2779
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:23,039
bridge weights so you can't not all

2780
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:25,520
bridges can handle

2781
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:26,719
that that much weight on them they can't

2782
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,880
handle these doubles right and some

2783
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:30,639
places can some places can't so this

2784
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,480
platooning idea was happening at the

2785
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:35,920
same time and we ended up on the same

2786
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:38,000
panel and the founders were like hey so

2787
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,520
what's it like to follow really close

2788
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,118
behind another truck which was kind of

2789
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,639
the the stage that they were at was like

2790
01:36:41,118 --> 01:36:44,719
you know what's that experience gonna be

2791
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:46,639
like and i was like it truckers aren't

2792
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:48,800
gonna like it you know i mean that

2793
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:50,639
that's just like the cardinal rule is

2794
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,800
following distance like that's the one

2795
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:54,079
you really shouldn't violate right um

2796
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,520
and and when you're out on the road like

2797
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:58,238
you have that trucker like right on your

2798
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:00,719
ass you know people remember that they

2799
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:02,718
don't remember the 99.9

2800
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:04,560
of truckers that are not on their ass

2801
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:06,000
you know like they they they're very

2802
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,440
careful about that but when you're when

2803
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,719
the trucks are really close together

2804
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:11,599
there's benefits in terms of

2805
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:12,880
aerodynamics so that's the the idea so

2806
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:15,520
like if you

2807
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:17,359
want to get some benefits of uh a

2808
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,639
platoon you want that to be close

2809
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:20,719
together but you're saying that's very

2810
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:22,480
uncomfortable for truckers yeah so i

2811
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:24,239
mean i think that ended up at the i mean

2812
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:28,238
peloton i think is is sort of winding

2813
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:30,000
down um their their work on this um and

2814
01:37:28,238 --> 01:37:32,238
i think that ended up being still an

2815
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,479
open question like and i had a chance to

2816
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:36,079
interview a couple drivers who um at

2817
01:37:34,479 --> 01:37:38,718
least one maybe two of which had

2818
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:41,118
actually driven in their platoons um and

2819
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:43,198
i got completely different experiences

2820
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:44,559
some of them were like it's really cool

2821
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:47,279
you know i'm like in communication with

2822
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:49,840
that other driver um you know i can see

2823
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:51,759
on a screen what what's out out you know

2824
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,920
the front of his truck um and then

2825
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,119
somewhere like it's too close um and it

2826
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,719
might be one of those things that's just

2827
01:37:55,118 --> 01:37:57,759
you know takes an adjustment to to sort

2828
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:59,359
of get there

2829
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,760
so you get the aerodynamic advantage

2830
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:03,679
which which you know saves fuel um

2831
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:06,320
there's some problems though right so

2832
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:07,840
you know you're getting that aerodynamic

2833
01:38:06,319 --> 01:38:10,319
advantage because there's a low pressure

2834
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,880
system in front of that following truck

2835
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:15,599
but the the engine is designed with

2836
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:17,279
higher pressure um feeding that engine

2837
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,520
right so there are sort of adjustments

2838
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:21,679
that you need to make and you know still

2839
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,440
the benefits are are there

2840
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:25,760
that's one scenario and that's just the

2841
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:26,799
automation of that acceleration and

2842
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,440
braking

2843
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:31,440
starsky which um you know

2844
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:32,559
probably a lot of your listeners heard

2845
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:34,879
heard about

2846
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,320
um was working on another scenario which

2847
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:38,239
was

2848
01:38:36,319 --> 01:38:40,639
you know to solve that local problem was

2849
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:43,678
going to do tele operation right sort of

2850
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:45,359
remote piloting um i had a chance to you

2851
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:47,199
know sort of watch

2852
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:50,559
watch them do that it was you know they

2853
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:52,319
they drove a truck in florida from um

2854
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,080
from san francisco in in one of their

2855
01:38:52,319 --> 01:38:55,679
office offices uh that was that was

2856
01:38:54,079 --> 01:38:57,439
really interesting and then in case it's

2857
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:58,399
not clear tele operation means you're

2858
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:00,238
controlling

2859
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:01,759
the truck remotely like it's a video

2860
01:39:00,238 --> 01:39:03,439
game

2861
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,119
so uh

2862
01:39:03,439 --> 01:39:06,799
you got the chance to witness it does it

2863
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:09,279
actually work

2864
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:10,880
yeah i mean so it's uh what are the pros

2865
01:39:09,279 --> 01:39:12,960
and cons you know one of the problems

2866
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,719
with with doing research like this with

2867
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,399
all these with all these silicon valley

2868
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,439
folks are the ndas

2869
01:39:16,399 --> 01:39:18,960
all right

2870
01:39:17,439 --> 01:39:20,960
right so so i don't you know i don't

2871
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:23,118
know what i'm able to say uh about sort

2872
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,719
of watching it but obviously the their

2873
01:39:23,118 --> 01:39:26,238
public statements about sort of what the

2874
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:27,760
challenges are right and it's about the

2875
01:39:26,238 --> 01:39:31,039
the latency

2876
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:32,960
and the ability to sort of in real time

2877
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:36,000
there's challenges that let me say one

2878
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:38,239
thing uh so i'm talking to the the

2879
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
you know i've talked to the waymo cto

2880
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:42,718
i'm in conversations with them talking

2881
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,840
to the the head of trucking boris uh

2882
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:46,239
sofman

2883
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:48,319
in next month actually i'm a huge fan of

2884
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:50,718
his because he was uh i think the

2885
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:51,920
founder of anki which is a toy robotics

2886
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:54,880
company

2887
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,560
uh so i love cute i love human robot

2888
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,840
interaction and he created one of the

2889
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:00,960
most

2890
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:02,319
uh effective and beautiful

2891
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:05,520
toy robots

2892
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:07,279
um anyway i keep complaining to them on

2893
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,719
email privately

2894
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:11,039
that uh

2895
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:13,840
there's way too much marketing in these

2896
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:15,439
conversations and not enough showing off

2897
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:17,360
the both the challenge and the beauty of

2898
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:19,279
the engineering efforts and that seems

2899
01:40:17,359 --> 01:40:21,679
to be the case for a lot of these

2900
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:25,359
silicon valley tech companies they they

2901
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:27,679
put up this uh you talk about ndas

2902
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:29,599
they they've i for some reason

2903
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:31,118
rightfully wrongfully

2904
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,440
because there's been so much hype and so

2905
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:36,479
much money being made

2906
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:38,238
they don't see the um

2907
01:40:36,479 --> 01:40:40,718
the upside in

2908
01:40:38,238 --> 01:40:42,399
being transparent and educating the

2909
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:43,198
public about how difficult the problem

2910
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:45,439
is

2911
01:40:43,198 --> 01:40:46,960
it's much more effective for them to say

2912
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:48,319
we have everything solved this will

2913
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,000
change everything this will change

2914
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:52,158
society as we know and just kind of wave

2915
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,238
their hands as opposed to exploring

2916
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:56,158
together like these different scenarios

2917
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:57,599
what are the pros and cons why is it

2918
01:40:56,158 --> 01:40:59,279
really difficult

2919
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,760
you know what are the what are the gray

2920
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:03,279
areas of where it works and doesn't uh

2921
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,600
what's the role of the human in this

2922
01:41:03,279 --> 01:41:07,359
picture of the both the sort of the

2923
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:09,520
operators and the other humans on the

2924
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:12,559
road all of that which are fascinating

2925
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:13,920
human problems fascinating engineering

2926
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:16,960
problems that i wish we could have a

2927
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:18,560
conversation about as opposed to uh

2928
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,880
always feeling like it's just marketing

2929
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:22,400
talk because a lot of what we're talking

2930
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,400
about now

2931
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:26,638
even you with having private

2932
01:41:24,399 --> 01:41:28,719
conversations under nda

2933
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:30,400
you still don't have the full picture

2934
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:32,800
of everything of how difficult this

2935
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:35,439
problem is one of the

2936
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:38,320
big questions i've had still have is how

2937
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:39,919
difficult is driving i've disagreed with

2938
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:42,319
you know elon musk and jim keller on

2939
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:43,118
this point i have a sense that driving

2940
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:45,279
is

2941
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:46,960
really difficult

2942
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:49,359
you know the task of driving just

2943
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,158
broadly this is like philosophy talk

2944
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:52,639
how

2945
01:41:50,158 --> 01:41:55,279
how much intelligence is required

2946
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,239
to drive a car

2947
01:41:55,279 --> 01:41:58,479
so

2948
01:41:56,238 --> 01:42:01,118
from uh like a jim keller who used to be

2949
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:02,879
the head of autopilot the idea is that

2950
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:05,118
it's just a collision avoidance problem

2951
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,800
it's like billiard balls

2952
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:08,559
it's like you have to convert the drive

2953
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,480
you have to do some basic perception a

2954
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:13,280
computer vision to convert

2955
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:14,399
driving into a game of pool and then you

2956
01:42:13,279 --> 01:42:17,118
just have to get everything into a

2957
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:18,879
pocket yeah to me there seems to be some

2958
01:42:17,118 --> 01:42:20,559
game theoretic dance

2959
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:23,039
uh combined with the fact that people's

2960
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:24,880
life is at stake and then when people

2961
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:26,639
die at the hands of a robot the reaction

2962
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,239
is going to be much more complicated so

2963
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:30,000
all of that but that's still an open

2964
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:31,839
question and the cool thing is all of

2965
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,079
these companies

2966
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:36,560
are struggling with this question

2967
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:38,479
of how difficult is it to solve this

2968
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:40,000
problem sufficiently such that we can

2969
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:41,919
build the business on top of it and have

2970
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,679
a product that's going to make a huge

2971
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,840
amount of money and compete with the

2972
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:48,639
manually driven uh

2973
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,319
vehicles and so their tele operation

2974
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:52,239
from starsky's is a really interesting

2975
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:54,479
idea how much

2976
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:56,479
can uh i mean there's a few autonomous

2977
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:58,879
vehicle companies that tried to

2978
01:42:56,479 --> 01:42:59,919
integrate tele operation in the picture

2979
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:02,159
can we

2980
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:04,560
reduce some of the costs

2981
01:43:02,158 --> 01:43:07,198
while still having reliability

2982
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,199
like uh

2983
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,840
catch when the vehicle

2984
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:13,679
fails by having tele operation it's an

2985
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:14,560
open question

2986
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:16,480
so

2987
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:19,199
that's that's for you scenario number

2988
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:21,279
two is to uh use teleoperation as part

2989
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:23,039
of the picture yeah let me let me follow

2990
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:25,439
up on that question of how hard driving

2991
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:26,639
is because this this becomes a big

2992
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:28,158
question for researchers who are

2993
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:29,600
thinking about labor market impacts

2994
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:32,079
right because

2995
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:36,000
we start from a perspective of what's

2996
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:38,158
hard or easy for humans right um and so

2997
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,079
you know if you were to look at truck

2998
01:43:38,158 --> 01:43:42,879
driving prior to a lot i mean there's

2999
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:44,960
been a lot of thinking and debate in um

3000
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:47,039
in academic you know research circles

3001
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,399
around sort of how you estimate labor

3002
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:50,399
impacts right what these models look

3003
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:53,279
like and a lot of it is about how

3004
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:55,279
automatable is a job object recognition

3005
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:57,439
really easy for people right really hard

3006
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:59,279
for computers and so there's a whole

3007
01:43:57,439 --> 01:44:00,479
bunch of things that you know truck

3008
01:43:59,279 --> 01:44:04,000
drivers do

3009
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:06,238
that we see as you know super easy and

3010
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:09,279
as it would have been characterized 10

3011
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:11,839
years ago routine and it's not for a

3012
01:44:09,279 --> 01:44:13,439
computer right it's a it's it turns out

3013
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,039
to be something that we do naturally

3014
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:17,759
that is that is you know sort of cutting

3015
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:20,158
edge right um computer science

3016
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:22,239
so on the tele operation question i

3017
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:24,638
think this is um

3018
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:26,879
this is a more interesting one than than

3019
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:28,239
people would like to sort of let on i

3020
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,679
think publicly

3021
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:32,000
um

3022
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:33,600
they're going to be problems right um

3023
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,039
and this is one of the complexities of

3024
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,960
sort of putting these things out in the

3025
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:38,960
world and if you see the real world of

3026
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,279
trucking you realize

3027
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:43,760
wow it's rough you know there are dirt

3028
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:45,519
lots there's gravel there's salt and ice

3029
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,039
and cold weather and there's equipment

3030
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,719
that just gets left out in the middle of

3031
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:50,639
nowhere and the brakes don't get

3032
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:52,239
maintained and somebody was supposed to

3033
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:53,199
service something and they didn't you

3034
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:55,519
know

3035
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:57,279
and so you imagine okay we've got this

3036
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:58,880
vehicle that can drive itself which is

3037
01:44:57,279 --> 01:45:01,439
going to require a whole lot of sensors

3038
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,440
to tell it that like the doors are still

3039
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:05,198
closed and the trailer's still hooked up

3040
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:07,439
and each of the tires has adequate

3041
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:09,118
pressure and you know any number of you

3042
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:10,399
know probably hundreds of sensors that

3043
01:45:09,118 --> 01:45:11,759
are going to be sort of relaying

3044
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:13,198
information

3045
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:15,679
and one of them

3046
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:16,960
you know after 500 000 miles or whatever

3047
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:19,520
goes out

3048
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:21,600
now you know do we have some fleet of

3049
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:23,520
technicians sort of continually cruising

3050
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:25,679
the highways and sort of servicing these

3051
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:27,440
things as they do what pull themselves

3052
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:29,679
off to the side of the road and say i've

3053
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:31,198
got a sensor fault i'm pulling over you

3054
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:33,440
know or maybe there's some level of like

3055
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:35,198
critical safety critical faults or or

3056
01:45:33,439 --> 01:45:36,238
whatever um

3057
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:38,638
it might be

3058
01:45:36,238 --> 01:45:41,118
so you know that

3059
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:43,679
suggests that there might be a role for

3060
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:46,719
tele operation even with self-driving

3061
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:49,440
and when i push people on it in in the

3062
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:51,118
conversations they all are like yeah we

3063
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:52,000
kind of have that on the like bottom of

3064
01:45:51,118 --> 01:45:54,399
the list

3065
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,279
figure out how to rescue truck you know

3066
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:57,519
it gets

3067
01:45:55,279 --> 01:45:59,439
on the to-do list right after solving

3068
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:01,600
the self-driving you know question is

3069
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:03,678
like yeah what do we do with the

3070
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,440
problems right i mean now we could we

3071
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:07,679
can imagine like all right we have some

3072
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:10,319
you know protocol that the truck is not

3073
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:12,960
you know realizes the system says not

3074
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:14,799
safe for operation pull to the side

3075
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,960
good you have a crash but now you got a

3076
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:18,639
truck stranded on the side of the road

3077
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,560
you're gonna send out somebody to like

3078
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:22,639
calibrate things and check out what's

3079
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:25,199
going on or that sounds like expensive

3080
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:26,719
labor it sounds like downtime it sounds

3081
01:46:25,198 --> 01:46:28,638
like the kind of things that shippers

3082
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:30,800
don't like to happen to their freight

3083
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:32,319
you know in a in a just-in-time world

3084
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:35,119
and so wouldn't it be great if you could

3085
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:35,840
just sort of you know loop your way into

3086
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:37,759
the

3087
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:39,679
controls of that truck and say all right

3088
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:41,039
we've got a sensor out says me that says

3089
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:43,279
that the tire is bad but i can see

3090
01:46:41,039 --> 01:46:45,519
visually from the camera looks fine i'm

3091
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:47,359
going to drive it to our next depot you

3092
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:49,199
know maybe the next rider or penske

3093
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:51,519
location right sort of all these service

3094
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:53,678
locations around and have a tech nation

3095
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:56,320
technician take a look at it so

3096
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:57,118
tally operation often gets this you know

3097
01:46:56,319 --> 01:46:58,479
um

3098
01:46:57,118 --> 01:46:59,679
dismissive

3099
01:46:58,479 --> 01:47:01,678
um

3100
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:03,920
you know commentary from from other

3101
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:06,399
folks working on other other scenarios

3102
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:09,760
but i think it's it's potentially more

3103
01:47:06,399 --> 01:47:11,679
relevant than than than we hear publicly

3104
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:14,400
but it's a hard problem

3105
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:14,399
and uh

3106
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:18,158
you know for me

3107
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:19,679
i've gotten a chance to interact with

3108
01:47:18,158 --> 01:47:21,920
people that take on hard problems and

3109
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:22,880
solve them and they're rare what tesla

3110
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:25,520
has done

3111
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:27,760
with their data engine

3112
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:29,280
so i thought autonomous driving cannot

3113
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,199
be solved

3114
01:47:29,279 --> 01:47:32,479
without collecting a huge amount of data

3115
01:47:31,198 --> 01:47:34,719
and organizing the wall not just

3116
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:37,359
collecting but organizing it

3117
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:38,800
and exactly what tesla is doing now is

3118
01:47:37,359 --> 01:47:40,479
what i thought it would be like i

3119
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:42,000
couldn't see car companies doing that

3120
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:43,279
including tesla

3121
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,158
and now that they're doing that it's

3122
01:47:43,279 --> 01:47:48,319
like oh okay so it's possible to take on

3123
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:50,799
this huge effort seriously to me

3124
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:51,759
teleoperation is another huge effort

3125
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,159
like that

3126
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:56,880
it's like taking seriously

3127
01:47:54,158 --> 01:47:59,920
what happens when it fails

3128
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:01,920
what's the in the case of waymo for um

3129
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:04,158
for the consumer like ride sharing

3130
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:05,840
what's the customer experience like

3131
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:07,920
there's a bunch of videos online now

3132
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,000
where people are like the car

3133
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:11,520
fails and it pulls off to the side and

3134
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,880
you call like customer service and

3135
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:15,520
you're basically sitting there for a

3136
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:17,118
long time and there's confusion and then

3137
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:18,320
there's a rescue that comes and they

3138
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:20,559
start to i mean just the whole

3139
01:48:18,319 --> 01:48:21,599
experience is a mess that has a ripple

3140
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:24,320
effect

3141
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:26,880
to how you trust in in the entirety of

3142
01:48:24,319 --> 01:48:29,359
the experience but like actually taking

3143
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:32,159
on the problem of that failure case

3144
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:34,559
and revolutionizing that experience both

3145
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:36,238
for trucking and for ride sharing that's

3146
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:37,199
an amazing opportunity there because

3147
01:48:36,238 --> 01:48:40,000
that

3148
01:48:37,198 --> 01:48:41,759
feels like it would change everything

3149
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,079
if you can reliably know when the

3150
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:46,800
failures happen which they will you have

3151
01:48:44,079 --> 01:48:48,000
a clear plan that doesn't significantly

3152
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,199
affect the efficiency of the whole

3153
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,600
process

3154
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:53,198
that that could be the game changer

3155
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,880
and if tele operation is part of that it

3156
01:48:53,198 --> 01:48:56,879
could be just like you're saying it

3157
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:59,520
could be tele operation or it could be

3158
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:01,760
like a fleet of rescuers that can come

3159
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:03,520
in which is a similar idea but tell the

3160
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:05,119
operation obviously

3161
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:07,360
that allows you to

3162
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:10,000
to just have a network of monitors of

3163
01:49:07,359 --> 01:49:12,880
people monitoring this giant fleet of

3164
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:15,359
trucks and taking over when needed it's

3165
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:18,159
a beautiful vision of the future where

3166
01:49:15,359 --> 01:49:20,799
there's millions of robots

3167
01:49:18,158 --> 01:49:22,559
and only thousands of humans monitoring

3168
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,960
those millions of robots

3169
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:27,199
that seems like

3170
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:29,039
that seems like a perfect dance

3171
01:49:27,198 --> 01:49:30,799
of allowing humans to do what they do

3172
01:49:29,039 --> 01:49:31,840
best and allowing robots to do what they

3173
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:34,639
do best

3174
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:36,719
yeah yeah so i mean i think there are um

3175
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:37,679
and we just applied for an nsf we didn't

3176
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:40,000
get

3177
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:41,520
anybody's watching

3178
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,158
but with some folks from wisconsin who

3179
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:46,080
do teleoperation right and and you know

3180
01:49:44,158 --> 01:49:48,158
some of this is used for like rovers and

3181
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:51,039
you know i mean really you know high

3182
01:49:48,158 --> 01:49:52,559
stakes difficult problems but one of the

3183
01:49:51,039 --> 01:49:54,719
things we wanted to study were these

3184
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:59,039
mines in these rio tinto mines in

3185
01:49:54,719 --> 01:50:00,880
australia where they remotely pilot the

3186
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:03,279
trucks and there's some autonomy i guess

3187
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:06,000
and then some but it's overseen by

3188
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:08,158
um a remote operator and they

3189
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,599
you know it's a it's a it's near perth

3190
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:13,759
it's quite remote and um

3191
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:16,079
they retrained the truck drivers to be

3192
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:18,320
the remote operators right um there's

3193
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:20,238
autonomy in in the port of rotterdam and

3194
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:22,479
places like that where there are jobs

3195
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:23,839
there and so there i think

3196
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:24,959
you know maybe we'll get to this later

3197
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,960
but you know there's a real policy

3198
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,639
question about sort of

3199
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,239
who's gonna lose and what we do about it

3200
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:32,000
and you know whether or not we there are

3201
01:50:30,238 --> 01:50:33,759
opportunities there that you know maybe

3202
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,479
we need to put our thumb on the scale a

3203
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:38,719
little bit to to make sure that you know

3204
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:40,799
there there's some give back to the

3205
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:42,800
community that's that's taking the hit

3206
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:45,039
you know um so for instance if there

3207
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:47,360
were tally operation centers you know

3208
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:49,118
maybe they go in these communities that

3209
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:51,279
we disproportionately source truck

3210
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:52,880
drivers from today now i mean what does

3211
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:54,238
that mean it may not be the cheapest

3212
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:56,560
place to do it if they don't have great

3213
01:50:54,238 --> 01:50:58,559
connectivity and it may not be where the

3214
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,239
upper level managers want to be and you

3215
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,679
know places like that you know issues

3216
01:51:00,238 --> 01:51:03,759
like that right so

3217
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:06,319
um i do think it's an interesting

3218
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:07,840
question you know both from sort of a

3219
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:10,079
practical

3220
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:12,719
uh scenario situation of how it's going

3221
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:15,118
to work but also from a policy

3222
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:16,880
perspective so there's platoons there's

3223
01:51:15,118 --> 01:51:17,839
tele operation

3224
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,359
and this is

3225
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:21,199
taking care of some of the highway

3226
01:51:19,359 --> 01:51:23,679
driving that we're talking about is

3227
01:51:21,198 --> 01:51:24,799
there other ideas like

3228
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:26,960
um

3229
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:29,279
is there other ideas scenarios that you

3230
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:31,439
have for autonomous trucks yeah so i

3231
01:51:29,279 --> 01:51:33,840
mean the the most obvious one actually

3232
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:36,319
is is just you know uh facility to

3233
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:39,199
facility right the sort of you know um

3234
01:51:36,319 --> 01:51:41,519
it can't go everywhere but a lot of

3235
01:51:39,198 --> 01:51:43,759
logistics facilities are very close to

3236
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:46,480
interstates and they're and they're on

3237
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:48,800
big commercial roads without you know

3238
01:51:46,479 --> 01:51:50,799
bikes and parked cars and all that stuff

3239
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:53,119
and some of the jobs that i think are

3240
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:55,520
really first on the chopping block

3241
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:57,439
are these ltl that less than truckload

3242
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:59,280
what's called line haul right so these

3243
01:51:57,439 --> 01:52:02,158
are the drivers who go from terminal to

3244
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:04,238
terminal with those full trailers

3245
01:52:02,158 --> 01:52:06,638
and those facilities are often located

3246
01:52:04,238 --> 01:52:08,879
strategically to avoid congestion

3247
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,800
right and to be in big you know

3248
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:13,359
industrial facilities so

3249
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:15,360
you could imagine that being you know

3250
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:17,519
the first place you see a waymo

3251
01:52:15,359 --> 01:52:20,238
self-driving you know truck roll out

3252
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:24,239
might be you know um sort of direct

3253
01:52:20,238 --> 01:52:26,000
facility to facility for ups or fedex or

3254
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:27,759
less than truckload care and the idea

3255
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,399
there is fully driverless so potentially

3256
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:32,560
not even a driver in the truck it's just

3257
01:52:30,399 --> 01:52:35,519
going from facility to facility

3258
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,599
empty zero occupancy yeah and those

3259
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:39,040
because that labor is expensive uh you

3260
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:41,039
know they don't keep those drivers out

3261
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:43,760
overnight those drivers do do a run back

3262
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:46,880
and forth typically um or in a team go

3263
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:49,199
back and forth in in one day

3264
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:51,359
so from the people you've spoken with uh

3265
01:52:49,198 --> 01:52:53,839
so far what's your sense how far are we

3266
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:56,799
away from which scenarios closest and

3267
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:59,199
how far away are we from that scenario

3268
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:02,079
of autonomy

3269
01:52:59,198 --> 01:53:04,879
being a big part of our trucking fleet

3270
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:07,279
most folks are are focused on another

3271
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:09,039
scenario which is the exit to exit right

3272
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:10,559
um which looks like that urban truck

3273
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:12,639
ports um

3274
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:14,320
thing that i laid out earlier you know

3275
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:17,679
so you have a human driven truck that

3276
01:53:14,319 --> 01:53:19,679
comes out to um a drop lot it meets up

3277
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:21,760
with an autonomous truck the

3278
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:23,760
that truck then you know drives it on

3279
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:26,400
the interstate to another lot

3280
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:28,000
and then a human driver

3281
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:30,559
you know picks it up

3282
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,319
there are a couple variations maybe on

3283
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:33,440
that um

3284
01:53:32,319 --> 01:53:35,359
so

3285
01:53:33,439 --> 01:53:37,919
or let me just run through the last two

3286
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:40,479
scenarios sure

3287
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,239
the other thing you could do right is to

3288
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:44,879
say all right i've got a truck that can

3289
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:47,439
drive itself um and i i refer to this

3290
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:49,118
one as autopilot but um

3291
01:53:47,439 --> 01:53:50,960
you know you have a human drive it out

3292
01:53:49,118 --> 01:53:51,679
to the interstate but rather than have

3293
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:54,079
that

3294
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:56,480
transaction where where the human driven

3295
01:53:54,079 --> 01:53:58,639
truck detaches the trailer and it gets

3296
01:53:56,479 --> 01:54:01,198
coupled up to a self-driving truck

3297
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:03,199
they just that human driver just hops on

3298
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:05,439
the interstate with that truck and goes

3299
01:54:03,198 --> 01:54:07,759
in back and goes off duty

3300
01:54:05,439 --> 01:54:09,519
while the truck drives itself and and so

3301
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:12,320
you have a self-driving truck that's not

3302
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:14,480
driverless right um and just to clarify

3303
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:16,319
because tesla uses the term autopilot so

3304
01:54:14,479 --> 01:54:18,559
the airplanes and so everybody uses the

3305
01:54:16,319 --> 01:54:20,960
word autopilot we're referring to

3306
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:23,520
essentially full autonomy but because

3307
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:25,198
it's exit to exit the truck driver is

3308
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:27,360
on board the truck but they're sleeping

3309
01:54:25,198 --> 01:54:30,000
in the back or whatever yeah and this

3310
01:54:27,359 --> 01:54:32,960
this gets to the really weedy policy

3311
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,399
questions right so basically for the

3312
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:36,480
department of transportation for you to

3313
01:54:34,399 --> 01:54:37,839
be off duty for safety reasons you have

3314
01:54:36,479 --> 01:54:39,279
to be completely relieved of all

3315
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:41,840
responsibility

3316
01:54:39,279 --> 01:54:44,000
so that truck has to not you know

3317
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:46,400
encounter a construction

3318
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,920
site or what inclement weather or

3319
01:54:46,399 --> 01:54:50,079
whatever it might be

3320
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:51,520
and and call to you and say hey you know

3321
01:54:50,079 --> 01:54:53,359
or i mean obviously right we're

3322
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,480
imagining connected vehicles as well

3323
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:56,079
right so

3324
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:59,118
you're in a self-driving truck you're in

3325
01:54:56,079 --> 01:55:02,079
the back and trucks 20 miles ahead

3326
01:54:59,118 --> 01:55:03,679
experience some problem right um that

3327
01:55:02,079 --> 01:55:05,760
may require tele operation or whatever

3328
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:08,239
it is right and it signals to your truck

3329
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:10,800
hey you know tell the driver 20 miles

3330
01:55:08,238 --> 01:55:12,238
ahead he's he's got to hop in the seat

3331
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:13,440
that would mean that they're on duty

3332
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:15,039
according to the way that the current

3333
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:16,879
rules are written they have some

3334
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:18,960
responsibility and part of that is you

3335
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:21,840
know we need we need them get rest right

3336
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:23,439
um they need to have uninterrupted

3337
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:26,079
sleep so

3338
01:55:23,439 --> 01:55:27,359
that's what i call autopilot the the

3339
01:55:26,079 --> 01:55:28,479
final

3340
01:55:27,359 --> 01:55:30,799
scenario

3341
01:55:28,479 --> 01:55:33,118
is one that i i thought was actually the

3342
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:36,239
one scenario that was good for labor

3343
01:55:33,118 --> 01:55:37,519
um you know uh which i which i i i

3344
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:38,879
proposed because i'm like well here's

3345
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:42,000
here's an idea you know that would be

3346
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:42,800
like actually good for workers um and

3347
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,319
just

3348
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:46,880
another

3349
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:49,679
brief aside here um

3350
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:52,000
the history of trucking over the last

3351
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:54,719
you know 40 years there's been a lot of

3352
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,920
technological change so when i

3353
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:57,279
learned to drive the truck i had to

3354
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:59,440
learn to manually shift it like i was

3355
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:01,279
describing you had to read these fairly

3356
01:55:59,439 --> 01:56:03,118
complicated you know big sets of

3357
01:56:01,279 --> 01:56:05,039
laminated maps to figure out where the

3358
01:56:03,118 --> 01:56:06,479
truck can go and where it couldn't which

3359
01:56:05,039 --> 01:56:08,158
is a big deal you know when you take

3360
01:56:06,479 --> 01:56:09,519
these trucks on the wrong road and

3361
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:10,879
you're destroying a bridge or you're

3362
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:12,719
doing a can opener which is where you

3363
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:14,319
try to drive it under about too low

3364
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:16,480
you've probably seen that on on youtube

3365
01:56:14,319 --> 01:56:19,039
if not you know check it out you know

3366
01:56:16,479 --> 01:56:20,559
truck can opener um you know there's

3367
01:56:19,039 --> 01:56:22,079
some bridges that are famous for it

3368
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:23,520
right and there's one i think called the

3369
01:56:22,079 --> 01:56:25,039
can opener

3370
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:26,560
you can find on youtube

3371
01:56:25,039 --> 01:56:29,118
um

3372
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:31,679
and you know you had to log those hours

3373
01:56:29,118 --> 01:56:34,158
like manually and sort of do do the math

3374
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:35,440
and and plan your work routine

3375
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:37,359
and i would do this every day i'd say

3376
01:56:35,439 --> 01:56:38,960
like okay i'm going to get up at 5. i

3377
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:40,799
got to think about buffalo and there's

3378
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:43,599
traffic there so i want to be through

3379
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:46,800
buffalo by 6 30 you know and then

3380
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:49,440
that'll put me you know in in cleveland

3381
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:51,520
at you know 9 30

3382
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:52,559
which means i'll miss that rush hour

3383
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:54,880
right which is going to put me in

3384
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:55,679
chicago you know and and so you do this

3385
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:59,359
and

3386
01:56:55,679 --> 01:57:01,520
now today you know 15 years later truck

3387
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:03,279
drivers don't have to do any of that um

3388
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:05,920
you know you don't have to shift the

3389
01:57:03,279 --> 01:57:08,559
truck you don't have to map um you know

3390
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:11,199
you can figure out the least congested

3391
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:13,599
route to go on and your hours of service

3392
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:15,839
are recorded or a good portion of them

3393
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:17,039
are reported

3394
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:18,880
automatically

3395
01:57:17,039 --> 01:57:21,359
all of that has been a substantial

3396
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:23,440
de-skilling that has you know put

3397
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:25,679
downward pressure on rage wages and

3398
01:57:23,439 --> 01:57:28,479
allowed companies to kind of speed up

3399
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:30,480
monitor and direct i mean the the key

3400
01:57:28,479 --> 01:57:32,638
technology you know that i did work

3401
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:34,158
under is satellite linked computers so

3402
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:35,760
before you could kind of go out and plan

3403
01:57:34,158 --> 01:57:37,039
your own work and the boss really

3404
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:39,199
couldn't see what you were doing and

3405
01:57:37,039 --> 01:57:41,118
push you and say you know you've been on

3406
01:57:39,198 --> 01:57:43,359
break for 10 hours why aren't you moving

3407
01:57:41,118 --> 01:57:45,039
you know um and you might tell them

3408
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:46,319
you know because i'm tired you know like

3409
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:48,560
i didn't sleep well i've got to get a

3410
01:57:46,319 --> 01:57:50,399
couple more hours you know they're only

3411
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:53,119
going to accept that so many times or at

3412
01:57:50,399 --> 01:57:55,039
least some of those dispatchers are so

3413
01:57:53,118 --> 01:57:57,359
all this technology has has made the job

3414
01:57:55,039 --> 01:57:59,519
sort of you know de-skilled the job you

3415
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:01,679
know hurt drivers in the labor market

3416
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,719
made the work worse

3417
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:05,679
so

3418
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:08,079
i think the burden is really on

3419
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:09,920
the technologists who are like oh this

3420
01:58:08,079 --> 01:58:11,599
will make truck driver jobs better and

3421
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,399
sort of envision ways that it would it's

3422
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:14,480
like

3423
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:16,799
the burden's really a proof is really on

3424
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:19,598
you to sort of really clearly lay out

3425
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:22,239
what that is going to look like because

3426
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:25,119
it's 30 or 40 years of history suggests

3427
01:58:22,238 --> 01:58:27,279
that that technology into labor markets

3428
01:58:25,118 --> 01:58:29,519
where workers are really weak

3429
01:58:27,279 --> 01:58:31,599
and cheap is what wins

3430
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:33,760
that new technology doesn't help workers

3431
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:35,840
or raise their wages

3432
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:38,000
so lowers the bar of entry in terms of

3433
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,880
skill yeah

3434
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,800
so

3435
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:45,118
that's that's really interest that's um

3436
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:47,119
that's tough that's tough to know to do

3437
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:49,039
with because yeah from a technology

3438
01:58:47,118 --> 01:58:51,839
perspective you want to make the life of

3439
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:52,639
the people doing the job today easier is

3440
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:55,360
it

3441
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:57,599
is that what you want no but that like

3442
01:58:55,359 --> 01:59:00,238
when you think about like what

3443
01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:02,319
exactly because the reality is

3444
01:59:00,238 --> 01:59:04,000
you will make the their life potentially

3445
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:06,238
a little bit easier

3446
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:08,719
but that will allow the companies to

3447
01:59:06,238 --> 01:59:10,238
then hire people that are less skilled

3448
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:12,560
it will get those people that are

3449
01:59:10,238 --> 01:59:17,039
previously working there fired or lower

3450
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:20,080
wages and so the result of this easier

3451
01:59:17,039 --> 01:59:23,118
is a lower quality of life yeah that's

3452
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:24,880
dark actually i know i'm sorry

3453
01:59:23,118 --> 01:59:27,039
but you're you were saying that was for

3454
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:29,039
you initially the hopeful

3455
01:59:27,039 --> 01:59:30,479
oh no so i'll i'll get to that but one

3456
01:59:29,039 --> 01:59:32,000
more thing because this this is not

3457
01:59:30,479 --> 01:59:33,439
stopping right and this is another

3458
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,679
interesting question about the sort of

3459
01:59:33,439 --> 01:59:37,839
automation and i think uber

3460
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:39,118
right is is a is an interesting example

3461
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:41,520
here right where it's like okay if we

3462
01:59:39,118 --> 01:59:43,279
had self-driving trucks or self-driving

3463
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:44,960
cars right we could we could automate

3464
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:46,000
you know what what used to be taxi

3465
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:47,039
service

3466
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,560
there's a whole bunch of stuff that's

3467
01:59:47,039 --> 01:59:50,319
already been automated like the

3468
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:53,039
dispatching so the dispatchers are

3469
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:54,719
already out of work in in rideshare and

3470
01:59:53,039 --> 01:59:56,880
the payment is already automated right

3471
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:58,960
so so you have to automate steps like

3472
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:00,960
this so you have to have you know that

3473
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:03,198
initial link to dispatch the truck you

3474
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:04,880
have to have the you know the automated

3475
02:00:03,198 --> 02:00:07,439
mapping and all so we've sort of done

3476
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:09,840
all this you know incremental automation

3477
02:00:07,439 --> 02:00:11,439
right that could make the truck um

3478
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:13,039
completely driverless

3479
02:00:11,439 --> 02:00:15,198
there's some important things happening

3480
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:15,920
right now with the remaining good jobs

3481
02:00:15,198 --> 02:00:17,678
so

3482
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:20,000
what you're really paying for when you

3483
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:21,520
get a good truck driver is you know like

3484
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:25,118
i said you get those kind of local

3485
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:27,119
skills of like backing and congested

3486
02:00:25,118 --> 02:00:28,639
traffic those

3487
02:00:27,118 --> 02:00:30,639
it's really impressive to watch and

3488
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:34,159
there's some value on it certainly but

3489
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:36,560
it's relatively low value um in in the

3490
02:00:34,158 --> 02:00:38,559
actual driving technique right so

3491
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:40,239
you bump something you know back into

3492
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:41,920
the dock it's you know it might be a

3493
02:00:40,238 --> 02:00:43,519
couple thousand dollars because you ruin

3494
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:45,359
a canopy or something over a dock or

3495
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:47,760
tear up a trailer

3496
02:00:45,359 --> 02:00:48,960
what you really want those those highly

3497
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:50,960
skilled

3498
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:52,639
conscientious drivers and that's really

3499
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:54,319
what it what it is and that's what

3500
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:56,159
computers are really good at is about

3501
02:00:54,319 --> 02:00:58,639
being conscientious right in the sense

3502
02:00:56,158 --> 02:01:00,399
of like they pay attention continually

3503
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:02,400
right and and how it was describing

3504
02:01:00,399 --> 02:01:05,679
those those long-haul segments where the

3505
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:07,439
driver you know just keeps out of the

3506
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:09,679
the situations that could become

3507
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:11,439
problematic right and just they don't

3508
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:13,760
look at their phone and they take the

3509
02:01:11,439 --> 02:01:16,158
job seriously and they're safe and you

3510
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:18,480
can give somebody a skills test right in

3511
02:01:16,158 --> 02:01:19,359
in you know as a cdl examiner you could

3512
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:20,799
take them out and say all right i need

3513
02:01:19,359 --> 02:01:24,158
you to go around these cones and like

3514
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:26,239
drive safely through this school zone

3515
02:01:24,158 --> 02:01:28,319
but what really proves that you're a

3516
02:01:26,238 --> 02:01:30,559
safe driver is two years without an

3517
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:33,279
accident right because that means that

3518
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:36,719
day after day hour after hour mile after

3519
02:01:33,279 --> 02:01:38,238
mile you did the right thing right um

3520
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:39,599
and not when it was like oh some

3521
02:01:38,238 --> 02:01:42,158
situation's emerging but just

3522
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:44,319
consistently over time kept yourself out

3523
02:01:42,158 --> 02:01:45,679
of accident situations and you can see

3524
02:01:44,319 --> 02:01:47,920
this with drivers who are you know a

3525
02:01:45,679 --> 02:01:50,239
million or two million safe miles

3526
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:52,560
the value of those drivers for walmart

3527
02:01:50,238 --> 02:01:55,039
is they don't run over minivans

3528
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:57,599
the company i ran i worked for they ran

3529
02:01:55,039 --> 02:01:59,039
over minivans on a regular basis so you

3530
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:02,239
know when i when i was trained they said

3531
02:01:59,039 --> 02:02:02,238
we kill 20 people a year

3532
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:06,719
we send someone to the funeral there's a

3533
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:09,039
big check involved

3534
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:10,960
um don't be that you know we don't want

3535
02:02:09,039 --> 02:02:12,880
to go to your funeral and you don't want

3536
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:15,118
to be the person who

3537
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:18,159
who caused that funeral

3538
02:02:15,118 --> 02:02:19,920
okay so they they just write that off

3539
02:02:18,158 --> 02:02:21,598
okay that's just part of the business

3540
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:25,199
model now

3541
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:26,639
um forward collision avoidance

3542
02:02:25,198 --> 02:02:28,799
can

3543
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:30,880
you know basically eliminate the vast

3544
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:32,560
majority of those accidents

3545
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:34,560
that's what the value of a really

3546
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:37,280
expensive conscientious driver is based

3547
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:38,880
on they don't run over minivans so as

3548
02:02:37,279 --> 02:02:40,158
soon as you have that forward collision

3549
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:41,840
avoidance

3550
02:02:40,158 --> 02:02:43,679
what's going to happen to the wages of

3551
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:46,000
those drivers

3552
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:48,000
by way of a therapy session help me

3553
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,520
understand

3554
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,198
it is a

3555
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:52,560
collision avoidance

3556
02:02:51,198 --> 02:02:55,118
um

3557
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,679
automated collision avoidance systems

3558
02:02:55,118 --> 02:02:59,198
are they good or bad for society

3559
02:02:57,679 --> 02:03:00,639
yeah i mean

3560
02:02:59,198 --> 02:03:02,079
you know this this is

3561
02:03:00,639 --> 02:03:04,159
they're good

3562
02:03:02,079 --> 02:03:07,519
right they're good but

3563
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:10,319
in uh what do we do about the pain

3564
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:12,800
of a workforce in the short term

3565
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:15,679
because their their wages are going to

3566
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:18,400
go down because the job starts requiring

3567
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:20,480
less and less skill

3568
02:03:18,399 --> 02:03:22,879
is is it is there a hopeful message here

3569
02:03:20,479 --> 02:03:24,879
where other jobs are created

3570
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:26,960
so i'm you know i'm a sociologist right

3571
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:28,560
so you know so i'm going to think about

3572
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:30,079
what's what's the structure behind that

3573
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:31,679
that creates that pain

3574
02:03:30,079 --> 02:03:33,679
right and it's ownership

3575
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:35,440
right um you know we don't call it

3576
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:37,760
capitalism for nothing

3577
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:40,000
you know what capitalists do is they

3578
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:42,000
figure out cheaper more efficient ways

3579
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,238
to do stuff and they use technology to

3580
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:46,560
do that oftentimes right this is

3581
02:03:44,238 --> 02:03:48,238
the remarkable history of the last

3582
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:50,320
couple centuries and and all the

3583
02:03:48,238 --> 02:03:52,479
productivity gains is

3584
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:54,399
you know people who are in a competitive

3585
02:03:52,479 --> 02:03:56,879
market saying

3586
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:59,039
if i have to do it right i don't have a

3587
02:03:56,880 --> 02:04:00,960
choice because like my competitor over

3588
02:03:59,039 --> 02:04:03,439
there is going to eat my lunch if i'm

3589
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:05,679
not on my game um

3590
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:08,158
i don't have a choice i've got to invest

3591
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:10,800
in this technology to you know make it

3592
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:13,439
more more efficient to make it cheaper

3593
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:15,679
and what do you look for you look for

3594
02:04:13,439 --> 02:04:17,598
oftentimes you look for labor costs

3595
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:19,118
right you look for high value labor if i

3596
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:20,159
can take a hundred and

3597
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:21,519
you know these a lot of these truck

3598
02:04:20,158 --> 02:04:23,839
drivers make good money hundred thousand

3599
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:25,199
dollars good benefits vacation you know

3600
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:27,440
retirement

3601
02:04:25,198 --> 02:04:30,078
if i can replace them with a 35 000

3602
02:04:27,439 --> 02:04:32,960
worker when i'm competing with maybe a

3603
02:04:30,078 --> 02:04:35,198
low-wage retail employer rather than

3604
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:37,599
some other more expensive employers for

3605
02:04:35,198 --> 02:04:38,960
you know skilled blue collar workers i'm

3606
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:41,679
gonna do that

3607
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:44,078
um and that's just that's what we do

3608
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:45,599
and so i think

3609
02:04:44,078 --> 02:04:47,679
those those are the bigger questions

3610
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:49,679
around this technology right is like

3611
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:51,679
you know are workers gonna get screwed

3612
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:53,920
by this like yeah most likely like

3613
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:55,440
that's that's what we do

3614
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:57,039
so one of the things you say is i mean

3615
02:04:55,439 --> 02:04:59,039
first of all the numbers of workers that

3616
02:04:57,039 --> 02:05:00,960
will be that will feel this pain is not

3617
02:04:59,039 --> 02:05:03,840
perhaps as large as the journalists kind

3618
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,279
of articulate but nevertheless the pain

3619
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,360
is real

3620
02:05:05,279 --> 02:05:08,719
and

3621
02:05:07,359 --> 02:05:11,359
i guess

3622
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:12,960
my question here is um

3623
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:14,960
do you have an optimistic vision about

3624
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:17,279
the transformative effects of autonomous

3625
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:18,560
trucks on society

3626
02:05:17,279 --> 02:05:21,279
like

3627
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:22,960
if you look 20 years from now

3628
02:05:21,279 --> 02:05:25,118
and perhaps see

3629
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:26,960
maybe 30 years from now perhaps see

3630
02:05:25,118 --> 02:05:28,000
these autonomous trucks doing the

3631
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:30,319
various

3632
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,479
parts of the scenarios you listed and

3633
02:05:30,319 --> 02:05:33,279
there's just hundreds of thousands of

3634
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:36,238
them

3635
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:38,319
just uh like uh like veins like blood

3636
02:05:36,238 --> 02:05:41,759
throwing through flowing through veins

3637
02:05:38,319 --> 02:05:43,599
on the interstate system

3638
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,679
um

3639
02:05:43,599 --> 02:05:47,440
what kind of world do you see that's a

3640
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:50,560
better world than today that involves

3641
02:05:47,439 --> 02:05:52,158
his trucks yeah um can i defend myself

3642
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:54,480
first because i can i'm reading the

3643
02:05:52,158 --> 02:05:55,839
comments right now yes of people you

3644
02:05:54,479 --> 02:05:57,439
know of the economists who are telling

3645
02:05:55,840 --> 02:06:01,840
you're a commenter

3646
02:05:57,439 --> 02:06:04,399
dear phd economics yes um yes d dear phd

3647
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:07,520
in economics i know that that higher

3648
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:09,118
skilled jobs are created you know by by

3649
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:11,040
technological advancement right i mean

3650
02:06:09,118 --> 02:06:13,519
there are big questions about how many

3651
02:06:11,039 --> 02:06:15,039
of them right so the idea that we would

3652
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:18,239
create more

3653
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:20,399
um ex you know expensive labor

3654
02:06:18,238 --> 02:06:21,919
positions right with a new technology

3655
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:24,238
right you better check your business

3656
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:26,480
plan if your idea is to take you know a

3657
02:06:24,238 --> 02:06:28,238
bunch of low um low wage labor and

3658
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:29,678
replace it with the same amount of high

3659
02:06:28,238 --> 02:06:31,678
wage labor right so we there's a

3660
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:34,000
question about how many of those jobs

3661
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:36,319
and there's the really important social

3662
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:38,319
and political question of

3663
02:06:36,319 --> 02:06:40,078
are they the same people right and do

3664
02:06:38,319 --> 02:06:42,719
they live in the same places and i think

3665
02:06:40,078 --> 02:06:45,439
that kind of you know geography is a

3666
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:48,000
huge issue here with the impacts right

3667
02:06:45,439 --> 02:06:49,678
lots of rural workers um interesting

3668
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:51,599
politically lots of red state workers

3669
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:53,359
right lots of blue state maybe union

3670
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:55,840
folks who are going to try to slow

3671
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:57,359
autonomy and lots of red state you know

3672
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:59,599
representatives in the house maybe who

3673
02:06:57,359 --> 02:07:02,158
want to you know stand up for their for

3674
02:06:59,599 --> 02:07:04,000
their trucker constituents um so just

3675
02:07:02,158 --> 02:07:06,559
just to defend myself yeah and to

3676
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,238
elaborate i think economics as a field

3677
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:10,239
is not good at measuring the landscape

3678
02:07:08,238 --> 02:07:11,839
of human pain and suffering

3679
02:07:10,238 --> 02:07:13,678
so you know

3680
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:15,520
sometimes you can forget in the numbers

3681
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:17,279
as real lives that are at stake that's

3682
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:18,079
what i suppose sociology is better at

3683
02:07:17,279 --> 02:07:20,960
doing

3684
02:07:18,078 --> 02:07:24,238
uh so you try sometimes sometimes well

3685
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:26,560
the problem with i mean i'm somebody who

3686
02:07:24,238 --> 02:07:28,718
loves psychology and psychiatry and a

3687
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:31,039
little bit i guess of sociology

3688
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:33,439
i realized how little how

3689
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:35,279
tragically flawed the field is not

3690
02:07:33,439 --> 02:07:37,919
because of lack of trying but just how

3691
02:07:35,279 --> 02:07:40,399
difficult the problems are you had to do

3692
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:42,639
really thorough studies that understand

3693
02:07:40,399 --> 02:07:45,759
the fundamentals of human behavior and

3694
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:47,760
this yes landscape of human suffering

3695
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:50,719
it's just it's almost an impossible task

3696
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:52,800
without the data and we currently don't

3697
02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:54,319
you know not everybody's richly

3698
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:56,000
integrated to where they're fully

3699
02:07:54,319 --> 02:07:59,599
connected and all their information is

3700
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:01,679
being uh like recorded for sociologists

3701
02:07:59,599 --> 02:08:03,360
to study so you have to make a lot of

3702
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:04,639
inferences you have to talk to people

3703
02:08:03,359 --> 02:08:07,039
you have to do the interviews as you're

3704
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:09,520
doing and through that like really

3705
02:08:07,039 --> 02:08:10,719
difficult work try to understand

3706
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:12,719
like uh

3707
02:08:10,719 --> 02:08:15,039
hear the music that nobody else is

3708
02:08:12,719 --> 02:08:17,679
hearing the music of like what people

3709
02:08:15,039 --> 02:08:20,000
are feeling their hopes their dreams and

3710
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:22,880
their the crushing of their dreams due

3711
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:25,359
to some kind of economic forces yeah i

3712
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:27,679
mean we've just lived that for four and

3713
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:29,920
a half years of of probably you know

3714
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:30,800
elites let me just go out on a limb and

3715
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:33,599
say

3716
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:36,320
not understanding the sort of emotional

3717
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:38,319
and psychological currents of a large

3718
02:08:36,319 --> 02:08:40,639
portion of the population right and just

3719
02:08:38,319 --> 02:08:42,319
being stunned by it and and confused

3720
02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:44,239
right um

3721
02:08:42,319 --> 02:08:46,399
wasn't confusing for me

3722
02:08:44,238 --> 02:08:47,118
after having talked to truckers again

3723
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:48,879
who

3724
02:08:47,118 --> 02:08:50,559
trucking is the job of last resort these

3725
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:52,639
are people who've already lost that

3726
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:53,760
manufacturing job oftentimes already

3727
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:57,279
lost that

3728
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:59,360
construction job to just aging right

3729
02:08:57,279 --> 02:09:01,039
so what you know what can we do right

3730
02:08:59,359 --> 02:09:02,158
what's sort of the positive vision

3731
02:09:01,039 --> 02:09:04,078
because

3732
02:09:02,158 --> 02:09:07,039
like we've got tons of highway deaths

3733
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:08,479
we've got um and just to you know

3734
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:10,639
the big picture

3735
02:09:08,479 --> 02:09:12,879
is and this is the opportunity i guess

3736
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:15,520
for investors um

3737
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:17,599
it's a hugely inefficient system

3738
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:19,840
so we buy this truck there's this

3739
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:21,279
low-wage worker in it oftentimes and

3740
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:23,440
again i'm setting aside those really

3741
02:09:21,279 --> 02:09:26,078
good line haul jobs in ltl those are

3742
02:09:23,439 --> 02:09:28,559
those are a different case um

3743
02:09:26,078 --> 02:09:31,118
that low-wage worker is driving a truck

3744
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:32,560
that they they might the wheels might

3745
02:09:31,118 --> 02:09:33,920
roll seven to eight hours a day that's

3746
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:35,039
what the truck is designed to do and

3747
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:36,158
that's what makes the money for the

3748
02:09:35,039 --> 02:09:38,000
company

3749
02:09:36,158 --> 02:09:40,319
in other seven eight hours a day the

3750
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,158
driver's doing other kinds of work that

3751
02:09:40,319 --> 02:09:43,759
you know is not driving and then the

3752
02:09:42,158 --> 02:09:44,960
rest of the day they're basically living

3753
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:46,880
out of the truck

3754
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:49,760
like you really can't find a more

3755
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:50,960
inefficient use of an asset than than

3756
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:52,480
that right

3757
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:54,560
now a big part of that is we pay for the

3758
02:09:52,479 --> 02:09:56,399
roads and we pay for the rest areas and

3759
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:58,400
all that all this other stuff so

3760
02:09:56,399 --> 02:09:59,839
so the way that i work and the way that

3761
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:01,519
you know i think about these problems is

3762
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:03,440
i try to find analogies right sort of

3763
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:06,159
labor processes and things that that

3764
02:10:03,439 --> 02:10:08,719
make economic sense you know that

3765
02:10:06,158 --> 02:10:12,000
that seem you know in in this in the

3766
02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:13,920
same area of of the economy but have

3767
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,238
some some different characteristics for

3768
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:18,158
for workers right and and sort of try to

3769
02:10:16,238 --> 02:10:19,198
figure out why does the economics work

3770
02:10:18,158 --> 02:10:20,559
there

3771
02:10:19,198 --> 02:10:23,118
right and so

3772
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:24,639
if you look at those really good

3773
02:10:23,118 --> 02:10:27,039
jobs

3774
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:29,440
the mo the most likely way that you as a

3775
02:10:27,039 --> 02:10:30,960
as a passenger car driver would know

3776
02:10:29,439 --> 02:10:32,719
that it's one of those drivers is that

3777
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:34,480
they're multiple trailers

3778
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:36,399
right so you see these like maybe maybe

3779
02:10:34,479 --> 02:10:38,078
it's three small trailers maybe it's two

3780
02:10:36,399 --> 02:10:39,679
sort of medium-sized trailers some

3781
02:10:38,078 --> 02:10:42,158
places you might even see two really big

3782
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:44,078
trailers together

3783
02:10:42,158 --> 02:10:46,238
you do that because labor's expensive

3784
02:10:44,078 --> 02:10:48,319
right and it's highly skilled and so you

3785
02:10:46,238 --> 02:10:50,158
use it efficiently and you say all right

3786
02:10:48,319 --> 02:10:51,599
you know rather than having you you know

3787
02:10:50,158 --> 02:10:53,198
haul that little trailer out of the

3788
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:54,560
ports you know that sort of half size

3789
02:10:53,198 --> 02:10:56,078
container we're going to wait till we

3790
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,840
get three or we're gonna coordinate the

3791
02:10:56,078 --> 02:11:00,479
movement so that they're three ready you

3792
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:02,639
go do what truckers call make a set you

3793
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:05,678
put them together right and you and you

3794
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:07,679
go um that's a massive productivity gain

3795
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:10,560
right because you know you're hauling

3796
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:12,158
two three times as much freight so the

3797
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:13,840
the positive scenario that i threw out

3798
02:11:12,158 --> 02:11:16,719
in in 2018

3799
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:18,639
was why not have

3800
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:20,239
a human-driven truck

3801
02:11:18,639 --> 02:11:23,118
with a self-driving truck that follows

3802
02:11:20,238 --> 02:11:24,718
it right just a drone unit um

3803
02:11:23,118 --> 02:11:26,238
and

3804
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:28,078
it was you know

3805
02:11:26,238 --> 02:11:30,559
to me this seemed as a you know

3806
02:11:28,078 --> 02:11:32,399
non-computer scientist as a sociologist

3807
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:34,400
right this made a lot of sense because

3808
02:11:32,399 --> 02:11:36,078
when i got done talking to the you know

3809
02:11:34,399 --> 02:11:37,359
the computer scientists and and the

3810
02:11:36,078 --> 02:11:39,118
engineers they were like well you know

3811
02:11:37,359 --> 02:11:40,719
it's like object recognition decision

3812
02:11:39,118 --> 02:11:43,198
making algorithm all this stuff it's

3813
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:44,639
like all right so why don't you leave

3814
02:11:43,198 --> 02:11:45,759
the human brain

3815
02:11:44,639 --> 02:11:47,440
in the lead

3816
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:49,199
vehicle right you got all that

3817
02:11:47,439 --> 02:11:51,039
processing and then

3818
02:11:49,198 --> 02:11:54,238
all that following now again this is

3819
02:11:51,039 --> 02:11:55,920
sort of me being a um a lay person you

3820
02:11:54,238 --> 02:11:57,598
know i said why don't you know then that

3821
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:59,199
following truck right takes direction

3822
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:01,039
from the front it uses the rear of the

3823
02:11:59,198 --> 02:12:02,479
trailer as a reference point it

3824
02:12:01,039 --> 02:12:05,920
maintains the lane you've got

3825
02:12:02,479 --> 02:12:07,678
cooperative adaptive cruise control and

3826
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:10,239
that you double the productivity of that

3827
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:13,118
driver you solved that problem that i

3828
02:12:10,238 --> 02:12:14,718
that i i hated in in my you know urban

3829
02:12:13,118 --> 02:12:16,158
truck ports thing about the bridge

3830
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:18,960
weight because when you get to the

3831
02:12:16,158 --> 02:12:20,479
bridges you know the the two trucks can

3832
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:21,760
just spread out just enough to make the

3833
02:12:20,479 --> 02:12:23,598
bridge weight right and you can just

3834
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:25,679
program that in and you know they're 50

3835
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:28,239
feet further apart 100 feet further

3836
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:31,440
further apart um

3837
02:12:28,238 --> 02:12:33,359
so interesting sort of i think uh

3838
02:12:31,439 --> 02:12:36,559
story about this that that leads to kind

3839
02:12:33,359 --> 02:12:37,679
of i think the policy questions

3840
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:42,079
in

3841
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:44,319
i guess 2017 jack reed and susan collins

3842
02:12:42,078 --> 02:12:46,479
and you know requested from the senate

3843
02:12:44,319 --> 02:12:48,000
the senate requested research on what

3844
02:12:46,479 --> 02:12:50,799
the impacts of self-driving trucks would

3845
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:54,000
be and the first stage of that was for

3846
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:56,320
the gao to um

3847
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:59,359
do a report sort of looking at the lay

3848
02:12:56,319 --> 02:13:03,118
of the land talking to some experts

3849
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:06,238
and i was working on my 2018 report um

3850
02:13:03,118 --> 02:13:07,118
helped contribute to that gao report

3851
02:13:06,238 --> 02:13:08,799
and

3852
02:13:07,118 --> 02:13:10,319
you know i had the six scenarios right

3853
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:12,320
i'm like okay you know here's here's

3854
02:13:10,319 --> 02:13:15,198
what starsky's doing you know here's

3855
02:13:12,319 --> 02:13:18,399
what embark and and uber are doing you

3856
02:13:15,198 --> 02:13:20,960
know here's what waymo might be doing no

3857
02:13:18,399 --> 02:13:22,479
nobody really knows right um here's what

3858
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:24,239
peloton's doing

3859
02:13:22,479 --> 02:13:26,479
um you know here's the autopilot

3860
02:13:24,238 --> 02:13:27,198
scenario and then here's this one that i

3861
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:29,598
think

3862
02:13:27,198 --> 02:13:32,399
actually could be good for drivers so

3863
02:13:29,599 --> 02:13:34,078
now you've got that driver who's got two

3864
02:13:32,399 --> 02:13:35,598
you know two times the freight

3865
02:13:34,078 --> 02:13:37,359
um their decisions are more important

3866
02:13:35,599 --> 02:13:38,400
they're managing a more complex system

3867
02:13:37,359 --> 02:13:40,319
right they're probably gonna have to

3868
02:13:38,399 --> 02:13:41,439
have some global understanding of how to

3869
02:13:40,319 --> 02:13:42,719
you know the environments in which you

3870
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:46,000
can operate safely right now we're

3871
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:46,960
talking upskilling right

3872
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,760
and so

3873
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:50,078
you know

3874
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,280
that um the gao

3875
02:13:50,078 --> 02:13:53,359
you know sort of writes up these

3876
02:13:51,279 --> 02:13:54,719
different scenarios and and the idea is

3877
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:56,399
that it's going to prepare for this

3878
02:13:54,719 --> 02:13:57,520
department of transportation department

3879
02:13:56,399 --> 02:14:00,638
of labor

3880
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:02,719
set of processes to engage stakeholders

3881
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:04,560
and um

3882
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:06,319
and sort of get you know get industry

3883
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:07,679
perspectives and then do a study on the

3884
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:08,880
labor impacts

3885
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:10,639
so

3886
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:14,159
you know that dot

3887
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:14,960
dol process starts to happen and

3888
02:14:14,158 --> 02:14:16,960
you know

3889
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:18,960
i get to the workshop

3890
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:20,239
and a friend was sitting at the table

3891
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:23,118
next to me

3892
02:14:20,238 --> 02:14:24,559
and he holds up the the scenarios that

3893
02:14:23,118 --> 02:14:26,000
that they're going to have us discuss at

3894
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:28,239
this workshop and he's like hey these

3895
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:30,319
look really familiar right because they

3896
02:14:28,238 --> 02:14:32,799
were the you know scenarios from from

3897
02:14:30,319 --> 02:14:35,039
the report but there were only five

3898
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:37,039
instead of six interesting

3899
02:14:35,039 --> 02:14:38,880
the sixth scenario which was the

3900
02:14:37,039 --> 02:14:40,960
upskilling labor good for good for

3901
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:43,359
worker scenario

3902
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:45,599
wasn't wasn't discussed so to clarify

3903
02:14:43,359 --> 02:14:47,359
that the integral piece of technology

3904
02:14:45,599 --> 02:14:48,960
there is platooning

3905
02:14:47,359 --> 02:14:52,238
yeah i mean in a sense it's it's

3906
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:53,439
platooning but and i and in fairness

3907
02:14:52,238 --> 02:14:55,439
right the

3908
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:57,198
as i pitched that idea or sort of ran

3909
02:14:55,439 --> 02:14:59,198
that idea by

3910
02:14:57,198 --> 02:15:00,638
the computer scientists and engineers

3911
02:14:59,198 --> 02:15:02,559
that i would and product managers that i

3912
02:15:00,639 --> 02:15:03,520
would talk to they would say

3913
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:06,079
you know

3914
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:07,599
you know we thought about that but that

3915
02:15:06,078 --> 02:15:10,559
following truck

3916
02:15:07,599 --> 02:15:13,199
it's not that simple you know that thing

3917
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:14,639
basically we had to engineer that to be

3918
02:15:13,198 --> 02:15:16,319
capable of

3919
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:18,480
independent self-driving because what if

3920
02:15:16,319 --> 02:15:21,599
there was a cut in or you know any

3921
02:15:18,479 --> 02:15:23,919
number of scenarios in which it lost

3922
02:15:21,599 --> 02:15:27,039
that connection to the lead truck for

3923
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:29,599
whatever reason now i mean i don't

3924
02:15:27,039 --> 02:15:31,599
platooning is hard

3925
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:33,920
there's edge cases i guarantee the

3926
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:35,599
number of edge cases and platooning is

3927
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:37,359
orders of magnitude lower than the

3928
02:15:35,599 --> 02:15:39,279
number of edge cases

3929
02:15:37,359 --> 02:15:41,519
in the general

3930
02:15:39,279 --> 02:15:43,679
solo full self drive you do not need to

3931
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:45,760
solve the full self-driving problem

3932
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:49,199
i mean if you're talking about

3933
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:52,000
uh probability of dangerous events yeah

3934
02:15:49,198 --> 02:15:54,638
it just seems with platooning then

3935
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:56,399
like you can deal with cut-ins

3936
02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:57,760
yeah so this is you know this is beyond

3937
02:15:56,399 --> 02:15:59,598
uh this is one of the challenges

3938
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:01,520
obviously of being a researcher who you

3939
02:15:59,599 --> 02:16:04,319
know uh doesn't doesn't really have any

3940
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:06,000
background in in the technology right um

3941
02:16:04,319 --> 02:16:08,158
so i can i can dream this up i don't you

3942
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:10,158
know no idea if it's feasible um well

3943
02:16:08,158 --> 02:16:11,839
let me speak you spoke to the phds in

3944
02:16:10,158 --> 02:16:13,920
economics let me speak to the pgs of

3945
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:15,520
computer science if you think platooning

3946
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:16,399
is as hard as the full self-driving

3947
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,599
problem

3948
02:16:16,399 --> 02:16:19,598
um

3949
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:21,920
well we need to talk because i think

3950
02:16:19,599 --> 02:16:23,599
that's ridiculous i think platooning

3951
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:25,118
and in fact i think platooning is an

3952
02:16:23,599 --> 02:16:27,199
interesting idea for

3953
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:28,719
ride sharing as well for the general

3954
02:16:27,198 --> 02:16:30,479
autonomous driving problem not just

3955
02:16:28,719 --> 02:16:33,359
trucking but obviously trucking is the

3956
02:16:30,479 --> 02:16:35,920
big big benefit because the number of a

3957
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:37,439
to b points in trucking is much much

3958
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:40,079
lower than the general ride sharing

3959
02:16:37,439 --> 02:16:42,639
problem but anyway i think it's a great

3960
02:16:40,079 --> 02:16:44,879
idea but you're saying it was removed

3961
02:16:42,638 --> 02:16:46,638
yeah and and so you you can go you know

3962
02:16:44,879 --> 02:16:48,239
and you know listeners could go to these

3963
02:16:46,638 --> 02:16:50,159
reports they're they're they're publicly

3964
02:16:48,239 --> 02:16:51,439
available and they explain why in the in

3965
02:16:50,159 --> 02:16:53,039
the footnote

3966
02:16:51,439 --> 02:16:55,519
and you know they they note that there

3967
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:57,200
was this other scenario um suggested by

3968
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:58,880
at least me and i remember if they said

3969
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:01,519
someone else did too

3970
02:16:58,879 --> 02:17:03,759
but they said you know we didn't include

3971
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:06,000
it because no developers

3972
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:07,439
were working on it interesting full

3973
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:09,920
disclosure

3974
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:12,079
that was the approach that i took in my

3975
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:14,558
research right which was to go to the

3976
02:17:12,079 --> 02:17:17,679
developers and say what's your vision

3977
02:17:14,558 --> 02:17:19,840
right what are you trying to develop

3978
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:20,879
that's what i was trying to do and maybe

3979
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:22,639
you know and then i tried to think

3980
02:17:20,879 --> 02:17:23,920
outside the box at the end by adding

3981
02:17:22,638 --> 02:17:25,039
that one right like here's one that i

3982
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:26,638
have you know people aren't talking

3983
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:29,359
about that could be cool now again it

3984
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:31,759
had been proposed like 2014 for like

3985
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:34,960
fuel convoys um so you could just have

3986
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:36,800
like one super armored lead fuel

3987
02:17:34,959 --> 02:17:38,159
truck right in a you know bringing fuel

3988
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:40,478
to forward operating bases in

3989
02:17:38,159 --> 02:17:42,000
afghanistan and then you wouldn't need

3990
02:17:40,478 --> 02:17:42,959
you know the the super heavy you know

3991
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,239
you wouldn't have to protect the human

3992
02:17:42,959 --> 02:17:45,678
life in the following trials so that's

3993
02:17:44,239 --> 02:17:47,119
interesting you're saying like when you

3994
02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:50,000
talk to waymo when you talk to these

3995
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:52,160
kinds of companies they weren't at least

3996
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:54,558
openly saying they're working on this so

3997
02:17:52,159 --> 02:17:57,359
then it doesn't make sense to um

3998
02:17:54,558 --> 02:17:58,879
to include in the list yeah and so but

3999
02:17:57,359 --> 02:18:01,040
here's the thing right this is the

4000
02:17:58,879 --> 02:18:02,959
department of transportation right and

4001
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:04,639
the department of labor

4002
02:18:02,959 --> 02:18:07,358
maybe they could consider some scenarios

4003
02:18:04,638 --> 02:18:08,799
like maybe we could say you know this we

4004
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:10,479
this technology's got a lot of potential

4005
02:18:08,799 --> 02:18:12,159
here's what we'd like it to do

4006
02:18:10,478 --> 02:18:13,840
you know we'd like it to reduce highway

4007
02:18:12,159 --> 02:18:15,359
deaths help us fight climate change

4008
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:16,159
reduce congestion you know all these

4009
02:18:15,359 --> 02:18:18,000
other

4010
02:18:16,159 --> 02:18:19,840
other things but that's not how our

4011
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:21,439
policy conversation our own technology

4012
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:24,478
is happening we're not

4013
02:18:21,439 --> 02:18:26,318
and people don't think that we should

4014
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:28,000
and i think that's the fundamental shift

4015
02:18:26,318 --> 02:18:29,119
that we need to have right i've been

4016
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:31,760
involved with this a little bit like

4017
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:33,359
nitsa and d.o.t

4018
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:34,960
the approach they took is saying we

4019
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:37,359
don't know what the heck we're doing so

4020
02:18:34,959 --> 02:18:39,518
we're going to just let the innovators

4021
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:41,200
do their thing and not regulate it for a

4022
02:18:39,519 --> 02:18:43,519
while just to see

4023
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:45,439
you don't you think that's um

4024
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:48,318
you think dot should provide ideas

4025
02:18:45,439 --> 02:18:50,000
themselves well so this is the um

4026
02:18:48,318 --> 02:18:53,599
this is the great trick

4027
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:57,359
in policy of um of private actors

4028
02:18:53,599 --> 02:18:59,599
is you you get narrow mandates for

4029
02:18:57,359 --> 02:19:02,000
government agencies right so you know

4030
02:18:59,599 --> 02:19:05,280
this the safety case will be handled by

4031
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,959
organizations whose mandate is safety so

4032
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:09,280
the federal motor carrier safety

4033
02:19:06,959 --> 02:19:11,119
administration who is you know going to

4034
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:13,359
be a key player

4035
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:14,719
i i argue in an article that i wrote you

4036
02:19:13,359 --> 02:19:16,399
know they're going to be a key player in

4037
02:19:14,718 --> 02:19:18,318
actually determining which

4038
02:19:16,398 --> 02:19:20,239
scenario is most profitable by setting

4039
02:19:18,318 --> 02:19:22,000
the rules for truck drivers their

4040
02:19:20,239 --> 02:19:24,159
mandate is safety

4041
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,760
right now they have lots of good people

4042
02:19:24,159 --> 02:19:27,599
there who want you know who care about

4043
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:29,280
truck drivers and who wish truck drivers

4044
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:32,719
jobs were better

4045
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:33,920
but they don't have the authority to say

4046
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:35,199
hey we're going to write this rule

4047
02:19:33,920 --> 02:19:37,359
because it's good for truck drivers

4048
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:39,359
right and so when you

4049
02:19:37,359 --> 02:19:42,479
you know we need

4050
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:44,719
to say you know as a society we need to

4051
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:46,478
not restrict technology not stand in the

4052
02:19:44,718 --> 02:19:48,478
way of things we need to harness it

4053
02:19:46,478 --> 02:19:51,039
towards the goals that matter

4054
02:19:48,478 --> 02:19:52,879
right not whatever comes out the end of

4055
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:55,040
the pipeline because it's the easiest

4056
02:19:52,879 --> 02:19:57,039
thing to develop or whatever is most

4057
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,960
profitable for the first actor or

4058
02:19:57,040 --> 02:20:01,280
whatever but you know and we do the

4059
02:19:58,959 --> 02:20:04,159
thing is we do that right i mean like

4060
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:06,159
when we when we sent people to the moon

4061
02:20:04,159 --> 02:20:08,239
you know we we did that we you know and

4062
02:20:06,159 --> 02:20:09,840
there were tremendous benefits that that

4063
02:20:08,239 --> 02:20:11,840
followed from it right and and we do

4064
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:13,600
this all the time in you know trying to

4065
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:15,280
cure cancer or whatever it is right i

4066
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:16,479
mean we can

4067
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:19,120
do this

4068
02:20:16,478 --> 02:20:21,840
right now the interesting sort of

4069
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:24,319
uh epilogue to that story is

4070
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:26,239
you know uh six months or so i don't

4071
02:20:24,318 --> 02:20:28,159
know how long it was after those those

4072
02:20:26,239 --> 02:20:31,119
meetings in which that sixth scenario

4073
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:33,680
was not considered um

4074
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:35,359
a company called location

4075
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:36,559
you know ends up

4076
02:20:35,359 --> 02:20:38,960
using that

4077
02:20:36,559 --> 02:20:40,799
essentially that basic scenario with it

4078
02:20:38,959 --> 02:20:43,759
with a slight variation so they they

4079
02:20:40,799 --> 02:20:45,599
leave the human driver in both trucks

4080
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:48,239
and then that following driver goes off

4081
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:49,920
duty and then um

4082
02:20:48,239 --> 02:20:51,439
uh you know i i've been trying to think

4083
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:52,879
of what the term is they kind of i i

4084
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:54,479
think of it as like slingshotting they

4085
02:20:52,879 --> 02:20:55,839
sort of when one runs out of hours you

4086
02:20:54,478 --> 02:20:58,799
know the one who's off duty goes up

4087
02:20:55,840 --> 02:21:00,880
front and you know um cool and so

4088
02:20:58,799 --> 02:21:02,159
you know if only they had been

4089
02:21:00,879 --> 02:21:04,639
uh you know

4090
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:06,398
around six six months earlier that would

4091
02:21:04,639 --> 02:21:07,840
it might have been considered by d.o.t

4092
02:21:06,398 --> 02:21:09,840
but it just says you know who has the

4093
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:11,600
authority to propose what these visions

4094
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:13,840
of the future are well some of it is

4095
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:15,120
also just the company stepping up and

4096
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:17,280
just doing it

4097
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:18,800
screw the authority and showing that

4098
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:22,880
it's possible and then the authority

4099
02:21:18,799 --> 02:21:25,358
follows so that's why i really

4100
02:21:22,879 --> 02:21:28,639
love innovators in the space the the

4101
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:30,960
criticism i have the very sort of

4102
02:21:28,639 --> 02:21:33,039
real i don't know harsh criticism i have

4103
02:21:30,959 --> 02:21:34,398
towards autonomous vehicle companies in

4104
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:35,280
the space

4105
02:21:34,398 --> 02:21:38,159
is

4106
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:40,640
they've gotten culturally

4107
02:21:38,159 --> 02:21:42,719
they've it's been it's become acceptable

4108
02:21:40,639 --> 02:21:46,159
somehow

4109
02:21:42,719 --> 02:21:48,398
to do demos and videos

4110
02:21:46,159 --> 02:21:50,478
as opposed to the old-school american

4111
02:21:48,398 --> 02:21:52,318
way of solving problems

4112
02:21:50,478 --> 02:21:56,159
there's there's a culture in silicon

4113
02:21:52,318 --> 02:21:58,879
valley where you're talking to vcs

4114
02:21:56,159 --> 02:22:00,879
that have lost that kind of

4115
02:21:58,879 --> 02:22:02,879
love of um

4116
02:22:00,879 --> 02:22:05,358
solving problem they kind of like

4117
02:22:02,879 --> 02:22:08,000
envision if the story you told me in

4118
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:09,920
your powerpoint presentation it's true

4119
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,840
how many trillions of dollars might i be

4120
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:14,159
able to make there's something lost in

4121
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:16,159
that conversation where you're not

4122
02:22:14,159 --> 02:22:18,318
really taking on like

4123
02:22:16,159 --> 02:22:20,159
the problem in a real way so these

4124
02:22:18,318 --> 02:22:22,478
autonomous vehicle companies realize we

4125
02:22:20,159 --> 02:22:24,559
don't need to we just need to make nice

4126
02:22:22,478 --> 02:22:27,199
powerpoint presentations and not

4127
02:22:24,559 --> 02:22:29,680
actually deliver products that like

4128
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:31,840
everybody looks outside and says holy

4129
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:33,439
this is this is life-changing

4130
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:36,880
that's where i have to give props to

4131
02:22:33,439 --> 02:22:37,920
waymo is they put driverless cars on the

4132
02:22:36,879 --> 02:22:39,119
road

4133
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:41,439
and like

4134
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:42,880
forget powerpoint slide presentations

4135
02:22:41,439 --> 02:22:44,800
actual cars in the world then you can

4136
02:22:42,879 --> 02:22:46,959
criticize like is that actually going to

4137
02:22:44,799 --> 02:22:48,639
work who knows but the thing is they

4138
02:22:46,959 --> 02:22:50,318
have cars on the road that's why i have

4139
02:22:48,639 --> 02:22:51,760
to give props to tesla they have

4140
02:22:50,318 --> 02:22:54,079
whatever you want to say

4141
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:55,920
about risk and all those kinds of things

4142
02:22:54,079 --> 02:22:58,000
they have cars on the road that have

4143
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:58,799
some level of automation and soon they

4144
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:01,280
have

4145
02:22:58,799 --> 02:23:02,840
trucks on the road as well and that kind

4146
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:05,280
of that

4147
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:07,280
component i think is important part of

4148
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:09,520
the policy conversation because you get

4149
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:10,960
you start getting data of these from

4150
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:13,520
these companies that are willing to take

4151
02:23:10,959 --> 02:23:15,759
the big risks as opposed to making slide

4152
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:18,720
decks they're actually putting cars on

4153
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:20,478
the road and like real lives are at

4154
02:23:18,719 --> 02:23:22,559
stake they could be lost and they could

4155
02:23:20,478 --> 02:23:24,799
bankrupt the company if they make the

4156
02:23:22,559 --> 02:23:27,119
wrong decisions and that that's deeply

4157
02:23:24,799 --> 02:23:29,279
admirable to me speaking of which i have

4158
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:30,840
to ask way more trucks i think it's

4159
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:33,680
called waymo

4160
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:34,960
via so i'm talking to the head of

4161
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:37,280
trucking at waymo i don't know if you've

4162
02:23:34,959 --> 02:23:39,358
gotten a chance to interact with them

4163
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:41,200
what's a good question to ask the guy

4164
02:23:39,359 --> 02:23:42,880
what's the good question of waymo

4165
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:45,120
because they seem to be

4166
02:23:42,879 --> 02:23:48,559
one of the leaders in the space they

4167
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:50,000
have the zen-like calm of like being

4168
02:23:48,559 --> 02:23:51,840
willing to stick

4169
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,280
with it for the long term in order to

4170
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:54,719
solve the problem

4171
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:56,720
yeah they and i guess they have that

4172
02:23:54,719 --> 02:23:59,279
luxury right um

4173
02:23:56,719 --> 02:24:01,920
which i don't think i

4174
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:04,319
if i had another life as a researcher i

4175
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:07,200
would love to just study the business

4176
02:24:04,318 --> 02:24:08,159
strategies of startups and and silicon

4177
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:10,720
valley

4178
02:24:08,159 --> 02:24:14,799
um sort of structure would you consider

4179
02:24:10,719 --> 02:24:16,959
waymo startup no no no right i mean it's

4180
02:24:14,799 --> 02:24:19,519
at least not in the things that seem to

4181
02:24:16,959 --> 02:24:22,079
matter in the self-driving space so you

4182
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:23,600
mentioned the demos um you know and i

4183
02:24:22,079 --> 02:24:25,120
don't i don't have enough data as a

4184
02:24:23,600 --> 02:24:27,520
sociologist to really say like oh this

4185
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:30,240
is why they do what they do um but you

4186
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:33,120
know my hypothesis is you know there's a

4187
02:24:30,239 --> 02:24:34,959
real scarcity of talent and money um for

4188
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:38,479
this and there certainly was a scarcity

4189
02:24:34,959 --> 02:24:40,079
of like partnerships with oems and you

4190
02:24:38,478 --> 02:24:42,398
know the big trucking companies and

4191
02:24:40,079 --> 02:24:44,639
there was a race for it right and the

4192
02:24:42,398 --> 02:24:47,920
way that if you don't have

4193
02:24:44,639 --> 02:24:50,478
you know the backing of alphabet um

4194
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:52,159
you you do a demo right and and you get

4195
02:24:50,478 --> 02:24:54,398
a few more good engineers who say hey

4196
02:24:52,159 --> 02:24:56,959
look they did that cool thing yeah like

4197
02:24:54,398 --> 02:24:58,799
anthony lewandowski did with otto and

4198
02:24:56,959 --> 02:25:00,398
that would resulted in the uber purchase

4199
02:24:58,799 --> 02:25:01,679
of that that program

4200
02:25:00,398 --> 02:25:03,439
um

4201
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:05,200
so what would i what would i ask i mean

4202
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:07,120
i think

4203
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:09,040
i would ask a lot of questions but well

4204
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:11,359
there's also on record and off record

4205
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:14,319
conversations which unfortunately

4206
02:25:11,359 --> 02:25:16,720
i'm asking for an on-racket conversation

4207
02:25:14,318 --> 02:25:19,119
and that i don't know

4208
02:25:16,719 --> 02:25:21,760
if if um these companies are willing to

4209
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:22,640
have interesting unreacted conversations

4210
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:24,398
yeah

4211
02:25:22,639 --> 02:25:25,760
i mean i assume that i like there are

4212
02:25:24,398 --> 02:25:27,599
questions that i don't think you'd have

4213
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:28,800
to ask like i assume they're gonna be

4214
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:30,399
actually driverless right they're not

4215
02:25:28,799 --> 02:25:31,199
gonna like keep the driver in there yeah

4216
02:25:30,398 --> 02:25:33,920
um

4217
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:36,560
so i mean for the industry i think it

4218
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:38,000
would be interesting to know

4219
02:25:36,559 --> 02:25:40,559
where they where they see that first

4220
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,719
adopter right oh you mean from like the

4221
02:25:40,559 --> 02:25:44,879
scenarios that laid out which one are

4222
02:25:42,719 --> 02:25:46,478
they going to take on yeah i mean

4223
02:25:44,879 --> 02:25:48,639
because that's gonna again it's those

4224
02:25:46,478 --> 02:25:51,438
really expensive good jobs right so

4225
02:25:48,639 --> 02:25:53,439
those ltl jobs the like ups jobs now

4226
02:25:51,439 --> 02:25:54,960
that's going to be that's where labor is

4227
02:25:53,439 --> 02:25:56,559
too right that's where the teamsters are

4228
02:25:54,959 --> 02:25:58,398
that's the only place they are left

4229
02:25:56,559 --> 02:25:59,519
right um so that's that's going to be

4230
02:25:58,398 --> 02:26:01,920
the big

4231
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:04,800
fight on the hill and public if if labor

4232
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:06,478
can muster it right i don't know um

4233
02:26:04,799 --> 02:26:07,679
there's a really cool

4234
02:26:06,478 --> 02:26:09,279
like um

4235
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:10,960
one thing i would recommend to to you

4236
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:13,439
and your listeners if you really want to

4237
02:26:10,959 --> 02:26:14,719
see some like a remarkable page in sort

4238
02:26:13,439 --> 02:26:16,880
of the history of

4239
02:26:14,719 --> 02:26:20,639
labor and automation there's a

4240
02:26:16,879 --> 02:26:22,799
a report that harry bridges who was um

4241
02:26:20,639 --> 02:26:24,719
the socialist leader of the the

4242
02:26:22,799 --> 02:26:26,719
longshoremen on the west coast and just

4243
02:26:24,719 --> 02:26:28,318
you know galvanized that union and they

4244
02:26:26,719 --> 02:26:29,279
they still control the ports today

4245
02:26:28,318 --> 02:26:31,760
because of

4246
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:33,680
this vision that he laid down

4247
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:36,079
in the 1960s

4248
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:37,760
he put out a photojournal report called

4249
02:26:36,079 --> 02:26:39,760
men and machines

4250
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:42,000
and basically what it was was it was an

4251
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:44,318
internal education campaign

4252
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:46,559
to convince the membership that they had

4253
02:26:44,318 --> 02:26:48,398
to go along with automation

4254
02:26:46,559 --> 02:26:50,239
machines were coming for their jobs and

4255
02:26:48,398 --> 02:26:52,559
what the photo journal it's almost like

4256
02:26:50,239 --> 02:26:54,478
100 pages or something like that is like

4257
02:26:52,559 --> 02:26:56,719
here's how we used to do it some of you

4258
02:26:54,478 --> 02:26:58,959
old-timers remember it like we used to

4259
02:26:56,719 --> 02:27:00,639
take the barrels olive oil and we'd

4260
02:26:58,959 --> 02:27:02,559
stack them in the hold and we'd roll

4261
02:27:00,639 --> 02:27:04,719
them by hand and we'd put the timber in

4262
02:27:02,559 --> 02:27:06,719
and we you know stack the crates tight

4263
02:27:04,719 --> 02:27:09,840
you know and and that was the pride of

4264
02:27:06,719 --> 02:27:12,079
the longshoremen was a was a tight stow

4265
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:13,600
and now you all know you know their

4266
02:27:12,079 --> 02:27:15,600
cranes that come down and there's no

4267
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:17,600
longer any you know rope slings and

4268
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:19,840
we're loading bulldozers into the hole

4269
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:21,760
to push the ore up into piles and then

4270
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:22,398
clamshells are coming down and

4271
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:25,040
and

4272
02:27:22,398 --> 02:27:27,760
he made this case to them and he said

4273
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:29,680
this is why we're signing this agreement

4274
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:32,000
to basically allow

4275
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:33,040
the employer to

4276
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,439
automate

4277
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:37,520
and we're going to lose jobs but we're

4278
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:39,200
going to get a share of the benefits

4279
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:40,560
and so our wages are going to go up

4280
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:42,560
we're going to continue to control the

4281
02:27:40,559 --> 02:27:44,318
hiring and training of workers

4282
02:27:42,559 --> 02:27:46,398
our numbers are gonna go down but you

4283
02:27:44,318 --> 02:27:48,318
know basically that last son of a

4284
02:27:46,398 --> 02:27:49,199
who's working at the ports he's gonna be

4285
02:27:48,318 --> 02:27:51,519
one

4286
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:52,399
one really well paid son of a you

4287
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:54,479
know

4288
02:27:52,398 --> 02:27:55,840
it may just be one standing but he's

4289
02:27:54,478 --> 02:27:57,760
gonna love his job

4290
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:59,600
um you should check out that report

4291
02:27:57,760 --> 02:28:01,840
that's an interesting vision of a future

4292
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:04,159
that probably still holds

4293
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:07,040
that is i mean there is some level to

4294
02:28:04,159 --> 02:28:08,719
which you have to embrace the automation

4295
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:10,479
yeah i mean who gets you know the

4296
02:28:08,719 --> 02:28:12,079
benefits right it's like

4297
02:28:10,478 --> 02:28:13,519
i mean think of the public dollars that

4298
02:28:12,079 --> 02:28:14,959
went into developing self-driving

4299
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:16,640
vehicles in the early days right not

4300
02:28:14,959 --> 02:28:18,959
just the vision of it right which was a

4301
02:28:16,639 --> 02:28:20,879
public vision to to you know take

4302
02:28:18,959 --> 02:28:22,719
soldiers out of harm's way

4303
02:28:20,879 --> 02:28:25,119
um but

4304
02:28:22,719 --> 02:28:27,519
you know uh a lot of money and there's

4305
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:29,600
some way if you are a business that's

4306
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:31,439
leveraging that technology

4307
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:34,079
from a broad

4308
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:35,040
historical ethical perspective you do

4309
02:28:34,079 --> 02:28:36,000
owe it

4310
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:38,960
to

4311
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:41,200
the bigger community

4312
02:28:38,959 --> 02:28:42,239
to pay back

4313
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:43,200
like

4314
02:28:42,239 --> 02:28:45,439
for

4315
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:47,520
all the investment that was paid to to

4316
02:28:45,439 --> 02:28:49,359
make that technology a reality in some

4317
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:51,040
sense i don't i don't know how to make

4318
02:28:49,359 --> 02:28:52,159
that right right

4319
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:54,399
on one

4320
02:28:52,159 --> 02:28:58,719
there's this pure capitalism and then

4321
02:28:54,398 --> 02:29:00,239
there's uh communism and i'm not sure

4322
02:28:58,719 --> 02:29:03,039
uh

4323
02:29:00,239 --> 02:29:05,039
i'm not sure how how to get that

4324
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:06,399
balance right you know i don't i don't

4325
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:08,399
have all the answers in here you know

4326
02:29:06,398 --> 02:29:11,039
and i don't i wouldn't expect you know

4327
02:29:08,398 --> 02:29:12,478
um individual private companies to to

4328
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:13,920
kind of kick back right that's

4329
02:29:12,478 --> 02:29:15,920
capitalism doesn't allow that right

4330
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:17,920
unless you have a huge monopoly right um

4331
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:19,520
and then you can on the back side create

4332
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:21,200
music halls and libraries and things

4333
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:23,280
like that

4334
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:24,319
but you know here's what i think you

4335
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:26,399
know the the

4336
02:29:24,318 --> 02:29:28,799
the basic obligation is

4337
02:29:26,398 --> 02:29:31,840
is you know come to the table

4338
02:29:28,799 --> 02:29:34,559
like and and have an honest conversation

4339
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:36,719
with the policy makers with the truck

4340
02:29:34,559 --> 02:29:39,359
drivers you know with the communities

4341
02:29:36,719 --> 02:29:41,840
that are are at risk like at least let's

4342
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:43,680
talk about these things you know

4343
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:46,318
in a way that doesn't look like the way

4344
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:49,520
lobbying works right now where where you

4345
02:29:46,318 --> 02:29:51,359
send a well-paid lobbyist to the hill to

4346
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:53,200
you know convince some

4347
02:29:51,359 --> 02:29:55,280
representative or senator to stick a

4348
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:57,920
sentence or two in that favors you into

4349
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:59,920
like let's have a real conversation real

4350
02:29:57,920 --> 02:30:01,359
human can we just do that yeah don't

4351
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:03,600
play games

4352
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:07,040
real real human conversation let me ask

4353
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:08,239
you um mention autopilot gotta ask you

4354
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:10,560
about tesla

4355
02:30:08,239 --> 02:30:12,159
this renegade little company that seems

4356
02:30:10,559 --> 02:30:13,840
to be from my perspective

4357
02:30:12,159 --> 02:30:15,520
revolutionizing autonomous driving or

4358
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:17,040
semi-autonomous driving or at least the

4359
02:30:15,520 --> 02:30:19,760
problem of

4360
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:22,080
perception and control

4361
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:24,478
they've got a semi on the way

4362
02:30:22,079 --> 02:30:26,799
they got a truck on the way what are

4363
02:30:24,478 --> 02:30:29,039
your thoughts about tesla semi you know

4364
02:30:26,799 --> 02:30:31,358
i um and i did have

4365
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:32,479
some very preliminary conversations with

4366
02:30:31,359 --> 02:30:34,880
um

4367
02:30:32,478 --> 02:30:37,199
with uh you know policy folks there um

4368
02:30:34,879 --> 02:30:40,000
you know nothing really in in the tech

4369
02:30:37,200 --> 02:30:42,399
or business side of it too much um and

4370
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:44,079
here's why i think because

4371
02:30:42,398 --> 02:30:46,879
electrification and autonomy run in

4372
02:30:44,079 --> 02:30:49,840
opposite directions right um and i just

4373
02:30:46,879 --> 02:30:52,398
you know um i don't see the application

4374
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:53,760
the value in self-driving for the truck

4375
02:30:52,398 --> 02:30:55,358
that tesla's going to produce in the

4376
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:56,639
near term

4377
02:30:55,359 --> 02:30:58,239
you know they're just you're not going

4378
02:30:56,639 --> 02:31:00,398
to have the battery

4379
02:30:58,239 --> 02:31:02,639
um now you could have wonderful safety

4380
02:31:00,398 --> 02:31:03,840
systems and you know reinforcing you

4381
02:31:02,639 --> 02:31:06,079
know the auto

4382
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:08,719
you know self-driving features

4383
02:31:06,079 --> 02:31:10,000
supporting a skilled driver um

4384
02:31:08,719 --> 02:31:12,159
but you're not going to be able to pull

4385
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:14,239
that driver out for long stretches the

4386
02:31:12,159 --> 02:31:15,600
way that you are with driverless trucks

4387
02:31:14,239 --> 02:31:17,439
so

4388
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:19,680
do you think

4389
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:22,239
i mean the reason so yeah the

4390
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:23,760
electrification

4391
02:31:22,239 --> 02:31:25,680
is not obviously coupled with the

4392
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:27,680
automation

4393
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:30,880
[Music]

4394
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:32,479
they have a very interesting approach to

4395
02:31:30,879 --> 02:31:34,879
semi-autonomous

4396
02:31:32,478 --> 02:31:37,760
pushing towards autonomous driving

4397
02:31:34,879 --> 02:31:39,199
right it's very unique

4398
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:41,040
no lidar

4399
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:43,200
now no radar

4400
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:45,040
it's computer vision alone

4401
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:47,120
from a large they're collecting huge

4402
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:49,520
amounts of data from a large fleet it's

4403
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:51,760
an interesting unique approach

4404
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:53,359
bold and fearless in this direction if i

4405
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:55,439
were to guess

4406
02:31:53,359 --> 02:31:56,399
whether this approach would work i would

4407
02:31:55,439 --> 02:31:57,200
say

4408
02:31:56,398 --> 02:31:59,439
no

4409
02:31:57,200 --> 02:32:01,600
it started

4410
02:31:59,439 --> 02:32:02,639
one you would need way a lot of data and

4411
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:04,559
two

4412
02:32:02,639 --> 02:32:06,079
because you have actual cars deployed on

4413
02:32:04,559 --> 02:32:08,000
the road using

4414
02:32:06,079 --> 02:32:09,280
a beta version of this product you're

4415
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,879
going to

4416
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:12,800
have a system that's

4417
02:32:10,879 --> 02:32:15,438
far less safe you're going to run into

4418
02:32:12,799 --> 02:32:18,000
trouble it's horrible pr like it just

4419
02:32:15,439 --> 02:32:19,920
seems like a nightmare uh but it seems

4420
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:22,000
to not be the case at least up to this

4421
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:26,398
point it seems to be

4422
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:28,079
uh not you know on par if not safer and

4423
02:32:26,398 --> 02:32:30,079
it seems to work really well and human

4424
02:32:28,079 --> 02:32:31,840
the human factor somehow

4425
02:32:30,079 --> 02:32:33,840
um manages

4426
02:32:31,840 --> 02:32:36,639
like drivers still pay attention now

4427
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:38,478
there's a selection of who is inside the

4428
02:32:36,639 --> 02:32:40,159
tesla autopilot

4429
02:32:38,478 --> 02:32:42,239
user base right there could be a

4430
02:32:40,159 --> 02:32:43,680
self-selection mechanism there but

4431
02:32:42,239 --> 02:32:45,119
however it works

4432
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:47,200
these things are not running off the

4433
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:49,520
road all the time

4434
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:51,280
so it's very interesting whether that

4435
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:52,880
can sort of creep into the trucking

4436
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:53,680
space

4437
02:32:52,879 --> 02:32:56,559
yes

4438
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:59,439
at first the long-haul problem

4439
02:32:56,559 --> 02:33:01,519
is not solved they need to charge but

4440
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:03,520
maybe you can solve you know a lot of

4441
02:33:01,520 --> 02:33:05,280
your scenarios involved

4442
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:06,800
small

4443
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:09,439
distances

4444
02:33:06,799 --> 02:33:11,438
and you know that last mile

4445
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:13,439
aspect which is exactly what tesla is

4446
02:33:11,439 --> 02:33:15,040
trying to solve for the

4447
02:33:13,439 --> 02:33:17,840
hum uh for the

4448
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:20,880
for the regular uh passenger vehicle uh

4449
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:22,559
space is the city driving it's possible

4450
02:33:20,879 --> 02:33:24,959
that you have these trucks

4451
02:33:22,559 --> 02:33:27,600
it's it's almost like

4452
02:33:24,959 --> 02:33:29,358
yeah you you solve the uh the last mile

4453
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:31,200
delivery part of some of the scenarios

4454
02:33:29,359 --> 02:33:34,159
that you mentioned

4455
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:35,520
in autonomous driving space is that do

4456
02:33:34,159 --> 02:33:37,439
you think that's from the people you've

4457
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:40,640
spoken with too difficult of a problem

4458
02:33:37,439 --> 02:33:42,398
the the thing that you know keeps me

4459
02:33:40,639 --> 02:33:44,239
so interested in this space and thinking

4460
02:33:42,398 --> 02:33:45,599
that it's so important you know is is

4461
02:33:44,239 --> 02:33:47,359
again that

4462
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:50,159
that efficiency question that safety

4463
02:33:47,359 --> 02:33:52,800
question and the and the way that these

4464
02:33:50,159 --> 02:33:55,280
economics can push us potentially you

4465
02:33:52,799 --> 02:33:57,438
know toward a more efficient system so i

4466
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:59,280
want to see those tesla electric trucks

4467
02:33:57,439 --> 02:34:01,359
running out to those truck ports where

4468
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:03,840
you're where you've got those two you

4469
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:06,318
know um two trucks with a human driver

4470
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:08,639
in front yeah right um you know i think

4471
02:34:06,318 --> 02:34:10,478
that's now what's powering those is that

4472
02:34:08,639 --> 02:34:11,119
hydrogen you know i mean i don't you

4473
02:34:10,478 --> 02:34:12,318
know

4474
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:13,520
again it's very interesting as a

4475
02:34:12,318 --> 02:34:15,039
researcher who does not have a

4476
02:34:13,520 --> 02:34:17,920
background in technology it doesn't have

4477
02:34:15,040 --> 02:34:20,560
a have a horse you know in this in this

4478
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:22,239
race i mean you know for all i know

4479
02:34:20,559 --> 02:34:25,039
self-driving trucks will ultimately be

4480
02:34:22,239 --> 02:34:27,119
achieved by some biomechanical sensor

4481
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:29,040
that uses echolocation because we took

4482
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:31,359
stem cells of bats right you know i mean

4483
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:33,520
i know you know i i don't i am

4484
02:34:31,359 --> 02:34:35,520
completely um

4485
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:37,280
unable to assess who's you know who's

4486
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:39,760
that or who's behind her who makes sense

4487
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:42,479
but but i think one key component there

4488
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:45,040
and this is what i see with tesla often

4489
02:34:42,478 --> 02:34:46,879
and it's it's quite sad to me that other

4490
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:49,359
companies don't do this enough

4491
02:34:46,879 --> 02:34:51,679
is is that first principles thinking

4492
02:34:49,359 --> 02:34:53,520
like wait wait okay it's looking at the

4493
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:56,880
inefficiencies as opposed to

4494
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:59,280
i worked with quite a few car companies

4495
02:34:56,879 --> 02:35:01,759
and they basically have a lot of

4496
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:03,840
meetings there's a lot of meetings

4497
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:05,200
and uh the discussion is like how can we

4498
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:06,318
make this cheaper this cheaper this

4499
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:07,280
cheaper this component cheaper this

4500
02:35:06,318 --> 02:35:08,719
cheaper

4501
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:10,079
the cheapification of everything just

4502
02:35:08,719 --> 02:35:11,679
like you said

4503
02:35:10,079 --> 02:35:13,120
as opposed to saying wait a minute let's

4504
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:14,960
step back

4505
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:17,120
let's look at the entirety of the

4506
02:35:14,959 --> 02:35:18,879
inefficiencies in the system

4507
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:20,800
like why have we been doing this like

4508
02:35:18,879 --> 02:35:24,239
this for the last few decades

4509
02:35:20,799 --> 02:35:26,398
like start from scratch can this be 10x

4510
02:35:24,239 --> 02:35:27,439
100x cheaper like if we

4511
02:35:26,398 --> 02:35:31,039
not just

4512
02:35:27,439 --> 02:35:32,398
decrease the the cost of one component

4513
02:35:31,040 --> 02:35:35,120
here or this component here or this

4514
02:35:32,398 --> 02:35:39,680
component here but like

4515
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:42,800
let's like redesign everything let's uh

4516
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:45,520
infrastructure let's have special lanes

4517
02:35:42,799 --> 02:35:47,438
or in terms of truck ports as opposed to

4518
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:49,680
having regular human control truck ports

4519
02:35:47,439 --> 02:35:53,200
have some kind of weird

4520
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:54,559
like like sensors like where everything

4521
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:55,359
about the truck

4522
02:35:54,559 --> 02:35:57,359
uh

4523
02:35:55,359 --> 02:35:59,760
connecting at that final destination is

4524
02:35:57,359 --> 02:36:01,439
automated fully from the ground up you

4525
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:04,159
build the facility from the ground up

4526
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:05,840
for the autonomous truck um all all

4527
02:36:04,159 --> 02:36:08,879
those kinds of sort of questions or

4528
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:11,359
platooning let's say wait a minute okay

4529
02:36:08,879 --> 02:36:13,920
i know we think platooning is hard but

4530
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:16,159
can we think through exactly why it's

4531
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:18,239
hard and can we actually solve it like

4532
02:36:16,159 --> 02:36:20,318
if we collect a huge amount of data can

4533
02:36:18,239 --> 02:36:22,239
we solve it

4534
02:36:20,318 --> 02:36:23,840
and then tell teleoperation

4535
02:36:22,239 --> 02:36:26,879
like okay yeah yeah it's difficult to

4536
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:29,280
have good signal but can we actually can

4537
02:36:26,879 --> 02:36:31,438
we have can we consider the the the

4538
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:32,800
probability of those edge cases and what

4539
02:36:31,439 --> 02:36:35,040
to do in the edge cases when the tail

4540
02:36:32,799 --> 02:36:36,719
operation fails like how difficult is

4541
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:39,200
this what are the costs how do we

4542
02:36:36,719 --> 02:36:41,039
actually construct a uh teleoperation

4543
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:43,520
center full of humans that are able to

4544
02:36:41,040 --> 02:36:45,200
pay attention to a large fleet where the

4545
02:36:43,520 --> 02:36:48,640
average number of vehicles per human is

4546
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:50,479
like 10 or 100. you know like

4547
02:36:48,639 --> 02:36:51,439
having that conversation as opposed to

4548
02:36:50,478 --> 02:36:53,199
kind of

4549
02:36:51,439 --> 02:36:55,680
having you know you show up to work and

4550
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:57,920
say all right

4551
02:36:55,680 --> 02:37:00,159
it seems like uh you know because of

4552
02:36:57,920 --> 02:37:02,799
kovid we you know are not making as much

4553
02:37:00,159 --> 02:37:06,559
money can we have a cheaper can we give

4554
02:37:02,799 --> 02:37:09,840
less salary to the trucker and can we uh

4555
02:37:06,559 --> 02:37:11,680
uh build like uh um

4556
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:13,280
decrease the cost or

4557
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:14,559
decrease the frequency at which we buy

4558
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:16,640
new trucks

4559
02:37:14,559 --> 02:37:18,639
and when we do buy new trucks make them

4560
02:37:16,639 --> 02:37:20,959
cheaper by making them crappier like

4561
02:37:18,639 --> 02:37:23,119
this kind of discussion this is why to

4562
02:37:20,959 --> 02:37:25,519
me it's like tesla is like rare on this

4563
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:27,760
and so there's some sectors in which

4564
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:29,359
innovation is part of the culture in the

4565
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:30,639
automotive sector for some reason it's

4566
02:37:29,359 --> 02:37:32,720
not as much

4567
02:37:30,639 --> 02:37:34,559
um this is obviously the problem that

4568
02:37:32,719 --> 02:37:37,199
ford and gm are struggling with it's

4569
02:37:34,559 --> 02:37:39,279
like they're really good at making cars

4570
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:41,920
at scale cheap

4571
02:37:39,280 --> 02:37:43,439
and they're like legit good like toyota

4572
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:45,040
at this they're some of the greatest

4573
02:37:43,439 --> 02:37:46,960
manufacturing people in the world right

4574
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:48,720
that's incredible but then

4575
02:37:46,959 --> 02:37:51,599
when it comes to hiring software people

4576
02:37:48,719 --> 02:37:51,599
they're horrible so

4577
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:56,079
it's it's culture and then it's such a

4578
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:58,879
difficult thing for them to sort of

4579
02:37:56,079 --> 02:38:01,280
embrace but greatness requires that they

4580
02:37:58,879 --> 02:38:03,438
embrace this

4581
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:05,040
embrace whatever is required to remove

4582
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:07,120
the inefficiency from the system and

4583
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:09,280
that may require you to do things very

4584
02:38:07,120 --> 02:38:11,600
differently that you've done in the past

4585
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:13,520
yeah i mean there are certain

4586
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:15,040
things that the market can do well in my

4587
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:17,600
you know this is how i see the world

4588
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:20,160
right um is you know and there

4589
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:21,760
that's the best way to to to organize

4590
02:38:20,159 --> 02:38:24,239
certain kinds of activities is the

4591
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:27,520
market and and private interest

4592
02:38:24,239 --> 02:38:28,799
but i i think we go too far in in some

4593
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:31,760
areas

4594
02:38:28,799 --> 02:38:34,959
transportation is if we can't

4595
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:37,920
have a public debate about

4596
02:38:34,959 --> 02:38:38,799
the roads that we all pay for

4597
02:38:37,920 --> 02:38:40,719
um

4598
02:38:38,799 --> 02:38:41,759
you forget about it private factories

4599
02:38:40,719 --> 02:38:43,199
and know all these other you know

4600
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:45,680
healthcare and other places it's going

4601
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:48,240
to be way harder um there healthcare i

4602
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:50,318
guess has some you know some some uh

4603
02:38:48,239 --> 02:38:52,000
some direct contact with the consumer

4604
02:38:50,318 --> 02:38:54,959
where we're probably gonna have lots of

4605
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:56,559
um sort of hands-on public policy about

4606
02:38:54,959 --> 02:38:58,639
you know concerns around patient rights

4607
02:38:56,559 --> 02:39:00,959
and things like that but

4608
02:38:58,639 --> 02:39:03,439
if we can't figure out how to have a

4609
02:39:00,959 --> 02:39:06,079
public policy conversation around how

4610
02:39:03,439 --> 02:39:08,079
technology is going to reform our public

4611
02:39:06,079 --> 02:39:11,280
you know roadways and our transportation

4612
02:39:08,079 --> 02:39:13,280
system like we're you know we're really

4613
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:16,399
leaving way too much to private

4614
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:17,600
companies it's just it's not it's not in

4615
02:39:16,398 --> 02:39:18,719
there

4616
02:39:17,600 --> 02:39:19,920
i get asked this question like what

4617
02:39:18,719 --> 02:39:21,358
should companies do and i'm like you

4618
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:23,280
know just go about doing what you're

4619
02:39:21,359 --> 02:39:25,600
doing you know i mean please come to the

4620
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:27,920
table and talk about it but it's not

4621
02:39:25,600 --> 02:39:31,120
their role i mean i appreciate you know

4622
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:34,398
uh elon's you know attempts to sort of

4623
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:36,000
you know have species level goals you

4624
02:39:34,398 --> 02:39:38,318
know like oh you know we're gonna go to

4625
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:41,359
mars i mean that's amazing and that's

4626
02:39:38,318 --> 02:39:42,959
incredible that that someone can realize

4627
02:39:41,359 --> 02:39:44,559
you know that you know

4628
02:39:42,959 --> 02:39:46,879
have a chance at realizing that vision

4629
02:39:44,559 --> 02:39:48,639
it's amazing right but

4630
02:39:46,879 --> 02:39:50,799
when it comes to so many areas of our

4631
02:39:48,639 --> 02:39:53,920
economy you know we can't wait for a

4632
02:39:50,799 --> 02:39:56,159
hero um you know we we have to have and

4633
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:57,840
they're way too many interests involved

4634
02:39:56,159 --> 02:40:00,000
you know it's who builds the roads who

4635
02:39:57,840 --> 02:40:02,639
you know i mean the the money that

4636
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:04,879
sloshes around on capitol hill to decide

4637
02:40:02,639 --> 02:40:06,959
what happens in in these infrastructure

4638
02:40:04,879 --> 02:40:08,639
bills and the transportation bill is

4639
02:40:06,959 --> 02:40:10,719
just obscene

4640
02:40:08,639 --> 02:40:12,879
right see i think so it's an interesting

4641
02:40:10,719 --> 02:40:14,879
view of markets

4642
02:40:12,879 --> 02:40:16,879
correct me if i'm wrong let me let me

4643
02:40:14,879 --> 02:40:21,039
propose a theory to you

4644
02:40:16,879 --> 02:40:23,039
that progress in the world is made by

4645
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:24,960
heroes and the markets removed the

4646
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:26,160
inefficiencies from the work the heroes

4647
02:40:24,959 --> 02:40:28,879
did

4648
02:40:26,159 --> 02:40:30,398
so going to mars from the perspective of

4649
02:40:28,879 --> 02:40:32,159
marcus

4650
02:40:30,398 --> 02:40:34,000
probably has no value

4651
02:40:32,159 --> 02:40:35,760
maybe you can argue it's good for hiring

4652
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:38,398
to have a vision or something like that

4653
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:42,159
but like those big projects don't seem

4654
02:40:38,398 --> 02:40:44,239
to have an obvious value but the world

4655
02:40:42,159 --> 02:40:46,000
our world progresses

4656
02:40:44,239 --> 02:40:49,199
by those big leaps

4657
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:51,359
and then as after the leaps are taken

4658
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:53,600
then the markets are very good at uh

4659
02:40:51,359 --> 02:40:55,920
removing sort of inefficiencies but it

4660
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:58,239
just feels like the autonomous vehicle

4661
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:59,760
space and the autonomous trucking space

4662
02:40:58,239 --> 02:41:03,119
requires leaps

4663
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:05,359
it doesn't feel like we can sneak up

4664
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:07,600
into a good solution that is ultimately

4665
02:41:05,359 --> 02:41:10,239
good for labor like for human beings in

4666
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:12,640
the system it feels like some

4667
02:41:10,239 --> 02:41:14,318
like uh

4668
02:41:12,639 --> 02:41:16,478
probably a bad example but like a henry

4669
02:41:14,318 --> 02:41:18,079
four type of character steps in and say

4670
02:41:16,478 --> 02:41:19,199
like we need to do stuff completely

4671
02:41:18,079 --> 02:41:20,879
differently

4672
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:22,079
um

4673
02:41:20,879 --> 02:41:24,719
yeah and i

4674
02:41:22,079 --> 02:41:27,200
you said we can't hope for a hero

4675
02:41:24,719 --> 02:41:30,159
but it's like no but we can say we need

4676
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:32,240
a hero we need more heroes so if you're

4677
02:41:30,159 --> 02:41:34,239
a young kid right now listening to this

4678
02:41:32,239 --> 02:41:35,600
we need you to be a hero it's not like

4679
02:41:34,239 --> 02:41:37,119
we need you to start a company that

4680
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:38,479
makes a lot of money no

4681
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:41,359
you need to start a company that makes a

4682
02:41:38,478 --> 02:41:42,879
lot of money so that you can uh feed

4683
02:41:41,359 --> 02:41:44,559
your family as you become a hero and

4684
02:41:42,879 --> 02:41:45,679
take huge risks and potentially go

4685
02:41:44,559 --> 02:41:48,318
bankrupt

4686
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:50,880
those risks is how we move society

4687
02:41:48,318 --> 02:41:53,039
forward i think maybe there's a romantic

4688
02:41:50,879 --> 02:41:55,679
view i don't know i totally disagree you

4689
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:56,880
disagree god damn it i mean i and the

4690
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:59,520
two of us

4691
02:41:56,879 --> 02:42:02,239
you're the knowledgeable one no no um no

4692
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:04,560
no i i think it's a it's a matter of

4693
02:42:02,239 --> 02:42:08,959
like do we need those heroes absolutely

4694
02:42:04,559 --> 02:42:12,719
i mean i i i saw the you know um the

4695
02:42:08,959 --> 02:42:14,000
boosters come down from spacex's rockets

4696
02:42:12,719 --> 02:42:17,199
and you know

4697
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:19,680
land nearly simultaneously with my kids

4698
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:20,880
um you know after school one day

4699
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:22,720
and i thought

4700
02:42:20,879 --> 02:42:25,519
oh my god like this is

4701
02:42:22,719 --> 02:42:28,318
like science fiction has been made real

4702
02:42:25,520 --> 02:42:30,399
it's incredible and it's a pinnacle of

4703
02:42:28,318 --> 02:42:32,559
human achievement right it's like this

4704
02:42:30,398 --> 02:42:34,639
is what we're capable of

4705
02:42:32,559 --> 02:42:37,600
but we need to have

4706
02:42:34,639 --> 02:42:40,318
that those heroes oriented we need to

4707
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:41,760
allow them right to orient toward the

4708
02:42:40,318 --> 02:42:44,000
right um

4709
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:45,040
toward the goals right we got it climate

4710
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,398
change

4711
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:48,319
you know i mean

4712
02:42:46,398 --> 02:42:50,959
all the heroes out there

4713
02:42:48,318 --> 02:42:53,359
right i mean it's time it's time the

4714
02:42:50,959 --> 02:42:55,358
clock is ticking it's pat it's it's past

4715
02:42:53,359 --> 02:42:56,479
time i've been working on climate change

4716
02:42:55,359 --> 02:42:58,559
issues since

4717
02:42:56,478 --> 02:42:59,358
you know the mid 90s

4718
02:42:58,559 --> 02:43:01,119
like

4719
02:42:59,359 --> 02:43:05,200
i i still remember

4720
02:43:01,120 --> 02:43:06,319
um the first time in 2010 when i got a

4721
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:09,040
grant

4722
02:43:06,318 --> 02:43:12,159
to that was completely focused on

4723
02:43:09,040 --> 02:43:15,279
adaptation rather than prevention

4724
02:43:12,159 --> 02:43:16,879
and just when it when it hit me

4725
02:43:15,279 --> 02:43:17,760
that like

4726
02:43:16,879 --> 02:43:20,159
wow

4727
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:21,200
like so adaptation versus prevention is

4728
02:43:20,159 --> 02:43:23,119
like

4729
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:24,960
acceptance that

4730
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:26,800
yeah there's going to be catastrophic

4731
02:43:24,959 --> 02:43:28,559
impact we just need we need to figure

4732
02:43:26,799 --> 02:43:30,239
out how do we at least live with that

4733
02:43:28,559 --> 02:43:32,318
yeah and you know the grant was like

4734
02:43:30,239 --> 02:43:33,920
okay our agriculture system is going to

4735
02:43:32,318 --> 02:43:35,199
move our bread basket is no longer going

4736
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:37,279
to be california it's going to be

4737
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:39,760
illinois what does that mean for truck

4738
02:43:37,279 --> 02:43:40,479
transportation so it's like uh

4739
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:42,398
so

4740
02:43:40,478 --> 02:43:44,478
in terms of a big philosophical societal

4741
02:43:42,398 --> 02:43:46,879
level that's kind of like giving up

4742
02:43:44,478 --> 02:43:50,639
yeah in terms of the big heroic actions

4743
02:43:46,879 --> 02:43:52,318
yeah you know failures in human history

4744
02:43:50,639 --> 02:43:54,559
yeah that's going to be

4745
02:43:52,318 --> 02:43:56,000
let's hope not the biggest but

4746
02:43:54,559 --> 02:43:58,959
could be

4747
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:00,239
do you so so let me see why i disagree

4748
02:43:58,959 --> 02:44:03,119
right um

4749
02:44:00,239 --> 02:44:05,359
henry ford amazing right to sort of

4750
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:07,439
produce cars right daimler to put that

4751
02:44:05,359 --> 02:44:10,159
first truck on the road

4752
02:44:07,439 --> 02:44:12,000
without the roads right so there's like

4753
02:44:10,159 --> 02:44:13,760
we need that innovation there's no doubt

4754
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:16,959
about it and there's r there are rules

4755
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:19,680
for that but there's big public stuff

4756
02:44:16,959 --> 02:44:21,839
um that that that sets the stage that's

4757
02:44:19,680 --> 02:44:23,920
critical and and you know and what it

4758
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:25,680
really is it's a it's a

4759
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:27,359
sociological problem it's a political

4760
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:29,520
problem it's a social problem we have to

4761
02:44:27,359 --> 02:44:31,680
say and we have these screwed up ideas

4762
02:44:29,520 --> 02:44:33,120
right so we have this politics right now

4763
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:35,920
where like everybody feels like they're

4764
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:38,479
getting screwed and someone undeserving

4765
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:39,920
is you know is benefiting when in fact

4766
02:44:38,478 --> 02:44:42,000
like you know at least in the middle

4767
02:44:39,920 --> 02:44:43,680
right they're huge i i used to teach

4768
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:46,239
this course in rich and poor you know in

4769
02:44:43,680 --> 02:44:48,000
economic inequality and i would go

4770
02:44:46,239 --> 02:44:50,799
through you know public housing

4771
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:54,318
subsidies in philadelphia um you know

4772
02:44:50,799 --> 02:44:55,599
section 8 subsidies um you know and then

4773
02:44:54,318 --> 02:44:58,239
i would go through

4774
02:44:55,600 --> 02:45:00,640
my housing subsidies for my

4775
02:44:58,239 --> 02:45:02,398
mortgage interest deduction and it

4776
02:45:00,639 --> 02:45:05,519
worked out to basically the average

4777
02:45:02,398 --> 02:45:07,358
payment for a section 8 housing voucher

4778
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:09,120
in my neighborhood i'm not a welfare

4779
02:45:07,359 --> 02:45:12,000
recipient according to the dominant

4780
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:14,160
discourse and so we have this completely

4781
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:16,079
screwed up sense of like where our

4782
02:45:14,159 --> 02:45:18,318
dollars go and you know where the who

4783
02:45:16,079 --> 02:45:20,799
benefits from the investment and

4784
02:45:18,318 --> 02:45:22,239
you know we need to you know we

4785
02:45:20,799 --> 02:45:23,679
i don't know that we can do it but you

4786
02:45:22,239 --> 02:45:26,559
know if we're gonna

4787
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:29,439
survive we need to figure out

4788
02:45:26,559 --> 02:45:30,719
how to have honest conversations where

4789
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:33,279
private interest

4790
02:45:30,719 --> 02:45:35,438
is where we need it to be in fostering

4791
02:45:33,279 --> 02:45:36,960
innovation and and you know and

4792
02:45:35,439 --> 02:45:39,439
rewarding the people who do incredible

4793
02:45:36,959 --> 02:45:41,039
things please you know we we don't want

4794
02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:42,880
to squash that

4795
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:45,200
but we need to harness that power to

4796
02:45:42,879 --> 02:45:48,000
solve what i think are some pretty big

4797
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:50,560
you know existential problems so you

4798
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:53,040
think there's a like government level

4799
02:45:50,559 --> 02:45:55,439
national level collaboration required

4800
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:58,399
for infrastructure projects like

4801
02:45:55,439 --> 02:45:59,200
there's we should really

4802
02:45:58,398 --> 02:46:02,079
have

4803
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:03,439
large moonshot projects that uh are

4804
02:46:02,079 --> 02:46:04,799
funded by

4805
02:46:03,439 --> 02:46:06,720
our governments

4806
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:08,318
at least guided by i mean i think there

4807
02:46:06,719 --> 02:46:10,559
are ways to finance them and you know

4808
02:46:08,318 --> 02:46:11,600
other things but we got to be careful

4809
02:46:10,559 --> 02:46:13,439
right because that that's where you get

4810
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:15,359
all these sort of perverse you know

4811
02:46:13,439 --> 02:46:17,359
unintended consequences and whatnot but

4812
02:46:15,359 --> 02:46:18,960
if you look at transportation

4813
02:46:17,359 --> 02:46:21,840
in the united states and it is the

4814
02:46:18,959 --> 02:46:24,478
foundation of of the the you know

4815
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:26,639
manifest destiny economic growth

4816
02:46:24,478 --> 02:46:29,199
right that that built the united states

4817
02:46:26,639 --> 02:46:30,639
into the the world superpower that it

4818
02:46:29,200 --> 02:46:33,439
became and the industrial power that it

4819
02:46:30,639 --> 02:46:36,478
became it rested on transportation right

4820
02:46:33,439 --> 02:46:38,318
it was like you know the erie canal i i

4821
02:46:36,478 --> 02:46:40,398
grew up a few miles from where they dug

4822
02:46:38,318 --> 02:46:42,239
the first shovel full of the erie canal

4823
02:46:40,398 --> 02:46:45,278
and everyone thought it was you know

4824
02:46:42,239 --> 02:46:47,680
crazy right um but those public

4825
02:46:45,279 --> 02:46:49,200
infrastructure projects the the canals

4826
02:46:47,680 --> 02:46:50,800
right the railroads yeah they were

4827
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:52,800
privately built but they wouldn't have

4828
02:46:50,799 --> 02:46:55,119
been privately built without you know

4829
02:46:52,799 --> 02:46:57,759
lincoln funding them essentially and

4830
02:46:55,120 --> 02:47:00,960
giving you know the railroads you know

4831
02:46:57,760 --> 02:47:03,680
land um in exchange for building them um

4832
02:47:00,959 --> 02:47:06,639
the highway system the the eisenhower

4833
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:09,200
the the payback that the u.s economy got

4834
02:47:06,639 --> 02:47:12,639
from the dwight d eisenhower interstate

4835
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:13,920
system is phenomenal right um no private

4836
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:17,278
entity was going to do that

4837
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:18,159
electrification dams water you know

4838
02:47:17,279 --> 02:47:20,399
we

4839
02:47:18,159 --> 02:47:22,318
we need to do this infrastructure

4840
02:47:20,398 --> 02:47:24,559
yeah infrastructure and now more than

4841
02:47:22,318 --> 02:47:26,559
ever it's been really upsetting to me on

4842
02:47:24,559 --> 02:47:28,079
the covet front

4843
02:47:26,559 --> 02:47:29,680
um there's

4844
02:47:28,079 --> 02:47:31,200
one of the solutions to kovit which

4845
02:47:29,680 --> 02:47:33,520
seems obvious to me

4846
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:34,800
from the very beginning that nobody is

4847
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:37,040
supposed to

4848
02:47:34,799 --> 02:47:38,719
it's one of the only bipartisan things

4849
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:41,439
is

4850
02:47:38,719 --> 02:47:43,358
at home testing rapid home testing

4851
02:47:41,439 --> 02:47:45,600
there's no reason

4852
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:47,120
why at the government level we couldn't

4853
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:49,520
manufacture hundreds of millions of

4854
02:47:47,120 --> 02:47:51,200
tests a month there's no reason starting

4855
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:53,439
in may 2020

4856
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:55,200
and that gives power

4857
02:47:53,439 --> 02:47:56,479
to a country that values freedom that

4858
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:57,840
gives power information to each

4859
02:47:56,478 --> 02:47:59,119
individual to know whether they have

4860
02:47:57,840 --> 02:48:01,120
covert or not

4861
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:02,720
so

4862
02:48:01,120 --> 02:48:04,079
it's possible to manufacture them for

4863
02:48:02,719 --> 02:48:06,079
under a dollar

4864
02:48:04,079 --> 02:48:08,000
it's like an obvious thing it's kind of

4865
02:48:06,079 --> 02:48:10,159
like the roads it's like everybody's

4866
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:11,760
invested let's put

4867
02:48:10,159 --> 02:48:13,920
countless tests in the hands of every

4868
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:16,478
single american citizen maybe every

4869
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:18,879
citizen of the world

4870
02:48:16,478 --> 02:48:21,039
the fact that we haven't done that

4871
02:48:18,879 --> 02:48:23,039
today and there's some regulation stuff

4872
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:24,960
with the fda all the kind of

4873
02:48:23,040 --> 02:48:28,399
drag in a feet but there's not actually

4874
02:48:24,959 --> 02:48:28,398
a good explanation except

4875
02:48:29,040 --> 02:48:34,240
our leaders

4876
02:48:30,559 --> 02:48:36,559
and culturally we've lost the sort of uh

4877
02:48:34,239 --> 02:48:38,000
uh not lost but it's a little bit

4878
02:48:36,559 --> 02:48:40,879
dormant

4879
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:43,040
the will to do these big projects that

4880
02:48:40,879 --> 02:48:45,920
better the world

4881
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:48,080
i still have the hope that when faced

4882
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:50,639
with

4883
02:48:48,079 --> 02:48:52,719
uh catastrophic events

4884
02:48:50,639 --> 02:48:54,398
the the more dramatic the more damaging

4885
02:48:52,719 --> 02:48:55,599
the more painful they are the higher we

4886
02:48:54,398 --> 02:48:57,358
will rise

4887
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:59,120
to meet those and that's where the

4888
02:48:57,359 --> 02:49:00,720
infrastructure style projects are really

4889
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:02,880
important but

4890
02:49:00,719 --> 02:49:04,478
it's certainly um

4891
02:49:02,879 --> 02:49:06,799
a little bit challenging to remain an

4892
02:49:04,478 --> 02:49:09,278
optimist in the times of covid because

4893
02:49:06,799 --> 02:49:12,959
the response of our leaders has not been

4894
02:49:09,279 --> 02:49:14,159
as great and as historic as i would have

4895
02:49:12,959 --> 02:49:16,159
hoped

4896
02:49:14,159 --> 02:49:18,000
i i would hope that

4897
02:49:16,159 --> 02:49:20,559
the actions of leaders in the past few

4898
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:22,000
years in response to kovid

4899
02:49:20,559 --> 02:49:24,159
would be ones that are written in the

4900
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:25,680
history books and we talk about it as we

4901
02:49:24,159 --> 02:49:27,840
talk about fdr

4902
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:30,639
but sadly i don't know i think the

4903
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:33,120
history books will forget this

4904
02:49:30,639 --> 02:49:35,439
the actions of our leaders

4905
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:38,640
um

4906
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:41,639
let me just to wrap up

4907
02:49:38,639 --> 02:49:41,639
autonomy

4908
02:49:42,159 --> 02:49:45,439
when you look into the future

4909
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:49,120
are you excited

4910
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:52,159
about

4911
02:49:49,120 --> 02:49:53,279
automation in the space of trucking is

4912
02:49:52,159 --> 02:49:57,200
it

4913
02:49:53,279 --> 02:49:57,200
you know when you go to bed at night

4914
02:49:57,520 --> 02:50:00,319
do you see a beautiful

4915
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:01,600
world

4916
02:50:00,318 --> 02:50:03,680
in your vision

4917
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:06,880
that involves autonomous trucks like all

4918
02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:08,559
the truckers you've become close with

4919
02:50:06,879 --> 02:50:10,159
you've talked to

4920
02:50:08,559 --> 02:50:13,039
do you see a better world for them

4921
02:50:10,159 --> 02:50:14,959
because of autonomous drugs

4922
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:17,520
damn you lex

4923
02:50:14,959 --> 02:50:20,000
you know why because i mean i i want to

4924
02:50:17,520 --> 02:50:22,239
be an optimist you know and and i i want

4925
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:24,318
to think of myself i guess as a half

4926
02:50:22,239 --> 02:50:26,079
glass bowl kind of person but you know

4927
02:50:24,318 --> 02:50:29,439
when you ask it like that and and i

4928
02:50:26,079 --> 02:50:29,439
think about you know like

4929
02:50:30,079 --> 02:50:34,318
that when i when i look at the

4930
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:36,478
challenges to

4931
02:50:34,318 --> 02:50:38,239
harnessing that for

4932
02:50:36,478 --> 02:50:40,478
you know just let's take let's take just

4933
02:50:38,239 --> 02:50:42,000
you know labor and and climate right

4934
02:50:40,478 --> 02:50:43,920
there there are other issues congestion

4935
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:45,600
etc infrastructure that that are going

4936
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:48,840
to be affected by this you know again

4937
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:51,120
those big transformat transformational

4938
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:53,120
issues i think

4939
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:56,079
it's going to take the best of us

4940
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:57,520
like it's going to take the best of our

4941
02:50:56,079 --> 02:50:59,520
our policy

4942
02:50:57,520 --> 02:51:02,479
approaches it's going to take you know

4943
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:04,479
we need to start investing in

4944
02:51:02,478 --> 02:51:05,760
building those in rebuilding those

4945
02:51:04,478 --> 02:51:08,000
institutions i mean that's what we've

4946
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:10,398
seen in the last four years right and

4947
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:12,959
and that the erosion of that was so

4948
02:51:10,398 --> 02:51:15,519
clear in among these truck drivers like

4949
02:51:12,959 --> 02:51:17,358
you know when trump you know came in and

4950
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:19,439
said like you know

4951
02:51:17,359 --> 02:51:21,760
free trades good for workers like yeah

4952
02:51:19,439 --> 02:51:23,760
right you know um

4953
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:25,680
i grew up in the rust belt you know i

4954
02:51:23,760 --> 02:51:28,000
watched factory after factory clothes

4955
02:51:25,680 --> 02:51:29,760
all of my ancestors worked at the same

4956
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,959
factory it's still holding on by a

4957
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:34,159
thread like

4958
02:51:30,959 --> 02:51:36,639
you know the the democratic party told

4959
02:51:34,159 --> 02:51:38,318
you know blue collar workers for years i

4960
02:51:36,639 --> 02:51:40,000
don't worry about you know free trade

4961
02:51:38,318 --> 02:51:41,199
it's not it's not bad for you and i know

4962
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:44,159
the economist will probably get in the

4963
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:45,840
comment box now um you know about how we

4964
02:51:44,159 --> 02:51:47,200
look forward to your comments we look

4965
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:49,840
forward to your comments about how free

4966
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:50,720
trade benefits everybody um

4967
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:52,079
but

4968
02:51:50,719 --> 02:51:54,639
you know

4969
02:51:52,079 --> 02:51:56,398
immigration you know you you go and i'm

4970
02:51:54,639 --> 02:51:57,920
you know i think immigration is great

4971
02:51:56,398 --> 02:52:00,478
the united the united states benefits

4972
02:51:57,920 --> 02:52:02,559
from it tremendously right but there are

4973
02:52:00,478 --> 02:52:05,920
costs right go down to south

4974
02:52:02,559 --> 02:52:07,439
philadelphia and find a dry waller

4975
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:10,239
and tell him that immigration hasn't

4976
02:52:07,439 --> 02:52:12,960
hurt him right you know go go to these

4977
02:52:10,239 --> 02:52:15,920
places where there's competition right

4978
02:52:12,959 --> 02:52:19,119
um and and yes we benefit overall but we

4979
02:52:15,920 --> 02:52:21,600
have a system that that allows some

4980
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:23,760
people to pay really high costs

4981
02:52:21,600 --> 02:52:25,840
um and and trump trump tapped into that

4982
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:28,000
you know and and there was no there was

4983
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:30,079
no you know there's more than that too

4984
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:31,520
obviously and there's there's lots of

4985
02:52:30,079 --> 02:52:32,639
really dark stuff that goes along with

4986
02:52:31,520 --> 02:52:34,560
it that you know

4987
02:52:32,639 --> 02:52:36,639
you know the sort of racialization of

4988
02:52:34,559 --> 02:52:38,318
others and things like that but but he

4989
02:52:36,639 --> 02:52:40,478
hit on those core

4990
02:52:38,318 --> 02:52:42,000
you know issues that you know if you

4991
02:52:40,478 --> 02:52:43,920
were to go back over my trucking

4992
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:45,680
interviews for 15 years you would have

4993
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:47,680
heard those stories over and over and

4994
02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:49,520
over again that sense of voicelessness

4995
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:51,200
that sense of powerlessness that sense

4996
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:52,479
that there's no difference between the

4997
02:52:51,200 --> 02:52:54,800
democrats and the republicans because

4998
02:52:52,478 --> 02:52:56,719
they're all going to screw us over yeah

4999
02:52:54,799 --> 02:52:58,239
and that was there you know and you

5000
02:52:56,719 --> 02:52:59,679
could just ignore it as long as you want

5001
02:52:58,239 --> 02:53:01,359
and tell people don't worry trade's good

5002
02:52:59,680 --> 02:53:03,439
for you don't worry immigration is good

5003
02:53:01,359 --> 02:53:05,120
for you as their communities lose

5004
02:53:03,439 --> 02:53:06,720
factories and i mean a lot of them were

5005
02:53:05,120 --> 02:53:09,520
lost to the south before they were lost

5006
02:53:06,719 --> 02:53:11,278
to overseas whatever but um

5007
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:13,520
tapped into that you know we and and

5008
02:53:11,279 --> 02:53:15,040
it's there's a fundamental distrust of

5009
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:16,800
you know you look at these like pew

5010
02:53:15,040 --> 02:53:18,080
polls on like you know whether people

5011
02:53:16,799 --> 02:53:19,920
trust the media right but whether or not

5012
02:53:18,079 --> 02:53:21,840
they trust higher education

5013
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:24,478
you know um you know these institutions

5014
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:27,040
that i find magical right i mean you

5015
02:53:24,478 --> 02:53:28,879
look at the the the vaccine

5016
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:29,760
research and stuff that you know just

5017
02:53:28,879 --> 02:53:31,759
you know

5018
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:34,398
brilliant you know people doing

5019
02:53:31,760 --> 02:53:36,719
incredible things for humanity like you

5020
02:53:34,398 --> 02:53:39,278
know the idea that like you know we can

5021
02:53:36,719 --> 02:53:41,119
we can take these viruses that you know

5022
02:53:39,279 --> 02:53:42,800
used to ravage through the human

5023
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:44,160
population and that we had to be

5024
02:53:42,799 --> 02:53:45,759
terrified of

5025
02:53:44,159 --> 02:53:46,959
and you know we've we've you know we've

5026
02:53:45,760 --> 02:53:50,719
suffered but

5027
02:53:46,959 --> 02:53:52,559
you know we have such power now to to to

5028
02:53:50,719 --> 02:53:55,119
defend ourselves right

5029
02:53:52,559 --> 02:53:57,039
behind these programs right and and to

5030
02:53:55,120 --> 02:53:58,479
see those people be like hey i'm not

5031
02:53:57,040 --> 02:54:00,960
sure if higher education is good for the

5032
02:53:58,478 --> 02:54:02,478
country or not you know it's like

5033
02:54:00,959 --> 02:54:04,398
where where are we you know so we need

5034
02:54:02,478 --> 02:54:06,000
to rebuild the faith and trust in those

5035
02:54:04,398 --> 02:54:07,519
institutions and have these but we we

5036
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,879
need to have honest conversations before

5037
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:10,720
people are gonna poor people are gonna

5038
02:54:08,879 --> 02:54:12,719
buy it you know you have ideas for

5039
02:54:10,719 --> 02:54:16,000
rebuilding the trust and giving a voice

5040
02:54:12,719 --> 02:54:17,278
to the voices so is is the

5041
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:19,279
many of the things we've been talking

5042
02:54:17,279 --> 02:54:21,279
about is so

5043
02:54:19,279 --> 02:54:23,040
sort of deeply integrated

5044
02:54:21,279 --> 02:54:24,640
you think like

5045
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:26,880
this is the trouble i have with people

5046
02:54:24,639 --> 02:54:28,478
that work on ai and autonomous vehicles

5047
02:54:26,879 --> 02:54:30,879
and so on

5048
02:54:28,478 --> 02:54:33,679
it's not just a technology problem

5049
02:54:30,879 --> 02:54:36,000
it's it's this um

5050
02:54:33,680 --> 02:54:37,359
human pain problem

5051
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:39,359
it's the uh

5052
02:54:37,359 --> 02:54:41,040
the robot essentially silencing the

5053
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:43,279
voice of a human being

5054
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:45,840
because it's lowering their wage making

5055
02:54:43,279 --> 02:54:48,880
themselves more and giving them no tools

5056
02:54:45,840 --> 02:54:52,318
of how to escape that suffering

5057
02:54:48,879 --> 02:54:54,159
is there something um

5058
02:54:52,318 --> 02:54:58,318
i mean it even gets into the question of

5059
02:54:54,159 --> 02:54:59,600
meaning you know so money is one thing

5060
02:54:58,318 --> 02:55:01,600
but it's also

5061
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:02,800
what makes us happy in life you know a

5062
02:55:01,600 --> 02:55:04,479
lot of those

5063
02:55:02,799 --> 02:55:06,239
uh

5064
02:55:04,478 --> 02:55:07,920
truckers

5065
02:55:06,239 --> 02:55:10,079
the set of jobs they've had in their

5066
02:55:07,920 --> 02:55:12,239
life were defining to them as human

5067
02:55:10,079 --> 02:55:14,719
beings

5068
02:55:12,239 --> 02:55:17,520
and so and the question with automation

5069
02:55:14,719 --> 02:55:18,799
is is not just how do we have a

5070
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:20,880
a job

5071
02:55:18,799 --> 02:55:22,639
that uh gives you money

5072
02:55:20,879 --> 02:55:24,719
to feed your family

5073
02:55:22,639 --> 02:55:27,680
but also a job that gives you meaning it

5074
02:55:24,719 --> 02:55:29,358
gives you pride yeah

5075
02:55:27,680 --> 02:55:30,800
and

5076
02:55:29,359 --> 02:55:34,239
for me

5077
02:55:30,799 --> 02:55:35,759
the hope the hope is that

5078
02:55:34,239 --> 02:55:38,559
ai

5079
02:55:35,760 --> 02:55:42,559
and automation will provide other jobs

5080
02:55:38,559 --> 02:55:42,559
will be that will be a source of meaning

5081
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:46,559
um but

5082
02:55:44,879 --> 02:55:48,079
coupled with that hope is that there

5083
02:55:46,559 --> 02:55:49,199
will not be too much suffering in the

5084
02:55:48,079 --> 02:55:51,279
transition

5085
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:53,279
and that's not obvious from as from the

5086
02:55:51,279 --> 02:55:55,439
people you've spoken with

5087
02:55:53,279 --> 02:55:56,960
i mean i think we need to differentiate

5088
02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:58,800
between the effects of technology and

5089
02:55:56,959 --> 02:56:02,079
the effects of capitalism right and and

5090
02:55:58,799 --> 02:56:04,478
they are you know um the the fact that

5091
02:56:02,079 --> 02:56:07,279
workers don't have a lot of power right

5092
02:56:04,478 --> 02:56:09,039
um in this system matters now we had a

5093
02:56:07,279 --> 02:56:10,319
system right and that's why i would say

5094
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:12,479
you know go to that

5095
02:56:10,318 --> 02:56:14,478
you know harry bridger's report bridges

5096
02:56:12,478 --> 02:56:16,559
report and you know those were workers

5097
02:56:14,478 --> 02:56:18,000
who who had a sense of power

5098
02:56:16,559 --> 02:56:19,760
they said you know what we can we can

5099
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:22,478
demand some of the benefits like yeah

5100
02:56:19,760 --> 02:56:25,359
automate our jobs away but you know kick

5101
02:56:22,478 --> 02:56:27,679
a little down to us right and and we had

5102
02:56:25,359 --> 02:56:30,239
in the golden era of american

5103
02:56:27,680 --> 02:56:32,318
industrialism in post-world war ii

5104
02:56:30,239 --> 02:56:33,520
that was the that was the contract the

5105
02:56:32,318 --> 02:56:35,278
contract was

5106
02:56:33,520 --> 02:56:37,200
employers can do what they want in

5107
02:56:35,279 --> 02:56:38,800
automation and all these things yeah

5108
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:40,000
sure there's some union rules that that

5109
02:56:38,799 --> 02:56:41,840
make things a little you know less

5110
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:44,318
efficient in places but

5111
02:56:41,840 --> 02:56:46,398
the key compromise is tie wages to

5112
02:56:44,318 --> 02:56:48,398
productivity that's what we did we tied

5113
02:56:46,398 --> 02:56:50,559
that's what unions did they tied wages

5114
02:56:48,398 --> 02:56:52,559
to productivity kept demand up right it

5115
02:56:50,559 --> 02:56:56,000
was good for the economy some economists

5116
02:56:52,559 --> 02:56:58,239
think right um and and that's what

5117
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:00,318
you know we need to i think we need to

5118
02:56:58,239 --> 02:57:02,079
acknowledge that we we need to

5119
02:57:00,318 --> 02:57:04,478
acknowledge the

5120
02:57:02,079 --> 02:57:07,520
the fact that it's not just technology

5121
02:57:04,478 --> 02:57:08,799
it's technology in a social

5122
02:57:07,520 --> 02:57:10,399
context

5123
02:57:08,799 --> 02:57:12,559
in which some people have a lot of power

5124
02:57:10,398 --> 02:57:14,478
to determine what what happens

5125
02:57:12,559 --> 02:57:16,719
for me i don't have all the answers but

5126
02:57:14,478 --> 02:57:18,719
i know what my answer is and my answer

5127
02:57:16,719 --> 02:57:20,239
is i i think i started with this you

5128
02:57:18,719 --> 02:57:22,719
know

5129
02:57:20,239 --> 02:57:23,840
i can learn from every single person

5130
02:57:22,719 --> 02:57:25,920
you know

5131
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:27,439
uh did i have to talk to the 200th truck

5132
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:28,478
driver

5133
02:57:27,439 --> 02:57:29,920
in my

5134
02:57:28,478 --> 02:57:31,599
opinion yes

5135
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:33,840
because i was going to learn something

5136
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:35,040
from that 200th truck driver

5137
02:57:33,840 --> 02:57:37,120
now

5138
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:39,439
people with more power

5139
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:40,960
might talk to none

5140
02:57:39,439 --> 02:57:42,880
or they might talk to five and say okay

5141
02:57:40,959 --> 02:57:44,559
i got it you know

5142
02:57:42,879 --> 02:57:45,759
i

5143
02:57:44,559 --> 02:57:48,239
people

5144
02:57:45,760 --> 02:57:50,719
are amazing and every one of them has a

5145
02:57:48,239 --> 02:57:52,079
life experience and concerns and

5146
02:57:50,719 --> 02:57:53,760
you know um

5147
02:57:52,079 --> 02:57:56,239
can teach us something

5148
02:57:53,760 --> 02:57:58,880
and they're not in the conversation with

5149
02:57:56,239 --> 02:58:01,600
him you know and i know this because i'm

5150
02:57:58,879 --> 02:58:03,119
the expert you know so i get pulled in

5151
02:58:01,600 --> 02:58:04,720
to these conversations and people want

5152
02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:08,079
to know you know what's going to happen

5153
02:58:04,719 --> 02:58:10,079
to labor you know it's like well

5154
02:58:08,079 --> 02:58:12,799
i try so i try to be a sounding board

5155
02:58:10,079 --> 02:58:16,719
and i feel i feel a tremendous weight of

5156
02:58:12,799 --> 02:58:18,559
responsibility um you know for that

5157
02:58:16,719 --> 02:58:21,119
um

5158
02:58:18,559 --> 02:58:23,119
but i'm not those workers

5159
02:58:21,120 --> 02:58:25,279
you know and and they may they may

5160
02:58:23,120 --> 02:58:27,200
listen to this or you know walk in the

5161
02:58:25,279 --> 02:58:28,720
door sometimes it's about me like that

5162
02:58:27,200 --> 02:58:31,359
guy's full of that's not what i

5163
02:58:28,719 --> 02:58:34,000
think about you know um

5164
02:58:31,359 --> 02:58:35,840
and they don't get heard over and over

5165
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:37,200
and over but in a small way you are

5166
02:58:35,840 --> 02:58:38,159
providing a voice to them and that's

5167
02:58:37,200 --> 02:58:39,279
kind of the

5168
02:58:38,159 --> 02:58:42,719
the

5169
02:58:39,279 --> 02:58:43,840
if at scale we apply that empathy and

5170
02:58:42,719 --> 02:58:45,519
listening

5171
02:58:43,840 --> 02:58:46,960
then we could provide the voice to the

5172
02:58:45,520 --> 02:58:48,800
voiceless through our votes through our

5173
02:58:46,959 --> 02:58:50,799
money through i mean that's one way to

5174
02:58:48,799 --> 02:58:52,398
make capitalism work

5175
02:58:50,799 --> 02:58:53,759
at not

5176
02:58:52,398 --> 02:58:55,920
making the

5177
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:58,559
the powerless more powerless

5178
02:58:55,920 --> 02:59:00,239
is by all of us being a community that

5179
02:58:58,559 --> 02:59:02,478
listens to the pain of others and tries

5180
02:59:00,239 --> 02:59:04,000
to minimize that to try to give a voice

5181
02:59:02,478 --> 02:59:05,278
to the voiceless give power to the

5182
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:09,200
powerless

5183
02:59:05,279 --> 02:59:11,200
i have to ask you on by way of advice

5184
02:59:09,200 --> 02:59:13,600
in young people high school students

5185
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:16,640
college students entering this world

5186
02:59:13,600 --> 02:59:16,640
full of automation

5187
02:59:17,279 --> 02:59:20,560
full of these complex

5188
02:59:21,120 --> 02:59:25,279
labor markets markets period what would

5189
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:27,600
you uh what kind of advice would you

5190
02:59:25,279 --> 02:59:28,800
give to that person about how to have a

5191
02:59:27,600 --> 02:59:32,399
career

5192
02:59:28,799 --> 02:59:34,478
how to have a life they can be proud of

5193
02:59:32,398 --> 02:59:35,920
yeah i think you know this is such a

5194
02:59:34,478 --> 02:59:39,019
great question i don't um

5195
02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:39,020
[Music]

5196
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:43,840
it's okay to quote steve jobs right

5197
02:59:44,799 --> 02:59:49,679
always yeah i mean so

5198
02:59:47,920 --> 02:59:51,760
and i just heard this recently it was a

5199
02:59:49,680 --> 02:59:53,359
commencement speech that he gave and i

5200
02:59:51,760 --> 02:59:55,120
can't remember where it was um and he

5201
02:59:53,359 --> 02:59:56,559
was talking about you know he you know

5202
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:59,760
he had famously dropped out of school

5203
02:59:56,559 --> 03:00:02,318
but continued to take classes right um

5204
02:59:59,760 --> 03:00:04,960
and and he took a calligraphy class and

5205
03:00:02,318 --> 03:00:06,799
it influenced the design of the mac and

5206
03:00:04,959 --> 03:00:09,278
and sort of fonts and you know just was

5207
03:00:06,799 --> 03:00:10,639
was something that he had no

5208
03:00:09,279 --> 03:00:13,040
you know sense of what it was going to

5209
03:00:10,639 --> 03:00:15,358
be useful for and his lesson was you

5210
03:00:13,040 --> 03:00:17,439
know you you can't connect the dots

5211
03:00:15,359 --> 03:00:19,760
looking forward you know looking back

5212
03:00:17,439 --> 03:00:22,159
you can see all the pieces

5213
03:00:19,760 --> 03:00:24,800
that sort of led you to where you ended

5214
03:00:22,159 --> 03:00:26,639
up and for me studying truck driving

5215
03:00:24,799 --> 03:00:27,920
like i mean i literally went to graduate

5216
03:00:26,639 --> 03:00:29,760
school because i was worried about

5217
03:00:27,920 --> 03:00:31,279
climate change and like you know i had a

5218
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:33,600
whole other dissertation plan and then

5219
03:00:31,279 --> 03:00:35,200
was like driving home and like i had

5220
03:00:33,600 --> 03:00:36,479
read about all this management

5221
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:38,319
literature and sort of like how you get

5222
03:00:36,478 --> 03:00:41,278
workers to work hard for my qualifying

5223
03:00:38,318 --> 03:00:44,318
exams and then read a popular article on

5224
03:00:41,279 --> 03:00:46,239
on satellite linked computers and the

5225
03:00:44,318 --> 03:00:49,199
story in the literature was just a sense

5226
03:00:46,239 --> 03:00:50,719
of autonomy and and i was like well that

5227
03:00:49,200 --> 03:00:52,399
monitoring must affect the sense of

5228
03:00:50,719 --> 03:00:54,799
autonomy and it's just this question

5229
03:00:52,398 --> 03:00:55,920
that i found interesting and it never in

5230
03:00:54,799 --> 03:00:57,920
a million years that i ever thought i

5231
03:00:55,920 --> 03:01:01,600
was gonna like study you know spend 15

5232
03:00:57,920 --> 03:01:02,559
years of my life studying truck driving

5233
03:01:01,600 --> 03:01:06,000
um

5234
03:01:02,559 --> 03:01:09,840
and it was like if you were to map out a

5235
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:11,680
career path in academia or research like

5236
03:01:09,840 --> 03:01:14,559
you know you would you would do none of

5237
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:16,318
the things that i that i did that many

5238
03:01:14,559 --> 03:01:18,239
people advise me against where like you

5239
03:01:16,318 --> 03:01:20,719
can't like go spend a year working as a

5240
03:01:18,239 --> 03:01:22,398
truck driver you know like that's crazy

5241
03:01:20,719 --> 03:01:24,478
or you know you can't you know spend all

5242
03:01:22,398 --> 03:01:26,799
this time trying to write like one huge

5243
03:01:24,478 --> 03:01:29,519
book and you know um

5244
03:01:26,799 --> 03:01:30,959
if i could just interrupt what what was

5245
03:01:29,520 --> 03:01:33,439
the fire that

5246
03:01:30,959 --> 03:01:36,000
got you to take the leap and go and work

5247
03:01:33,439 --> 03:01:38,159
as a truck driver and go interview truck

5248
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:40,239
drivers this is what a lot of people

5249
03:01:38,159 --> 03:01:42,478
would be incapable of doing just took

5250
03:01:40,239 --> 03:01:44,398
took that leap what the heck what the

5251
03:01:42,478 --> 03:01:47,119
heck is up with your mind that allows

5252
03:01:44,398 --> 03:01:48,879
you to take that big leap so i think

5253
03:01:47,120 --> 03:01:50,800
it's probably like

5254
03:01:48,879 --> 03:01:53,039
tolkien and

5255
03:01:50,799 --> 03:01:55,920
you know i mean i think as a

5256
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:58,160
teenager you know i yeah i sort of uh

5257
03:01:55,920 --> 03:02:00,398
adopted some sense of needing to you

5258
03:01:58,159 --> 03:02:02,478
know heroically go out in the world and

5259
03:02:00,398 --> 03:02:04,239
and you know um which i've done at

5260
03:02:02,478 --> 03:02:06,639
various points in my life and like

5261
03:02:04,239 --> 03:02:08,159
looking back in absolutely stupid ways

5262
03:02:06,639 --> 03:02:10,239
um that you know where i could have

5263
03:02:08,159 --> 03:02:12,079
completely ended up dead and traumatized

5264
03:02:10,239 --> 03:02:14,799
my my family including like i took a

5265
03:02:12,079 --> 03:02:16,879
couple week trip in the pacific um like

5266
03:02:14,799 --> 03:02:18,639
solo trip and a kayak and basically my

5267
03:02:16,879 --> 03:02:20,799
kayaking experience up till that you

5268
03:02:18,639 --> 03:02:23,039
know point had been you know on a fairly

5269
03:02:20,799 --> 03:02:25,278
calm lake and like class one solo trip

5270
03:02:23,040 --> 03:02:27,520
on a kayak in the pacific yeah yeah so i

5271
03:02:25,279 --> 03:02:28,479
was working i was working on forestry

5272
03:02:27,520 --> 03:02:31,040
issues

5273
03:02:28,478 --> 03:02:33,039
and we were starting a campaign up in

5274
03:02:31,040 --> 03:02:34,800
really remote british columbia

5275
03:02:33,040 --> 03:02:36,000
and i i was like okay if i'm going to

5276
03:02:34,799 --> 03:02:37,679
work on this i've got to actually go

5277
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:39,279
there myself and see what this is all

5278
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:41,359
about and see whether it's worth like

5279
03:02:39,279 --> 03:02:42,319
devoting my sort of you know life right

5280
03:02:41,359 --> 03:02:45,120
now to

5281
03:02:42,318 --> 03:02:48,478
and just drove up there with this kayak

5282
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:50,880
and you know put into the pacific and um

5283
03:02:48,478 --> 03:02:53,679
it was insane you know like the tides

5284
03:02:50,879 --> 03:02:56,318
are huge and you know there was one

5285
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:58,800
point in which i was going down a fjord

5286
03:02:56,318 --> 03:03:00,398
and two fjords kind of came up and there

5287
03:02:58,799 --> 03:03:02,719
was a cross channel

5288
03:03:00,398 --> 03:03:04,879
and i had hit the timing completely

5289
03:03:02,719 --> 03:03:07,039
wrong and the tide was sort of rushing

5290
03:03:04,879 --> 03:03:09,679
up like you know rivers in these you

5291
03:03:07,040 --> 03:03:11,120
know two fjords and then

5292
03:03:09,680 --> 03:03:14,159
coming through this cross channel and

5293
03:03:11,120 --> 03:03:17,439
met and created this giant standing wave

5294
03:03:14,159 --> 03:03:19,039
that i had to paddle through um and now

5295
03:03:17,439 --> 03:03:20,318
actually very recently i've gone out on

5296
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:22,000
white water with some people who know

5297
03:03:20,318 --> 03:03:23,439
what the hell they're doing and i

5298
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:26,398
realized like

5299
03:03:23,439 --> 03:03:28,479
just how absolutely stupid

5300
03:03:26,398 --> 03:03:29,680
and and you know ill-fit i was but

5301
03:03:28,478 --> 03:03:31,119
that's just

5302
03:03:29,680 --> 03:03:32,239
that i think i've always had that were

5303
03:03:31,120 --> 03:03:33,760
you afraid

5304
03:03:32,239 --> 03:03:35,439
when you had that wave before that wave

5305
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:36,318
scared the out of me yeah okay what

5306
03:03:35,439 --> 03:03:39,040
about

5307
03:03:36,318 --> 03:03:40,959
taking a leap and becoming a trucker

5308
03:03:39,040 --> 03:03:44,160
yeah there was some nervousness for sure

5309
03:03:40,959 --> 03:03:47,119
i mean and you know i guess my advantage

5310
03:03:44,159 --> 03:03:49,439
as an ethnographer is i i grew up in a

5311
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:51,200
a blue collar environment you know again

5312
03:03:49,439 --> 03:03:53,840
all my um

5313
03:03:51,200 --> 03:03:54,800
ancestors were factory workers so i can

5314
03:03:53,840 --> 03:03:58,639
move

5315
03:03:54,799 --> 03:04:01,679
through spaces um i i'm really

5316
03:03:58,639 --> 03:04:03,358
i feel conf i can become comfortable in

5317
03:04:01,680 --> 03:04:05,359
lots and lots of places you know not

5318
03:04:03,359 --> 03:04:07,760
everywhere but you know along class

5319
03:04:05,359 --> 03:04:09,840
lines for sort of white you know even

5320
03:04:07,760 --> 03:04:12,478
white ethnic workers like that's you

5321
03:04:09,840 --> 03:04:15,120
know i can move in those spaces fairly

5322
03:04:12,478 --> 03:04:16,879
easily i mean not entirely there was one

5323
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:18,319
there was one time where i was like okay

5324
03:04:16,879 --> 03:04:20,239
you know and i grew up around people

5325
03:04:18,318 --> 03:04:22,959
worked on cars i've been to drag races

5326
03:04:20,239 --> 03:04:25,359
in nascar and um and i've been to you

5327
03:04:22,959 --> 03:04:27,199
know colgate university and that's why

5328
03:04:25,359 --> 03:04:29,600
and i think that was probably my initial

5329
03:04:27,200 --> 03:04:32,399
training was you know being this just

5330
03:04:29,600 --> 03:04:34,318
working class kid who ends up in this

5331
03:04:32,398 --> 03:04:36,959
you know sort of blue blood small

5332
03:04:34,318 --> 03:04:39,119
liberal arts college and just feeling

5333
03:04:36,959 --> 03:04:41,119
like

5334
03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:43,040
you know both having the entire world

5335
03:04:41,120 --> 03:04:45,200
opened up to me like philosophy and

5336
03:04:43,040 --> 03:04:47,680
buddhism and things that i had never

5337
03:04:45,200 --> 03:04:49,760
heard of you know and just became

5338
03:04:47,680 --> 03:04:52,639
totally obsessed with and just like you

5339
03:04:49,760 --> 03:04:54,318
know just following my interest but also

5340
03:04:52,639 --> 03:04:55,439
culturally perhaps didn't feel like you

5341
03:04:54,318 --> 03:04:57,680
fit in

5342
03:04:55,439 --> 03:04:59,520
feeling like just a fish out of water

5343
03:04:57,680 --> 03:05:00,479
and just you know but and at the same

5344
03:04:59,520 --> 03:05:02,000
time that

5345
03:05:00,478 --> 03:05:02,719
you know sort of drove me in the sense

5346
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,719
that

5347
03:05:02,719 --> 03:05:06,799
it drove an opening of my mind because i

5348
03:05:04,719 --> 03:05:08,719
couldn't understand it you know i was

5349
03:05:06,799 --> 03:05:11,679
like i didn't know that this world

5350
03:05:08,719 --> 03:05:13,920
existed i don't understand

5351
03:05:11,680 --> 03:05:16,079
and i think maybe that's where my real

5352
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:18,159
first step in trying to understand other

5353
03:05:16,079 --> 03:05:20,159
people because they were my friends you

5354
03:05:18,159 --> 03:05:21,520
know i mean they were my teammates i

5355
03:05:20,159 --> 03:05:24,318
played lacrosse in college like you know

5356
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:26,000
i was close to people who came from such

5357
03:05:24,318 --> 03:05:27,039
different backgrounds than i did and i

5358
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:29,680
just

5359
03:05:27,040 --> 03:05:32,800
i was so confused you know and so i

5360
03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:34,079
think i i learned to learn um and then

5361
03:05:32,799 --> 03:05:35,519
you know sort of went from there and

5362
03:05:34,079 --> 03:05:37,600
then developed your fascination with

5363
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:39,600
people and the funny thing is

5364
03:05:37,600 --> 03:05:41,439
you went from trucking now to autonomous

5365
03:05:39,600 --> 03:05:43,600
trucks i mean just speaking of not being

5366
03:05:41,439 --> 03:05:46,479
able to connect the dots and

5367
03:05:43,600 --> 03:05:48,800
you know your life in the next 10 years

5368
03:05:46,478 --> 03:05:50,879
could take very interesting directions

5369
03:05:48,799 --> 03:05:52,959
that's very difficult to first of all us

5370
03:05:50,879 --> 03:05:54,079
meeting is a funny little

5371
03:05:52,959 --> 03:05:56,478
thing given

5372
03:05:54,079 --> 03:05:59,120
the things i'm working on with robots

5373
03:05:56,478 --> 03:06:00,639
currently but you know it may not relate

5374
03:05:59,120 --> 03:06:02,079
to trucks at all

5375
03:06:00,639 --> 03:06:04,639
there's uh

5376
03:06:02,079 --> 03:06:06,478
at a certain point autonomous trucks

5377
03:06:04,639 --> 03:06:07,920
are just robots

5378
03:06:06,478 --> 03:06:10,478
and then it starts getting into a

5379
03:06:07,920 --> 03:06:13,200
conversation about the roles of robots

5380
03:06:10,478 --> 03:06:15,519
in society yeah and uh

5381
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:16,960
and the roles of humans and robots and

5382
03:06:15,520 --> 03:06:19,120
that interplay

5383
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:21,119
is right up your alley

5384
03:06:19,120 --> 03:06:23,680
yeah as somebody who deeply cares about

5385
03:06:21,120 --> 03:06:26,160
humans and have somehow found themselves

5386
03:06:23,680 --> 03:06:29,200
studying robots yeah no it's crazy i

5387
03:06:26,159 --> 03:06:30,639
mean even four four or five years ago i

5388
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:32,079
i would if you had asked me if i was

5389
03:06:30,639 --> 03:06:33,358
going to be studying trucking still i

5390
03:06:32,079 --> 03:06:35,680
would have said no

5391
03:06:33,359 --> 03:06:38,239
and so my advice is i think if i was

5392
03:06:35,680 --> 03:06:40,079
gonna give advice you know um is you

5393
03:06:38,239 --> 03:06:42,079
know you can't connect the dots looking

5394
03:06:40,079 --> 03:06:44,000
forward you just gotta follow what

5395
03:06:42,079 --> 03:06:47,680
interests you you know and

5396
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:50,478
and i think we we we downplay right that

5397
03:06:47,680 --> 03:06:51,439
when we when we talk to you know kids

5398
03:06:50,478 --> 03:06:53,039
especially you know if you have some

5399
03:06:51,439 --> 03:06:54,559
bright gifted kid that gets identified

5400
03:06:53,040 --> 03:06:56,000
as like oh you could go somewhere then

5401
03:06:54,559 --> 03:06:57,760
we're like we feed them stuff and like

5402
03:06:56,000 --> 03:07:00,799
we'll learn the piano and learn another

5403
03:06:57,760 --> 03:07:02,800
language right to learn robotics um

5404
03:07:00,799 --> 03:07:04,478
and then we tell other kids like oh

5405
03:07:02,799 --> 03:07:05,759
learn a trade you know like figure out

5406
03:07:04,478 --> 03:07:07,358
what's going to pay well and not that

5407
03:07:05,760 --> 03:07:09,920
there's anything against traits i think

5408
03:07:07,359 --> 03:07:12,000
everyone should learn like manual skills

5409
03:07:09,920 --> 03:07:14,000
to make things i think it's incredibly

5410
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:16,799
satisfying and and wonderful and we need

5411
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:19,439
more of that but also you know tell you

5412
03:07:16,799 --> 03:07:21,278
know all kids it's okay to like take a

5413
03:07:19,439 --> 03:07:22,639
class in something random that you don't

5414
03:07:21,279 --> 03:07:24,960
think you're going to get any economic

5415
03:07:22,639 --> 03:07:27,439
return on well because maybe you will

5416
03:07:24,959 --> 03:07:29,919
end up going into a trade but that class

5417
03:07:27,439 --> 03:07:32,000
that you took in studio art

5418
03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:33,600
is going to mean that you know you you

5419
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:35,279
look at buildings differently right or

5420
03:07:33,600 --> 03:07:38,000
you end up sort of putting your own

5421
03:07:35,279 --> 03:07:39,120
stamp on you know woodworking you know

5422
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:41,439
and just

5423
03:07:39,120 --> 03:07:42,319
i think that's the key is like follow

5424
03:07:41,439 --> 03:07:43,520
you know

5425
03:07:42,318 --> 03:07:45,840
it's cheesy because everybody says

5426
03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:48,640
follow your passion but you know if we

5427
03:07:45,840 --> 03:07:49,600
we say that and then we just you know

5428
03:07:48,639 --> 03:07:51,358
the the

5429
03:07:49,600 --> 03:07:53,439
90 of what people hear is you know

5430
03:07:51,359 --> 03:07:55,840
what's the return on investment for that

5431
03:07:53,439 --> 03:07:57,920
you know it's like you're a human being

5432
03:07:55,840 --> 03:08:00,239
like things interest you music interests

5433
03:07:57,920 --> 03:08:02,559
you literature interests you video games

5434
03:08:00,239 --> 03:08:04,959
interests you like follow it you know go

5435
03:08:02,559 --> 03:08:07,199
grab a kayak and go into the go do

5436
03:08:04,959 --> 03:08:10,000
something real no don't do that

5437
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:12,240
go do something stupid and uh something

5438
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:14,000
you'll regret a lot later my foremother

5439
03:08:12,239 --> 03:08:16,719
thank god she didn't know well let me

5440
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:18,239
ask because uh for a lot of people work

5441
03:08:16,719 --> 03:08:19,760
for me it is

5442
03:08:18,239 --> 03:08:22,159
quote unquote work is a source of

5443
03:08:19,760 --> 03:08:24,318
meaning and at the core of something

5444
03:08:22,159 --> 03:08:25,920
we've been talking about

5445
03:08:24,318 --> 03:08:28,159
with jobs is

5446
03:08:25,920 --> 03:08:29,359
is meaning so the big ridiculous

5447
03:08:28,159 --> 03:08:31,279
question what do you think is the

5448
03:08:29,359 --> 03:08:32,840
meaning of life

5449
03:08:31,279 --> 03:08:36,880
do you think

5450
03:08:32,840 --> 03:08:38,559
work for us humans modern society is as

5451
03:08:36,879 --> 03:08:40,318
core to that meaning

5452
03:08:38,559 --> 03:08:42,559
is that's and is that something you

5453
03:08:40,318 --> 03:08:44,159
think about in in your work sort of the

5454
03:08:42,559 --> 03:08:45,840
deeper question of meaning not just

5455
03:08:44,159 --> 03:08:50,000
financial well-being and the quality of

5456
03:08:45,840 --> 03:08:51,359
life but the deeper search for meaning

5457
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:53,600
yeah um

5458
03:08:51,359 --> 03:08:55,200
the meaning of life is love

5459
03:08:53,600 --> 03:08:57,040
and

5460
03:08:55,200 --> 03:09:00,319
you can find love in your work

5461
03:08:57,040 --> 03:09:01,600
um now and i i don't think everybody can

5462
03:09:00,318 --> 03:09:04,000
there are a lot of jobs out there that

5463
03:09:01,600 --> 03:09:06,960
just you know you do it for a paycheck

5464
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:08,639
and i think we do have to be

5465
03:09:06,959 --> 03:09:10,478
you know honest about that there are a

5466
03:09:08,639 --> 03:09:12,879
lot of people who you know don't love

5467
03:09:10,478 --> 03:09:15,358
their jobs and you know we don't have

5468
03:09:12,879 --> 03:09:17,278
jobs that they're going to love um

5469
03:09:15,359 --> 03:09:19,279
you know and and maybe that's not a sort

5470
03:09:17,279 --> 03:09:20,479
of realistic you know that's a utopia

5471
03:09:19,279 --> 03:09:22,720
right um

5472
03:09:20,478 --> 03:09:26,159
but for those of us that have the the

5473
03:09:22,719 --> 03:09:27,599
luxury i mean i think you you love what

5474
03:09:26,159 --> 03:09:28,799
you do

5475
03:09:27,600 --> 03:09:31,680
um

5476
03:09:28,799 --> 03:09:34,000
that people say that i i think the key

5477
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:36,238
you know for real

5478
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:38,000
happiness um is to

5479
03:09:36,238 --> 03:09:40,238
love what you're trying to achieve and

5480
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:41,439
maybe you love trying to build a company

5481
03:09:40,238 --> 03:09:42,719
and make a lot of money just for the

5482
03:09:41,439 --> 03:09:44,559
sake of doing that

5483
03:09:42,719 --> 03:09:46,879
but i think the people who you know are

5484
03:09:44,559 --> 03:09:48,879
really happy and have great impacts you

5485
03:09:46,879 --> 03:09:50,398
know they they love what they do because

5486
03:09:48,879 --> 03:09:51,599
it has an impact on the world that they

5487
03:09:50,398 --> 03:09:54,238
think is

5488
03:09:51,600 --> 03:09:55,920
it expresses that love right um and that

5489
03:09:54,238 --> 03:09:58,559
could be you know at

5490
03:09:55,920 --> 03:10:00,719
a counseling center that that could be

5491
03:09:58,559 --> 03:10:03,840
you know um in your community that could

5492
03:10:00,719 --> 03:10:06,000
be sending people to mars you know

5493
03:10:03,840 --> 03:10:07,760
well i also think it doesn't necessarily

5494
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:10,238
the expression of love isn't necessarily

5495
03:10:07,760 --> 03:10:11,680
about helping other people directly

5496
03:10:10,238 --> 03:10:13,680
there's something about craftsmanship

5497
03:10:11,680 --> 03:10:15,760
and skills we've talked about

5498
03:10:13,680 --> 03:10:18,800
that's almost like you're celebrating

5499
03:10:15,760 --> 03:10:18,800
humanity by

5500
03:10:19,520 --> 03:10:24,560
like searching for mastery in the task

5501
03:10:22,238 --> 03:10:26,639
in the simple like especially tasks that

5502
03:10:24,559 --> 03:10:29,920
people outside me

5503
03:10:26,639 --> 03:10:31,358
uh see as menial as is not important

5504
03:10:29,920 --> 03:10:33,840
nevertheless

5505
03:10:31,359 --> 03:10:35,840
searching for mastery for excellence in

5506
03:10:33,840 --> 03:10:38,000
that task there's something deeply human

5507
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:40,559
to that and also fulfilling

5508
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:42,719
that just like driving a truck

5509
03:10:40,559 --> 03:10:45,278
and getting damn good at it

5510
03:10:42,719 --> 03:10:47,119
like you know the best who's ever lived

5511
03:10:45,279 --> 03:10:48,319
and driving the truck and taking pride

5512
03:10:47,120 --> 03:10:50,960
in that

5513
03:10:48,318 --> 03:10:53,600
that that's uh deeply meaningful and

5514
03:10:50,959 --> 03:10:56,079
also like a real

5515
03:10:53,600 --> 03:10:59,040
celebration of humanity and a real show

5516
03:10:56,079 --> 03:11:00,478
of love i think for for humanity

5517
03:10:59,040 --> 03:11:02,000
