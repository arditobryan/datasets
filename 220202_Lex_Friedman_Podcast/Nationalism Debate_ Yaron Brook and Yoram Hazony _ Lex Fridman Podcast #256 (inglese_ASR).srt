rediscovery allow me to say a few words

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,399
about each part of the uh two word title

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,239
of this episode nationalism debate

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,000
first debate

22
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,558
i would like to have a few conversations

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,640
this year that are a kind of debate with

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,119
two or three people that hold differing

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,280
views on a particular topic but come to

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,000
the table with respect for each other

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,840
and a desire to learn and discover

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,680
something interesting together through

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,079
the empathetic exploration of the

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,159
tension between their ideas

31
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,759
this is not strictly a debate it is

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,439
simply a conversation

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,959
there's no structure

34
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:22,798
there's no winners

35
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,640
except of course just a bit of trash

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,159
talking to keep it fun

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,320
some of these topics will be very

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,960
difficult and i hope you can keep an

39
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,039
open mind and have patience with me

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,039
as kind of moderator who tries to bring

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,880
out the best in each person and the

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
ideas discussed

43
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,759
okay that's my comment on the word

44
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,280
debate now on to the word nationalism

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,079
this debate could have been called

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,399
nationalism versus individualism

47
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,919
or national conservatism versus

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,840
individualism or just conservatism

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,118
versus

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,200
individualism as we discuss in this

51
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,718
episode these words have slightly

52
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,759
different meanings depending on who you

53
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:04,000
ask this is especially true i think for

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,319
any word that ends in ism

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,318
i personally enjoy the discussion of the

56
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,079
meaning of such philosophical words i

57
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,238
don't think it's possible to arrive at a

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,120
perfect definition that everybody agrees

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,000
with

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,039
but the process of trying to do so for a

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,318
bit is interesting and productive at

62
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,318
least to me

63
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,318
as long as we don't get stuck there some

64
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,000
folks sometimes do in these

65
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,919
conversations

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,239
this is the lex friedman podcast to

67
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:32,559
support it please check out our sponsors

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:37,200
in the description and now here's my

69
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,199
conversation with yaran brooke and joram

70
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,439
i attended the excellent debate between

71
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,839
the two of you yesterday ut austin the

72
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,239
debate was between ideas of conservatism

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,560
represented by yoramazoni

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,800
and ideas of individualism represented

75
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,000
by yaran brook

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
let's start with the topics of the

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,318
debate you're on how do you define

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,080
conservatism maybe in the way you were

79
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,759
thinking about it yesterday

80
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,159
what to you are

81
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,318
some principles of conservatism

82
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,039
let me define it and then we can we can

83
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,318
get into principles if if you want when

84
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,280
i when i talk about political

85
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:14,000
conservatism i'm talking about uh a

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,719
political standpoint that

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,560
regards the recovery elaboration and

88
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,919
restoration of

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,080
tradition

90
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,839
as the key to maintaining a nation and

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,000
strengthening it through time

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,000
okay so this is something

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,759
that if you have time to talk about it

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,120
like we do on the show it's worth

95
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,439
emphasizing that conservatism uh is is

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,759
not like liberalism or marxism

97
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:41,120
liberalism and marxism are both

98
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:43,120
uh kind of universal theories and they

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
claim to be able to tell you

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,799
what's good for human beings at all

101
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,319
times in all places

102
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,400
and conservatism is a little bit

103
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,000
different because it's going to carry

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
different values

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,280
uh in every nation and every tribe you

106
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,919
know even every family you can say has

107
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,919
somewhat different values and the the

108
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,280
these loyalty groups they compete with

109
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,798
one another

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,640
that's the way human beings work so it's

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,280
deeply rooted in history of that

112
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,318
particular area of land well i wouldn't

113
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,799
necessarily say land you're right that

114
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,719
many forms of conservatism are tied to a

115
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,720
particular place so how does the

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,759
implementation of conservatism to you

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,160
differ

118
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,319
from the ideal of conservatism the

119
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,000
implementations you've seen of political

120
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,439
conservatism in the united states and

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,478
the rest of the world just to give some

122
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,719
context

123
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,399
because uh it's a loaded term like most

124
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
political terms

125
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,599
so when people think about conservative

126
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,758
in the united states they think about

127
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,160
the republican party

128
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,919
what can you kind of disambiguate some

129
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
of this what are we supposed to think

130
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,240
yeah that's a really important question

131
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,919
um usually the word conservative is

132
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,160
associated with

133
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,959
uh edmund burke and with the

134
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
uh with the the english common law

135
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,399
tradition

136
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,079
uh going back you know centuries and

137
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,478
centuries there's kind of a classical

138
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,519
english conservative tradition

139
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,599
that goes

140
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,399
uh fortescue hooker

141
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,960
uh coke selden

142
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:13,918
hale burke uh blackstone before burke um

143
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:16,239
if you take that kind of as a as a as a

144
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,159
benchmark and you compare it then you

145
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,639
can compare it to things like

146
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,960
uh the american federalist party at the

147
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,960
time of the the american founding is in

148
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,439
many respects very much

149
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,959
very much in keeping with that tradition

150
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,719
um

151
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,399
as you go forward

152
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,800
there's uh in

153
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:38,159
increasing mix of liberalism into

154
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,600
conservatism and i think i i think by

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,600
the time you get to the 1960s with uh

156
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,680
william buckley and frank meyer you know

157
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,439
the the jargon term is fusionism by the

158
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,560
time you get there

159
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,240
um

160
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,079
it's it's arguable that their

161
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,639
conservatism isn't very conservative

162
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,800
anymore that it's kind of a uh

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,319
a public liberalism mixed with a private

164
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,478
conservatism

165
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,319
so a lot of the debate that we have

166
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,560
today about you know what does the word

167
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,560
conservatism actually mean a lot of the

168
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,680
confusion comes from that comes from the

169
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,000
fact that

170
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,240
um that on on the one hand we have

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,360
people use use the term

172
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,680
i think properly historically to refer

173
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,080
to this this common law tradition of

174
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,519
which burke was a spokesman

175
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,680
but but there are lots of other people

176
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,120
who when they say conservatives they

177
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,360
just mean liberal

178
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,600
uh and um

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,840
i think that that's a big problem i mean

180
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,240
it's a it's a problem just to have an

181
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,959
intelligent debate as difficult when uh

182
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,600
when people are using the the the word

183
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,638
almost in too antithetical what would

184
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,720
you say the essential idea of

185
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,720
conservatism is time you mentioned your

186
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,960
father's a physicist so a lot of

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
physicists when they form models of the

188
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,038
universe

189
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
they don't consider time so everything

190
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:53,759
is

191
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,960
dealt with instantaneously a particle is

192
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,639
represented fully by its current state

193
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,159
velocity and position

194
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,840
you're saying

195
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,400
so you're arguing

196
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:07,279
um with with all of physics and and your

197
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,638
father as we always do uh that their

198
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,239
time matters

199
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,319
uh in conservatives that's the

200
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,478
fundamental element is the full history

201
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,120
matters and you cannot separate the

202
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:20,399
individual from the history from the

203
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,079
roots that they come from the parallel

204
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,959
in political theory

205
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,279
is

206
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,719
is what's called rationalism

207
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,519
i guess we'll probably talk about that

208
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
some

209
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,879
rationalism is kind of an instantaneous

210
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,720
timeless thing before i mentioned that

211
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,759
liberalism and various enlightenment

212
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
theories

213
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,120
they don't include time at all their

214
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,800
goal is to

215
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,639
say look there's such a thing as

216
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,000
universal human reason

217
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,519
all human beings if they're reason

218
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,680
properly will come to the same

219
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,240
conclusions

220
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,240
if that's true then it removes

221
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,400
the time consideration it removes

222
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,120
tradition and context because

223
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,198
everywhere where you are at any time you

224
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,240
ought to be able to use reason

225
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,960
and come to the same conclusions about

226
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,560
politics or morals so that's a that's a

227
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,318
theory like uh

228
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,160
immanuel kant or

229
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,919
john locke as an example hobbes is an

230
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,879
example

231
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,560
that kind of political theorizing

232
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,800
really does say

233
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,478
at a given instant we can

234
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,879
know pretty much everything that we need

235
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:25,918
to know at least the big things

236
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,319
uh and conservatism is the opposite it's

237
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,719
a it's a it's a traditionalist view

238
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,200
exactly as you say that uh that says

239
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,000
that history is crucial

240
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,120
so

241
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,240
iran

242
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,639
you say that uh history is interesting

243
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,959
but perhaps not crucial if in in the

244
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,639
context of individualism no i mean i

245
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,639
think i think there's a false dichotomy

246
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,559
he presented here and and that is that

247
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,879
one view holds that

248
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,039
uh you can derive any anything from a

249
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,559
particular historical path and a kind of

250
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,319
an empirical view

251
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,239
and if we know the history we know where

252
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,399
we should be tomorrow we know what what

253
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,799
where we should stand today and the the

254
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,639
other path is we ignore history we

255
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,399
ignore facts we know what's going on we

256
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,759
can derive from some

257
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,679
a priori axioms we can derive a truth

258
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,600
right now and both are false both of

259
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,958
those views in my view are false

260
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,680
and uh you know i'm rand and i i reject

261
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,359
uh uh both of those views and i think

262
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,519
the better thinkers of the enlightenment

263
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,200
did as well although they sometimes fall

264
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,159
into the trap of appearing like

265
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,120
rationalists and yom and i uh agree on

266
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,399
one thing and that is that kant is is is

267
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,759
one of uh

268
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,320
you know we've we've we've talked about

269
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:38,639
this in the past alex but we both hate

270
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,278
cons we both think kant is

271
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,000
is i at least think kant is probably the

272
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,759
the most destructive philosopher

273
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,919
uh since plato

274
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,879
uh who is pretty destructive himself but

275
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,639
um

276
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,120
and part of the problem is that kant

277
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,439
divorces reason from reality that is he

278
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,759
divorces reason from history he divorces

279
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,360
reason from experience because we don't

280
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,278
have direct experience of reality

281
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,600
according to cartwright we we're we're

282
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:06,320
removed from that direct experience but

283
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,120
i i view kant as the anti-enlightenment

284
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,519
that is i view khan's as the destroyer

285
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,879
of good enlightenment thinking and and

286
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,440
joram and

287
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,039
acknowledge a lot of um history of

288
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,800
philosophy people who do history of

289
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,480
philosophy if you can't as the

290
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,159
embodiment of the enlightenment that is

291
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,639
the the ultimate but but i i think

292
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,600
that's a mistake i think both russo

293
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,958
and kant uh fundamentally the goal the

294
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,159
mission in life is to destroy the

295
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,559
indictment

296
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:35,759
so my view is neither of those options

297
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:38,399
are the right option that is uh the true

298
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,000
reason based reason is not divorce from

299
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,278
reality it's quite the opposite reason

300
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,958
is a tool it's a faculty of identifying

301
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,958
and integrating

302
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,879
what it's identifying integrating the

303
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,278
facts of reality as

304
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,360
as as as we know them through

305
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,600
sense perception or through the study of

306
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,919
history through what actually happened

307
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,320
so it's the integration of those facts

308
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,958
it's the knowledge of that history and

309
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,278
then what we do is we abstract away

310
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,879
principles based on what's worked in the

311
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,799
past what hasn't worked in the past the

312
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,958
consequences of different ideas

313
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,199
different paths different actions we

314
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,399
abstract away principles that then can

315
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
be universal

316
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,839
not always we make mistakes right we can

317
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,360
come up with a universal principle it

318
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,440
sends out that it's not

319
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,360
but if we have the whole scope of human

320
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,240
history we can derive principles as we

321
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,240
do

322
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,480
in life as individuals we derive

323
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,639
principles that are then

324
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,360
truths that we can live by but you don't

325
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,879
do that by ignoring history you do that

326
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,480
by learning history by understanding

327
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,720
history by understanding in a sense

328
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,560
tradition and where it leads to and then

329
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,160
trying to do better and i think good

330
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,239
thinkers are constantly trying to do

331
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,439
better based on what they know about the

332
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,039
past and what they know about the

333
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,920
president what's the difference between

334
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,759
studying history

335
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,519
on a journey of reason

336
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,439
and tradition

337
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,120
so you mentioned that burke understood

338
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,279
that reason begins with inherited

339
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,519
tradition yesterday so what's the

340
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,799
difference between studying history but

341
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,919
then being free to go any way you want

342
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,278
and

343
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,278
tradition where it feels more

344
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,320
um not i don't want to say a negative

345
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,240
term like burden but it's uh

346
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,639
there's more of a momentum that forces

347
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,799
you to go the same way as your ancestors

348
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,000
it's the recognition that people are

349
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,559
wrong

350
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,320
often are wrong and parents

351
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,159
including your parents including your

352
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,160
your teachers including everybody

353
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,879
everybody is potentially wrong

354
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,639
and that that you can't accept anybody

355
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,278
just because they happen to come before

356
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,560
you uh that is you have to evaluate and

357
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,078
judge and you have to have a standard by

358
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,838
which they're valued and judged the

359
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,278
actions of those who came before you

360
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,760
whether they are

361
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,519
your parents whether they are the state

362
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,480
in which you happen to be born whether

363
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,919
they are

364
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,800
somebody on the other side of planet

365
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,479
earth

366
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,078
you can judge them if you have a

367
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,560
standard now my standard and i think the

368
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,278
right standard is human well-being that

369
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,679
is

370
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,399
that which is good for human beings

371
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:05,039
human beings uh you know is is the

372
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,759
standard by which we judge i can say

373
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,278
that certain periods of history were bad

374
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,958
they happened it's important to study

375
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,039
them it's important to understand what

376
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,359
they did that made them bad so we cannot

377
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,120
do that again and i can say certain

378
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,120
cultures certain periods in time were

379
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,120
good why because they promoted

380
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,879
human well-being and human flourishing

381
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,320
that's the standard then derive from

382
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,679
that okay what is it that made a

383
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,959
particular culture

384
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,399
good what is it that made that

385
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,919
particular culture

386
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,078
positive in terms of human well-being

387
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,000
and human flourishing what made this bad

388
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,479
and hopefully from that i can derive a

389
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,839
principle okay if i want human

390
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,079
flourishing and human well-being in the

391
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,560
future i want to be more like these guys

392
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,319
unless those guys i want to derive what

393
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,159
is the principle that will guide me in

394
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,160
the future that's i think how human

395
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,879
knowledge ultimately develops i think

396
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,240
people often make a mistake just

397
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,919
i'm not saying you're wrong but lots of

398
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,240
people you know don't actually read the

399
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,559
original sources and so what happens is

400
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,560
uh people will attack conservatives

401
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,638
assuming that conservatives think that

402
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,039
whatever comes from the past is right

403
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,639
and actually it's it it's very difficult

404
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,120
to find a thinker who actually says

405
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,278
something like that the the selden or

406
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,679
burke the big the the big conservative

407
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,879
theorists uh hooker they're they're all

408
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,120
people who

409
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,360
understand that the tradition

410
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,720
uh carries with it mistakes that were

411
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,278
made in the past

412
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,920
and uh and this is actually i think an

413
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,078
important part of of their empiricism

414
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,719
is that they see the search for truth as

415
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,479
something a society does by trial and

416
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,000
error and what that means is that in any

417
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,399
given moment

418
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,240
you have to be aware of the possibility

419
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,039
that things that you've inherited are

420
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,278
actually false and the job of the

421
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:45,278
political thinker or the jurist or the

422
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,039
the the philosopher

423
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,559
is not to dig in and say you know

424
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
whatever it is that we've inherited is

425
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,879
right

426
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,800
the the job is to look at uh the society

427
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,000
as a whole and say look we we have this

428
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,919
job of

429
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,759
first of all first of all conservation

430
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,599
just making sure that we don't lose good

431
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,278
things that we've had and and second

432
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,320
seeing if we can repair things in order

433
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,078
to

434
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,600
to improve them where it's necessary or

435
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,000
where it's possible

436
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,000
and that process is actually a creative

437
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,480
process this is a way in which i think

438
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,320
it is similar to euron's philosophy that

439
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,839
you take the inherited

440
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,079
uh tradition

441
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,720
and you look for way that you can shape

442
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,479
it in order to make it something uh

443
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,800
better than it was

444
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,120
that's that's a that's a baseline for

445
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,519
for what we call conservatism yes the

446
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,759
comments of the trial and error

447
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,879
the errors is uh you're proud of the

448
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,519
errors

449
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,879
it's a feature not a bug so the you

450
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,240
mentioned trial and error a few times

451
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,278
yesterday it's a really interesting kind

452
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
of idea

453
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,559
it's basically accepting that the

454
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,000
journey is going to have flaws as

455
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,838
opposed to saying

456
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,600
i mean the uh

457
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,839
the conclusion there is the current

458
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,360
system is flawed and it will always be

459
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,440
flawed

460
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,199
and you try to improve it when you

461
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,079
listen to iran talk there's much more of

462
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,919
optimism for the system being

463
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,479
perfect

464
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,958
now or potentially soon or could be

465
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,240
perfect and to me the way i heard it is

466
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,359
almost like

467
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,680
accepting that the system is flawed and

468
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,800
through trial and error will improve

469
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,559
and

470
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:21,599
uh euron says

471
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,518
no

472
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
we can have

473
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,159
a perfection now

474
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
that's why it sounds to me yeah yeah and

475
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,958
i think that's right i think the

476
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,199
difference is that

477
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,078
at some points just like in science i

478
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,599
think

479
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:41,599
one can stop the trial and error and say

480
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,360
i can now see a pattern here i i can see

481
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600
you know that that certain actions lead

482
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,320
to bad consequences certain actions lead

483
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,720
to good consequences let me try to let

484
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,360
me try to abstract away what is it that

485
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,360
is good and what is it that are bad

486
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,440
and build a system around what is good

487
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,800
and and reject what is bad i i think

488
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,000
ultimately if you if you read the

489
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,919
founding fathers and whether we call

490
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,519
them conservatives individuals

491
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,038
what the founding fathers actually did

492
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,959
all of them i think is study history

493
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,798
they all did they all talk about history

494
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,160
they'll talk about examples of other

495
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,439
cultures whether it's

496
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,439
uh whether they go back to uh uh to the

497
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,439
republic in venice or back to the

498
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,038
ancient greeks so

499
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959
they they studied these they they

500
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,640
learned lessons from them they they try

501
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,160
to figure out what has worked in the

502
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,240
past and what hasn't and tried to drive

503
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,480
principles now in my view

504
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,599
they got pretty close to what i would

505
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,120
consider

506
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,119
kind of an ideal

507
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,279
but they didn't get it completely right

508
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,678
and and here we sit 200 something years

509
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,119
after uh the declaration and after the

510
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,960
constitution i think we can look back

511
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,119
and say okay well what did they get

512
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,440
right what did they get wrong based on

513
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,759
how is it done and and where the flaws

514
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,840
and where the and we can improve on it

515
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:54,319
um i think we can get closer to

516
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:56,639
perfection um and uh and and based on

517
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,480
those kind of observations based on that

518
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,600
kind of abstraction that kind of

519
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,440
discovery of what is true just like

520
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,119
at some point you do the experiments you

521
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,600
do the trial and error and now you come

522
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,199
up with a scientific principle it it is

523
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,199
true that 100 years later you might

524
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,798
discover that hey i missed something

525
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,120
there's something uh

526
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,960
but to not

527
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,599
take the full lesson

528
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,798
to insist on incrementalism to insist on

529
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,558
we're just going to tinker with the

530
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,240
system instead of saying no there's

531
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,000
something really wrong

532
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,359
with having a king there's something

533
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,079
really wrong with

534
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,959
uh not having any representation or

535
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,678
whatever the the standard it needs to be

536
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,600
i in the name of we don't want to move

537
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,080
too fast i think is a mistake and the

538
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,839
problem with trial and error in

539
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,960
politics

540
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:44,879
is that

541
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,240
we're talking about human life right so

542
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,280
so there was a big

543
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,960
trial

544
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,798
around communism

545
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,558
and you know 100 million people paid the

546
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,160
price for the trial

547
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,480
i could have told them in advance as did

548
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,919
many people that it would not work there

549
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,919
are principles of human nature

550
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,799
principles of that we can study from

551
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,559
history principles about economics and

552
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:05,599
and other aspects well we know it's not

553
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,240
going to work you don't need to try it

554
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,079
again you know we've had communal

555
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,319
arrangements throughout history there

556
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,839
was an experiment with fascism and and

557
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:17,038
they've been experiments with all kinds

558
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,798
of political systems okay we we've done

559
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,480
them sad that we did them because many

560
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,798
of us knew they wouldn't work

561
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,519
we should learn the lesson and i think

562
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:28,319
that all of history now converges on one

563
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:30,000
lesson and that is what we need to do is

564
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,240
build systems that protect individual

565
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,679
freedom that is the core that's what

566
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,160
ultimately leads to human flourishing

567
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,240
and human success and and and human

568
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,840
achievement and to the extent that we

569
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,279
place anything above that individual

570
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,279
whether it's the state whether it's the

571
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,279
ethnicity whether it's the race whether

572
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:47,440
it's the bourgeois where it's whatever

573
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,879
it happens to be the class or whatever

574
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,400
whenever we place something above the

575
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,559
individual a consequence of negative

576
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,840
that's one of these principles that i

577
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:58,720
think we can derive from studying

578
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,480
two you know 3 000 years of civilization

579
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,919
uh and and

580
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,480
it's tragic i think because we're going

581
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,120
to keep experimenting sadly i i see it

582
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,880
right i'm not winning this battle uh i'm

583
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,239
losing the battle we're going to keep

584
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,919
experimenting with different forms of

585
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,000
collectivism we're going to keep paying

586
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,960
the price in human life

587
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
and in

588
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,159
missed opportunities for human

589
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,798
flourishing and human success and human

590
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,360
wealth and prosperity well look if we

591
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,960
let's take communism as a good example

592
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,719
none of the the major conservative

593
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,200
thinkers would say you know what's a

594
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,038
good idea a good idea would be to

595
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,038
experiment by

596
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,119
raising everything that we've inherited

597
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:37,440
and starting from scratch i mean that's

598
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:40,158
the conservative complaint or accusation

599
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,919
against uh uh rationalists i mean as

600
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,679
opposed to empiricism using rationalism

601
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,759
let's take you know let's take descartes

602
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,519
kind of as a as a benchmark you'll also

603
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:51,839
maybe define rationalism

604
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,720
yeah these are two terms that are in

605
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,399
philosophy especially in epistemology

606
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,640
they're often

607
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,798
uh compared to one another your own said

608
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,799
that it's an uh that it's a false

609
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,240
dichotomy and and maybe it is a bit

610
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,798
exaggerated but that doesn't mean it's

611
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,038
not useful for for conceptualizing the

612
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,679
the domain so

613
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,640
rationalist is somebody like descartes

614
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,440
who says

615
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,080
um

616
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,000
i'm going to set aside i'm going to try

617
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,359
to set aside everything i know

618
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,759
everything i've inherited i'm going to

619
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,038
start from scratch and he explicitly

620
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,279
says you know

621
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,599
in evaluating the the inheritance of the

622
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,279
past he explicitly says

623
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,879
you take a look at the histories that we

624
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,480
have they're not reliable you take a

625
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,159
look at the moral and the scientific

626
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,599
writings that we receive they're not

627
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,000
very good his baseline is to look

628
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,558
very critically at the past and say

629
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,400
look i'm evaluating it i i think all in

630
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,639
all it's just not worth very much

631
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,440
and so whatever i do

632
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,880
going

633
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,960
beginning from scratch is going to be

634
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,000
better as long as and he here's his

635
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,880
caveat this is as long as i'm proceeding

636
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,200
from

637
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,039
uh from self-evident

638
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,720
uh assumptions from self-evident

639
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,038
premises things that you can't argue

640
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,120
against i think therefore i am right and

641
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:08,158
then from there deducing what what he

642
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:10,719
calls infallible conclusions so that

643
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,480
model of self-evident premises to

644
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,319
infallible conclusions

645
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,319
i'm i'm calling that rationalism i think

646
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:19,839
that's kind of a kind of a standard you

647
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:23,839
know academic uh uh jargon term and it's

648
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:26,079
opposed to uh empiricism which is a a

649
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,399
thinker i i think in universities

650
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:32,079
usually the you know the empiricist is

651
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,440
uh is david yum and uh david young uh

652
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,439
will say

653
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,960
we can't learn anything the way that

654
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,720
descartes said i mean there is nothing

655
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,279
that's that self-evident and that

656
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,279
infallible so so

657
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,720
yum proposes

658
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:49,440
based on uh newton and and boyle and you

659
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,400
know the the the uh the the new physical

660
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,159
sciences so um proposes uh a science of

661
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,600
man and the science of man sounds an

662
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,080
awful lot like what euron just said

663
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:01,279
which is we're going to take a look at

664
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,720
human nature at the nature of societies

665
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,399
human nature we're going to try to

666
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,400
abstract towards

667
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,679
fixed principles for describing it human

668
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,240
societies we're going to try to do the

669
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,159
same thing and from there we get you

670
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,519
know for ex for example contemporary

671
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,679
economics

672
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,918
but we also get you know sociology and

673
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,840
anthropology which which cut in in a

674
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,880
different different direction so

675
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,000
um

676
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,600
that's rationalism versus empiricism can

677
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,440
i just say go ahead please yeah it just

678
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,279
i agree with that i think i think it's a

679
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,798
i think empiricism

680
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,399
the one thing i disagree is that i think

681
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,639
empiricism

682
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,480
rarely comes to these abstractions i

683
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,600
mean they they want more facts it's

684
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
always about

685
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,399
collecting more evidence in in the abs

686
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,000
but

687
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,080
this is where

688
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,919
you know i think i need so unusual and

689
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,000
where i i think

690
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,360
there's something new here right and and

691
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,798
that's a bold statement given the

692
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,839
history of philosophy but i think ayn

693
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,158
rand is

694
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,199
is something new and and and she so she

695
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,600
says yes

696
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,798
we agree about rationalism and it's

697
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,278
inherently wrong

698
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,119
empiricism has the problem of of okay

699
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,400
where does it lead it's it's

700
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,239
you never come to a conclusion you're

701
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,159
just accumulating evidence there's

702
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,798
something in addition there's a third

703
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,400
alternative which she is positing

704
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,798
which is

705
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,559
using empirical evidence not denying

706
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,480
empirical evidence

707
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,960
recognizing that are some axioms there's

708
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,278
some actions that we all uh at the base

709
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,440
of all of our knowledge that that are

710
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,038
starting points we're not rejecting

711
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,798
extrematic knowledge

712
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,200
and integrating those two and

713
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,278
identifying the fact that based on these

714
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,640
axioms and based on these empirical

715
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:38,319
evidence we can come to truths

716
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,919
just again like we do in science we have

717
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,599
certain axioms scientific axioms we have

718
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,440
certain experiments that we want and

719
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,678
then we can come to some identification

720
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,640
of a truth and that truth is always

721
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,519
going to be challenged by new

722
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,000
information by new knowledge but as long

723
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,158
as that's what we know that is the that

724
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,679
that is what true so truth is contextual

725
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,039
in the sense that it's contextual it's

726
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,600
based on

727
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:02,240
that knowledge uh that surrounds you so

728
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:03,839
for it to change if you get new facts

729
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,919
it's always it's always available to

730
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,599
change if the facts that you get and and

731
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,240
there really are i mean the the burden

732
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,480
of

733
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,159
of of changing what you've come to a

734
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,919
conclusion of truth is high so you'd

735
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,320
have to have real evidence that it's not

736
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,000
true but that happens all the time so it

737
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,278
happens at science right we discovered

738
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
that what we thought was true is not

739
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,839
true and and it can happen in politics

740
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,880
and ethics even more so than in science

741
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,199
because they're much

742
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,840
messier uh fields

743
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,440
but uh the idea is that you can come to

744
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:36,000
a truth but it's not just deductive uh

745
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,880
most truths are inductive

746
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,038
we learn from from obs observing reality

747
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,039
and and again coming to principles about

748
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,558
what works and what's not and here i

749
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,480
think this is

750
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,319
ein rand is different she she doesn't

751
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,679
fall into the and she's different in her

752
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,759
politics and she's different in her

753
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,120
epistemology she doesn't fall into the

754
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,278
conventional

755
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:57,278
view she's she's an opponent of hume and

756
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,919
she's an opponent of the cuts

757
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,640
she's certainly an opponent of kant's um

758
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,360
and uh and you know i i think she's

759
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,919
right right so if it's okay

760
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,199
can we walk back to uh criticism of

761
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,960
communism

762
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,319
you're both critics of communism

763
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,640
socialism

764
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,599
why did communism fail you started to

765
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,480
say

766
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,439
that

767
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,440
conservatives criticize it on the

768
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,360
basis of like rationalism that you're

769
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,400
throwing away the past you're starting

770
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,918
from scratch

771
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,080
is that the fundamental description of

772
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,960
why communism failed i think the

773
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:33,439
fundamental difference between

774
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,720
rationalists and empiricists is the

775
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,759
question of whether you're throwing away

776
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,038
the past

777
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,960
that's the argument and it cashes out as

778
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,759
a distinction between

779
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,960
abstract universal rationalist political

780
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,400
theories

781
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,319
and uh

782
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,038
empirical political theories empirical

783
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,278
political theories are are they're

784
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:54,240
always going to say something like

785
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,480
um

786
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,200
look uh

787
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,640
there are many different societies

788
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,000
we can say that some are better and some

789
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:06,720
are worse but the problem is that

790
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,038
you know that that there are many

791
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,798
different ways in which a society can be

792
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,960
better or worse

793
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,879
there's an ongoing competition and we're

794
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,319
learning on an ongoing basis what are

795
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,520
the ways in which societies can be

796
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,319
better and worse

797
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:23,200
that creates a kind of i'd say a mild

798
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:25,278
skepticism a moderate skepticism among

799
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,880
conservatives i don't think too many

800
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:27,599
conservatives have a problem looking at

801
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,480
the

802
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:33,678
at the soviet union which is brutal and

803
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,000
murderous ineffective and it's a it

804
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,360
economics totally ineffective you know

805
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,359
spiritually and then collapsed okay so

806
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,079
so so i think it's easier for us to look

807
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,839
at a system like that uh and say you

808
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,199
know what on earth what what should we

809
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,000
learn from that

810
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,720
but the main conservative tradition is

811
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,919
pretty tolerant of a diversity of

812
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,880
different kinds of society and is slow

813
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,159
to insist that france is so tyrannical

814
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,120
it just needs a revolution because

815
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,960
what's going to come after the

816
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,798
revolution is going to be much better

817
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,240
the assumption is that there's lots of

818
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:10,240
things that are

819
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,960
good about most societies and that a a

820
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,798
clean slate leads you to

821
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,120
to throw out all of the inherited things

822
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,960
that you don't even know how to notice

823
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,558
until they're gone could i actually play

824
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,798
devil's advocate here and address

825
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:25,278
something you've also said

826
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,918
can we as opposed to knowing the

827
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,240
empirical data of the 20th century that

828
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,640
communism presented can we go back to

829
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,599
the beginning of the 20th century

830
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,159
can you

831
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,359
empathize or steal man or put yourself

832
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,360
in a place

833
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,278
of the soviet union where the workers

834
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,158
are being disrespected

835
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,480
and

836
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,640
can you not see that the conservatives

837
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,360
could be pro-communism

838
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,440
or like communism is such a strongly

839
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:53,599
negative word in modern day political

840
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,960
discourse that you can't like you have

841
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,719
to put yourself

842
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,880
in the mind of

843
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,000
uh people who like red colors

844
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,679
who like

845
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,159
what it was it was

846
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,720
it's all about the branding i think

847
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,159
um just but also like the ideas of

848
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,679
solidarity

849
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:17,120
of nation of togetherness

850
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,640
of uh respect for fellow man i mean all

851
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,719
of these things that kind of communist

852
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,640
represents can you not see

853
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,798
that this idea

854
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,960
uh is actually uh

855
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:30,000
going along with conservatism it is in

856
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,440
some ways respecting the the deep ideals

857
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
of the past

858
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,080
but proposing a new way

859
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,240
to raise those ideals

860
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,759
implement those ideas in the system yes

861
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,000
i'm going to try to do it what you're

862
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,319
suggesting but historically we actually

863
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,558
have a more useful option i think for

864
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:48,720
both of our positions instead of you

865
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,480
know pretending that we like the actual

866
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,278
communists

867
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,120
we have conservative statesmen like

868
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:58,000
disraeli and bismarck who initiated

869
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,798
um

870
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
social legislation right the the the

871
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:06,319
uh the the first step to towards saying

872
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,640
uh look we're one nation we're

873
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,879
undergoing industrialization

874
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,880
that industrialization is

875
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,840
important and positive but it's also

876
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,600
doing

877
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,599
a lot of damage to a lot of people and

878
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,918
in particular it's doing damage not just

879
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,398
to individuals and families but it's

880
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,120
it's doing damage to the to the social

881
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,359
fabric the capacity of britain or german

882
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,239
to remain cohesive societies is being

883
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,158
harmed

884
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,120
and so it's these two conservative

885
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,520
statesmen israeli and bismarck who who

886
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,439
actually take the first steps

887
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,440
in order to legislate for you know for

888
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,240
what today we would consider to be

889
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,080
minimal social programs uh pensions and

890
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,519
disability insurance and those kinds of

891
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:50,319
things so for sure conservatives

892
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,480
do look at industrialization as a rapid

893
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:54,319
change and they say

894
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,159
we we do have to care about the nation

895
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,639
as a whole and we have to care about it

896
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,600
as a unity and and i assume that iran

897
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,759
will say

898
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:06,000
look that's the first step towards the

899
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,839
the catastrophe of communism but

900
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,960
before your own drives that nail into

901
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,439
the

902
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,278
let me try to make a distinction because

903
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,200
when you read marx

904
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,038
you're reading an intellectual

905
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,038
descendant of descartes

906
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:19,919
you're reading somebody who says

907
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:20,960
um

908
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,278
look

909
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,159
every society has

910
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:28,079
uh consists of oppressors and oppressed

911
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,919
right and and and that's an improvement

912
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,678
in some ways over liberal thinking

913
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,080
because at least he's seeing he's seeing

914
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,399
groups as a as a a real social

915
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:38,639
phenomenon but he says every society has

916
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:39,759
a oppressor class and oppressed class

917
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,200
there are different classes they're

918
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,278
different groups and whenever one is

919
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,319
stronger it exploits the ones that are

920
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,119
weaker

921
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,398
all right

922
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:49,839
that is the the foundation of a

923
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:51,839
revolutionary

924
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,398
political theory why because the moment

925
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,359
that you say that the only relationship

926
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:56,798
between

927
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:58,479
the stronger and the weaker is

928
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:00,960
exploitation

929
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,558
the moment that you say that then you're

930
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,079
pushed into the position and marx and

931
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,918
angle say this explicitly you're pushed

932
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,480
into the position we're saying when will

933
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,919
the exploitation end never until there's

934
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,919
a revolution what happens when there's a

935
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,799
revolution you eliminate the oppressor

936
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,759
class it's annihilationist i mean you

937
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,000
you can

938
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,480
immediately when you read it see why

939
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,480
it's different from from uh descartes or

940
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,558
bismarck because they're trying to keep

941
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,480
everybody you know somehow at peace with

942
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,879
one another and marx is saying there is

943
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,880
no peace that oppressor class has to be

944
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,720
annihilated and and then they go ahead

945
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,760
and do it and they and they and they

946
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,480
kill 100 million people so i i do think

947
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:38,319
that

948
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,679
despite the fact your question is is

949
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,000
good and right there are certain

950
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,960
similarities in concern but still i

951
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,679
think you can tell the difference

952
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,000
between that extra step of revolution to

953
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,919
you is where the problem comes like that

954
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,119
extra step of let's kill all the

955
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,600
oppressors

956
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,918
that's the problem right and then to you

957
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,158
you're on the whole step one is the

958
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,919
problem well it's all a problem b first

959
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,240
i don't view communism as um

960
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,799
something that radical in a sense that i

961
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,880
i think it it comes from a tradition of

962
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,960
collectivism i think it comes from a

963
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,120
tradition of looking at groups and and

964
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,038
measuring things in terms of groups it

965
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,639
comes from tradition where you expect

966
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,720
some people to be sacrificed for the

967
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,960
greater good of the of the whole

968
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,079
uh i i think it comes from a tradition

969
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,919
where

970
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:27,599
mysticism a revelation as as the source

971
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,399
of of truth

972
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,798
is accepted i view marx as

973
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,839
in some sense very christian i i i don't

974
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:38,079
think he's this radical rejecting i i

975
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,759
think he's just reformatting

976
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,278
christianity in a sense he's replacing

977
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,200
in a sense he's replacing god with the

978
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:44,798
proletarian

979
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,720
knowledge you know you have to you have

980
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,319
to get knowledge from somewhere so you

981
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,399
need the dictatorship of the palestinian

982
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:53,038
you need somebody the stalin the lenin

983
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:54,719
who who somehow communes with the spirit

984
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,200
the the spirit of the proletarian

985
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,519
there's no rationality not rationalism

986
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,519
there's no rationality in marx

987
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,720
there is a lot of mysticism and there is

988
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,000
a lot of

989
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,319
hand waving and there's a lot of

990
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,559
sacrifice and a lot of original sin in

991
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,319
the way he views humanity

992
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,799
side view marx as

993
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,720
as one more collectivists in in a whole

994
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,320
string of collectivists uh you know and

995
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,118
and i think i think the

996
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,960
the the bismarck in response which

997
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,039
bismarck i mean

998
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,639
i know less about israeli so i'll focus

999
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:26,719
on bismarck and bismarck is really

1000
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,440
responding to political pressures from

1001
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,239
the left and and and uh he's responding

1002
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,200
to

1003
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:35,598
the rise of of communism socialism

1004
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,598
but what bismarck is doing he's uh

1005
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,359
putting something alternative he's

1006
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,760
presenting an alternative

1007
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,000
to the proletarian as the standard by

1008
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,800
which we should uh we should measure the

1009
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,719
good

1010
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,399
and this and and what he's replacing it

1011
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,559
is the state he's replacing the

1012
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,719
proletarian with the state and that has

1013
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:54,639
exactly the same problems that is first

1014
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,158
it requires sacrificing some to others

1015
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,160
which which is what the welfare state

1016
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,559
basically legitimizes

1017
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,838
um it it places the state above all so

1018
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,838
the state now becomes i think the

1019
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:05,838
biggest evil of bismarck and i i

1020
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,719
definitely view him as a negative force

1021
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:11,039
in history is uh public education i mean

1022
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:12,879
i mean the germans really

1023
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,039
dig in on public education and really

1024
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,960
develop it and really the american model

1025
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,000
of public education is is

1026
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,000
copying

1027
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,838
the the german the prussian uh

1028
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,599
bismarcking public education

1029
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,320
real quick why

1030
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:29,359
the public education is such a root of

1031
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,240
moral evil for you well because it now

1032
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,000
says that there's one uh standard and

1033
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,639
that standard is determined by

1034
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,320
government by by a bureaucracy by by uh

1035
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:40,239
whatever the government deems as in the

1036
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,680
national interest and bismarck's very

1037
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:44,000
explicit about this he's training the

1038
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:46,000
workers of the future uh you know they

1039
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,519
they need to catch up and and you know

1040
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,719
with england and other places and they

1041
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,679
need to train the workers and there's

1042
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:51,039
going to be a

1043
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,480
he's going to train some people to be

1044
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,400
the managerial class he's going to train

1045
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,000
other people to be and he decides right

1046
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,920
the the government the bureaucracy is

1047
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,599
going to decide who's who and where they

1048
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,240
go there's no individual choice there's

1049
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,160
no individual uh is showing an ability

1050
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,399
to break out of what what the government

1051
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,480
has decided is their little box uh

1052
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,599
there's very little freedom there's very

1053
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,119
little

1054
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,800
you know ultimately there's very little

1055
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,480
competition there's very little

1056
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,920
innovation and this is the problem we

1057
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,838
have today in american education which

1058
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,760
we can get to is there's no competition

1059
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,599
and no innovation we have one

1060
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,119
standard fit all and then we have

1061
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,359
conflicts about what should be taught

1062
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,800
and the conflicts now not pedagogical

1063
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:28,319
they're not about what works and what

1064
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,000
doesn't

1065
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,160
nobody cares about that it's about

1066
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,920
political agendas right it's about what

1067
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,838
my group wants to be taught and what

1068
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,079
that group wants to be taught rather

1069
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:39,679
than actually discovering how do we get

1070
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,200
kids to read i mean we all know how to

1071
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,039
get kids to read but there's a political

1072
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,960
agenda about not teaching phonics for

1073
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,320
example so

1074
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,838
a lot of schools don't teach phonics

1075
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,160
even though the kids will never learn

1076
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,239
how to read properly so it becomes

1077
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:54,000
politics and i i don't believe politics

1078
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:55,838
belongs in education i think education

1079
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,599
is a product it's a service

1080
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,199
and we know how to deliver products and

1081
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,800
services really really efficiently at a

1082
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,319
really really low price

1083
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,480
at a really really high quality and

1084
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,559
that's leaving it to the market to do

1085
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,679
but your fundamental criticism is that

1086
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:14,000
the state can use education

1087
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:15,598
to uh further authoritarian aims well or

1088
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,838
whatever the aims i mean think about the

1089
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,599
conservative today critique of american

1090
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:22,960
educational system it's dominated by the

1091
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,720
left yeah what did you expect right if

1092
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,559
you leave it if you leave it up to the

1093
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,239
state to fund they're going to fund the

1094
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,239
things that promote

1095
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,000
state growth and state intervention and

1096
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,078
the left is better at that it has been

1097
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,679
better at that than the right and and

1098
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,359
they now dominate our educational

1099
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:40,078
institutions but look if we go back to

1100
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:42,880
bismarck my problem is placing the state

1101
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,119
above the individual so if if communism

1102
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,400
places the the class above the

1103
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,760
individual what matters is class

1104
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,119
individuals are nothing they're cogs in

1105
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,119
a machine

1106
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,320
bismarck the certainly the german

1107
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,240
tradition much more than the british

1108
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,838
tradition or the american tradition the

1109
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,439
german tradition is to place the state

1110
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:59,119
above the individual i think that's

1111
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,960
equally evil and and the outcome is

1112
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,240
fascism and the outcome is the same the

1113
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,519
outcome is the deaths of tens of

1114
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,838
millions of people

1115
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,199
when taken to to its ultimate conclusion

1116
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:09,039
just like socialism the ultimate

1117
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,480
conclusion of it is

1118
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:14,559
uh communism uh uh you know nationalism

1119
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,519
in that form kind of the smoking form

1120
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:20,159
the ultimate conclusion is uh is uh

1121
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,280
nazism or some form of fascism um

1122
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,559
because

1123
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,240
you don't care about the individual

1124
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,039
individual doesn't matter i think this

1125
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,279
is one of the differences

1126
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,880
in the anglo you know anglo-american

1127
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,200
tradition where the anglo-american

1128
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,358
tradition even the conservatives

1129
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,639
have always acknowledged and it goes

1130
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:38,159
back to you

1131
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,078
especially the conservatives yes the

1132
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,159
conservatives were there first they they

1133
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,519
acknowledged well you've you've defined

1134
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,838
conservatives to include all the good

1135
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,920
thinkers of the distant past and they're

1136
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:49,920
all good thinkers we agree on that i'm

1137
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,240
defining conservatism

1138
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,800
the way that burke does i'm just

1139
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,639
look this is a very simple observation

1140
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,480
burke thinks when you open burke and you

1141
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,319
actually read him he starts naming all

1142
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,159
of these people who he's defending and

1143
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,240
it's bizarre i'm sorry it's just in

1144
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,480
intellectual sloppiness for people to be

1145
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:08,239
publishing books called burke the first

1146
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,800
conservative the founding conservatives

1147
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:13,358
the founder i mean this is non-stop it's

1148
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,039
it's a it's a view that says burke

1149
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:16,880
reacts to the french revolution so

1150
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:18,639
conservatism has no prior tradition it's

1151
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,160
just reacting to the french revolution

1152
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:21,598
and this is i mean this is this is just

1153
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,838
uh absurd

1154
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,000
questions yeah on conservatism are there

1155
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:28,559
any conservatives that are embracing of

1156
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,519
revolutions so are they ultimately

1157
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:31,279
against

1158
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:34,320
the concept of revolution yes burke

1159
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,160
himself embraces the polish revolution

1160
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,320
uh which takes place almost exactly at

1161
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,679
the same time as the french revolution

1162
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,920
and the argument's really interesting

1163
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,759
because there's a common mistake is

1164
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,000
assuming that burke and conservative

1165
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,560
thinkers are always in favor of slow

1166
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,960
change i i think that's that's also just

1167
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,279
factually mistaken um

1168
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,599
burke is against the french revolution

1169
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,720
because he thinks that there are

1170
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,160
actually

1171
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,639
tried and true

1172
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,799
uh things that work things that work for

1173
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,358
human human flourishing and freedom

1174
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,800
included as as a very important part of

1175
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:07,679
human flourishing

1176
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,318
um

1177
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,639
he like many others takes the uh takes

1178
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,599
the uh the british the english

1179
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:17,358
constitution to be a a a model of

1180
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,119
something that works you know so it has

1181
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:20,960
a king it has various other things that

1182
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,358
that you know maybe euron will say well

1183
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,519
that that's a mistake but still

1184
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:27,679
for centuries it's the leader in many

1185
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,838
things that i think we can easily agree

1186
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:31,199
are human flourishing and

1187
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:32,318
burke says

1188
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:33,598
look what's wrong with the french

1189
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:35,599
revolution what's wrong with the french

1190
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,599
revolution is that they is that they

1191
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,440
have a system that has all sorts of

1192
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,720
problems but they could they could be

1193
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,400
repairing it

1194
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,399
and instead what they're doing by over

1195
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,039
by by overthrowing everything is they're

1196
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,720
moving away from what we know is good

1197
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:50,960
for for human beings then he looks at

1198
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,719
the polish revolution and he says the

1199
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,880
polls do the opposite the polls have a

1200
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,279
non-functioning traditional constitution

1201
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,400
it's it's too democratic it it's

1202
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,920
impossible to get uh to to raise armies

1203
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,760
and and and to defend the country

1204
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,519
because because of the fact that every

1205
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,839
nobleman has a veto

1206
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,400
so the the polish revolution moves in

1207
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:12,078
the direction of the british

1208
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,440
constitution they repair their

1209
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,480
constitution

1210
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,639
through a quick a rapid revolution they

1211
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,318
install a king along the model that

1212
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,000
looks a lot like britain and burke

1213
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,800
supports he says

1214
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,920
this is a good revolution so it's it

1215
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,519
it's not

1216
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,358
um the

1217
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:31,119
the need to quickly make a change in

1218
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,199
order to save yourself that that's not

1219
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,519
what conservatives are objecting to what

1220
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,838
they're objecting to is

1221
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,838
instead of looking at experience in

1222
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:42,400
order to try to make a

1223
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:45,039
slow or quick improvement a measured

1224
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,400
improvement to achieve a particular goal

1225
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,800
instead of doing that you say look the

1226
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,400
whole thing has just been wrong and what

1227
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,839
we've really got to do is annihilate a

1228
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,680
certain part of the population and then

1229
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,679
make completely new laws in a completely

1230
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,960
new theory that that's what he's

1231
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,879
objecting to that's the french

1232
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,318
revolution and that then becomes you

1233
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,480
know the model for for communist

1234
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:04,400
revolutions and for me the i mean the

1235
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,880
french revolution is clearly

1236
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,720
a real evil and wrong but it's not that

1237
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,079
it was a revolution and it's not that it

1238
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,519
tried to change everything i mean let's

1239
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,599
remember what was going on in france at

1240
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,119
the time and people were starving and

1241
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,760
the monarchy in particular was

1242
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,358
completely detached completely detached

1243
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,359
from the suffering of the people and

1244
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:23,920
something needed to change

1245
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,519
the the the unfortunate thing is that

1246
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,720
that

1247
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,880
the change was motivated by a a an

1248
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:32,159
egalitarian philosophy not egalitarian

1249
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,760
in a sense that i think the founding

1250
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,279
fathers talked about it but in galilee

1251
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,119
in a sense of real equality quality of

1252
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,079
outcome uh motivated by a philosophy by

1253
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,440
rousseau's philosophy and it inevitably

1254
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,200
led you could tell that the ideas were

1255
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,039
going to lead to this to massive

1256
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,719
destruction and death and an

1257
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,039
annihilation of a class

1258
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,399
you can't annihilation is never an

1259
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:54,800
option that is it

1260
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,760
it's not true that a good revolution

1261
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,599
never leads to mass death uh of just

1262
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,359
whole groups of people because a good

1263
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,960
revolution is about the sanctity of the

1264
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,119
individual it's about preservation

1265
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,280
liberty of the individual and and again

1266
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,599
that that goes back to and and defense

1267
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,599
revolution denies and russo denies

1268
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,519
really that in civilization there is a

1269
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,599
value and a thing called the individual

1270
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,838
i think this is a good place

1271
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,838
to have this discussion

1272
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,119
the founding fathers of the united

1273
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:22,078
states

1274
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,960
are they

1275
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,079
um

1276
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,400
individualists or are they conservatives

1277
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,480
so in this particular revolution that

1278
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,079
founded this country at the core of

1279
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:35,280
which are some

1280
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,280
fascinating some powerful ideas

1281
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,119
were those founding fathers were those

1282
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,160
ideas coming from a place of

1283
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,960
conservatism or did they put

1284
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,559
primary value into the freedom and the

1285
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,358
power of the individual what do you

1286
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,639
think

1287
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,480
there were both

1288
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,838
i mean this is i this is something

1289
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,079
that's a little bit difficult for

1290
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,400
sometimes for for for americans i mean

1291
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,079
even very educated americans they l they

1292
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,160
they talk about the founding fathers as

1293
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,119
though it's kind of like this this yeah

1294
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:05,358
this this collective you know uh entity

1295
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,680
with with a single brain and a single

1296
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:10,400
single value system but i i think at the

1297
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,639
time that's not the way they uh

1298
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,280
not the way any of them saw it so

1299
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:17,838
roughly there's two camps and they map

1300
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,240
on to the rationalist versus

1301
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:23,920
traditionalist empiricist dichotomy that

1302
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:25,519
i proposed earlier and the um so on the

1303
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,000
one hand you have

1304
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,838
real revolutionaries like uh jefferson

1305
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,838
and payne these are the people who burke

1306
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:33,759
was writing against these are the people

1307
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,480
who supported the french revolution so

1308
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,240
when you say real so when you say pain

1309
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,559
you're referring to revolutionaries in a

1310
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:43,358
bad way like this is a problem these are

1311
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:46,159
people who will say

1312
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:47,759
history up until now has has has been

1313
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,679
you know like with with descartes but

1314
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,720
applied to politics history up until now

1315
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:52,879
has been

1316
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:56,239
you know just a story of

1317
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,358
ugliness foolishness stupidity and evil

1318
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,959
and uh if you apply reason

1319
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:02,559
we'll all come to

1320
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,318
roughly we'll all come to the same

1321
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,960
conclusions you know and pain writes a

1322
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:10,079
book called the age of reason and the

1323
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,000
age of reason is a a manifesto for

1324
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,160
here is the answer to political and

1325
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,400
moral problems throughout history we

1326
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,960
have the answers and it's in the same

1327
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,280
school as russo's uh the social con no

1328
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,480
you you don't like that not at all oh i

1329
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,359
thought it was like i think they're the

1330
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,079
opposites okay so let me just throw in a

1331
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:29,279
question on uh jefferson and payne

1332
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,280
do you think

1333
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,560
america would exist without those two

1334
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,839
figures

1335
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:37,759
so like uh how how important is spice

1336
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:39,759
in the uh in the flavor of the dish

1337
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,599
you're making i don't want to try to run

1338
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,040
the counter factual i don't you know i

1339
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,838
don't have confidence that i know the

1340
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,440
answer to the question but it's so much

1341
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:49,199
fun you know what i'm going to offer

1342
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,440
something that i think is more fun more

1343
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:55,199
fun than the counterfactual is

1344
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:59,039
america had two revolutions not one okay

1345
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:00,399
at first there is a revolution that is

1346
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,679
strongly spiced

1347
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,960
with

1348
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:07,358
this kind this kind of rationalism

1349
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,440
and then there's a ten year period after

1350
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:11,279
the declaration of independence there's

1351
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,200
a ten-year period under which america

1352
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,880
has a constitution its first

1353
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,239
constitution which today they call the

1354
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,119
articles of the confederation but

1355
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:21,759
there's a constitution from 1777

1356
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,640
and that constitution is

1357
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,119
based on in a lot of ways on the hottest

1358
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,199
new ideas it has instead of the

1359
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,680
traditional british system with a

1360
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:33,919
division of powers between you know an

1361
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,838
executive and a bicameral camera

1362
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,358
legislature instead instead of that

1363
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,199
traditional english

1364
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,199
uh model which most of the states had as

1365
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:44,480
their governments instead of that they

1366
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:46,239
say no we're going to have uh one

1367
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,800
uh elected body

1368
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,559
okay and that body that congress it's

1369
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,480
going to be the executive it's going to

1370
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,000
be the legislative it's going to be it's

1371
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,000
going to be everything and it's going to

1372
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,440
run as a big committee these these are

1373
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,079
the ideas of the french revolution you

1374
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,960
get to actually see them implemented in

1375
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,720
uh in pennsylvania in the pennsylvania

1376
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,800
constitution and then and then later in

1377
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:09,118
the national assembly in france it's a

1378
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,960
disaster the thing doesn't work it's

1379
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,480
completely made up it's not based on any

1380
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,400
kind it's it's neither based on

1381
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,079
historical experience nor is it based on

1382
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,400
historical custom on what people are

1383
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,119
used to and what what they succeed in

1384
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,519
creating with this first constitution is

1385
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,240
it's wonderfully rational but it's a

1386
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,000
complete disaster it doesn't allow the

1387
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,000
raising of taxes it doesn't allow the

1388
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,559
mustering of troops it doesn't allow

1389
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,358
giving orders to to soldiers to fight a

1390
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,040
war

1391
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:39,440
and if it if that had continued if that

1392
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:41,199
had continued to be the the the

1393
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,480
the american constitution america never

1394
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:43,358
would have been an independent country

1395
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,199
they aren't willing to do that

1396
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:48,400
counter-factual

1397
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:50,239
what happens uh during those years

1398
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,400
where uh where

1399
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:56,639
uh washington and jay and knox and

1400
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,000
hamilton and morris there's like this

1401
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:02,558
group of conservatives they're mostly

1402
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,400
soldiers and lawyers other than

1403
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,880
washington most of them are from you

1404
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,358
know from northern cities and this group

1405
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:13,039
is much more conservative

1406
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:16,078
than uh than the uh than the tom paine

1407
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,000
and and jefferson school you some some

1408
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,920
historians some historians call them the

1409
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,599
nationalist party

1410
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,599
historically they give up the word

1411
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,280
nationalism and they call themselves the

1412
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,280
federalists but they're basically the

1413
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,319
nationalist party what does that mean it

1414
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,000
means on the one hand that their goal is

1415
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:33,519
to create an independent nation

1416
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,719
independent from britain but on the

1417
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,920
other hand

1418
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:39,439
they believe that that they already have

1419
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,559
uh national

1420
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,800
legal traditions the common law the the

1421
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,880
forms of government that have been uh

1422
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,960
imported from from britain and of course

1423
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,960
christianity which they consider to be

1424
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,000
you know part of their inheritance

1425
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,480
this this pharaoh federalist party

1426
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,239
is the conservative party

1427
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,639
these are people who are extremely close

1428
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:02,399
in in ideas to burke and these are

1429
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:04,239
people who wrote the constitution of the

1430
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,039
united states the second constitution

1431
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:09,439
the second revolution in 1787

1432
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:12,318
when washington leads the establishment

1433
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,720
of a new constitution which you know

1434
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,960
maybe technically legally it wasn't even

1435
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:19,439
legal under the old constitution but it

1436
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,679
was democratic and what it did is it

1437
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,559
said we're going to take what we know

1438
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:25,118
about

1439
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,800
english government what we've learned by

1440
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,480
pl applying english government in the

1441
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,720
states we're going to create a national

1442
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,318
government a unified national government

1443
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:33,919
that's going to muster power in its

1444
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:35,358
hands enough power to be able to do

1445
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,480
things like

1446
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:41,279
fighting wars to defend a unified people

1447
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,599
those are conservatives now it it's

1448
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,119
reasonable to say

1449
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,960
well look there was no king so how

1450
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,800
conservative could they be but i think

1451
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,159
that's a reasonable question

1452
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,240
but don't forget that the american

1453
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:53,920
colonies the the english colonies in

1454
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,078
america by that point had been around

1455
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,440
for 150 years they had written

1456
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:01,119
constitutions they had already adapted

1457
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,200
for an entire century adapted the

1458
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,720
english constitution to local conditions

1459
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:05,759
where there's no aristocracy and there's

1460
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,439
no king

1461
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,200
you know i think you can see that as as

1462
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,358
a positive thing on the other hand they

1463
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:12,799
have slavery that's an innovation that

1464
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:14,159
that's not english

1465
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,920
so it's a little bit different from the

1466
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:18,159
english constitution but those those men

1467
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,400
are conservatives they make the the

1468
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,960
minimum changes that they need for the

1469
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,240
to the english constitution and and they

1470
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,480
they largely replicate it which is why

1471
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,639
the jeffersonians hated them so much

1472
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,039
they call them apostates they say

1473
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,519
they've betrayed

1474
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,239
equality and liberty and fraternity by

1475
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,159
adopting an english-style constitution

1476
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:42,479
so i would imagine you're on you would

1477
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:44,318
put emphasis of the success of the key

1478
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,358
ideas at the founding of this country

1479
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:47,279
elsewhere

1480
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:50,078
at the at the freedom of the individual

1481
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,760
so the yes the tradition of the british

1482
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,839
empire i mean the one thing i agree with

1483
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,599
yom is is is the fact that yes the

1484
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:57,279
founding fathers were not a monolith i

1485
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,519
mean they argued they debated they

1486
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,680
disagreed they they wrote against each

1487
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:03,199
other i mean jefferson and adams for

1488
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,759
decades didn't even speak to each other

1489
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:07,919
though they did make up uh and and had a

1490
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,400
fascinating fascinating relationship you

1491
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,240
and i are making up today

1492
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,720
it's like the founding fathers

1493
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:17,039
uh you know there's there's this massive

1494
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,399
debate and and discussion

1495
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,960
but i don't i don't agree with the

1496
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,559
characterization of pain and jefferson i

1497
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,679
don't think it's just to call them

1498
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,359
rationalists because i don't think

1499
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,199
they're rationalists people who've

1500
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:29,279
looked at history at the problems in

1501
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,039
history and and remember this is the

1502
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,000
18th century and they

1503
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:33,920
uh

1504
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,358
were coming out of 100 years earlier

1505
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,280
some of the bloodiest wars in all of

1506
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,119
human history were happening in in in

1507
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,960
europe uh

1508
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,838
many of them over religion

1509
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,760
um

1510
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:45,599
you know they had seen what was going on

1511
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,599
in in france and other countries where

1512
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,000
people were with people who were

1513
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,640
starving uh and where kings were

1514
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,440
frolicking in in palaces in spite of

1515
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:54,480
that

1516
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,280
uh

1517
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,599
they were very aware of the relative

1518
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,400
freedom that the british tradition

1519
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,720
uh had had given englishmen i think they

1520
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,160
knew that they understood that

1521
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:08,078
and i think they were building on that

1522
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,118
they were taking the observation of the

1523
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,039
past

1524
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,400
and trying to come up with a more

1525
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:14,239
perfect system

1526
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,480
and i think they did and in that sense

1527
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:18,479
i'm a huge fan of jefferson you know

1528
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,719
they're two things that i'm i think

1529
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,679
unfortunate about jefferson one is that

1530
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:23,598
uh

1531
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,838
he continued to hold slaves which is

1532
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,000
which is which is uh very unfortunate

1533
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,199
and the second is his is early support

1534
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,800
for the french revolution which i think

1535
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,279
is a massive mistake

1536
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,359
uh and and i would be surprised uh if

1537
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,839
you regretted it later in life given the

1538
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:40,078
consequences but you know they were

1539
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,719
trying to derive principles by which

1540
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,720
they could establish a new state and yes

1541
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:46,480
there was some uh there was pushed back

1542
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,959
by by some and there was disagreements

1543
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,159
and the in the constitution in the end

1544
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,000
is is

1545
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,440
to some extent a form of compromise it's

1546
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,679
still one of the great documents of all

1547
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,599
of human history political documents the

1548
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,679
constitution uh although i think it's

1549
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,200
inferior to the declaration i i'm i'm a

1550
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:02,639
huge fan of the declaration and i think

1551
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:04,159
one of the mistakes the conservatives

1552
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:05,838
makes one of the

1553
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:08,558
mistakes the supreme court makes and

1554
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:10,239
american judiciary makes is

1555
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:11,920
assuming the two documents are separate

1556
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:13,358
i think lincoln is absolutely right you

1557
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,119
can't understand the constitution

1558
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,039
without understanding the declaration

1559
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,800
the declaration would set the context

1560
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,039
and what sets everything up for the

1561
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,720
constitution individual rights are the

1562
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,800
key concept there

1563
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,959
and and and one of the challenges was

1564
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,318
that some of the compromises and

1565
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,720
and compromise is not necessarily

1566
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:33,039
between groups but compromises that even

1567
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:34,959
jefferson made and others made regarding

1568
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:37,519
individual rights

1569
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,920
set america on a path that uh we're

1570
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:42,079
suffering from today uh and and uh i

1571
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,519
mentioned three last night one was

1572
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:48,079
slavery obviously there was a a horrific

1573
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:50,079
compromise one that

1574
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,800
american not just paid for with a civil

1575
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,680
war six hundred thousand young men uh

1576
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,079
died because of it but the suffering of

1577
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,558
black slaves for all those years but

1578
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,480
then the whole issue of racial tensions

1579
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,200
in this country uh

1580
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,079
for

1581
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:07,598
for a century and to this day really uh

1582
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,440
is a consequence of that initial

1583
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,519
compromise who knows what would what the

1584
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,280
counterfactual is in america

1585
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:14,800
if if there's a civil war right at the

1586
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,800
founding right because there would have

1587
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,559
been a war no matter what but if it

1588
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,480
happened in the late 18th century early

1589
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,720
19th century rather than waiting until

1590
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,119
to 1860s but then

1591
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:27,838
second was um

1592
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,440
jefferson's embrace of uh of public

1593
00:54:27,838 --> 00:54:30,960
education uh his founding of the

1594
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,039
university of virginia which which i

1595
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,000
think is is a great tragedy

1596
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,838
and um which nobody agrees with me on so

1597
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,358
so that's one of the areas where i'm

1598
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:43,679
pretty radical and then they embrace

1599
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:46,000
both by jefferson and by hamilton

1600
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:48,078
uh for different reasons but embraced by

1601
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,119
both of them of government role in the

1602
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,880
economy and you know i'm i do finance so

1603
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,079
i know a little bit about finance and

1604
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,000
the debate between jefferson and

1605
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,680
hamilton about banking is is is

1606
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,280
fascinating but at the end of the day

1607
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:01,279
both wanted a role for government in

1608
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,760
banking they both didn't trust

1609
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,599
uh jefferson didn't trust a big

1610
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,040
financial interest hamilton wanted to

1611
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,760
capture some of those financial issues

1612
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:12,318
for the state and as a consequence

1613
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,839
we set america on a path where

1614
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:15,279
you know in my view regulation always

1615
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:17,119
leads to more regulation there's never

1616
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,798
never a case where regulation decreases

1617
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,039
and we started out with a certain

1618
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:22,639
regulatory body around banks and a

1619
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,558
recognition it was okay to regulate the

1620
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:26,480
economy so once we get into the late

1621
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,640
19th century it's fine to regulate the

1622
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,199
railroads it's fine to pass antitrust

1623
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:33,279
laws it's fine to then continue on the

1624
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,519
path to where we are today which is

1625
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,599
heavy heavy heavy massive involvement of

1626
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:38,880
governing every aspect

1627
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,280
of our economy and really in every

1628
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,400
aspect of our life because of education

1629
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,000
so

1630
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,760
i i think the country was founded on

1631
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,039
certain mistakes and we haven't been

1632
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,960
willing to

1633
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:50,960
question those mistakes and in a sense

1634
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,000
that we've only moved in the opposite

1635
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,280
direction

1636
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,880
and now america has become

1637
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,400
whereas i think it was founded in the

1638
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,640
idea of the primacy of the individual

1639
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,798
the sanctity of the individual at least

1640
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:04,400
as an idea even if not fully implemented

1641
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:05,838
i think now that's completely lost i

1642
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,639
don't think anybody

1643
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:11,279
uh it really is an advocate out there

1644
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:13,519
for individualism in politics or for

1645
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,280
true freedom in politics we'll get to

1646
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:16,798
individualism but let me ask the beatles

1647
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,319
and the rolling stones question about

1648
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:20,159
the declaration of independence in the

1649
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:21,920
constitution what

1650
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:23,920
well because it's like which document

1651
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,960
beetles are all which document is more

1652
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,280
important so it's obvious it's the

1653
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,119
beatles right okay is it questions is

1654
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,200
there even a question but let me then

1655
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,880
even zoom in further and ask you to pick

1656
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:33,759
your favorite song

1657
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,000
so

1658
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,000
what ideas in the constitution or the

1659
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,880
declaration of independence do you think

1660
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,440
are

1661
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,599
the most important to the success of the

1662
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,200
united states of america i'll answer the

1663
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,359
question but before answering the

1664
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,199
question i want a dissent from

1665
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:51,598
registered descent from your runs is it

1666
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:52,719
the public education is it which uh no

1667
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,640
no actually

1668
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:55,598
we're we're not so look we're not so far

1669
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:57,279
apart on

1670
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,359
on on public education i'm actually kind

1671
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,119
of i'm actually kind of surprised that

1672
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:03,279
you're so anti-bismarck because his

1673
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:04,720
public school system was his national

1674
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,280
public school system was created in

1675
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:08,879
order to stick it to the church it was

1676
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,119
the church that ran the schools before

1677
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,838
then and okay so that's a different i'm

1678
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:15,519
also sticking it to the church

1679
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:16,798
but not when the alternative is the

1680
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,559
nation right

1681
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:20,480
this is no that's a free educational

1682
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,798
system you know where freedom is in

1683
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:26,159
education okay so so um i i want to

1684
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:27,759
register a dissent about uh lincoln look

1685
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:30,239
lincoln is an important figure and a

1686
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,319
great man and he was presiding over a

1687
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,719
country which at that point was pretty

1688
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:36,558
jeffersonian in terms of its uh

1689
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,399
self-perception he said what he needed

1690
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,480
to say i'm not going to criticize him

1691
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,760
but i don't accept the idea

1692
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:46,159
that the the declaration of independence

1693
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,799
which starts one revolution

1694
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:50,558
is uh is of a peace with the

1695
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:53,358
constitution the second constitution the

1696
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,559
constitution of 1787 the nationalist

1697
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:56,000
constitution

1698
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,680
which is effectively a

1699
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,079
counter-revolution

1700
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:01,838
what happens is there is a revolution

1701
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,079
it's based on certain principles there

1702
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:06,960
are a lot it not exactly but in many

1703
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,280
ways resemble the the the later

1704
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,199
ideas of the french revolution and what

1705
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,839
the federalist party does the national

1706
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:16,480
nationalist conservative party does is a

1707
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:19,279
counter-revolution to reinstate the old

1708
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,159
english constitution so these documents

1709
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,920
are

1710
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:25,199
if you're willing to accept the evidence

1711
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,960
of history they are in many respects

1712
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:30,239
contrary to one another

1713
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,079
and uh so if if i'm asked what's the

1714
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:34,838
most important values that are handed

1715
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,798
down by these documents i don't have an

1716
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:39,039
objection to

1717
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:40,480
uh you know to uh life liberty and

1718
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:42,639
property all of which are really

1719
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,679
important things i do have an objection

1720
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:49,199
to the the to the pom po the pompous

1721
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:50,639
overreach of uh these are self-evident

1722
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:52,239
which is absurd they can't be

1723
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:53,519
self-evident if they were self-evident

1724
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:55,279
then somebody would have come up with

1725
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,679
them you know like like 2 000 years

1726
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,480
before it's not it's not self-evident

1727
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:02,879
and and so so that's damaging i i like

1728
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,480
the conservative preamble of the

1729
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,358
constitution

1730
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,960
which uh describes the purposes of the

1731
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:11,920
of the national government that's being

1732
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,960
established there there are are seven

1733
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,039
purposes

1734
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,599
uh a more perfect union which is the

1735
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:18,798
prince of the principle of cohesion

1736
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,720
justice

1737
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:23,838
uh domestic peace

1738
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:26,639
uh common defense the general welfare

1739
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:28,400
which is is uh the welfare of the public

1740
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:29,838
is a as a thing that's not only

1741
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,440
individuals but there is such a thing as

1742
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:33,920
a general welfare

1743
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:37,200
liberty which we agree is absolutely

1744
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,119
crucial and posterity the idea that the

1745
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,960
purpose of the government is to be able

1746
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,358
to sustain and grow

1747
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,880
of this independent nation and not only

1748
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:47,358
to guarantee rights no matter what

1749
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:49,920
happens but you don't like the we hold

1750
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:51,679
these truth to be self-evident so you're

1751
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,639
definitely beatles guy you don't want

1752
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:56,239
the you don't want the pompous

1753
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:59,519
you don't need that right

1754
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:02,239
look i just i think that that expression

1755
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:04,719
self-evident truths it does tremendous

1756
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:07,199
damage because it it it

1757
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:08,159
instead of a moderate skepticism which

1758
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:11,039
says

1759
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:12,960
look we may not know everything it says

1760
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,318
look we know everything here it is

1761
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,000
here's what we know we know we don't

1762
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:17,119
know everything no we

1763
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,280
think

1764
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,960
so so i you know i'll agree with you i

1765
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,319
don't like self-evident i don't like

1766
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,559
self-evident because he's absolutely

1767
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:26,798
right it's not self-evident these are

1768
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,440
massive achievements

1769
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:31,838
these are massive achievements of of of

1770
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,000
enlightened thinking of studying history

1771
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:37,279
of understanding human nature of

1772
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,358
deriving a truth from

1773
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,960
3 000 years of star of historical

1774
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:43,440
knowledge and a better understanding of

1775
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,039
human nature and and and capacity is

1776
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,838
using reason

1777
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:50,159
in some ways better than any human

1778
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:52,719
beings have in i mean founding fathers

1779
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,879
giants historically in my view

1780
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:56,239
because they came up with these truths i

1781
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,400
do think they're truths but they're

1782
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:59,919
certainly not self-evident i mean if

1783
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,200
they were your arm is right they would

1784
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,039
have discovered them thousands of years

1785
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,879
earlier or or everybody would accept

1786
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:07,039
them right i mean how many people today

1787
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,720
think that those what they state in that

1788
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,679
document is true

1789
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,078
pretty much

1790
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:14,078
you know five people i don't know it's

1791
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:16,000
it's it's very it's very you're a

1792
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:18,160
criticism of modern society it's it's

1793
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,480
right there it's very very few people

1794
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:23,199
recognize that if they were self-evident

1795
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,559
bam everybody would have become a a you

1796
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:26,719
know would have accepted the american

1797
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:29,200
revolution as as truth and and that was

1798
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:31,118
it a lot of work has to go into

1799
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:33,039
understanding and describing and

1800
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,960
convincing people about those truths but

1801
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:35,920
but i i completely disagree with you all

1802
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,318
i'm about

1803
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,240
uh this idea or i'll i'll voice my

1804
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:42,159
descent as as we said

1805
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:44,000
history you're this official

1806
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:46,159
about about a that this being two

1807
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,519
different revolutions and and b that the

1808
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:50,000
american revolution was had any

1809
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:52,559
similarity to the french revolution

1810
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,559
you know that jefferson and payne were

1811
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,880
that they were in france

1812
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,400
running a different race

1813
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,318
they were waiting constantly i mean they

1814
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:02,559
were in communication with madison there

1815
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:03,920
was a lot of input going on i know and

1816
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,760
jefferson's sitting there in paris

1817
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,280
pulling his hair out because madison

1818
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,960
madison has come under the influence of

1819
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,599
these nationalists and he can't believe

1820
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,280
it

1821
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,960
the reality is that the difference

1822
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:16,400
between the french revolution and and

1823
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,960
the and the american revolution is is is

1824
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,639
vast and it is a deep philosophical

1825
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,960
difference and it's a difference that

1826
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:24,239
expressed i think uh

1827
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,358
between the differences that you know

1828
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:28,000
joram

1829
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:29,838
in his writings lumps who sew with locke

1830
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,039
and with voltaire and with others and

1831
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:33,038
and i think

1832
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,400
i i think that's wrong i think russo is

1833
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,799
very different than the others i think

1834
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,838
again we're so as an anti-enlightenment

1835
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:43,599
figure we're so is a is in many respects

1836
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:45,519
hawkening back to a past an ancient past

1837
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:47,838
and i think and i think a completely

1838
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:50,798
distorted view of human nature of human

1839
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:53,358
mind he rejects reason i mean rousseau

1840
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:55,358
is on the premise that reason is the end

1841
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:56,480
of humanity reason is the destruction of

1842
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:58,480
humanity

1843
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,280
reason is is how we get civilization and

1844
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:03,119
civilization is awful because i i i

1845
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,400
don't disagree we're only talking about

1846
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,920
different texts

1847
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,760
when i say i'm just talking about the

1848
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,599
social contract yeah but the social

1849
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,960
contract there's similarity between

1850
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,559
others but he takes it in a completely

1851
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,000
different direction and we agree social

1852
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,680
context is a bad idea but i i it can't

1853
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,719
have a contract that you don't actually

1854
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:22,558
voluntarily accept but so is the french

1855
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:24,879
revolution rousseau is

1856
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,720
about destruction and mayhem and chaos

1857
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,318
and anarchy

1858
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,598
he is the spirit behind the french

1859
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,038
revolution i think the american

1860
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:33,119
revolution is a complete rejection of

1861
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,480
rousseau uh i think jefferson is a

1862
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,400
complete rejection of russo i don't

1863
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,559
think jefferson is a fan of who so he is

1864
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,760
a voltaire he certainly is a monastery

1865
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,079
if you look at it and if you look at the

1866
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,079
federalist papers the intellectual most

1867
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,599
cited in the federalist papers i think

1868
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:48,160
in terms of this the number of times the

1869
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,680
site is montesquieu you know so i think

1870
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:51,598
that the american revolution is an

1871
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,838
individualistic revolution

1872
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:56,400
it is a revolution about the rights of

1873
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:57,599
the individual the french revolution is

1874
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,358
a negation of the rights of the

1875
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,599
individual it's a collectivistic

1876
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:02,880
revolution it's it's not quite

1877
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,359
the marxist revolution of the

1878
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,559
proletarian but it it's defining people

1879
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:08,798
in classes

1880
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,640
and it's a rebellion against a certain

1881
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:13,280
class and and yeah

1882
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:15,679
kill them all right off with their heads

1883
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,680
and it is a negation uh it's about

1884
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:19,679
egalitarianism in the sense of equality

1885
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:21,598
of outcome not in a sense of equality

1886
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:23,679
before the law or equality of rights

1887
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,160
which is the jeffersonian sense so i

1888
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:27,679
think it's it's it's wrong to to lump

1889
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:30,318
jefferson in

1890
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:33,038
to the uh fraternity uh you know

1891
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:35,519
egalitarian notion of of the french

1892
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:39,280
which is far more similar to

1893
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:39,838
to what ultimately became socialism and

1894
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,240
and marxism

1895
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:43,759
uh and and kind of that tradition it's

1896
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,959
anti-individualistic

1897
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,680
the french revolution is whereas the

1898
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,199
american revolution the first one uh is

1899
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:51,358
is individualistic it's all about

1900
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:52,879
individual rights and and while there's

1901
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:54,480
certain phrases in the declaration of

1902
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,559
independence that i don't

1903
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,159
agree with you know it's beautifully

1904
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,400
written and it's a magnificent document

1905
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:02,399
so it's hard for me to say i don't agree

1906
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:06,079
who am i right these were these were

1907
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:08,639
giants uh self-evident is one of them

1908
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:11,680
you know i'm not particularly uh

1909
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:13,679
crazy about endowed by the creator um

1910
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,519
but i like the fact that it it's creator

1911
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,838
and not god or not a specific creator

1912
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:20,159
but just it kind of a more general thing

1913
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:21,838
but putting those two ashes aside it's

1914
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:23,759
the greatest political document in all

1915
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:26,480
of human history in my view by far

1916
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:29,359
nothing comes close it it is it is a

1917
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,639
document that that identifies the core

1918
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:31,440
principles

1919
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:34,400
of

1920
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:36,000
political tourism of truth that is the

1921
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,559
role of government is to preserve and to

1922
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,798
protect these rights these inalienable

1923
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,640
rights and and that is so crucial that

1924
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:45,679
these rights are inalienable that is a

1925
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:48,239
majority can't vote them out uh you know

1926
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:50,558
revelation can't vote them out th this

1927
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:53,118
is this is what is required for human

1928
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:56,000
liberty and human freedom the the right

1929
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:57,760
that is the the sanction the freedom to

1930
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,280
act on your own behalf to act based on

1931
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,400
your own judgment as and as long as

1932
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,920
you're not

1933
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,559
you know interfering with other people's

1934
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,400
rights you are free to do so that is

1935
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,640
such a profound truth

1936
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,079
and that to me is the is the is is the

1937
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:12,639
essence of political philosophy that's

1938
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:15,440
the beginning you know and and it's it's

1939
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:17,838
based on just just uh not to fall into

1940
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,838
you i'm gonna say uh it's a rationalist

1941
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:21,679
it's based on a whole history of what

1942
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:22,400
happens when we negate that it's based

1943
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:24,000
on

1944
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:27,200
looking at england and seeing to the

1945
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,159
extent that they practiced a respect for

1946
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,798
individual liberty of property of of of

1947
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:34,639
freedom good things happened so let's

1948
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:36,480
take that all the way let's not

1949
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:39,440
compromise on that let's let's be

1950
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:42,719
consistent with the good and reject the

1951
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:44,159
bad and when england goes away distance

1952
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:47,279
itself from the rights of man from the

1953
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:48,558
idea of of a right to property and so on

1954
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,680
bad things happen and when they go

1955
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,680
through let's go all in and i'm i'm all

1956
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:55,519
in on on the right to life liberty

1957
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:57,038
property in the pursuit of happiness and

1958
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:59,599
i think the idea pursuit of happiness is

1959
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,599
profound because it's a moral statement

1960
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,559
it's a statement that says that

1961
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:07,440
sanctions and and and says that

1962
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:09,039
ultimately people should be allowed to

1963
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,440
make their own judgments and and live

1964
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,480
their lives as they see fit based on how

1965
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,920
they

1966
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,519
view happiness they might be right that

1967
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:18,240
might be wrong but we're not going to

1968
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:19,759
dictate what happiness entails and

1969
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:22,318
dictate to people how they should live

1970
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:25,920
their lives we're going to let them

1971
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:28,400
let them figure that out so it has this

1972
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,079
self-interested moral code kind of

1973
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,519
embedded in it so i think it's a it's a

1974
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,000
beautiful statement so i think the

1975
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:36,480
declaration is key and i i i think there

1976
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,440
was an experiment and the experiment was

1977
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,760
post

1978
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,920
uh in that period of of uh before the

1979
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,319
constitution where the experiment was

1980
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,720
let's let the states let's have a kind

1981
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:49,119
of a loose confederation uh let's just

1982
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:50,879
the states experiment with with setting

1983
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,039
up their own constitutions and role of

1984
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,838
government and we won't have any kind of

1985
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:57,520
unity and i think what they realized

1986
01:07:55,838 --> 01:08:00,798
and i think even jefferson realized is

1987
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:03,038
that that was not workable because

1988
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:05,440
many of the states were starting to

1989
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,599
significantly violate rights there was

1990
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,240
nothing to unify there was nothing to

1991
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,440
really protect the vision of the

1992
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:13,838
declaration

1993
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,358
you needed to establish a nation which

1994
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:16,880
is what the constitution does it

1995
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:18,798
establishes a nation

1996
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,838
but the purpose of that

1997
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:23,039
was

1998
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:25,759
to put everybody under one set

1999
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:27,519
of laws that protected rights the the

2000
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:30,158
the focus was still on the protection of

2001
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:33,040
rights and i agree with six of the seven

2002
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:34,559
of the principles right i i and i and

2003
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:36,399
which did disagree with the common

2004
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,520
warfare which which the general which

2005
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:39,198
you're going to worry

2006
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,279
i think in the way the founders

2007
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:43,678
understood it i think i probably agreed

2008
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:45,520
with it but it's such an ambiguous i'm

2009
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,440
sure you don't maybe don't maybe but

2010
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,440
just can you state the general welfare

2011
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:50,960
principle well the idea that part of the

2012
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:53,358
world of government is to secure the

2013
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,119
general wealth look it's something

2014
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:56,880
look this is something we we didn't get

2015
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:59,759
to in the debate we really should have

2016
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:02,960
is the question of whether there is such

2017
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:05,119
a thing as a a common good or a public

2018
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:07,920
interest or a national interest or a

2019
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:11,198
general welfare do these words do these

2020
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,039
terms mean anything other than the good

2021
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:15,599
of all of the individuals in the country

2022
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:17,519
that that's an important yeah so so

2023
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,440
that's right so that's why so i object

2024
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,159
to it because i think it's too easy to

2025
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:24,000
interpret it as so i interpret it as

2026
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,559
well what's good for the you know a

2027
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,079
general a group a common uh uh

2028
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,120
people or just collection of individuals

2029
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:30,880
so what's good for the individual is

2030
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:33,039
good for the common welfare but i

2031
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,640
understand that that is a that's

2032
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:36,238
something that is hard for people to

2033
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,640
grasp and and not the common

2034
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,559
understanding so i was i i would have

2035
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,319
skipped the general welfare in order to

2036
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,600
avoid the fact that now the general

2037
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,120
office includes

2038
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,520
the government telling you

2039
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:48,960
what gender you should be assigned to so

2040
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,120
so i would have i would have wanted to

2041
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,798
have skipped that completely um so i

2042
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:54,559
think the the constitution is pretty

2043
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:56,238
consistent with the the declaration with

2044
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,600
a few exceptions the general welfare but

2045
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:59,839
you know

2046
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,679
perfection is is a difficult thing to

2047
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,800
find particularly for me right

2048
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,800
politically

2049
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,400
but it's it's a magnificent document the

2050
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,920
constitution it doesn't quite rise to

2051
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:09,679
the level i think of the declaration but

2052
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,119
it's a magnificent document

2053
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:12,239
because

2054
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:13,760
you know and this is the difference i

2055
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:14,959
think between the english constitution

2056
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,119
here's here's what i see is the

2057
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,560
difference

2058
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:21,279
the difference is that the the

2059
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:23,280
constitution is written in the context

2060
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:25,439
of why do we have a separation of powers

2061
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:27,039
for example we have a separation of

2062
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:28,238
powers in order to make sure that the

2063
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:29,279
government only does what the government

2064
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:30,479
is supposed to do and what is the

2065
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:32,639
government supposed to do well

2066
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:34,238
fundamentally it's supposed to protect

2067
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,360
rights i mean all of those seven or at

2068
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:38,879
least six of the seven about protecting

2069
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:41,039
rights they're about protecting us from

2070
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,960
foreign invaders about protecting uh you

2071
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:45,519
know peace within the country

2072
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,439
they're about preserving this protection

2073
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,360
of rights and why do we have this

2074
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:50,960
separation to so so that we make sure

2075
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:52,399
that no one of those

2076
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,399
entities the executive or the

2077
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:55,599
legislature judicial can violate rights

2078
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:56,960
because there's always somebody looking

2079
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,039
over their shoulder there's always

2080
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,960
somebody who can veto their power but

2081
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:02,158
there's a purpose to it and that purpose

2082
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,158
is clearly

2083
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:05,359
uh signified and characterized and

2084
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:07,198
that's why i think the bill of rights

2085
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:09,119
was written in order to

2086
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:10,879
add to the clarification of what exactly

2087
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:12,559
we mean what is the purpose the purpose

2088
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,800
is to preserve rights

2089
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,480
um and that's why we need to to

2090
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,239
elaborate with those rights and and

2091
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:20,479
madison's objection to the bill of

2092
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:22,238
rights was to say not that he objected

2093
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:24,079
to having a

2094
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:25,678
protection of rights

2095
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:27,119
but to listing them because he was

2096
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:28,880
worried that other rights that were not

2097
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:30,158
listed would not be and his worry was

2098
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,159
completely justified because that's

2099
01:11:30,158 --> 01:11:33,279
exactly what's happened it's like the

2100
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:34,960
only reason we have free speech in

2101
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:36,800
america we've got it in writing as a

2102
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,920
first amendment if we didn't have any

2103
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,920
writing it would have been gone a long

2104
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,880
time ago and the reason we don't have

2105
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:46,239
for example the freedom to negotiate uh

2106
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:47,520
a a a contract uh you know independent

2107
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:50,238
government regulation is there was that

2108
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:52,080
was not listed as a right uh in the bill

2109
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:53,439
even though i think it's clearly covered

2110
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:55,279
under the constitution and certainly

2111
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:56,559
under the declaration so there was a

2112
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:58,238
massive mistake done in the bill of

2113
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,840
rights they tried to

2114
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:03,439
cover it with the ninth amendment but it

2115
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:05,600
never really stuck uh this idea that the

2116
01:12:03,439 --> 01:12:07,839
non-enumerated rights that that are

2117
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,360
still in place so i don't see it as a

2118
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,360
second revolution i think it's it's a

2119
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:14,799
it's a it's a fix

2120
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:16,399
to a flaw that happened it's a fix that

2121
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,159
uh allowed

2122
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:19,279
the expansion of the protection of

2123
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:21,279
rights

2124
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:23,599
to all states

2125
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:25,198
by creating a national entity to protect

2126
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,880
those rights and that's what ultimately

2127
01:12:25,198 --> 01:12:29,599
led

2128
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:32,400
to the to slavery going away uh

2129
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,560
you know under the under the initial uh

2130
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:36,479
the initial agreement slavey would have

2131
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,880
been there in perpetuity because states

2132
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:40,718
were sovereign in in a way that under

2133
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,239
the new constitution they were not and

2134
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:43,359
in a sense the constitution sets in

2135
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:44,319
motion

2136
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,158
the declaration and then the

2137
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:48,079
constitution said emotion

2138
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:49,599
the the civil war the civil war has to

2139
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:52,158
happen because at the end of the day you

2140
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,840
cannot have some states with a massive

2141
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:55,920
violation of rights what's more of a

2142
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:58,000
violation of rights and slavery and some

2143
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,239
states that recognize it's not

2144
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,479
it it if it inevitably leads to the

2145
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:04,399
civil war euron was just saying that you

2146
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:06,000
know other than the general welfare

2147
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:08,079
these principles are about individual

2148
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,760
liberties i i i think i just don't think

2149
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:11,600
you can read it that way the first

2150
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,119
stated purpose of the constitution of

2151
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,679
1787

2152
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:18,079
is in order to form a more perfect union

2153
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:20,399
a more perfect union it would what it

2154
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:23,279
it's describing a characteristic of the

2155
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:25,119
whole it is not a characteristic of any

2156
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:26,800
individual if you look at how the

2157
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:29,039
individuals are doing you don't know

2158
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,719
whether whether their union is more or

2159
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:32,158
less perfect right so what they're doing

2160
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,880
is they're they're looking they're

2161
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:36,319
looking at the condition in which uh in

2162
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,880
in order to be able to fight the battle

2163
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:40,319
of yorktown they have to somebody has to

2164
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,719
write a personal check in order to be

2165
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:44,880
able to move armies a more perfect union

2166
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,399
is a more cohesive union it's the

2167
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,880
ability to get

2168
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:50,799
all of these different individuals to do

2169
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,400
one focused thing when it's needed

2170
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,320
necessary to do it

2171
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:55,599
well it's it's more than that right so i

2172
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:57,599
agree with that

2173
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,239
but for what purpose

2174
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,600
that is f and this is why i you know

2175
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:03,198
this is why it's so hard with these

2176
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,880
historical documents because there's a

2177
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:06,559
there's a context and there's a thinking

2178
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,239
that they can't write everything down

2179
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,039
right which is sad because i wish they

2180
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:10,479
had

2181
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:12,719
what's the purpose of a more perfect

2182
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:14,879
union the purpose of the more perfect

2183
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,480
war union is to preserve the liberty of

2184
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,400
the individuals within that union now

2185
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:20,319
how do you know how because because if

2186
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:22,719
you look what's the rest so what is the

2187
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:24,479
common defense the common defenses is to

2188
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,719
protect us from foreign invaders who

2189
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:28,319
would now disrupt what the rest of the

2190
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,560
constitution is all about all of the

2191
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:33,439
constitution is written in a way as to

2192
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,440
preserve find ways to limit the war the

2193
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:37,519
ability of government to violate the

2194
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:39,359
rights of individuals that

2195
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,280
the the the beauty of this constitution

2196
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:43,920
and again its connection to the

2197
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:45,840
declaration and and tradition right what

2198
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,600
came before it what came before it was a

2199
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,840
was a document which they all respected

2200
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,760
which was the declaration which set the

2201
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,679
context for this and now the union is

2202
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,079
there in order to provide for the common

2203
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,840
defense great because we know that

2204
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:59,439
foreign invaders can violate our rights

2205
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,760
that's what war is about

2206
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:03,599
to to protect us from peace to establish

2207
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,159
peace and justice within the country

2208
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,000
that's based on law the rule of law and

2209
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:10,399
and again uh uh

2210
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,079
individual liberty so

2211
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:13,519
to me when you read the founders when

2212
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:15,198
you read the federalist papers when you

2213
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,440
read what they wrote

2214
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:19,519
what they're trying to do is figure out

2215
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:20,960
the right kind of political system the

2216
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,080
right kind of

2217
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,880
structure

2218
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:27,439
to be able to preserve these liberties

2219
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,640
and and not all of them had a

2220
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:29,759
from my perspective perfect

2221
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,079
understanding what those liberties

2222
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,119
entailed but they were all even the

2223
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:35,279
conservatives that you call

2224
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,359
conservatives we're all in generally in

2225
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,719
agreement about the importance of

2226
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:40,960
individual liberty and imports of

2227
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:43,520
individuals of course because almost all

2228
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:45,279
of these rights are traditional english

2229
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,199
rights they exist in the english bill of

2230
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:48,800
rights in the english petition of right

2231
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:50,559
in the existence of course

2232
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,679
all of these are trying to perfect that

2233
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,320
they're trying to take the british

2234
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:57,359
system and perfect it and what but you

2235
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:59,198
you keep leaving out that that they want

2236
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:01,119
to be like england in that they want to

2237
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:03,439
have an independent nation an

2238
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:05,198
independent nation is not a collection

2239
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:06,960
of individual liberties an independent

2240
01:16:05,198 --> 01:16:08,960
nation the first sentence of the

2241
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,719
declaration of independence is the

2242
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,560
declaration that there is a collective

2243
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,560
right that we as a people are breaking

2244
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,320
the bonds within other people and we're

2245
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,400
going to take our place our equal

2246
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:20,719
station among the nations of the earth

2247
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:22,399
that for what purpose the purpose is to

2248
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,920
protect individual rights and there's no

2249
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,679
collective right

2250
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,840
your argument is completely circular

2251
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:30,480
you're not allowing the possibility that

2252
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,199
there could be that there could be

2253
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:36,319
great and decent men that you and i both

2254
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:39,279
admire who wanted the independence of

2255
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:41,439
their nation not not because that would

2256
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:44,158
give individuals liberty but because the

2257
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:46,479
independence of their nation was itself

2258
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:47,920
a great good so we clearly disagree on

2259
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:49,359
this because i i don't think the

2260
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,679
independence of the nation is a good in

2261
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:53,519
of itself because it's and this is what

2262
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:55,920
they think it was i don't think they did

2263
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:58,320
i and this is why they tried so hard not

2264
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:01,039
to break from england and and why many

2265
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:03,599
of them when many of them uh

2266
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:05,198
struggled really really struggled with

2267
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,880
with having a revolution because england

2268
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:09,198
was pretty good right english was the

2269
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,079
england was the best and this is where i

2270
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:11,919
you know we should get to the

2271
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:13,679
universality of these things because i i

2272
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:16,158
do think england was the best and

2273
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:18,239
universally and and and absolutely was

2274
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:19,039
the best system out there and what they

2275
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:20,559
were

2276
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:22,238
they struggled to break from england

2277
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,080
because they didn't view

2278
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,158
the value of having a nation as the

2279
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:29,039
primary but what they identified in

2280
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:30,799
england is certain flaws in the system

2281
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:32,719
that created situations in which their

2282
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,279
rights were being violated so they

2283
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:37,760
figured the our only option in order to

2284
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:40,000
secure these rights is to break away

2285
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:43,119
from england and secure nation now i am

2286
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,119
not an anarchist as

2287
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:48,719
i believe you need nations

2288
01:17:46,158 --> 01:17:50,799
you need nations to secure those rights

2289
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:52,239
that is the rights are not you can't

2290
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,560
secure those rights without having a

2291
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:56,879
nation but the nation is just a means to

2292
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,400
an end the end is the rights and i think

2293
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,400
that's how the founders understood it

2294
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,439
and that's why they created this kind of

2295
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:02,960
country

2296
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:07,119
i think this is a good place to ask

2297
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:08,480
about common welfare and cohesion

2298
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:10,640
let me uh

2299
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:13,198
say what john don wrote

2300
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,239
that quote no man is an island entire of

2301
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:16,879
itself

2302
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:18,319
every man is a piece of the continent a

2303
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,600
part of the main

2304
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:22,319
he went on

2305
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:25,600
any man's death diminishes me because i

2306
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:27,679
am involved in mankind and therefore

2307
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,800
never send to know for whom the bell

2308
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,920
tolls

2309
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,960
it tolls for thee

2310
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,119
so

2311
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:37,279
let's talk about individualism

2312
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:40,000
and cohesion

2313
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:41,920
not just the political level but at a

2314
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,359
philosophical level for the human

2315
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,319
condition

2316
01:18:43,359 --> 01:18:48,158
what is central what is the role

2317
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:50,479
of other humans

2318
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:52,000
in our lives what's the importance of

2319
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:52,879
cohesion this is something you've talked

2320
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,840
about

2321
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:58,800
so iran said that the the beauty of the

2322
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:01,520
founding documents is that they create a

2323
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,440
cohesive union that protects

2324
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,080
the individual freedoms

2325
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:07,359
but you have spoken about the value of

2326
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:10,079
the union

2327
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:13,039
the common welfare

2328
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:15,679
the cohesion in itself

2329
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:18,800
so can you maybe elaborate on

2330
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:20,960
what is the role of cohesion and the

2331
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,760
collective not to use that term but

2332
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,079
multiple humans together connected

2333
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,079
in the human condition sure i keep

2334
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:30,559
getting the feeling that euron and i are

2335
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,800
actually having an a disagreement about

2336
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,480
empirical reality because i think that

2337
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,600
enlightenment rationalist political

2338
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:37,919
thought

2339
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,480
features the individual

2340
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,560
it features the state

2341
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:45,439
uh there isn't really a nation other

2342
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:48,239
than the the nation the people is as a

2343
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:49,919
collective is created by the state and

2344
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:52,799
when the state disappears then the

2345
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,640
collective disappears now i think that

2346
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,320
when conservatives

2347
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,560
of all stripes

2348
01:19:56,319 --> 01:20:00,238
look at this kind of thinking that

2349
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,440
there's the individuals and then there's

2350
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:03,678
the state

2351
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:05,359
and there really isn't anything else

2352
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,399
when they look at that

2353
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:09,039
they say

2354
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:11,519
even before you get to consequences it's

2355
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:13,920
a terrible theory because when we try to

2356
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:16,480
understand any field of inquiry any

2357
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:20,719
domain any subject area when you try to

2358
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:22,718
understand it we try to come up with a

2359
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,639
small number of

2360
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:27,119
uh of concepts

2361
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:29,920
and of relations among the concepts

2362
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:32,479
which is supposed to be able to to uh to

2363
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:34,480
explain to illuminate

2364
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:35,678
as much as possible

2365
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:37,119
the important things they're taking

2366
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:38,960
place in the domain

2367
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:41,279
and conservatives look at this

2368
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:44,239
individuals and the state and they say

2369
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:46,319
you're missing most of what's going on

2370
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:48,799
in politics

2371
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:49,920
also in in in personal human relations

2372
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,960
as well

2373
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,079
but

2374
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,679
it it just doesn't look like a

2375
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:55,600
description of human beings it looks

2376
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:56,960
like a completely artificial thing and

2377
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,039
then conservatives say well look if i

2378
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,560
went to adopt this artificial thing then

2379
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:02,560
the consequences are horrific because

2380
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,719
you're not describing reality

2381
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,480
so a conservative reality

2382
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:07,600
uh begins with

2383
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:10,000
um

2384
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:12,079
with an empirical view of what you know

2385
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,679
what are human beings like and and

2386
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:15,519
the first thing you notice about human

2387
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:17,359
beings or at least the first thing i

2388
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,600
think conservatives notice is that

2389
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:21,759
they're sticky is that they clump they

2390
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,760
turn into groups and you take any

2391
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,480
arbitrary collection of

2392
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,639
human beings and set them to a task or

2393
01:21:26,479 --> 01:21:32,000
even just leave them alone

2394
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:33,520
and they they quickly form into groups

2395
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,679
and those groups are always structured

2396
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,880
as hierarchies this is this competition

2397
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,920
within the hierarchy who's you know

2398
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,920
who's going to be the leader who's going

2399
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,079
to be number two but

2400
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,440
there are everywhere you look in human

2401
01:21:42,079 --> 01:21:45,359
societies

2402
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:47,839
universally

2403
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:49,198
there are groups the groups compete and

2404
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,560
they're high and they're structured

2405
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:52,638
internally as hierarchies and then

2406
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,719
they're internal competitions for who

2407
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:56,880
leads the different groups

2408
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:59,279
and when we think about scientific

2409
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,400
explanation we allow that there are

2410
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:01,599
there are different levels of

2411
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:03,679
explanation

2412
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:06,239
that you know a macroscopic object like

2413
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:08,158
a table it doesn't have properties that

2414
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:09,919
are that you know that can be directly

2415
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:11,839
derived from the properties of you know

2416
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:14,560
the atoms or the molecules or the the

2417
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,560
microfibers that make up the table

2418
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,480
and and and that's understood that

2419
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,239
there's what you know

2420
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:21,919
academic philosophers call emergent

2421
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:24,079
properties that when you get up to the

2422
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,440
level of the table it has properties

2423
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:27,279
like you know that you can't put your

2424
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:29,198
fist through it which you can't

2425
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:30,719
necessarily know just by looking at the

2426
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:32,638
atoms alone

2427
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:34,560
and i think conservatives say the same

2428
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:35,840
thing is true for political theory for

2429
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,719
social theory

2430
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,560
that looking at an individual human

2431
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,158
being and thinking about what does that

2432
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:44,480
individual human being

2433
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:46,000
need which euron does very eloquently in

2434
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:48,079
his in his writings

2435
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,960
but that doesn't tell you what the

2436
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:53,439
characteristics are of this

2437
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:55,679
hierarchically structured group as soon

2438
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:58,479
as you have that it has its own

2439
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:00,880
qualities so an example the question of

2440
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:03,279
what holds these groups together and and

2441
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,359
we need to answer that question

2442
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:06,960
i i try to answer it by by saying

2443
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:09,920
there's such a thing as mutual loyalty

2444
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:12,079
mutual loyalty is shorthand for

2445
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:15,199
human beings individuals have the

2446
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:17,439
capacity to include another individual

2447
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:20,319
within their self within within their

2448
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:21,198
conception of their self when two people

2449
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:22,799
do it

2450
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:25,519
it it creates a

2451
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,520
a bond like a like a bond between two

2452
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,639
two atoms creates a molecule that

2453
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:30,239
doesn't mean that they lose their

2454
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,920
individuality they

2455
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:33,839
within the group they they may still

2456
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,840
continue competing with one another but

2457
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:39,679
that doesn't mean that there isn't in

2458
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:42,400
reality a bond and that real bond is is

2459
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:43,600
the stuff of which uh political events

2460
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:45,759
and political

2461
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,760
history are made is the the coming

2462
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:50,239
together the cohesion and the

2463
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,960
dissolution of of of these bonded

2464
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:54,238
loyalty groups that's the reality of of

2465
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,439
politics

2466
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:59,519
and so when i hear these discussions

2467
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:01,919
about individuals in the state

2468
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,920
i feel like we're missing most of the

2469
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,440
reality and in order to understand the

2470
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,199
political reality

2471
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:09,359
we need to understand

2472
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:11,839
what makes human beings coherent to

2473
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:14,319
groups what makes them dissolve what

2474
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:16,000
makes the groups come apart and and end

2475
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:20,000
up creating civil wars and that kind of

2476
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,960
thing i think we also need to know um

2477
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,760
what

2478
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:26,960
in practice um rival groups do come

2479
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:29,280
together and and bond i mean basically

2480
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:32,239
when we think about uh democratic

2481
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:34,639
society we're talking about different

2482
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:36,000
different groups we can call them tribes

2483
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,840
or you can come up with a different name

2484
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,079
but but different different tribal

2485
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:42,239
groupings with different views they come

2486
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:44,719
together to form a nation

2487
01:24:42,238 --> 01:24:46,399
and they're able to do that even though

2488
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:47,359
you know often they they hate each other

2489
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:48,399
you know like

2490
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:50,079
like we were talking about the the

2491
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:52,238
american revolution and often they hate

2492
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:54,559
each other and nevertheless they're able

2493
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:57,279
to come together why how

2494
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,560
and that leads us into questions like

2495
01:24:57,279 --> 01:25:00,880
how does

2496
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,080
honor the giving of honor by one group

2497
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,440
to another

2498
01:25:02,079 --> 01:25:07,840
how does that increase the

2499
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:09,119
the mutual loyalty between groups that

2500
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,079
that are still competing with one

2501
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:12,719
another

2502
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,559
all of these questions i think we have

2503
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:18,319
to answer them in order to be able to

2504
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:21,120
talk about politics and uh and and i i

2505
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:23,039
think the reason the first reason why

2506
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:24,880
why one should approach politics as a

2507
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:26,639
conservative rather than as an

2508
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,719
individual just because it gives us

2509
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,560
gives us these these theoretical tools

2510
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:32,800
to be able to talk about reality which

2511
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,639
we don't have as long as we keep within

2512
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,880
the individual's framework as as you're

2513
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:40,159
talking the metaphor that's popping up

2514
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:42,000
in my mind and this is also something

2515
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:43,119
that uh bothers me with theoretical

2516
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,639
physics

2517
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:46,800
the metaphor is

2518
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:48,719
there's some sense in which there's

2519
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:51,199
things called theories of everything

2520
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:52,639
where you try to uh describe the basic

2521
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:54,719
laws of physics how they interact

2522
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:57,359
together and once you do you have a

2523
01:25:54,719 --> 01:26:00,319
sense that you understand all of reality

2524
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:02,238
in in a sense you do and that to me when

2525
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:04,799
you that to me is understanding the

2526
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:06,559
individual like how the individual

2527
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,360
behaves in this world but then you're

2528
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:12,719
saying that they're hey hey you're also

2529
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:14,319
forgetting chemistry biology how all of

2530
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,600
that actually comes together the

2531
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:18,000
stickiness

2532
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,840
uh the stickiness of molecules and how

2533
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,600
they build different systems and they

2534
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,560
some systems can kill each other some

2535
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:27,440
systems can flourish some can make

2536
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,960
pancakes and bananas and some can make

2537
01:26:27,439 --> 01:26:30,719
poison and all those kinds of things and

2538
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,920
we need to be able to we need to

2539
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,520
consider

2540
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,840
the the full

2541
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,600
stack

2542
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:39,600
of things that are constructed from the

2543
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,480
fundamental basics

2544
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:45,199
um and uh i guess iran you're saying

2545
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:46,479
that no you

2546
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:49,039
you're just like the theoretical

2547
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:52,000
physicist it all starts at the bot like

2548
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:53,439
if you need to preserve the fundamentals

2549
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,920
of reality

2550
01:26:53,439 --> 01:26:57,839
uh which is the individual like the the

2551
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,480
basic atom

2552
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:03,360
of human society is the individual to

2553
01:27:00,479 --> 01:27:06,000
you so yes so the the basic unit the

2554
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:08,399
basic model unit the basic ethical unit

2555
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,079
in society is the individual and yeah of

2556
01:27:08,399 --> 01:27:11,920
course we form groups

2557
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:13,920
and and you can't understand history

2558
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,158
unless you understand group formation

2559
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,840
and group motivation and

2560
01:27:16,158 --> 01:27:19,679
and i have a view about what kind of

2561
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,840
groups should be formed

2562
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:24,560
uh and and politically from a political

2563
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:27,119
perspective voluntary ones ones in which

2564
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:30,080
we we join when we want to join and we

2565
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:33,279
can leave when we want to leave and uh

2566
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:34,238
ones that help us and clearly groups

2567
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:35,359
help us

2568
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:38,559
pursue

2569
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:40,559
whatever it is our goal is ultimately so

2570
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:43,199
so in the pursuit of happiness there are

2571
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,840
lots of groups that one wants the form

2572
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:47,359
whether it's marriage whether it's

2573
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:49,119
businesses whether it's sports teams

2574
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:50,719
whether it's lots of there's lots of

2575
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:53,279
different groups to fund

2576
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:55,359
but the question is what is the standard

2577
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:57,519
of well-being is it the standard well

2578
01:27:55,359 --> 01:27:59,920
being some

2579
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,760
algorithm that maximizes the well-being

2580
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,719
of a group you know some utilitarian

2581
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,400
function

2582
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:05,439
you know is it

2583
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:06,638
uh

2584
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:08,638
is it

2585
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:10,239
something that's inherent in the group

2586
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:11,920
that we can measure

2587
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:14,158
as goodness and to help with individuals

2588
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,920
within as long as we can get that that

2589
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:17,119
the group to function well we don't

2590
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,800
really care about where the individuals

2591
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:21,920
at so to me

2592
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,279
the the the the goal of creating groups

2593
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,639
is the well-being of the individual and

2594
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:26,800
that's why it needs to be voluntary and

2595
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:28,960
that's why there has to be a way out of

2596
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,639
of those sometimes it's costly it's not

2597
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,560
a cheap out that's why you should really

2598
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,319
think about what groups you you you and

2599
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,520
this you know on an issue that's very

2600
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:37,119
controversial

2601
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,199
maybe we can discuss maybe not this is

2602
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:40,960
why to me immigration is so important

2603
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:42,879
right open immigration or free

2604
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,560
immigration is because that's another

2605
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,800
group that i would like people to be

2606
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,880
able to voluntarily choose both in and

2607
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:52,000
out and and i'd like to see people be

2608
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,920
able to go and join that group that

2609
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,439
you know that they believe will allow

2610
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,440
for the pursuit of happiness but let me

2611
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:59,119
say that you know

2612
01:28:57,439 --> 01:29:00,960
that's a description of an idea what i'm

2613
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:03,198
just saying right i recognize that

2614
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:05,359
that's not the reality in which we live

2615
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:07,439
i recognize that that's not a reality in

2616
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:09,679
which history history

2617
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:11,599
you know recognizing that such a that

2618
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:13,840
the individual exists in a sense

2619
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:14,960
philosophically is a massive achievement

2620
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,800
right uh

2621
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,760
you know human beings however they

2622
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,360
evolved clearly we started out in in a

2623
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,520
in a tribal context in which the

2624
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:26,000
individual did matter we followed the

2625
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:28,080
leader the competition was for power

2626
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,719
power over the group and and and

2627
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:32,960
dictates how the group should work uh

2628
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:35,119
you know it the the history of human

2629
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:37,359
beings is a history of gaining knowledge

2630
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:39,679
and part of the knowledge is

2631
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:41,679
the value of an individual and you can

2632
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:44,158
see that in in in religion you can see

2633
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,920
that in philosophy you can see that uh

2634
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:47,119
through the evolution and then

2635
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,359
you know uh

2636
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:50,238
we we evolved from tribes into nations

2637
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:52,238
and then

2638
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:54,559
empires and conflicts between nations

2639
01:29:52,238 --> 01:29:56,238
and conflict within empires and we tried

2640
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,080
a lot of different things if you will i

2641
01:29:56,238 --> 01:30:00,399
don't think we always did on purpose but

2642
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:02,559
uh we kind of did different philosophies

2643
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:04,158
different sets of ideas drove us towards

2644
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:06,320
different

2645
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:08,719
collectives different groupings and and

2646
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:11,359
different ways in which to structure

2647
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:13,600
and after i don't know 3000 years of

2648
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:15,039
kind of known history uh this history

2649
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,280
before that but we don't know much about

2650
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:19,039
it 3000 years of known history you can

2651
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:20,880
sit back and evaluate

2652
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:22,880
and and i think that's what that's what

2653
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,639
is done in the enlightenment and and and

2654
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,199
you sit back and suddenly we can do it

2655
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:28,560
today we can sit back and evaluate what

2656
01:30:27,198 --> 01:30:30,319
promotes human flourishing and what

2657
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,159
doesn't and what do we mean by human

2658
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:33,198
flourishing human who's who's

2659
01:30:32,158 --> 01:30:35,599
flourishing

2660
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:36,960
well individual human beings now

2661
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,800
since i don't believe in a zero-sum

2662
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,960
world and the world is not zero summit

2663
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,400
we can see that it's it's empirically

2664
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,319
possible to show that the world is not a

2665
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:47,119
zero-sum game my fl human flourishing

2666
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:48,479
doesn't come at your expense so i i you

2667
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:49,679
know i can show that a system that

2668
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:50,959
promotes my flourishing will probably

2669
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:52,960
promote your flourishing as well and

2670
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:55,198
promotes the general welfare in that

2671
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:56,560
sense because it promotes

2672
01:30:55,198 --> 01:30:58,399
individuals

2673
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,320
flourishing and we can we can look at

2674
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:02,319
all these

2675
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:04,238
examples of how we evolved and what

2676
01:31:02,319 --> 01:31:06,559
leads to bloodshed and what doesn't and

2677
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:08,238
and and what promotes this ability to

2678
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,760
flourish as an individual again an

2679
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:10,959
achievement the idea of individual

2680
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,960
flourishing

2681
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:15,279
and then we can think about how to

2682
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,800
create a political system around that a

2683
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:19,759
political system

2684
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:22,000
that recognizes and allows for the

2685
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,480
formation of groups but just under the

2686
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,238
principle of voluntary so you can't be

2687
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,399
forced to join a group you you can't be

2688
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:30,399
cursed into forming a group

2689
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,319
um other than the fact that you're born

2690
01:31:30,399 --> 01:31:34,000
in a particular place in a particular

2691
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:35,519
you know that in a sense but that's not

2692
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,920
force that's there's a difference

2693
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,280
between metaphysics and between choices

2694
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,679
so this is something that came up in the

2695
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:43,439
debate that yoram said that not all

2696
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:45,840
human relations are voluntary and you

2697
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:48,479
kind of emphasize that a lot of

2698
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:51,840
where we are is not voluntary we're

2699
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:54,959
grounded we're connected in so much so

2700
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,719
how how can a human be free

2701
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,719
in the way you're describing individual

2702
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:01,198
be free if

2703
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:03,119
uh some part of who we are is not

2704
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:05,439
voluntary some part of who we are is

2705
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:08,000
other people well because what do we

2706
01:32:05,439 --> 01:32:10,238
mean by freedom freedom doesn't mean

2707
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:13,198
and the negation of the laws of physics

2708
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:14,479
right freedom doesn't mean uh ignoring

2709
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:17,359
um

2710
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:18,879
freedom means the the ability within the

2711
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:21,279
scope of what's available for you to

2712
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,960
choose being able to choose those things

2713
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:24,079
um so

2714
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:27,198
in in

2715
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:29,439
in a political context vita means uh uh

2716
01:32:27,198 --> 01:32:32,238
you know the negate the the absence of

2717
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:33,919
coercion uh so once you're an adult

2718
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:35,439
uh you know you almost says you're born

2719
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,119
with a particular into a particular

2720
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:38,399
religious context absolutely but once

2721
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:39,920
you're an adult i think it's incumbent

2722
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:42,238
on you to evaluate that religious

2723
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:44,719
context and and and look at different

2724
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:47,039
religions or non-religion or whatever

2725
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:49,119
and choose your philosophy of life

2726
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:51,039
choose your values choose how you want

2727
01:32:49,119 --> 01:32:52,158
to live your life that's the freedom the

2728
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:54,960
freedom is

2729
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:57,439
one one system says uh

2730
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,920
you're either cursed by the state of

2731
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:02,238
course by the group occurs by society

2732
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:03,440
around you to follow a particular path

2733
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:05,039
or your

2734
01:33:03,439 --> 01:33:07,439
your uh

2735
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:10,000
the expectation is the demand is the the

2736
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:12,799
pressure is to conform to a particular

2737
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,639
path and my view is no you you should be

2738
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:17,119
in a position to be able to choose your

2739
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:18,719
path and and that choice means you look

2740
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:20,960
around

2741
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:23,279
you you you evaluate you evaluate

2742
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:24,800
history based on knowledge based on on

2743
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:26,559
all of these things and you choose what

2744
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,560
that path would be that's

2745
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:30,719
fundamentally what what freedom means

2746
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:33,039
yes you cannot choose your parents but

2747
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:34,319
of course not no nobody would claim that

2748
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:36,560
that's what's in the scope of what is

2749
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:38,639
possible i think that i think the

2750
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:40,000
coercion freedom

2751
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:42,880
dichotomy

2752
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,119
these are too few concepts coercion and

2753
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,639
freedom it's too simplistic to be able

2754
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:47,519
to describe what we're actually dealing

2755
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:48,840
with

2756
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,280
the traditional

2757
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,239
anglo-conservative view

2758
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:53,119
is

2759
01:33:52,238 --> 01:33:54,959
that

2760
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:57,279
society has to be

2761
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:58,480
it has to be ordered it has to be

2762
01:33:57,279 --> 01:33:59,359
disciplined

2763
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:01,599
and

2764
01:33:59,359 --> 01:34:03,198
there are two choices for how it can can

2765
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:07,600
be ordered

2766
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:10,158
one is that a people is uh by its own

2767
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,320
traditions you would say voluntarily but

2768
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:13,839
these are mostly inherited traditions by

2769
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:18,000
its own traditions

2770
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:20,480
it is uh it it is ordered for example

2771
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:23,359
people just in general will not go into

2772
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:24,879
somebody else's yard because that that's

2773
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:26,238
the custom here is we don't go into

2774
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:28,400
somebody else's yard without their

2775
01:34:26,238 --> 01:34:30,479
permission and so fortescue we're

2776
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:33,439
talking about you know 500 years ago

2777
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:36,000
already so fortiscue says that the

2778
01:34:33,439 --> 01:34:38,960
genius of the english people is that our

2779
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:41,520
government can be mild and apply very

2780
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:43,600
little coercion because the people are

2781
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:44,800
so disciplined now when he says the

2782
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:47,199
people are so disciplined what he's

2783
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,119
saying is is that

2784
01:34:47,198 --> 01:34:52,079
that our art

2785
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:55,359
our nation our tribes we have strong

2786
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:57,600
traditions which channel people you know

2787
01:34:55,359 --> 01:34:59,679
through through tools of being honored

2788
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,920
and dishonored now

2789
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:04,560
that's a reality that exists in every

2790
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:06,000
society and it's it's not captured by

2791
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:09,039
your distinction between coercion and

2792
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,760
lack of coercion when it when when i'm

2793
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:14,560
going to be dishonored if if i don't if

2794
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:16,719
i don't care for for from from my aging

2795
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,880
mother i'm not being coerced like the

2796
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:21,198
state comes and puts a gun to my head i

2797
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:23,279
but but i am being pressured

2798
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:24,960
i'm given guidelines but i'm saying

2799
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:27,118
that's wrong and i'm saying that's

2800
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:31,118
dangerous because

2801
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:33,439
because that could easily be used

2802
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:34,960
for bad tradition

2803
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:36,559
but that's what's the standard by which

2804
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,480
we evaluate what a good tradition is

2805
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:40,320
about you you're the english you're

2806
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:42,158
getting to the standard too wait wait

2807
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:44,960
you're getting to the standard too fast

2808
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:46,799
first i want to know factually is it

2809
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,239
true that all societies work like this

2810
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,760
because if it's true that all societies

2811
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:51,439
work like this then saying saying we

2812
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,480
should be free from it is is just a

2813
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:54,000
fantasy

2814
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:55,919
so a i don't think all societies work

2815
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,158
like this i think much of what happened

2816
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:59,440
in america post-founding in the 19th

2817
01:35:58,158 --> 01:36:01,679
century didn't work like that i think

2818
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:03,279
that's the genius of america and i think

2819
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:05,039
what happened during the 19th century in

2820
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:07,840
the industrial revolution what happened

2821
01:36:05,039 --> 01:36:09,279
in in in the 19th century to some extent

2822
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:11,360
globally but certainly in the united

2823
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:13,439
states didn't work that way it broke

2824
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:15,118
tradition i think i think all innovation

2825
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:17,678
breaks tradition and i think that's what

2826
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:19,279
the genius of of this country is and and

2827
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:20,880
the post-enlightenment

2828
01:36:19,279 --> 01:36:23,519
uh world is

2829
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:25,760
uh i think pre that tradition they work

2830
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,280
that way and then the question is that

2831
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,000
people understand why they do what they

2832
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:31,519
do

2833
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,359
that is i don't want people doing what i

2834
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:35,440
think is right

2835
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:37,599
just because i think it's right and i've

2836
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:39,118
i you know and i've created a society in

2837
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,639
which yeah

2838
01:36:39,118 --> 01:36:42,000
yeah okay

2839
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,279
you know somebody founded this country

2840
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,560
in a particular way so we're just gonna

2841
01:36:43,279 --> 01:36:46,000
follow i want people to understand what

2842
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,920
they're doing so i want people to have a

2843
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,920
respect for property not because it's a

2844
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:53,118
tradition but because they understand

2845
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,800
the value of a respect for property um i

2846
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:56,559
i want people not to murder one another

2847
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:58,159
not because there's a commandment that

2848
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:01,119
shall not murder but because they have

2849
01:36:58,158 --> 01:37:04,079
an understanding of why murdering is bad

2850
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:05,359
and wrong and and bad for them and bad

2851
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:08,000
for the kind of world that they want to

2852
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:10,399
live in that's and i think that's what

2853
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,880
we achieve through enlightenment through

2854
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:16,799
education through through in and where

2855
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:18,960
we don't treat people just as a a blob

2856
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,960
tribe that just follows orders but we

2857
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:22,800
now treat individuals as capable of

2858
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,679
thinking for themselves capable for

2859
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:28,880
discovering truth capable of of of

2860
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:31,118
figuring out their own values and and

2861
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:32,880
that's the big break between and this is

2862
01:37:31,118 --> 01:37:34,799
why you know this is the break i think

2863
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,960
that the declaration represents

2864
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,639
the break between society that is based

2865
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,158
on tradition following commandments

2866
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:41,679
following rules

2867
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:43,839
because they are the rules because they

2868
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:46,158
are the commandments and a society where

2869
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:48,239
individuals understand those rules

2870
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:50,158
understand yes it's now become a

2871
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:51,599
tradition let's say to respect

2872
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:53,359
individual right to respect property

2873
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,960
rights but it's they're not following it

2874
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:56,559
because it's a tradition they're

2875
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,039
following it because they understand

2876
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:02,000
what it is about it that that that makes

2877
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:04,238
it good so that's the world i think that

2878
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,520
that we were on the process of evolving

2879
01:38:04,238 --> 01:38:07,279
towards

2880
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,119
and that is what got destroyed in the

2881
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:11,118
20th century and and

2882
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:12,719
certainly disappeared today and i think

2883
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:14,238
that's the great tragedy is that we're

2884
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:15,439
evolving to a place where people

2885
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:17,519
understood

2886
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:18,799
the values the rep

2887
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:20,560
that represent and of course the the

2888
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,520
danger with tradition is

2889
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:23,600
it

2890
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:25,199
i mean we'll agree right it's it's it's

2891
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,960
yeah it's it's okay to kill the jew

2892
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:29,439
right or it's okay to steal people's

2893
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:31,840
property if there are a certain color

2894
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:33,039
okay to enslave those are all traditions

2895
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,800
and yet

2896
01:38:33,039 --> 01:38:37,519
once you stop and say but what are they

2897
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:38,560
based on what's or is this right is this

2898
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:41,280
just

2899
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:43,360
based on some moral law

2900
01:38:41,279 --> 01:38:45,118
no it's not there's something wrong here

2901
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:46,960
we can't achieve happiness and success

2902
01:38:45,118 --> 01:38:49,198
if we follow these you're talking about

2903
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:51,118
reason and tradition but i think i would

2904
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:54,079
love to sort of linger on the on the

2905
01:38:51,118 --> 01:38:56,399
stickiness of humans that you described

2906
01:38:54,079 --> 01:38:59,118
uh so you kind of said this primary the

2907
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:01,118
individuals is primary i know as a great

2908
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:02,238
invention but to me it's not at all

2909
01:39:01,118 --> 01:39:04,079
obvious

2910
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:05,118
that somehow

2911
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:08,399
that

2912
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:10,319
uh the invention that humans have been

2913
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:13,118
practicing for a

2914
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:14,479
very long time of the stickiness

2915
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:17,198
of uh

2916
01:39:14,479 --> 01:39:19,039
of community of family

2917
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:21,439
of love

2918
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:22,800
it's that's that's not obvious to me

2919
01:39:21,439 --> 01:39:24,839
that's that's

2920
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:28,320
not also fundamental to human

2921
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:30,239
flourishing and should be celebrated

2922
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:33,118
and protected

2923
01:39:30,238 --> 01:39:36,479
now the i suppose the argument you're

2924
01:39:33,118 --> 01:39:37,599
making is uh when you start to let

2925
01:39:36,479 --> 01:39:39,759
the state

2926
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:41,760
define what the stickiness how the

2927
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:44,320
stickiness looks between humans so

2928
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:45,840
you're really like the voluntary aspect

2929
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:48,559
but i just want to

2930
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:50,480
sort of the the the observation is

2931
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:53,039
humans seem to

2932
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:55,839
be pretty happy when they form

2933
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:58,479
communities uh uh however you define

2934
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:00,960
that it's a romantic partnership family

2935
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:02,238
communities some communities people

2936
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,439
people are miserable in other

2937
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:05,599
communities so the nature of the

2938
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:08,079
community matters right we know this we

2939
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:10,000
know that that some bondings are not

2940
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:12,238
healthy and not good for the individuals

2941
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,760
involved and they don't thrive

2942
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:17,279
um so i i absolutely i mean i'm a lover

2943
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,639
not a fighter right so i'm a huge

2944
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:20,399
believer in love

2945
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:22,480
the whole philosophy i think is

2946
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:25,359
is a love-based philosophy i fight in

2947
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:27,439
order to love right so it's it's love is

2948
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:29,920
love is at the core of all of this and

2949
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:32,079
it's it's it's it's a love of of life

2950
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:34,239
it's a love of of the world out there

2951
01:40:32,079 --> 01:40:36,960
and it's a love of other people because

2952
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:40,638
they represent a value to you

2953
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:43,039
so the stickiness is there it's it's you

2954
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:44,880
know my point is a it should be chosen

2955
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:46,560
it should be consciously chosen and and

2956
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,880
this is i'm put aside the state forget

2957
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:50,880
the state for a minute forget forget cos

2958
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:53,279
and forget all that

2959
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:55,679
what i would encourage individuals to do

2960
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:57,759
and this is where you know i'm i'm not

2961
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:59,520
primarily a political for you know

2962
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,440
interested in politics although

2963
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,199
i sent to talk most about that i'm

2964
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:05,759
primarily interested in human beings and

2965
01:41:03,198 --> 01:41:08,399
how they live in a sense in morality and

2966
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:10,880
what i would urge individuals to do

2967
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:13,439
is to think about their relationships to

2968
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:16,000
choose the best relationships possible

2969
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:17,439
but to seek out great relationships

2970
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,439
because other human beings are an

2971
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:20,719
immense value to us

2972
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:22,719
and and

2973
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:24,480
you know when i write

2974
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:26,000
you know maybe you don't quoted this or

2975
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:27,678
not but i write that

2976
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,118
you know about the trade principle and

2977
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:31,679
trading

2978
01:41:29,118 --> 01:41:33,599
you know it's easy and and obvious to

2979
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:36,319
think of it as a materialistic kind of

2980
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,679
thing you know i get you know uh i i do

2981
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:39,519
the chose this day and my wife does the

2982
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:41,199
chose the other day we're trading but

2983
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,880
trading is much more subtle than that

2984
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:44,638
and much more can be much more spiritual

2985
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:47,440
than that it's about

2986
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:49,440
the the the the the trading in in

2987
01:41:47,439 --> 01:41:52,479
emotions it's about it's about the the

2988
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:54,799
way one uh sees each other what one gets

2989
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:57,439
from one another i think friendship is a

2990
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:59,360
form of trade now i know that that seems

2991
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:01,519
to make it material but i don't i don't

2992
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:03,679
think it's of trade as a material thing

2993
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,280
but friendship is incredibly important

2994
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:06,319
in life love is incredibly important in

2995
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:07,118
life

2996
01:42:06,319 --> 01:42:08,880
you know

2997
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:10,639
having having a group of friends is

2998
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:13,359
incredibly important all of these are

2999
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:15,440
sticky and important okay how can i try

3000
01:42:13,359 --> 01:42:18,000
to be eloquent on this so

3001
01:42:15,439 --> 01:42:20,319
if you give people freedom

3002
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,679
if you give people politics yeah well

3003
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:25,599
not politics relations relations uh

3004
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:27,039
relationships so

3005
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:28,639
this is interesting because we have an

3006
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:30,719
interesting dynamic going on here in

3007
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:34,400
terms of beliefs they're differing and

3008
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:36,880
so there's interesting overlaps but

3009
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:38,479
there's a worry if you look at human

3010
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:41,199
history and you study the lessons of

3011
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:43,519
history and you look at modern society

3012
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:45,599
if you give people freedom in terms of

3013
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,400
stickiness and human relations and so on

3014
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,719
full

3015
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:50,319
like if you not give people freedom

3016
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:53,439
emphasize

3017
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:56,479
freedom as the highest ideal

3018
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:58,719
you start getting more tender online

3019
01:42:56,479 --> 01:43:01,118
dating the stickiness dissolves just

3020
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:04,000
like in chemistry you start to have a

3021
01:43:01,118 --> 01:43:05,920
gas versus a liquid right that that's

3022
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,960
the way so you have to what you have to

3023
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:10,560
study

3024
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:12,158
what actually happens if you emphasize

3025
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:15,199
that

3026
01:43:12,158 --> 01:43:17,839
the stickiness the bonds of humans

3027
01:43:15,198 --> 01:43:19,759
is holding you back the exercise of

3028
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,679
voluntary choice

3029
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:24,800
is the highest ideal

3030
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:27,520
the danger of that is for that to be

3031
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:30,560
implemented or interpreted in certain

3032
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:32,560
kinds of ways by us flawed humans that

3033
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,159
are not i mean you could say we're

3034
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,600
perfectly reasonable and rational we can

3035
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:38,479
think through all of our decisions but

3036
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:40,400
really i mean especially you're young

3037
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:41,039
you get horny you make decisions that

3038
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:44,079
are

3039
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:46,319
suboptimal perhaps so the the point is

3040
01:43:44,079 --> 01:43:49,118
you have to look at reality

3041
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:51,920
of when you emphasize different things

3042
01:43:49,118 --> 01:43:54,399
so when you when you talk about what is

3043
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:55,920
the ideal life what is the ideal

3044
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:57,599
relations you have to also think like

3045
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:00,158
what are you emphasizing i think you

3046
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:02,480
both agree on what's important uh that

3047
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:04,079
community can be important that freedom

3048
01:44:02,479 --> 01:44:05,359
is important but what are you

3049
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:07,840
emphasizing and you're really

3050
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:10,719
emphasizing the individual and

3051
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:12,960
you're emphasizing uh your arm you're

3052
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:13,840
emphasizing

3053
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,560
more

3054
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:18,560
of the community of the family of the

3055
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:20,800
stickiness of the nation

3056
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:24,000
well look i don't want to deny the place

3057
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,880
of the individual i i think that

3058
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,760
uh

3059
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:28,000
that

3060
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,960
there really is a very great

3061
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,118
change in civilization

3062
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:34,800
when the books of moses

3063
01:44:33,118 --> 01:44:36,799
announced that

3064
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,320
the individual is created in the image

3065
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:40,639
of god

3066
01:44:38,319 --> 01:44:42,799
that that's a step that's

3067
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:44,880
as far as we know without pr precedent

3068
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:48,159
before that in history

3069
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:49,840
and uh to a very large degree i mean one

3070
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:52,799
of the kind of unspoken

3071
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:54,800
uh things going on is that that uh

3072
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:57,360
euron and i really do agree on all sorts

3073
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:59,760
of things i i think in part because

3074
01:44:57,359 --> 01:45:02,479
because we're we're both jewish and he

3075
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:04,800
said you just say you're on his mo

3076
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:07,039
basically moses yesterday

3077
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:09,279
no i said he was channeling moses but

3078
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:10,479
that's still in my book you know that

3079
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:12,559
that's still pretty pretty that's a

3080
01:45:10,479 --> 01:45:13,439
compliment that's pretty good

3081
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:15,119
that

3082
01:45:13,439 --> 01:45:16,319
for me that's a compliment we'll talk

3083
01:45:15,118 --> 01:45:17,839
about this a little bit just for the

3084
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:20,960
listener just so they

3085
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:23,279
they know iran amongst many things we'll

3086
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:24,399
talk about the virtue of nationalism but

3087
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:26,399
uh

3088
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:28,799
you're also a religious scholar of sorts

3089
01:45:26,399 --> 01:45:31,839
or at least uh leverage

3090
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:33,760
the bible for much not much but some of

3091
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,440
the wisdom in your life

3092
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:38,239
look the way that euron looks at

3093
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:40,479
enlightenment or maybe at ayn rand that

3094
01:45:38,238 --> 01:45:43,279
that that's that's the way that i see

3095
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:45,839
the uh hebrew scripture and and the

3096
01:45:43,279 --> 01:45:48,319
tradition that comes from it uh it has

3097
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:49,360
the same kind of place in my life and i

3098
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:51,359
i just

3099
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:54,399
i don't know how much we want to

3100
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:56,000
want to explore it but i i i think that

3101
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:59,118
uh that

3102
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:01,118
the agreement that we do have about the

3103
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:03,519
positive value of

3104
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:07,359
the creative individual the positive

3105
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:10,800
value of the individual's um desire to

3106
01:46:07,359 --> 01:46:12,479
improve the world and and and and

3107
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:16,079
in my book that means

3108
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:18,799
including his or her desire to improve

3109
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:21,039
his family his his his tribe his

3110
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:23,039
congregation his nation

3111
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:24,479
but but it still comes from this kind of

3112
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:25,920
for you know what your own calls

3113
01:46:24,479 --> 01:46:27,839
selfishness

3114
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,960
the the desire to make things better for

3115
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:32,719
yourself

3116
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:34,639
in hebrew bible and in judaism

3117
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:37,039
that just is a positive thing of course

3118
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:39,359
it can be taken too far but it just is

3119
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:40,639
positive and it doesn't carry these

3120
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:42,319
kinds of

3121
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:43,840
uh you know you should turn the other

3122
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:45,519
cheek you should give away your cloak

3123
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:47,520
you should love your enemy these kinds

3124
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:51,040
of christian tropes do not exist in

3125
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:52,880
judaism and so it just i i like

3126
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:54,800
listening to your iran's i do feel like

3127
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,800
he goes too far on various things but

3128
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:59,119
but i also hear you know underneath that

3129
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:01,440
i can sort of you know hear hear the the

3130
01:46:59,118 --> 01:47:02,559
the jewish current and the resistance to

3131
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:04,238
you know to

3132
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:06,719
uh to things that

3133
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:08,879
about christianity the jews often find

3134
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:10,480
can ask you a question there

3135
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,960
uh can you make

3136
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:15,039
an argument for turn the other cheek

3137
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:16,319
no i i tend to

3138
01:47:15,039 --> 01:47:18,719
i guess you would equate that with

3139
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:21,359
altruism

3140
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:24,000
i tend to uh injustice

3141
01:47:21,359 --> 01:47:25,118
it's unjustified now that you all right

3142
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,800
um

3143
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:29,039
okay so yourself if you're turning

3144
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:30,880
another cheek it's it's a lack of love

3145
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:33,920
lack of self-respect well let me push

3146
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:36,239
back on that because i'm uh i i like

3147
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:37,279
turn the other cheek um especially on

3148
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:38,319
twitter

3149
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:39,039
uh

3150
01:47:38,319 --> 01:47:41,599
so

3151
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:43,920
i like i i like block the offender on

3152
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,920
twitter

3153
01:47:44,238 --> 01:47:49,279
no what

3154
01:47:46,238 --> 01:47:51,359
uh so twitter aside is more like your

3155
01:47:49,279 --> 01:47:52,960
you um

3156
01:47:51,359 --> 01:47:54,639
you're investing in the long-term

3157
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,600
version of yourself versus the short

3158
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:57,520
term

3159
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:59,280
so that that's the way i think about it

3160
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:00,639
it's like the energy you put on to the

3161
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:02,880
world the turning out of the cheek

3162
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:05,199
philosophy allows you to walk through

3163
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:07,039
the fire gracefully

3164
01:48:05,198 --> 01:48:10,000
in some sense i mean perhaps you would

3165
01:48:07,039 --> 01:48:12,158
reframe that as not a

3166
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,520
uh then that that's not being altruistic

3167
01:48:12,158 --> 01:48:15,839
or whatever but

3168
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:18,400
there there is something pragmatic about

3169
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:20,480
that kind of approach to life uh

3170
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:23,359
disciplining yourself so that you become

3171
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:25,439
a better version of yourself i mean i i

3172
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:27,679
not not only do we agree but you know i

3173
01:48:25,439 --> 01:48:30,000
think i think every religious and

3174
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:32,560
philosophical tradition probably has a

3175
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,960
version of that even even kant who we

3176
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:36,800
join together in finding to be terrible

3177
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,399
even kant makes that distinction between

3178
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:40,000
the short-term interest and long-term

3179
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:42,000
interest so i

3180
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,600
i i think that's universal i don't know

3181
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,359
of anybody who's really disagreeing

3182
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:47,679
about that the thing that we were

3183
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:49,599
talking about a couple of minutes ago

3184
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:52,079
before we got onto this tangent is the

3185
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:55,119
relationship between the the

3186
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:57,600
individual who is in the image of god

3187
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:58,639
and and is of of

3188
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:00,880
uh

3189
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:02,560
a value as an individual

3190
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:03,279
nevertheless there's this question about

3191
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:06,639
what

3192
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:08,479
what is what is good for that person

3193
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:09,760
and and and also what makes them happy

3194
01:49:08,479 --> 01:49:11,359
i'm not sure that those are exactly the

3195
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:13,840
same things but they're they're they're

3196
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:15,198
both certainly uh relevant and

3197
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:18,960
important

3198
01:49:15,198 --> 01:49:20,479
and um i i i feel like i mean i think

3199
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,800
we're beginning to uncover this

3200
01:49:20,479 --> 01:49:24,238
empirical disagreement about what it is

3201
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:25,599
that's good for the individual and what

3202
01:49:24,238 --> 01:49:28,559
it is that makes them happy and i'll go

3203
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:31,360
back to something i raised um i i raised

3204
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:34,880
in the debate which is uh this uh this

3205
01:49:31,359 --> 01:49:36,559
theory of durkheim that now has been uh

3206
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:40,159
popularized by

3207
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:42,880
uh by jordan peterson but um

3208
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:44,079
durkheim argues that

3209
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:45,520
that

3210
01:49:44,079 --> 01:49:47,039
the

3211
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:48,480
he's writing a book on suicide he's

3212
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:50,880
trying to understand what what brings

3213
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:52,959
individuals to suicide and he coins this

3214
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,560
term anomi

3215
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,639
lack of law

3216
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:57,760
and the argument is that

3217
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:59,118
uh that

3218
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,280
individuals

3219
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:03,039
basically are

3220
01:50:01,279 --> 01:50:06,079
healthy and happy

3221
01:50:03,039 --> 01:50:07,840
when they find their place in uh in a

3222
01:50:06,079 --> 01:50:10,319
hierarchy within a loyalty group in a

3223
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:12,639
certain place in a hierarchy they

3224
01:50:10,319 --> 01:50:14,399
compete and struggle in order to rise in

3225
01:50:12,639 --> 01:50:16,319
the hierarchy but they know

3226
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:17,759
where they are they know who they are

3227
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,519
the kids today like to say they know

3228
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:22,400
what their identity is

3229
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:25,119
because they associate themselves

3230
01:50:22,399 --> 01:50:26,879
their self expands to take on you know

3231
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:28,960
the leadership the different layers the

3232
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:30,560
past and the future of this this

3233
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:32,719
particular hierarchy and i completely

3234
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:35,840
agree with iran that some of these

3235
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:37,679
hierarchies are are pernicious and

3236
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:39,119
oppressive

3237
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:40,319
and and terrible and some of them are

3238
01:50:39,118 --> 01:50:43,359
better

3239
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:46,960
what what we might disagree about is

3240
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:49,519
that that you can find um human beings

3241
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:51,599
who are are capable of

3242
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:54,080
becoming healthy and happy

3243
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:55,920
off by themselves without participating

3244
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:58,960
in in in this kind of structure the

3245
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:01,760
minute that you accept if you accept

3246
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:04,560
that this is empirical reality but human

3247
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:07,039
beings it it's it's an iron law you

3248
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:08,719
can't you can't do anything you you can

3249
01:51:07,039 --> 01:51:11,599
tell you human beings that they can be

3250
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:13,520
free of all constraints all you want and

3251
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:16,400
you can get them to do

3252
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:18,639
things that that as you say dissolve

3253
01:51:16,399 --> 01:51:20,000
dissolve their pl they can have contempt

3254
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:21,840
for hierarchies they can say i'm not

3255
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
gonna i'm not gonna serve the man i'm

3256
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,159
gonna you know i i'm just gonna burn

3257
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,639
them all down you can you can

3258
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:30,000
get them to say all get kids to say all

3259
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:32,000
these things you can get them either to

3260
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,479
be marxists who are

3261
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,560
were actively trying to overthrow and

3262
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:38,158
destroy the existing hierarchies or you

3263
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,599
can make them some kind of liberal where

3264
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:41,920
they basically pretend the hierarchies

3265
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:43,440
don't exist they just act like that that

3266
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:45,840
they're not there

3267
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:47,759
in both cases and it's not coincidence

3268
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:49,920
that that's what universities teach is

3269
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:53,520
your choice is either marxist revolution

3270
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:56,158
or liberal ignoring of the hierarchies

3271
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:58,719
in both cases what you've done is you've

3272
01:51:56,158 --> 01:52:01,279
eliminated the possibility that the

3273
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:03,198
young person will be able to

3274
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:05,679
find his or her

3275
01:52:03,198 --> 01:52:08,079
place in a way that allows them to grow

3276
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:10,319
and exercise their their their their

3277
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:12,719
love their drive their their creativity

3278
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:14,799
in order to to advance something

3279
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:17,760
constructive you've eliminated it and

3280
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:21,760
you've put the burden on them

3281
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:24,560
you know kind of a niche burden to uh to

3282
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,679
just be the fountain of all values

3283
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,840
yourself

3284
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:28,719
which you know maybe some people can do

3285
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,719
it

3286
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:33,198
but almost no one can do it and i think

3287
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:34,719
that's empirically true and so i i think

3288
01:52:33,198 --> 01:52:37,039
by telling them

3289
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:38,639
about their freedom rather than telling

3290
01:52:37,039 --> 01:52:41,039
them about how

3291
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:42,079
about the the need to join into some

3292
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:43,920
some

3293
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:45,519
uh traditionalist hierarchy that can be

3294
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:47,440
good and healthy for them

3295
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:49,280
i think we're destroying them i think

3296
01:52:47,439 --> 01:52:52,799
we're destroying this generation and the

3297
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:57,439
last one and the next euron is the

3298
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:59,279
burden of freedom destroying mankind

3299
01:52:57,439 --> 01:53:01,678
what freedom i mean uh

3300
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:03,759
how many people are indeed free the the

3301
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:06,079
look the problem is that we we were

3302
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,360
caught up on political concepts

3303
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:10,559
and we we've

3304
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:11,759
we're moving into uh uh ethical issues

3305
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:13,360
and and

3306
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,480
i i don't think it's right to tell

3307
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:16,000
people

3308
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:17,598
you're free go do whatever the hell you

3309
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,000
want

3310
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:22,079
just just use your emotions you know

3311
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,439
just just go where you want to go

3312
01:53:22,079 --> 01:53:25,039
you know in the spur of the moment think

3313
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:27,359
short term don't think long term or

3314
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:29,840
don't think why think

3315
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:32,479
one has to provide moral guidance

3316
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:34,159
and and and morality here is crucial and

3317
01:53:32,479 --> 01:53:36,399
crucially important

3318
01:53:34,158 --> 01:53:39,198
and part of taking responsibility for

3319
01:53:36,399 --> 01:53:40,399
your own life is establishing a moral

3320
01:53:39,198 --> 01:53:43,118
framework

3321
01:53:40,399 --> 01:53:44,879
for your life and and what does it mean

3322
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:46,479
to live a good life i mean that's much

3323
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:48,560
more important in a sense

3324
01:53:46,479 --> 01:53:51,359
of a question and it is

3325
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:54,800
it is my belief that people can do that

3326
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:56,479
they can find and choose the values

3327
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:58,400
necessary to achieve a good life but

3328
01:53:56,479 --> 01:54:00,399
they need guidance they need guidance

3329
01:53:58,399 --> 01:54:02,319
this is why religion evolved in my view

3330
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:04,399
because people need guidance so so so

3331
01:54:02,319 --> 01:54:06,158
that says you know i had called religion

3332
01:54:04,399 --> 01:54:07,920
a primitive foreign philosophy it was

3333
01:54:06,158 --> 01:54:10,238
the original philosophy that provided

3334
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:12,158
people with some guidance about what to

3335
01:54:10,238 --> 01:54:13,919
do and what not to do and

3336
01:54:12,158 --> 01:54:16,000
secular philosophy is supposed to do the

3337
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:18,480
same and the problem is

3338
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:21,520
that i think religion and

3339
01:54:18,479 --> 01:54:22,479
99 of secular philosophy give people bad

3340
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:24,480
advice

3341
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:28,319
about what to do and therefore they do

3342
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:31,279
bad stuff and and some of that sometimes

3343
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:32,639
uh you know because uh uh when they do

3344
01:54:31,279 --> 01:54:35,359
good stuff it gets reinforced that we

3345
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:37,599
survive in spite of that but uh ideas

3346
01:54:35,359 --> 01:54:40,238
like kant and hegel and and mocks and so

3347
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:41,760
on give young people awful advice about

3348
01:54:40,238 --> 01:54:44,079
how to live and what to do and as a

3349
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:45,840
consequence really bad stuff happens and

3350
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:47,599
the world in which we exist today which

3351
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:48,960
we agree

3352
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:50,800
there's a lot of

3353
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:53,118
pathologies to it a lot of bad stuff

3354
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:55,119
going on in my views going the wrong way

3355
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:58,880
in my view a product

3356
01:54:55,118 --> 01:55:01,039
of of of a set of ideas uh you know on

3357
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:02,560
the one hand i think i think

3358
01:55:01,039 --> 01:55:04,719
christian ideas on the other hand i

3359
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,800
think secular philosophical ideas that

3360
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:08,560
have driven this country and the world

3361
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:11,360
more generally in a really really bad

3362
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:13,760
direction and this is why the this is

3363
01:55:11,359 --> 01:55:16,000
why what i do what i do because i think

3364
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:16,800
at the core of it the only way to change

3365
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,118
it

3366
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:21,039
is not to impose a new set of ideas from

3367
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:22,639
the top because i i worry about who's

3368
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:24,399
going to be doing the imposition plus i

3369
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:25,760
don't believe you can you can force

3370
01:55:24,399 --> 01:55:27,839
people to be good

3371
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:30,159
it's to challenge the ideas it's the

3372
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:32,159
question the ideas it's to present an

3373
01:55:30,158 --> 01:55:34,879
alternative view of morality an

3374
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:36,559
alternative a set of moral principles an

3375
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:38,319
alternative ultimately an alternative

3376
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:41,039
view of political principles but it has

3377
01:55:38,319 --> 01:55:42,559
to start with morality if you don't and

3378
01:55:41,039 --> 01:55:43,679
and my morality centered on the

3379
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,960
individual and what the individual

3380
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:48,319
should do with his life in order to

3381
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:50,480
attain a good life uh i i believe that

3382
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:51,359
leads to happiness but but but the good

3383
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:53,359
life

3384
01:55:51,359 --> 01:55:55,359
that's why it's good right the the the

3385
01:55:53,359 --> 01:55:58,639
goal is survival and thriving and

3386
01:55:55,359 --> 01:56:01,519
flourishing and and happiness ultimately

3387
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:04,079
but politics is a servant of that in the

3388
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:05,679
end it's it's not an end in itself

3389
01:56:04,079 --> 01:56:06,880
so the real issue is

3390
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:08,319
you know you ask before what is the

3391
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,599
value of relationship

3392
01:56:08,319 --> 01:56:11,039
there's enormous value in relationship

3393
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:12,639
because we get values from other people

3394
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:14,560
we don't produce all our values we don't

3395
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:15,920
produce all our spiritual values

3396
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,920
and we don't produce all our material

3397
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:19,599
values other people

3398
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:21,279
on a massive

3399
01:56:19,599 --> 01:56:22,560
benefit to us because they produce

3400
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:25,039
values we can't there's a massive

3401
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:27,520
division of labor in terms of values not

3402
01:56:25,039 --> 01:56:28,479
just in economics but also in philosophy

3403
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,920
and elsewhere

3404
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:31,439
it's why we have teachers it's why we

3405
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:33,920
have moral teachers small teachers are

3406
01:56:31,439 --> 01:56:35,839
important to help guide us towards a

3407
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:37,760
good life not all of us are philosophers

3408
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:39,599
but what i do

3409
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,920
demand if you will of individuals this

3410
01:56:39,599 --> 01:56:43,920
is where i put a burden on people right

3411
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:44,960
understand what you're doing

3412
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:47,840
right

3413
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:50,560
you know don't embrace a moral teaching

3414
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:52,319
because it was tradition don't embrace

3415
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:53,599
them all teaching because your parents

3416
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:55,519
embrace that don't embrace them all

3417
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:57,199
teaching just because your teachers are

3418
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:59,760
teaching it

3419
01:56:57,198 --> 01:57:01,118
challenge it think about it embrace it

3420
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:02,960
because you

3421
01:57:01,118 --> 01:57:05,279
embrace it you might be wrong you might

3422
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:07,359
embrace the wrong one but take moral

3423
01:57:05,279 --> 01:57:08,880
responsibility take responsibility over

3424
01:57:07,359 --> 01:57:12,000
your life by

3425
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:15,760
evaluating testing challenging

3426
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,279
what you have received and choosing

3427
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:18,880
what your

3428
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:20,960
what what you're going to pursue and i i

3429
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:22,159
acknowledge empirically that most people

3430
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:24,880
don't do that

3431
01:57:22,158 --> 01:57:27,198
and uh and and and this is why

3432
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:29,920
intellectual leadership is so important

3433
01:57:27,198 --> 01:57:31,919
uh this is why you want to get peop you

3434
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:34,480
want the voices in a culture to be good

3435
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:36,158
voices so that those people who don't

3436
01:57:34,479 --> 01:57:37,839
think for themselves

3437
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:39,439
land up being followers but they end up

3438
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:41,279
being followers of somebody good versus

3439
01:57:39,439 --> 01:57:42,319
followers of somebody bad

3440
01:57:41,279 --> 01:57:43,759
but

3441
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:45,599
for the thinkers in the world out there

3442
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:47,840
who i think are the people who count who

3443
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:49,119
the people who shape society

3444
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:50,880
no no

3445
01:57:49,118 --> 01:57:52,559
wait a minute not not count in a sense

3446
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:54,319
that you can dismiss the lives of others

3447
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:55,599
and you know because i'm you know

3448
01:57:54,319 --> 01:57:57,198
obviously i'm anti-coercion and

3449
01:57:55,599 --> 01:57:57,920
anti-violence

3450
01:57:57,198 --> 01:57:58,719
but

3451
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:00,639
yes

3452
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:02,158
i don't want to sound like plato but in

3453
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:03,679
the sense that they're the ones who

3454
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:05,359
shape who land of shaping the world

3455
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:06,719
they're the ones who land up shaping how

3456
01:58:05,359 --> 01:58:08,960
how they will be

3457
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:11,198
i want those people to make choices

3458
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:13,039
about their values and not to just

3459
01:58:11,198 --> 01:58:15,198
accept them based on traditional base

3460
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:17,118
the commandment or based on

3461
01:58:15,198 --> 01:58:18,960
where they happen to grow up and and in

3462
01:58:17,118 --> 01:58:21,118
that sense again

3463
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:22,158
you know i i do and this is this is an

3464
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:24,559
interesting

3465
01:58:22,158 --> 01:58:26,479
point where i we disagree but i'm not

3466
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:28,560
exactly sure what joram's position is i

3467
01:58:26,479 --> 01:58:30,158
do believe in universal values that is

3468
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,679
there are things that are good and there

3469
01:58:30,158 --> 01:58:33,279
are things that are evil and and i think

3470
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:35,520
we'd agree on that and and there are

3471
01:58:33,279 --> 01:58:38,000
systems we agree that that communism and

3472
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,520
fascism are evil well i think we should

3473
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,439
be able to agree that some things some

3474
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:43,520
political systems are good and maybe

3475
01:58:41,439 --> 01:58:45,919
there's this middle ground where

3476
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:47,119
uh we both think that they're

3477
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:48,399
not particularly bad but not

3478
01:58:47,118 --> 01:58:50,238
particularly good and you all might

3479
01:58:48,399 --> 01:58:52,960
think that better than i think they are

3480
01:58:50,238 --> 01:58:55,439
but if we can agree and this is good and

3481
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:57,118
this is evil right then the systems that

3482
01:58:55,439 --> 01:58:59,439
tend towards the good are good and the

3483
01:58:57,118 --> 01:59:02,000
system to tend towards the evil or evil

3484
01:58:59,439 --> 01:59:04,879
and and but that's universal right you

3485
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,679
know i i look at places like uh uh south

3486
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:09,199
korea japan uh asia you know cultures

3487
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:11,199
that are very very different in many

3488
01:59:09,198 --> 01:59:13,359
respects in the west and yet when they

3489
01:59:11,198 --> 01:59:14,319
adopt

3490
01:59:13,359 --> 01:59:17,598
certain

3491
01:59:14,319 --> 01:59:19,198
uh western ideas right uh about freedom

3492
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:20,400
about liberty about individualism i mean

3493
01:59:19,198 --> 01:59:22,158
the japanese constitution because

3494
01:59:20,399 --> 01:59:24,000
macarthur forced it in there has the

3495
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:25,439
pursuit of happiness in the constitution

3496
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,319
not because they chose it because he put

3497
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:30,719
it in it but they to some extent adopted

3498
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:33,198
that and and they're they're successful

3499
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:35,118
they're successful places today those

3500
01:59:33,198 --> 01:59:36,559
societies in asia that didn't adopt

3501
01:59:35,118 --> 01:59:38,639
these values are not successful

3502
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:42,159
societies today euron

3503
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:45,840
japan has a has a birth rate of what is

3504
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:49,279
it one point no 1.1 1.2

3505
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:50,159
children per woman i mean look

3506
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:52,000
there

3507
01:59:50,158 --> 01:59:54,238
there are some things

3508
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,639
there are some places where you give

3509
01:59:54,238 --> 01:59:58,479
people freedom this is also biblical

3510
01:59:56,639 --> 02:00:00,079
right the idea that

3511
01:59:58,479 --> 02:00:00,959
everyone did what's right in his own

3512
02:00:00,079 --> 02:00:03,920
eyes

3513
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:06,639
okay right this is a a refl refrain in

3514
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:09,118
the book of judges and and and and the

3515
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:11,599
bible is not an anti-freedom book i mean

3516
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:14,079
there's many many look i i don't know

3517
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:15,520
let's talk no we're not fine we will get

3518
02:00:14,079 --> 02:00:17,599
there okay

3519
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:20,159
he's gonna go okay look just as an

3520
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:21,440
asterisk i'm not asking you because you

3521
02:00:20,158 --> 02:00:23,679
know because the bible is such a great

3522
02:00:21,439 --> 02:00:24,479
authoritarian but it it's not that at

3523
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:27,359
all my

3524
02:00:24,479 --> 02:00:29,039
in my in in my view if uh if you want to

3525
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:31,039
know where you know

3526
02:00:29,039 --> 02:00:33,279
where where this uh the what you call

3527
02:00:31,039 --> 02:00:35,198
the the sanctity of property where does

3528
02:00:33,279 --> 02:00:36,719
the sanctity of property comes from it

3529
02:00:35,198 --> 02:00:39,198
comes from the ten commandments it comes

3530
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:40,480
from moses saying i haven't taken

3531
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:42,158
anything from anyone it comes from

3532
02:00:40,479 --> 02:00:44,158
samuel saying i haven't taken anything

3533
02:00:42,158 --> 02:00:46,238
from anyone it's the condemnation of

3534
02:00:44,158 --> 02:00:47,920
have of the unjust kings who steal the

3535
02:00:46,238 --> 02:00:50,158
property of

3536
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:53,440
of their of their subjects so so i'm not

3537
02:00:50,158 --> 02:00:56,559
so i i'm property and freedom i i think

3538
02:00:53,439 --> 02:00:58,879
there's great basis for for it in in in

3539
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:02,159
the bible but right now i i'm focusing

3540
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:04,319
on on on this other question which is

3541
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:06,079
what happens when everyone does what's

3542
02:01:04,319 --> 02:01:08,960
right in his own eyes that's the book of

3543
02:01:06,079 --> 02:01:12,479
judges and that's that's this civil war

3544
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:15,520
uh moral corruption theft idolatry uh

3545
02:01:12,479 --> 02:01:16,959
murder uh rape i mean there's that

3546
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,159
that's what what happens when everyone

3547
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:19,118
everyone does whatever is writing isn't

3548
02:01:18,158 --> 02:01:20,879
organized

3549
02:01:19,118 --> 02:01:23,519
well no it's what that that's what it

3550
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:24,800
says in the text i'm not okay so when i

3551
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,800
look at

3552
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:28,800
you're right there are things that i

3553
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:31,039
think are objectively true i think it's

3554
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:32,400
really hard to get people to agree agree

3555
02:01:31,039 --> 02:01:35,118
to them

3556
02:01:32,399 --> 02:01:38,238
almost impossible but when i look at a

3557
02:01:35,118 --> 02:01:39,439
country which is uh is

3558
02:01:38,238 --> 02:01:42,799
approaching

3559
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:45,598
uh one birth per

3560
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:48,239
woman in other words half of the minimum

3561
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:50,000
necessary for for replacement

3562
02:01:48,238 --> 02:01:51,759
you can say whatever you want whatever

3563
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,079
you want about immigration we can have

3564
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:57,760
that discussion but the point is that

3565
02:01:54,079 --> 02:02:00,319
when when when your values are such that

3566
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:02,480
you're not even capable of of doing the

3567
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:04,319
most basic techniques that human beings

3568
02:02:02,479 --> 02:02:06,399
need in order to be able to propagate

3569
02:02:04,319 --> 02:02:09,198
themselves and their values and the way

3570
02:02:06,399 --> 02:02:10,960
they see things then i look you're

3571
02:02:09,198 --> 02:02:12,719
you're finished you can't say that so

3572
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:15,359
you you can't if i implied that japan is

3573
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:16,639
an ideal society i i take that back

3574
02:02:15,359 --> 02:02:19,039
but no but

3575
02:02:16,639 --> 02:02:19,039
let's think

3576
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:36,800
we should talk about hierarchy yeah but

3577
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:38,880
uh just just to clarify do you

3578
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:40,960
how do you explain uh the situation in

3579
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:42,639
japan is it the decrease in value in

3580
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:45,198
family like some of them

3581
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:46,880
um just expand on that like how do you

3582
02:02:45,198 --> 02:02:49,118
explain that situation

3583
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:51,039
you're saying that that society is in

3584
02:02:49,118 --> 02:02:53,519
trouble in a certain way can you kind of

3585
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:55,599
describe the nature of that trouble i'm

3586
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:59,679
saying that when

3587
02:02:55,599 --> 02:03:02,079
the individual is part of a social

3588
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:04,480
group this can be a family a

3589
02:03:02,079 --> 02:03:05,519
congregation a community a tribe a

3590
02:03:04,479 --> 02:03:07,439
nation

3591
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:09,280
when the individual

3592
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:11,039
feels that the things that are happening

3593
02:03:09,279 --> 02:03:14,000
to the society are things that are

3594
02:03:11,039 --> 02:03:16,960
happening to him or to her and i want to

3595
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:19,279
emphasize this is not the standard view

3596
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:21,520
of collectivism that you know that

3597
02:03:19,279 --> 02:03:23,198
mussolini will mussolini will say you

3598
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:25,599
know the glory of the individual is in

3599
02:03:23,198 --> 02:03:27,118
totally immersing himself in you know in

3600
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:28,480
in the organic whole

3601
02:03:27,118 --> 02:03:29,920
that's not what i'm saying i'm saying

3602
02:03:28,479 --> 02:03:31,439
that human beings

3603
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:34,719
have and are

3604
02:03:31,439 --> 02:03:37,519
both they enter into a society to which

3605
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:41,039
they are loyal and they compete

3606
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:42,639
with one another within

3607
02:03:41,039 --> 02:03:44,319
in the terms that that society allows

3608
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:46,000
competition but also sometimes by

3609
02:03:44,319 --> 02:03:48,319
bending the rules and by shaping them

3610
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:51,439
and by by changing them

3611
02:03:48,319 --> 02:03:53,599
what what you see in many societies

3612
02:03:51,439 --> 02:03:55,519
certainly throughout the liberal west

3613
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:57,199
but also in countries that have been

3614
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:58,960
affected by the liberal west by

3615
02:03:57,198 --> 02:04:00,479
industrialization and ideas of

3616
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:03,760
individualism

3617
02:04:00,479 --> 02:04:06,559
what you see is a collapse of a

3618
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:09,840
willingness of the individual to look at

3619
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:10,639
what the what is what is needed by the

3620
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:14,880
whole

3621
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:16,880
and to uh to make choices that are um

3622
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:18,319
that are as th your own would call them

3623
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:21,199
selfish because it's a because the

3624
02:04:18,319 --> 02:04:23,679
purpose of them is is self-expression

3625
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:28,238
competition self-assertion moving up in

3626
02:04:23,679 --> 02:04:30,239
the hierarchy a achieving achieving um

3627
02:04:28,238 --> 02:04:32,638
honor or wealth

3628
02:04:30,238 --> 02:04:35,759
in order to do those things but but

3629
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:37,599
when you stop being able to to look at

3630
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:39,199
the framework of a particular society

3631
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:40,560
and identify with it

3632
02:04:39,198 --> 02:04:41,519
you lose

3633
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,199
that

3634
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:44,560
you cease to understand what it is that

3635
02:04:43,198 --> 02:04:46,319
you need to do

3636
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:48,400
not not every single person but i'm

3637
02:04:46,319 --> 02:04:49,840
talking about society wide so there are

3638
02:04:48,399 --> 02:04:51,679
few individuals who are just going to

3639
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:54,000
have a fantastic time and live the kind

3640
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:56,880
of life that euron is describing and the

3641
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:58,960
great majority they stop being willing

3642
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:00,560
to take risks they stop being willing to

3643
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:02,158
get married they stop being willing to

3644
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:04,159
have children they stop being willing to

3645
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:07,039
start companies they stop being willing

3646
02:05:04,158 --> 02:05:09,920
to put themselves out to do great things

3647
02:05:07,039 --> 02:05:12,479
because the guide rails that told them

3648
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:14,880
what what kinds of things and the the

3649
02:05:12,479 --> 02:05:16,799
social feedback that honored them when

3650
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,880
they did things like getting married and

3651
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:20,400
having children they've been crushed and

3652
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:23,279
what have they been crushed by they've

3653
02:05:20,399 --> 02:05:25,439
been crushed by the the the false view

3654
02:05:23,279 --> 02:05:27,439
that if you tell the individual be free

3655
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:28,799
make all your own decisions that they

3656
02:05:27,439 --> 02:05:30,960
will then be free and make all their own

3657
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:33,440
decisions they don't they just stop they

3658
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:34,960
stop being human

3659
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:38,078
that's powerful so do you want to

3660
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:39,520
respond to that yes

3661
02:05:38,078 --> 02:05:40,639
so i don't think anybody should have

3662
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:43,360
children

3663
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:44,719
if the goal is the goal

3664
02:05:43,359 --> 02:05:46,559
this there's a good uh there's a good

3665
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:49,039
tweet clip that

3666
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:49,039
clip that

3667
02:05:51,118 --> 02:05:56,960
children for the goal of um

3668
02:05:54,319 --> 02:06:01,118
perpetuating their nation or

3669
02:05:56,960 --> 02:06:02,158
expanding their society or for some

3670
02:06:01,118 --> 02:06:04,399
think they'd make people

3671
02:06:02,158 --> 02:06:06,078
parents if that was the goal the the

3672
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:07,839
purpose of doing it

3673
02:06:06,078 --> 02:06:09,279
i i think people should have children

3674
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:11,679
because they want to embrace that

3675
02:06:09,279 --> 02:06:12,800
challenge that that that

3676
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:16,158
beauty

3677
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:18,079
that experience that amazing very very

3678
02:06:16,158 --> 02:06:19,679
hard very very difficult

3679
02:06:18,078 --> 02:06:21,599
experience in life it's it's a it's

3680
02:06:19,679 --> 02:06:24,239
about being able to project the long

3681
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:26,400
term but also being able to enjoy and

3682
02:06:24,238 --> 02:06:28,238
love the creation of another human being

3683
02:06:26,399 --> 02:06:30,238
that process of creation it is a

3684
02:06:28,238 --> 02:06:31,359
beautiful self-interested thing and by

3685
02:06:30,238 --> 02:06:32,238
the way not everybody should have

3686
02:06:31,359 --> 02:06:33,519
children

3687
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:35,279
i think way too many people have

3688
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:37,040
children you know there's some awful

3689
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:39,439
parents out there that i wish

3690
02:06:37,039 --> 02:06:42,800
uh would stop i mean there are you know

3691
02:06:39,439 --> 02:06:45,118
life is precious and life of suffering

3692
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:46,800
is sad it's sad to see people suffer and

3693
02:06:45,118 --> 02:06:49,839
a lot of people are born into situations

3694
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,599
and abort born into parents that that

3695
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:53,840
destroy their capacity to ever live a

3696
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:57,679
good life and that's that's a tragic and

3697
02:06:53,840 --> 02:07:00,400
and sad thing and uh so

3698
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:01,599
so i don't measure um the health of a

3699
02:07:00,399 --> 02:07:03,519
society

3700
02:07:01,599 --> 02:07:05,440
uh in how many children they're having

3701
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:06,800
or a health of a couple whether they

3702
02:07:05,439 --> 02:07:09,279
have children or not those are

3703
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,800
individual choices some people

3704
02:07:09,279 --> 02:07:12,238
make a choice not to have children which

3705
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:13,760
is completely rational and consistent

3706
02:07:12,238 --> 02:07:15,839
with their values and

3707
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:17,840
now when you look at a society overall i

3708
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:20,159
do think having children not having

3709
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:21,520
children is a reflection of something i

3710
02:07:20,158 --> 02:07:23,279
think it's a reflection of a certain

3711
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:25,119
optimism about the future i think it's a

3712
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:27,279
reflection of thinking long term versus

3713
02:07:25,118 --> 02:07:28,799
short-term i think a short-term society

3714
02:07:27,279 --> 02:07:30,479
doesn't have children people don't have

3715
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:32,480
children there because

3716
02:07:30,479 --> 02:07:35,279
children are long-term investment

3717
02:07:32,479 --> 02:07:36,959
they they require real planning and real

3718
02:07:35,279 --> 02:07:39,599
effort and real thinking about the

3719
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:41,760
long-term but those are all issues and

3720
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:43,199
again we're confusing or

3721
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:45,360
or mixing

3722
02:07:43,198 --> 02:07:47,598
when i say japan look how well japan has

3723
02:07:45,359 --> 02:07:48,960
done i i don't mean the specific

3724
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:50,078
japanese people and how many kids

3725
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:51,840
they're having and what kind of life

3726
02:07:50,078 --> 02:07:53,679
they're having you know in terms of

3727
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:55,679
these kind of particulars

3728
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:58,480
but think about the alternatives japan

3729
02:07:55,679 --> 02:08:00,800
faces if you look around the the options

3730
02:07:58,479 --> 02:08:02,879
right that they face

3731
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:04,800
they tried empire uh they tried

3732
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:06,800
nationalistic empire didn't turn out too

3733
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:09,360
well for them or anybody who they

3734
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:10,560
interacted with they could have become

3735
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:12,158
north korea

3736
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:13,039
we we know how that turned out we know

3737
02:08:12,158 --> 02:08:14,719
what that is they could have been

3738
02:08:13,039 --> 02:08:16,719
cambodia if you've ever been to cambodia

3739
02:08:14,719 --> 02:08:18,880
and seen the kind of poverty and and yes

3740
02:08:16,719 --> 02:08:21,840
maybe cambodia's have lots of children

3741
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:23,840
but god i'd rather be in japan any day

3742
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:26,159
than than have children in in the kind

3743
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:28,560
of poverty and horrific uh circumstances

3744
02:08:26,158 --> 02:08:29,679
they have but in the context of the

3745
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:33,360
available

3746
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:35,118
um regimes that that were possible post

3747
02:08:33,359 --> 02:08:37,279
world war ii for the for the japanese

3748
02:08:35,118 --> 02:08:39,039
ten-based name-based one that generally

3749
02:08:37,279 --> 02:08:40,880
led to prosperity

3750
02:08:39,039 --> 02:08:43,760
to freedom to individuals pursuing

3751
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:45,840
values not perfectly because they didn't

3752
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:47,920
implement the philosophical foundation

3753
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:51,039
the mall foundation that i would like to

3754
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:53,840
to have this still being impacted by

3755
02:08:51,039 --> 02:08:55,198
kantian hegelian whatever philosophy

3756
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:58,000
that's out there in the west that's

3757
02:08:55,198 --> 02:09:00,000
destroying the better part so you give

3758
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:02,479
people freedom now what do they do with

3759
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:04,399
it and if they have a bad philosophy

3760
02:09:02,479 --> 02:09:06,879
they're going to do bad things with that

3761
02:09:04,399 --> 02:09:08,799
freedom right you you tell people to do

3762
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:11,520
whatever they choose to do but if they

3763
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:12,719
have bad ideas they will choose to do

3764
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:15,199
bad things

3765
02:09:12,719 --> 02:09:17,760
so it is true that the primacy of

3766
02:09:15,198 --> 02:09:20,158
morality and the primacy of philosophy

3767
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:22,480
has to be recognized it's it's not the

3768
02:09:20,158 --> 02:09:25,920
primacy of politics and indeed you don't

3769
02:09:22,479 --> 02:09:29,678
get free societies unless you have some

3770
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:31,359
elements of decent philosophy but

3771
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:32,800
you can get free societies with a rotten

3772
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:34,559
philosophy but they don't they don't

3773
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:37,039
stay free for very long don't understand

3774
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:40,079
how can it be a decent philosophy if it

3775
02:09:37,039 --> 02:09:41,279
doesn't care about posterity if it does

3776
02:09:40,078 --> 02:09:43,039
it if

3777
02:09:41,279 --> 02:09:45,359
you're willing to say

3778
02:09:43,039 --> 02:09:46,800
i'm i'm offering guidance i think you

3779
02:09:45,359 --> 02:09:48,719
should live as a traitor all

3780
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:50,719
relationships should be voluntary those

3781
02:09:48,719 --> 02:09:53,520
are those are interesting things but the

3782
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:55,840
moment that it comes to posterity to the

3783
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:57,599
future to there being a future let's say

3784
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:59,520
that there were a society that lived the

3785
02:09:57,599 --> 02:10:01,119
way you know in general according to

3786
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:03,599
your view let's say there was such a

3787
02:10:01,118 --> 02:10:05,359
society how can you not care whether

3788
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:07,039
that society is capable of passing it on

3789
02:10:05,359 --> 02:10:08,639
to the next generation or not but the

3790
02:10:07,039 --> 02:10:10,800
way to pass it on to the next generation

3791
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:12,078
is through ideas and not through uh

3792
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:14,079
through having children having children

3793
02:10:12,078 --> 02:10:15,279
is an individual choice that some people

3794
02:10:14,078 --> 02:10:18,078
are going to make and some people are

3795
02:10:15,279 --> 02:10:19,599
not but the fundamental that preserves

3796
02:10:18,078 --> 02:10:21,519
what the good life

3797
02:10:19,599 --> 02:10:22,239
what does that even mean

3798
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:25,360
if

3799
02:10:22,238 --> 02:10:27,198
if if every generation from now on your

3800
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:29,439
your your society that was good at a

3801
02:10:27,198 --> 02:10:31,039
certain point has half as many people in

3802
02:10:29,439 --> 02:10:32,559
it it's going to

3803
02:10:31,039 --> 02:10:34,800
very quickly it's just going to be

3804
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:36,400
overrun everyone back home

3805
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:38,639
what do you mean over anybody are we

3806
02:10:36,399 --> 02:10:40,638
just totally ahistorical if you're the

3807
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:43,199
spartans and you have all of these you

3808
02:10:40,639 --> 02:10:45,279
know like like warrior values but you

3809
02:10:43,198 --> 02:10:46,559
stop having children you get overrun you

3810
02:10:45,279 --> 02:10:48,000
get defeated in the case of spotter

3811
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:50,400
that's a good thing not a bad thing but

3812
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,800
i get my point you have to have the

3813
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:54,960
ability to have enough children to

3814
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:57,440
create enough wealth and enough power

3815
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:59,679
enough strength who makes these kind of

3816
02:10:57,439 --> 02:11:01,519
conclusions and decisions about how many

3817
02:10:59,679 --> 02:11:03,520
you make it as an individual and you

3818
02:11:01,520 --> 02:11:05,679
decide that you know what we're not

3819
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:07,840
talking about we're talking about what

3820
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:10,399
kind of intellectual cultural religious

3821
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:11,199
inheritance you give your children yes

3822
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:13,198
all right

3823
02:11:11,198 --> 02:11:15,039
and those are the ideas that i get

3824
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:16,319
and those ideas are going to perpetuate

3825
02:11:15,039 --> 02:11:18,078
because they're good ideas if they're

3826
02:11:16,319 --> 02:11:19,118
bad they're not going to perpetuate they

3827
02:11:18,078 --> 02:11:21,359
can be

3828
02:11:19,118 --> 02:11:23,359
they can't be good ideas if they don't

3829
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:24,799
produce future generations what are you

3830
02:11:23,359 --> 02:11:26,880
talking about why would they not produce

3831
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:29,440
future generations i mean as i look at

3832
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,719
every liberal every liberal society on

3833
02:11:29,439 --> 02:11:32,879
earth but i'm not

3834
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:34,800
in the democratic collapse is not a

3835
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:36,639
single liberal society on earth tonight

3836
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:38,320
that i'm willing to defend but

3837
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:40,639
because they're not living by okay so

3838
02:11:38,319 --> 02:11:42,399
okay so they're not acceptable okay so

3839
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:44,800
they have an assemblage

3840
02:11:42,399 --> 02:11:46,799
i am a semblance of a political i know a

3841
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:49,119
system that is a little bit like what i

3842
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:50,880
would like far from what i would i know

3843
02:11:49,118 --> 02:11:52,559
but they certainly don't have a moral

3844
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:54,719
foundation i believe that people who

3845
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:56,159
have the right moral foundation most of

3846
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:58,560
them not all of them but most of them

3847
02:11:56,158 --> 02:12:00,319
will have children most of them will

3848
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:04,000
continue into the future most of them

3849
02:12:00,319 --> 02:12:06,238
will fight for a future but not because

3850
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,760
they care what happens in 200 years but

3851
02:12:06,238 --> 02:12:09,759
because they care about their lifetime

3852
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:13,039
and part of having fun and enjoying

3853
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:15,280
one's lifetime is having kids is

3854
02:12:13,039 --> 02:12:17,118
projecting into the future are you

3855
02:12:15,279 --> 02:12:19,198
really gonna tell me that the people

3856
02:12:17,118 --> 02:12:20,479
have children because it's fun they're

3857
02:12:19,198 --> 02:12:23,039
fun when they're four years old they're

3858
02:12:20,479 --> 02:12:24,799
not fun when they're when they're 15. no

3859
02:12:23,039 --> 02:12:26,238
when they're 15 they're not funny

3860
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:27,920
they're not just not funny look you

3861
02:12:26,238 --> 02:12:30,959
don't do learning so much today you

3862
02:12:27,920 --> 02:12:32,560
don't you you don't do this for fun

3863
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:33,760
marriage also you don't do for fun there

3864
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:36,239
are times that are fun and there are

3865
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:37,920
times they're not fun

3866
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:39,598
it's not exactly the talent but you

3867
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:42,078
certainly do it for you do it for

3868
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:44,400
happiness you do it for fulfillment you

3869
02:12:42,078 --> 02:12:45,439
do it as a challenge you do it for

3870
02:12:44,399 --> 02:12:48,319
making

3871
02:12:45,439 --> 02:12:49,839
for making your life better for making

3872
02:12:48,319 --> 02:12:52,399
your life interesting for making your

3873
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:53,520
life challenging for embracing

3874
02:12:52,399 --> 02:12:55,439
you know

3875
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:58,960
part of it is fun part of it is hard

3876
02:12:55,439 --> 02:13:01,759
work but you do it because it's

3877
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:03,439
it it's it makes your life a better life

3878
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:06,480
it's very interesting so empirically

3879
02:13:03,439 --> 02:13:08,238
speaking if you dissolve the cultural

3880
02:13:06,479 --> 02:13:09,678
backbone where everybody comes up like

3881
02:13:08,238 --> 02:13:12,000
the background

3882
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:13,520
the moral ideas that everybody is raised

3883
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,520
with if you dissolve that and if you

3884
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:16,960
truly emphasize the individual

3885
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:19,599
uh i think

3886
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:21,279
joram is saying it's

3887
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:23,119
going to naturally lead to the

3888
02:13:21,279 --> 02:13:24,719
dissolution of marriage and all these

3889
02:13:23,118 --> 02:13:26,960
concepts i think so you're not i think

3890
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:28,639
so like everything or basically saying

3891
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:30,800
you're not going to choose some of these

3892
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:31,840
things you're not you're going to more

3893
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:34,800
and more

3894
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:37,360
choose the short-term optimization

3895
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:40,480
versus the long-term optimization

3896
02:13:37,359 --> 02:13:42,078
beyond your own life like posterity so

3897
02:13:40,479 --> 02:13:43,839
so i don't think about posterity i don't

3898
02:13:42,078 --> 02:13:46,000
know what posterity means right i can

3899
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:47,760
project into my children's life

3900
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:49,760
maybe when i have grandchildren at the

3901
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,679
grandchildren but it ends there i i

3902
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:53,440
can't project 300 years in the future

3903
02:13:51,679 --> 02:13:55,118
it's ridiculous to try to think about

3904
02:13:53,439 --> 02:13:57,678
300 years into the future things change

3905
02:13:55,118 --> 02:13:59,439
so much and and and that's the founding

3906
02:13:57,679 --> 02:14:01,279
fathers that's the conservative founding

3907
02:13:59,439 --> 02:14:02,879
father well no i i don't think i think

3908
02:14:01,279 --> 02:14:04,559
they set up a system i think the whole

3909
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:06,239
idea was to set up a system i'm just it

3910
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:08,719
was self-perpetuating

3911
02:14:06,238 --> 02:14:10,879
that would it would if

3912
02:14:08,719 --> 02:14:12,840
people lived up to it right no no would

3913
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:15,039
perpetuate the subject no systems are

3914
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:17,119
self-perpetuating things rise and fall

3915
02:14:15,039 --> 02:14:18,560
and it's they don't necessarily focus i

3916
02:14:17,118 --> 02:14:20,559
don't believe in that let me speak jared

3917
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:23,280
for a second

3918
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:25,679
the great the great individuals

3919
02:14:23,279 --> 02:14:28,158
in societies are the people who have

3920
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:31,118
seen the decline understood it and

3921
02:14:28,158 --> 02:14:32,799
provided resources in order to redirect

3922
02:14:31,118 --> 02:14:34,158
and bring it back up you can't agree to

3923
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:37,119
that

3924
02:14:34,158 --> 02:14:40,319
i i don't see it that way at all yes i

3925
02:14:37,118 --> 02:14:41,598
want people out there to rebel against

3926
02:14:40,319 --> 02:14:43,198
conventional morality i think

3927
02:14:41,599 --> 02:14:45,920
conventional morality is destructive to

3928
02:14:43,198 --> 02:14:47,598
their own lives and broadly to posterity

3929
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:49,440
because i think it's unsustainable it's

3930
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:50,719
not good and this goes to i think

3931
02:14:49,439 --> 02:14:52,399
conventional morality is christian

3932
02:14:50,719 --> 02:14:54,639
morality is a morality that's been

3933
02:14:52,399 --> 02:14:56,319
secularized through christian lens and i

3934
02:14:54,639 --> 02:14:58,159
think it's destructive but i don't want

3935
02:14:56,319 --> 02:14:59,359
them to dump that and not replace it

3936
02:14:58,158 --> 02:15:00,719
with something

3937
02:14:59,359 --> 02:15:03,118
i want

3938
02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:05,279
and i think it's necessary and essential

3939
02:15:03,118 --> 02:15:07,759
for people to have a moral code and to

3940
02:15:05,279 --> 02:15:08,960
have a a moral code

3941
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:10,960
reality is

3942
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:13,679
a set of guidelines to live your life it

3943
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:15,198
is a set of values that did to to to

3944
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:17,359
guide you to help you identify what is

3945
02:15:15,198 --> 02:15:17,359
good

3946
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:23,920
you're saying

3947
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:27,039
central to this morality that people

3948
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:28,399
should have is reason yes okay

3949
02:15:27,039 --> 02:15:31,439
you're not saying other things you're

3950
02:15:28,399 --> 02:15:33,920
basically saying reason will arrive a

3951
02:15:31,439 --> 02:15:36,399
lot of things why are you so sure that

3952
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:38,399
reason is so important there's nothing

3953
02:15:36,399 --> 02:15:40,479
else no hold on a second but like it

3954
02:15:38,399 --> 02:15:42,319
seems like obvious to you

3955
02:15:40,479 --> 02:15:44,718
so first of all humans have limited

3956
02:15:42,319 --> 02:15:46,319
cognitive capacity so even to assume we

3957
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:49,520
the reason can actually function that

3958
02:15:46,319 --> 02:15:51,198
well from an artificial intelligence

3959
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:53,119
researcher perspective

3960
02:15:51,198 --> 02:15:54,638
uh it seems there's a whole discussion

3961
02:15:53,118 --> 02:15:56,719
about whether there is such a thing as

3962
02:15:54,639 --> 02:15:59,279
artificial intelligence whether whether

3963
02:15:56,719 --> 02:16:00,960
that is what it is but um but see here's

3964
02:15:59,279 --> 02:16:02,399
the thing i mean you're very confident

3965
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:04,399
about this particular thing but not

3966
02:16:02,399 --> 02:16:07,920
about other aspects of human nature that

3967
02:16:04,399 --> 02:16:08,799
seems to be obviously present so yes uh

3968
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:11,920
almost

3969
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:14,560
uh human relations love connection

3970
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:16,399
between us so i it's very possible to

3971
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:18,079
argue that all of the accomplishments of

3972
02:16:16,399 --> 02:16:20,238
reason would not exist without the

3973
02:16:18,078 --> 02:16:21,679
connection of other humans there is of

3974
02:16:20,238 --> 02:16:24,238
course that's true it's not obvious

3975
02:16:21,679 --> 02:16:27,279
though it's possible that reason is a

3976
02:16:24,238 --> 02:16:29,039
property of the collective of multiple

3977
02:16:27,279 --> 02:16:30,559
people interacting with each other when

3978
02:16:29,039 --> 02:16:32,478
you look at the greatest inventions of

3979
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:34,800
human history some people tell that

3980
02:16:32,478 --> 02:16:37,199
story by individual inventors

3981
02:16:34,799 --> 02:16:38,879
you could argue that's true some people

3982
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:40,319
say that it's

3983
02:16:38,879 --> 02:16:42,638
it's a bunch of people in the room

3984
02:16:40,318 --> 02:16:43,679
together the idea is bubbling and if

3985
02:16:42,638 --> 02:16:47,119
you're saying

3986
02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:49,040
individual is primary and they have the

3987
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:50,240
full power and the capacity to make

3988
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:51,920
choices

3989
02:16:50,239 --> 02:16:53,840
i don't know if that's necessarily

3990
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:56,719
obviously so there's a straw manning

3991
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:58,840
going on here yeah my position right yep

3992
02:16:56,718 --> 02:17:01,598
of course my favorite thing to do

3993
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:03,200
i'm you don't do it and you do it more

3994
02:17:01,599 --> 02:17:05,280
politely than anybody else i know when

3995
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:07,840
you do it of course we all stand on the

3996
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:10,719
shoulders of giants of course invention

3997
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:13,679
and science is collaborative uh not

3998
02:17:10,718 --> 02:17:15,598
always not not not a hundred percent uh

3999
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:17,280
newton stood on the on the shoulders of

4000
02:17:15,599 --> 02:17:19,439
giants i don't know how collaborative he

4001
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:21,679
was he wasn't exactly known as a

4002
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:23,359
bubbling up and and testing ideas out

4003
02:17:21,679 --> 02:17:26,960
with other people but this is a

4004
02:17:23,359 --> 02:17:28,559
metaphysical fact you can't eat for me

4005
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:29,919
there's no collective stomach you can't

4006
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:31,840
eat for me

4007
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:33,679
you know you can provide me with food

4008
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:34,960
but i need to do the eating you can't

4009
02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:37,200
think for me

4010
02:17:34,959 --> 02:17:39,438
you can help stimulate my thought

4011
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:40,719
you can challenge my thinking you can

4012
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:42,398
add to it

4013
02:17:40,718 --> 02:17:43,839
but in the end of the day only i can

4014
02:17:42,398 --> 02:17:46,000
either do my thinking or not do my

4015
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:48,079
thinking but i need to think but you can

4016
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:50,318
think all by yourself alone but what

4017
02:17:48,079 --> 02:17:52,398
does that mean all by yourself right can

4018
02:17:50,318 --> 02:17:53,840
can i think on a desert island yes i can

4019
02:17:52,398 --> 02:17:57,519
think on a desert line

4020
02:17:53,840 --> 02:18:00,159
can i can i think as big and as broad

4021
02:17:57,519 --> 02:18:03,439
and as deep as i can

4022
02:18:00,159 --> 02:18:05,280
in in uh uh aristotle's i see him of

4023
02:18:03,439 --> 02:18:08,000
course not i i'm a much better thinker

4024
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:09,679
and aristotle i see him or in or or in

4025
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,959
any kind of situation like this where

4026
02:18:09,679 --> 02:18:12,558
you're going to challenge me and i have

4027
02:18:10,959 --> 02:18:14,478
to come back and i have to think deeply

4028
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:16,079
about what it is you said and why i'm

4029
02:18:14,478 --> 02:18:18,558
not communicating very effectively and

4030
02:18:16,079 --> 02:18:20,398
why why you're not understanding me

4031
02:18:18,558 --> 02:18:22,398
of course now you're causing me to think

4032
02:18:20,398 --> 02:18:24,478
much more deeply and to challenge me but

4033
02:18:22,398 --> 02:18:26,239
it's still true that i have to think i

4034
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:28,799
if i don't think for myself who's going

4035
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:30,239
to think for me right so

4036
02:18:28,799 --> 02:18:32,318
so this is why

4037
02:18:30,239 --> 02:18:34,239
um i'm not a philosopher

4038
02:18:32,318 --> 02:18:37,199
i'm certainly not an original thinker in

4039
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:39,119
that sense i you know i recognize the

4040
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:40,800
fact that they're geniuses that are much

4041
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:43,519
smarter than me whether it's aristotle

4042
02:18:40,799 --> 02:18:45,599
line rand or people that inspire me i

4043
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:47,040
study their work i try to understand it

4044
02:18:45,599 --> 02:18:48,558
to the best of my ability but i don't

4045
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:50,960
take it as

4046
02:18:48,558 --> 02:18:52,478
gospel i take it as

4047
02:18:50,959 --> 02:18:54,638
you know this is something i need to

4048
02:18:52,478 --> 02:18:56,239
figure out i need to learn it i need to

4049
02:18:54,638 --> 02:18:57,920
understand it because it's good for my

4050
02:18:56,239 --> 02:19:00,159
life it's important to me

4051
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:01,359
but i have to do the thinking it won't

4052
02:19:00,159 --> 02:19:03,119
be mine

4053
02:19:01,359 --> 02:19:04,960
it it'll behind manage but it won't be

4054
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:08,240
mine unless i've done the thinking to

4055
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:10,398
integrate it into my soul into my

4056
02:19:08,239 --> 02:19:11,840
consciousness into my mind but it's

4057
02:19:10,398 --> 02:19:14,318
still true that i have to think for

4058
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:17,200
myself not on a desert island i you know

4059
02:19:14,318 --> 02:19:19,599
and i i i now regret ever using a desert

4060
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:21,920
island in in in the book as an example

4061
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:24,239
because you know because uh uh

4062
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:25,519
we've achieved something there

4063
02:19:24,239 --> 02:19:26,398
there is progress

4064
02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:28,318
because

4065
02:19:26,398 --> 02:19:30,558
clearly the truth is because clearly it

4066
02:19:28,318 --> 02:19:32,239
was misunderstood

4067
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:34,959
i didn't make myself clear enough in in

4068
02:19:32,239 --> 02:19:36,558
the book in terms of what i meant but um

4069
02:19:34,959 --> 02:19:39,598
you know i

4070
02:19:36,558 --> 02:19:42,318
i do not advocate for thinking alone in

4071
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:44,079
a dark room not engaging with reality

4072
02:19:42,318 --> 02:19:46,000
not studying history not knowing about

4073
02:19:44,079 --> 02:19:47,760
the world or on a desert island not

4074
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:50,959
interacting with you're a collectivist

4075
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:52,159
no i'm a trader so i i enjoy what we're

4076
02:19:50,959 --> 02:19:54,159
doing right now because you're

4077
02:19:52,159 --> 02:19:56,799
challenging me you make me a better

4078
02:19:54,159 --> 02:19:57,920
thinker uh it's interesting you know the

4079
02:19:56,799 --> 02:19:59,679
fact that

4080
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:01,680
a lot of people are going to watch this

4081
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:02,479
plays into it as well but i would

4082
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:04,479
probably

4083
02:20:02,478 --> 02:20:06,879
enjoy engaging with you in conversation

4084
02:20:04,478 --> 02:20:09,039
recording so yeah there you go i i would

4085
02:20:06,879 --> 02:20:10,879
enjoy engaging with you with your in

4086
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:13,200
conversation even if it wasn't being

4087
02:20:10,879 --> 02:20:15,119
recorded and even if it was because

4088
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:16,319
uh you know that kind of conversation

4089
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:18,399
makes me better there's some people who

4090
02:20:16,318 --> 02:20:20,159
i wouldn't there's some people who who

4091
02:20:18,398 --> 02:20:21,439
make it worse right that you want to

4092
02:20:20,159 --> 02:20:22,959
walk that you walk away from the

4093
02:20:21,439 --> 02:20:24,398
conversation because because they're

4094
02:20:22,959 --> 02:20:26,799
harmful to you and this is where choice

4095
02:20:24,398 --> 02:20:29,039
comes in it's i want to be able to

4096
02:20:26,799 --> 02:20:30,559
choose who i engage with i don't always

4097
02:20:29,040 --> 02:20:32,000
have that choice because

4098
02:20:30,559 --> 02:20:34,079
as a public intellectual you go in front

4099
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:35,840
of audiences you don't always choose who

4100
02:20:34,079 --> 02:20:37,760
it is but you want to choose who you

4101
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:40,239
engage with and who you don't you want

4102
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:42,318
to choose the forum in which you engage

4103
02:20:40,239 --> 02:20:43,840
and how you engage and the standard for

4104
02:20:42,318 --> 02:20:45,920
me is reason there is no understanding

4105
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:47,680
so you asked a deep question to start

4106
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:48,879
off why reason right

4107
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:50,880
because

4108
02:20:48,879 --> 02:20:53,279
that's where the values come from that's

4109
02:20:50,879 --> 02:20:55,519
the only tool we have to discover truth

4110
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:57,840
yes you know reason is something that it

4111
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:59,840
doesn't guarantee truth it doesn't

4112
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:00,880
guarantee they're always right it's

4113
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:02,719
fallible

4114
02:21:00,879 --> 02:21:05,279
but it's all we have it's the tool in

4115
02:21:02,719 --> 02:21:06,879
which we evaluate the world around us

4116
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:09,040
and we come to conclusions about it

4117
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:10,318
there is there just isn't other two

4118
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:13,280
emotions

4119
02:21:10,318 --> 02:21:16,159
emotions are uh are not tools of

4120
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:19,200
cognition consciousness is a tool

4121
02:21:16,159 --> 02:21:21,600
emotion like love all of these things

4122
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:24,000
are ways to experience the world to say

4123
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:25,439
that reason is the best tool but there's

4124
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,559
a difference between experiencing the

4125
02:21:25,439 --> 02:21:28,960
world

4126
02:21:26,559 --> 02:21:30,239
and and evaluating the world in terms of

4127
02:21:28,959 --> 02:21:32,318
what is true

4128
02:21:30,239 --> 02:21:34,799
as a scientist i appreciate the value of

4129
02:21:32,318 --> 02:21:37,359
reason and emotions and love

4130
02:21:34,799 --> 02:21:40,000
are consequences they're not primary

4131
02:21:37,359 --> 02:21:42,239
emotions are consequences of conclusions

4132
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,719
you've come to your emotions will change

4133
02:21:42,239 --> 02:21:46,719
very quickly relatively speaking when

4134
02:21:44,719 --> 02:21:48,879
your evaluations of a situation will

4135
02:21:46,719 --> 02:21:50,318
change different people can see exactly

4136
02:21:48,879 --> 02:21:52,159
the same scene and have completely

4137
02:21:50,318 --> 02:21:53,840
different emotions because they're

4138
02:21:52,159 --> 02:21:55,520
bringing different value systems and

4139
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:57,600
they're bringing different thoughts to

4140
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:59,840
the process maybe love is primary but

4141
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:01,280
let me ask uh love is the same thing you

4142
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:03,120
can fall out of love with somebody why

4143
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:04,560
because you learn something new because

4144
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:06,000
you've discovered something new about

4145
02:22:04,559 --> 02:22:07,680
the person now you don't love them the

4146
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:10,478
wrong podcast to bring up love we'll

4147
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:12,000
talk forever about it so uh

4148
02:22:10,478 --> 02:22:13,519
you wrote the book the virtue of

4149
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:16,079
nationalism

4150
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:17,520
contrasting nation states with empires

4151
02:22:16,079 --> 02:22:21,600
and with global governance like united

4152
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:24,000
nations and so on so uh you argue that

4153
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:26,800
nationalism uniquely provides the quote

4154
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:29,359
the collective right of a free people to

4155
02:22:26,799 --> 02:22:31,438
rule themselves so continuing our

4156
02:22:29,359 --> 02:22:33,920
conversation

4157
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:36,800
why is this particular

4158
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:39,920
collection of humans we call a nation

4159
02:22:36,799 --> 02:22:42,159
a uniquely powerful way to preserve the

4160
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:43,600
freedom of a people to have people rule

4161
02:22:42,159 --> 02:22:45,359
themselves

4162
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:47,600
before i say anything on the subject i

4163
02:22:45,359 --> 02:22:50,640
should emphasize that i'm not a

4164
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:52,800
rationalist i'm an empiricist and i'm

4165
02:22:50,639 --> 02:22:54,239
i'm i'm offering what

4166
02:22:52,799 --> 02:22:57,039
uh

4167
02:22:54,239 --> 02:22:58,879
what i think is a valid observation of

4168
02:22:57,040 --> 02:23:00,800
of human history i i don't have some

4169
02:22:58,879 --> 02:23:02,559
kind of deductive framework for proving

4170
02:23:00,799 --> 02:23:05,039
that you know that the nation is the

4171
02:23:02,559 --> 02:23:06,959
best and empirically we know something

4172
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:08,640
about the way systems of national states

4173
02:23:06,959 --> 02:23:11,759
work and about the way empires work and

4174
02:23:08,639 --> 02:23:14,398
the way tribal societies work uh what we

4175
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:16,159
don't know is uh you know

4176
02:23:14,398 --> 02:23:17,358
is it possible to invent something else

4177
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:18,559
or i mean there's a lot of things we

4178
02:23:17,359 --> 02:23:19,520
don't know here

4179
02:23:18,559 --> 02:23:21,519
so

4180
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:23,920
with the caveat that i'm i'm making an

4181
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:24,720
empirical observation the basic argument

4182
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:28,159
is

4183
02:23:24,719 --> 02:23:29,679
human beings form collectives naturally

4184
02:23:28,159 --> 02:23:30,478
loyalty groups

4185
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:32,720
and

4186
02:23:30,478 --> 02:23:35,039
for most of human history and prehistory

4187
02:23:32,719 --> 02:23:36,719
as far as as as we know human beings

4188
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:40,240
lived in tribal societies tribal

4189
02:23:36,719 --> 02:23:41,039
societies or societies um in in in which

4190
02:23:40,239 --> 02:23:42,000
there's

4191
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:44,479
um

4192
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,760
uh constant friction and constant

4193
02:23:44,478 --> 02:23:47,920
warfare

4194
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:49,680
among very small groups among among

4195
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:51,840
families and clans

4196
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:53,200
and we reach a turning point in human

4197
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:55,920
history with the invention of

4198
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:58,079
large-scale agriculture which allows the

4199
02:23:55,920 --> 02:24:00,639
creation of vast wealth it allows the

4200
02:23:58,079 --> 02:24:02,318
establishment of standing armies instead

4201
02:24:00,639 --> 02:24:04,478
of militias you know

4202
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:06,639
sargon of akkad says

4203
02:24:04,478 --> 02:24:08,959
i can pay five thousand men to do

4204
02:24:06,639 --> 02:24:10,079
nothing other than to drill in the arts

4205
02:24:08,959 --> 02:24:11,919
of war and then i'm gonna send them out

4206
02:24:10,079 --> 02:24:13,680
to conquer the neighboring city-states

4207
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:17,520
and there you have empire

4208
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:19,600
the bible which is the source of our

4209
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:22,479
our image our conception of a world of

4210
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:24,640
of independent nations that are not

4211
02:24:22,478 --> 02:24:27,039
constantly trying to conquer one another

4212
02:24:24,639 --> 02:24:30,639
the sort the source of that is the bible

4213
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:31,840
and the the uh the biblical world is is

4214
02:24:30,639 --> 02:24:32,799
one in which

4215
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:33,680
uh

4216
02:24:32,799 --> 02:24:36,639
uh

4217
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:39,200
israel and and and and various other

4218
02:24:36,639 --> 02:24:41,680
small nations are are trying to create

4219
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:42,880
to to to to fight for their independence

4220
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:45,840
against

4221
02:24:42,879 --> 02:24:48,559
world empires against empires babylonian

4222
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:50,639
assyrian persian egyptian which aspire

4223
02:24:48,559 --> 02:24:54,000
to rule the world

4224
02:24:50,639 --> 02:24:57,358
my my claim is fundamentally

4225
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:59,280
twofold it's it it it's moral

4226
02:24:57,359 --> 02:25:01,040
that whenever you conquer a foreign

4227
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:03,040
nation you're murdering and you're

4228
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:05,120
stealing you're you're you're destroying

4229
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:08,000
you you as as your own would say you

4230
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:11,359
you're using force to to to

4231
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:13,840
to to cause people to submit so so

4232
02:25:11,359 --> 02:25:17,040
there is something in uh in in the

4233
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:19,600
prophets that rebels against this uh

4234
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:21,520
ongoing atrocity and carnage of trying

4235
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:25,280
to take over the whole world

4236
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:28,000
and um and and there's a a prudential

4237
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:29,680
practical argument which is that the

4238
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:31,840
world is governed best

4239
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:33,760
when there are multiple nations when

4240
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:35,520
when they're free to experiment and

4241
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:37,840
chart their own courses that means they

4242
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:39,290
they they have their their own route to

4243
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:40,478
god they have their own

4244
02:25:39,290 --> 02:25:42,800
[Music]

4245
02:25:40,478 --> 02:25:45,438
moralities they have their own forms of

4246
02:25:42,799 --> 02:25:47,519
economy and government and what tends to

4247
02:25:45,439 --> 02:25:49,600
happen in history is that

4248
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:51,600
when something is successful when

4249
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:52,960
something looks like when people a

4250
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:54,559
different nation looks at and say well

4251
02:25:52,959 --> 02:25:57,119
those people are they're flourishing

4252
02:25:54,559 --> 02:25:59,600
they're succeeding then it's it's

4253
02:25:57,120 --> 02:26:01,359
imitated and you know in in the way that

4254
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:03,120
you know the dutch invented the stock

4255
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:05,600
market and and the english said look

4256
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:07,600
that makes them them powerful so so

4257
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:10,000
we'll we'll adopt it so that there's

4258
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:12,960
endless examples of that so that's the

4259
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:15,120
argument for it the argument is is um

4260
02:26:12,959 --> 02:26:18,959
since since we don't know

4261
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:21,359
a priori deductively from self-evident

4262
02:26:18,959 --> 02:26:23,119
principles what is best

4263
02:26:21,359 --> 02:26:25,600
it it's best to have a world in which

4264
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:27,040
people are trying different things so a

4265
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:29,359
quick question because the word

4266
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:32,800
nationalism sometimes is presented in a

4267
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:35,120
negative light in connection to

4268
02:26:32,799 --> 02:26:36,799
uh the nationalism of nazi germany for

4269
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:37,920
example

4270
02:26:36,799 --> 02:26:40,159
so

4271
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:43,359
so you're looking empirically

4272
02:26:40,159 --> 02:26:45,680
at a world of nations that respect each

4273
02:26:43,359 --> 02:26:48,399
other i use the word nationalism the way

4274
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:50,800
that i inherited it in my tradition yes

4275
02:26:48,398 --> 02:26:52,478
which is it's a principled standpoint

4276
02:26:50,799 --> 02:26:53,679
that says that the world is governed

4277
02:26:52,478 --> 02:26:54,478
best

4278
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:57,040
when

4279
02:26:54,478 --> 02:26:58,639
uh many nations are able to be

4280
02:26:57,040 --> 02:27:00,960
independent and charge their own course

4281
02:26:58,639 --> 02:27:03,439
that's nationals as far as the nazis

4282
02:27:00,959 --> 02:27:06,239
hitler's an imperialist he hated nation

4283
02:27:03,439 --> 02:27:08,000
states his whole theory if you pick up

4284
02:27:06,239 --> 02:27:09,600
i i don't recommend doing this but if

4285
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,280
you if you do actually reading it right

4286
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:13,280
now mine conference right if you do read

4287
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:16,000
mineconf then you'll see that he says

4288
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:17,520
explicitly that the goal is for germany

4289
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,520
to be

4290
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:22,800
the the lord of the earth and mistress

4291
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:24,800
of the globe and he detests the idea of

4292
02:27:22,799 --> 02:27:27,279
the independent nation state because he

4293
02:27:24,799 --> 02:27:29,279
sees it as weak and effete he might as

4294
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:32,239
well have said it's jewish so let me ask

4295
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:33,840
from the individual perspective

4296
02:27:32,239 --> 02:27:35,840
for nationalism

4297
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:38,478
what do you make of the value of the

4298
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:41,439
love of country

4299
02:27:38,478 --> 02:27:43,279
the reason i connect that so

4300
02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:46,720
i i personally

4301
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:51,439
uh what would you say a patriot i i love

4302
02:27:46,719 --> 02:27:54,639
the love of country or i am suscept or

4303
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:57,120
the in iranian way i enjoy

4304
02:27:54,639 --> 02:27:59,279
i in a

4305
02:27:57,120 --> 02:28:00,800
love is a good word but what do we find

4306
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:02,479
well i love a lot of things but i'm

4307
02:28:00,799 --> 02:28:05,039
saying this particular love is a little

4308
02:28:02,478 --> 02:28:06,318
bit contentious which is loving your

4309
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:08,319
country

4310
02:28:06,318 --> 02:28:10,478
that's an interesting love that some

4311
02:28:08,318 --> 02:28:12,478
people are a little uncomfortable with

4312
02:28:10,478 --> 02:28:14,559
uh even when especially when that love

4313
02:28:12,478 --> 02:28:17,438
you know i grew up in the soviet union

4314
02:28:14,559 --> 02:28:19,039
to say you you know i you you just love

4315
02:28:17,439 --> 02:28:20,639
the country it represents a certain

4316
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:22,640
thing to you and it's not you don't

4317
02:28:20,639 --> 02:28:24,719
think like philosophically like i was

4318
02:28:22,639 --> 02:28:26,799
marching around with with like marks

4319
02:28:24,719 --> 02:28:28,559
under my arm or something like that it's

4320
02:28:26,799 --> 02:28:31,679
just loving

4321
02:28:28,559 --> 02:28:31,680
uh community

4322
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:34,719
at the level of nation it's very

4323
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:36,559
interesting i don't know if that's an

4324
02:28:34,719 --> 02:28:39,279
artifact of the past

4325
02:28:36,559 --> 02:28:41,199
that we're going to have to strip away

4326
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:42,960
i don't know if i was just raised in

4327
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:43,760
that kind of community but i appreciate

4328
02:28:42,959 --> 02:28:45,519
that

4329
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:47,439
my i guess

4330
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:49,600
the thing i'm torn about

4331
02:28:47,439 --> 02:28:52,000
is that love of country

4332
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:53,760
that i have in my heart that i now love

4333
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,040
america and i consider myself an

4334
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:57,280
american

4335
02:28:55,040 --> 02:29:00,160
that would have easily if i was born

4336
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:02,000
earlier been used by stalin

4337
02:29:00,159 --> 02:29:04,559
and i would have proudly died on the

4338
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:07,439
battlefield i would have probably died

4339
02:29:04,559 --> 02:29:09,840
if i was in nazi germany as a german and

4340
02:29:07,439 --> 02:29:12,159
i would proudly die as an american are

4341
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:14,159
you sure about these things yes

4342
02:29:12,159 --> 02:29:16,159
that's interesting no i think about this

4343
02:29:14,159 --> 02:29:18,159
a lot it's interesting to run

4344
02:29:16,159 --> 02:29:20,318
a radical counter factual and be sure of

4345
02:29:18,159 --> 02:29:22,318
the answer i mean i'm not sure i mean

4346
02:29:20,318 --> 02:29:24,239
but i think about this a lot because

4347
02:29:22,318 --> 02:29:27,039
obviously i'm really interested in

4348
02:29:24,239 --> 02:29:29,039
history and i put my this is the way i

4349
02:29:27,040 --> 02:29:31,600
think about most situations as i

4350
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:33,760
empathize i really try to do hard work

4351
02:29:31,600 --> 02:29:36,159
of placing myself in that moment

4352
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:39,439
and thinking through it i'm just okay i

4353
02:29:36,159 --> 02:29:41,200
just know myself psychologically what

4354
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:43,040
what i'm susceptible to

4355
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:45,120
uh that's a negative way to phrase it

4356
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:49,200
but what i would love doing

4357
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:52,079
and so i'm just saying my question is um

4358
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:53,600
is the love of nation

4359
02:29:52,079 --> 02:29:57,120
a useful

4360
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:58,399
or a powerful moral

4361
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:00,960
sort of from a moral philosophy

4362
02:29:58,398 --> 02:30:02,559
perspective uh a good thing

4363
02:30:00,959 --> 02:30:04,398
i think it is a good thing but before we

4364
02:30:02,559 --> 02:30:06,000
ask whether it's a good thing i think

4365
02:30:04,398 --> 02:30:07,840
it's it's worth asking whether there's

4366
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:10,398
any way to live without it

4367
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:13,040
the idea of national independence

4368
02:30:10,398 --> 02:30:15,199
of a world or a continent which

4369
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:17,680
politically is governed by multiple

4370
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:20,000
independent national states that is a

4371
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:23,200
political theory somebody came up with

4372
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:25,120
that you know in the bible or elsewhere

4373
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:27,200
some someone came up with this idea and

4374
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:29,120
sold it and a lot of people like it

4375
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:32,560
but the nation

4376
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:34,399
is not an invention it it

4377
02:30:32,559 --> 02:30:36,079
every place in human history that we

4378
02:30:34,398 --> 02:30:37,439
have any record of

4379
02:30:36,079 --> 02:30:38,318
there are nations

4380
02:30:37,439 --> 02:30:39,760
and

4381
02:30:38,318 --> 02:30:41,439
so

4382
02:30:39,760 --> 02:30:43,280
the the the

4383
02:30:41,439 --> 02:30:45,520
the fact of

4384
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:47,359
people creating families families

4385
02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:48,079
creating an alliance

4386
02:30:47,359 --> 02:30:51,280
of

4387
02:30:48,079 --> 02:30:53,120
of uh of of clans clans creating

4388
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:55,600
alliances of tribes tribes creating

4389
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:56,319
alliances of uh

4390
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:58,720
and

4391
02:30:56,318 --> 02:31:01,359
an alliance that becomes the nation

4392
02:30:58,719 --> 02:31:03,039
we see that everywhere in human history

4393
02:31:01,359 --> 02:31:06,720
everywhere we look

4394
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:09,439
and the love of a group of tribes that

4395
02:31:06,719 --> 02:31:11,039
have come together in order to fight

4396
02:31:09,439 --> 02:31:13,760
opponents that are trying to destroy

4397
02:31:11,040 --> 02:31:16,399
your way of life and you know and this

4398
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:18,000
steal your land and and and and harm

4399
02:31:16,398 --> 02:31:20,398
your women and children

4400
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,600
the the the love of

4401
02:31:20,398 --> 02:31:23,279
uh of

4402
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:24,960
uh the leadership that brings it

4403
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:28,560
together here this is

4404
02:31:24,959 --> 02:31:31,599
you know a george washington type figure

4405
02:31:28,559 --> 02:31:34,959
or an alfred the great type figure or or

4406
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:37,760
or saul the biblical saul somebody who

4407
02:31:34,959 --> 02:31:40,559
has the the wisdom the daring to unite

4408
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:42,398
the tribes overcome their their you know

4409
02:31:40,559 --> 02:31:45,519
their their internal

4410
02:31:42,398 --> 02:31:48,239
uh uh mutual hatreds and grievances and

4411
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:51,680
rally them around uh a set of ideas a

4412
02:31:48,239 --> 02:31:54,639
language a tradition uh a a a a an

4413
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:57,200
identity as people say today that love

4414
02:31:54,639 --> 02:31:58,398
is eradicable from human beings maybe

4415
02:31:57,200 --> 02:32:00,079
we'll have brave new world people will

4416
02:31:58,398 --> 02:32:02,239
take drugs in order to get rid of it the

4417
02:32:00,079 --> 02:32:04,398
problem is that could be leveraged by

4418
02:32:02,239 --> 02:32:06,159
authoritarian regime yes but that's true

4419
02:32:04,398 --> 02:32:07,599
of everything it's like saying you know

4420
02:32:06,159 --> 02:32:09,520
you can have children and you can teach

4421
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:11,359
them to be evil you you can make a lot

4422
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:12,960
of money you can use it for evil you you

4423
02:32:11,359 --> 02:32:14,800
can have a gun for self-defense but you

4424
02:32:12,959 --> 02:32:16,478
can use it for evil come on we just

4425
02:32:14,799 --> 02:32:18,879
that's that's that's human that's being

4426
02:32:16,478 --> 02:32:20,719
human but you guys are making love this

4427
02:32:18,879 --> 02:32:22,398
primary which i don't think it is there

4428
02:32:20,719 --> 02:32:23,599
are lots of people

4429
02:32:22,398 --> 02:32:24,879
i know there are lots of people in the

4430
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:26,559
world out there who don't love their

4431
02:32:24,879 --> 02:32:29,199
nation because their nation is not worth

4432
02:32:26,559 --> 02:32:31,519
loving that is love is conditional it's

4433
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:33,680
not unconditional love is conditioned on

4434
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:35,600
the value that's presented to you you

4435
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:37,760
know so i i lived through this

4436
02:32:35,600 --> 02:32:40,079
experience in my own life right i was i

4437
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:43,680
grew up in a in a in in israel

4438
02:32:40,079 --> 02:32:45,039
at a time uh of of everything was geared

4439
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:47,359
towards

4440
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:51,040
patriotism and in the state

4441
02:32:47,359 --> 02:32:52,720
uh i i would say i was trained to to

4442
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:54,319
when i saw a grenade to jump on it

4443
02:32:52,719 --> 02:32:57,279
because that was

4444
02:32:54,318 --> 02:33:00,000
you know every song and every story and

4445
02:32:57,280 --> 02:33:01,680
everything was about

4446
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,920
the state is everything and you should

4447
02:33:01,680 --> 02:33:06,720
sacrifice and you know when the flag

4448
02:33:03,920 --> 02:33:09,439
went up i got teary-eyed i mean

4449
02:33:06,719 --> 02:33:12,398
i bought into it completely

4450
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:14,000
um and at some point i rejected that and

4451
02:33:12,398 --> 02:33:16,318
i changed and i changed my alliance and

4452
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:17,600
i i rejected my love of israel it's not

4453
02:33:16,318 --> 02:33:19,359
that i don't love it anymore but it's

4454
02:33:17,600 --> 02:33:20,640
certainly not my top love and it's

4455
02:33:19,359 --> 02:33:22,000
certainly i'm certainly not looking for

4456
02:33:20,639 --> 02:33:24,478
the grenade to jump on and i'm

4457
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:27,040
volunteering to go fight the war there

4458
02:33:24,478 --> 02:33:30,079
and and i i fell in love from a distance

4459
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:32,000
with with with the idea of america

4460
02:33:30,079 --> 02:33:34,079
i i love the idea of america more than i

4461
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,760
love america right and and i could see

4462
02:33:34,079 --> 02:33:37,680
myself falling in love out of love with

4463
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:39,760
america given where it's heading right

4464
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:41,840
it's it's not automatic it's it's it's

4465
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:44,159
conditioned on what it is that it

4466
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:45,359
represents and what it is what value it

4467
02:33:44,159 --> 02:33:48,079
represents

4468
02:33:45,359 --> 02:33:50,000
uh for me uh you know and and i think

4469
02:33:48,079 --> 02:33:52,239
that's that's always the case with love

4470
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:55,359
uh you know it's not true

4471
02:33:52,239 --> 02:33:57,600
that children have to love their parents

4472
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:58,640
that's the ideal and and hopefully most

4473
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:00,640
children love their parents because

4474
02:33:58,639 --> 02:34:01,840
their parents but some children fall out

4475
02:34:00,639 --> 02:34:04,159
of love with their parents because their

4476
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:05,920
parents don't deserve their love

4477
02:34:04,159 --> 02:34:07,280
uh and and the same with this is the

4478
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:09,040
same with the other way around i think i

4479
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:11,280
think parents are capable of not loving

4480
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:12,880
their children okay so it's it's love is

4481
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:14,720
a is a conditional thing it's not

4482
02:34:12,879 --> 02:34:16,398
automatic but but let me let me point

4483
02:34:14,719 --> 02:34:17,438
out an agreement with let me say

4484
02:34:16,398 --> 02:34:21,039
something when you agree you're trying

4485
02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:21,040
to bribe me with an agreement okay

4486
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:25,520
right mostly i like to talk to your own

4487
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,040
about his ideas and i don't want to talk

4488
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:28,479
about ein rand but i want to say

4489
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:31,280
something just

4490
02:34:28,478 --> 02:34:33,358
just one one thing about iron ranch uh

4491
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:35,680
all my kids all my kids

4492
02:34:33,359 --> 02:34:37,600
read ayn rand's books my father read the

4493
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:38,800
fountainhead i don't know like you know

4494
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:43,040
like

4495
02:34:38,799 --> 02:34:46,000
we we know ein rand and um

4496
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:48,000
i'll tell you it is incredibly difficult

4497
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:51,280
reading for me it's it's it's painful

4498
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:54,079
it's painful to read why is it painful

4499
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:56,640
not because i disagree with the

4500
02:34:54,079 --> 02:34:58,959
with with the view of of trading and

4501
02:34:56,639 --> 02:35:00,959
business and the creativity of it and

4502
02:34:58,959 --> 02:35:03,759
and you know and and reardon metal i

4503
02:35:00,959 --> 02:35:06,559
mean you know that stuff that stuff uh

4504
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:07,760
moves me and and and and and i i do

4505
02:35:06,559 --> 02:35:08,799
admire it

4506
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:10,719
but

4507
02:35:08,799 --> 02:35:13,358
to read you know a book that's a

4508
02:35:10,719 --> 02:35:17,358
thousand pages long in which

4509
02:35:13,359 --> 02:35:20,399
nobody nobody is having children nobody

4510
02:35:17,359 --> 02:35:23,439
is having a stable marriage no one is

4511
02:35:20,398 --> 02:35:25,199
running a uh an admirable government

4512
02:35:23,439 --> 02:35:28,880
that's fighting for a just cause

4513
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:31,439
anywhere anywhere euron i it i feel i

4514
02:35:28,879 --> 02:35:34,559
just i feel like like

4515
02:35:31,439 --> 02:35:37,120
it's focusing on one aspect of what it

4516
02:35:34,559 --> 02:35:39,680
is to be human and to flourish and that

4517
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:41,359
everything else is just erased and

4518
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:43,680
thrown out as though it's just not part

4519
02:35:41,359 --> 02:35:46,559
of reality and i'm scared i'm scared of

4520
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:48,800
what happens to to to teenagers who

4521
02:35:46,559 --> 02:35:51,680
hormonally or in any case know that

4522
02:35:48,799 --> 02:35:53,679
that's their they're programmed to to uh

4523
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,520
to pull away from their parents and

4524
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:57,680
experiment with things they're

4525
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:58,479
they're biologically programmed to do

4526
02:35:57,680 --> 02:36:00,960
that

4527
02:35:58,478 --> 02:36:01,920
and you give them a book which says

4528
02:36:00,959 --> 02:36:03,679
look

4529
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:05,280
you you don't you don't have to have a

4530
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:06,559
family you don't have to raise children

4531
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:08,399
you don't have to have a country you

4532
02:36:06,559 --> 02:36:10,318
don't have to fight for anything all you

4533
02:36:08,398 --> 02:36:12,478
have to do is

4534
02:36:10,318 --> 02:36:14,559
assert yourself and trade

4535
02:36:12,478 --> 02:36:17,279
i i i think it's destructive because

4536
02:36:14,559 --> 02:36:19,519
it's not realistic it's just not real

4537
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:22,000
but i got none of that for mine rent

4538
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:23,840
i got none of that from my man you know

4539
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:26,318
the the the books were not about a

4540
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:28,559
family uh you could write a book in in

4541
02:36:26,318 --> 02:36:31,199
iron man style about

4542
02:36:28,559 --> 02:36:33,600
where where people have a family but

4543
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:36,399
the goal the purpose it's a novel it's

4544
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:38,399
not it's a novel which is delimited with

4545
02:36:36,398 --> 02:36:40,639
a particular story there's one family in

4546
02:36:38,398 --> 02:36:42,239
goat gulch and there's a little passage

4547
02:36:40,639 --> 02:36:45,840
about raising children and the value of

4548
02:36:42,239 --> 02:36:47,840
that uh because it's not core to what

4549
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:49,840
she is writing about but that doesn't

4550
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:51,680
exclude it i ne when i read i read i

4551
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:53,920
read out of struggle when i was 16 and i

4552
02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:56,079
read it over over the years uh several

4553
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:57,600
times more it never occurred to me oh

4554
02:36:56,079 --> 02:37:00,159
ain't man's anti-family i shouldn't have

4555
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:01,840
a family it that that thought never came

4556
02:37:00,159 --> 02:37:03,520
into my mind i i always wanted to have

4557
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:04,880
children i continued to want to have

4558
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:06,720
children

4559
02:37:04,879 --> 02:37:08,398
i thought of it a little differently i

4560
02:37:06,719 --> 02:37:10,239
thought of how i would find a partner a

4561
02:37:08,398 --> 02:37:12,559
little bit differently i thought about

4562
02:37:10,239 --> 02:37:15,039
what i would look for in a partner

4563
02:37:12,559 --> 02:37:17,279
differently but not that i wouldn't want

4564
02:37:15,040 --> 02:37:20,000
to get married the question i i have is

4565
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:22,159
what effect has in society so outside of

4566
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:23,840
you so for example you mentioned love

4567
02:37:22,159 --> 02:37:25,680
should be conditional i think well it is

4568
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:27,120
whether you like it or not it is you

4569
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:28,559
might pretend that it isn't but it's

4570
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:30,479
always conditional well let me try to

4571
02:37:28,559 --> 02:37:34,398
say something and see if it makes any

4572
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:37,119
sense so could there be things that are

4573
02:37:34,398 --> 02:37:40,959
true like love is conditional is always

4574
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:43,280
conditional that if you say it often

4575
02:37:40,959 --> 02:37:44,639
it has a negative effect on society so

4576
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:47,760
for example

4577
02:37:44,639 --> 02:37:50,000
i mean uh so maybe i'm just a romantic

4578
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:52,079
but good luck saying love is conditional

4579
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:53,680
to a romantic partner

4580
02:37:52,079 --> 02:37:56,079
i mean you could

4581
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:58,880
i would argue on mass

4582
02:37:56,079 --> 02:38:00,559
that would uh deteriorate the quality of

4583
02:37:58,879 --> 02:38:04,318
relationships

4584
02:38:00,559 --> 02:38:05,279
uh if you remind the partner of that

4585
02:38:04,318 --> 02:38:09,199
truth

4586
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:11,200
that is universal like you have to the

4587
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:13,040
the i mean okay maybe it's just me i'll

4588
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:15,359
just speak to myself it's like there's a

4589
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:17,680
certain romantic notion of unconditional

4590
02:38:15,359 --> 02:38:19,840
love it's part of why

4591
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:21,600
you have so many destructive marriages

4592
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:23,920
it's it's part of why you say that's a

4593
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:25,760
problem yes it's it's a real problem

4594
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:28,000
because because

4595
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:30,318
yes there is a you are talked about

4596
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:32,719
honoring your spouse and and there's a

4597
02:38:30,318 --> 02:38:33,519
real truth there and i i i respect that

4598
02:38:32,719 --> 02:38:35,679
yes

4599
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:37,680
you have to do certain things love is

4600
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:39,040
not you marry somebody and there's a

4601
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:40,479
real attitude out there in the culture

4602
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:42,720
you marry somebody and okay now we're

4603
02:38:40,478 --> 02:38:44,239
gonna we're just gonna cruise it's just

4604
02:38:42,719 --> 02:38:46,478
right hollywood that's that's the

4605
02:38:44,239 --> 02:38:49,359
hollywood map you know marriage is work

4606
02:38:46,478 --> 02:38:51,119
it it it it's like all values it's work

4607
02:38:49,359 --> 02:38:52,720
it it's something you have to reignite

4608
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:55,200
every day you have to you have to the

4609
02:38:52,719 --> 02:38:58,318
challenges the real disagreements the

4610
02:38:55,200 --> 02:39:00,720
the the the the things you you fight

4611
02:38:58,318 --> 02:39:03,600
about you disagree about and and there's

4612
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:06,799
real if it's a value you work it out you

4613
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:08,399
you you you struggle through it you you

4614
02:39:06,799 --> 02:39:10,478
and and sometimes you struggle through

4615
02:39:08,398 --> 02:39:12,559
it you come to a conclusion nah this is

4616
02:39:10,478 --> 02:39:14,559
not gonna work and and you dissolve a

4617
02:39:12,559 --> 02:39:15,600
marriage and i'm i'm all for dissolving

4618
02:39:14,559 --> 02:39:17,279
after

4619
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:19,200
really really fighting for it because if

4620
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:21,359
it's an important value and if you fell

4621
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:23,280
in love with this person for a reason

4622
02:39:21,359 --> 02:39:24,720
then that's something worth fighting for

4623
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:27,040
i have a feeling that hollywood goes the

4624
02:39:24,719 --> 02:39:29,039
other way but it's not this cruising

4625
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:30,479
along and everything everything is easy

4626
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:32,800
no human relationship is like that

4627
02:39:30,478 --> 02:39:35,679
enough friendship not love not not not

4628
02:39:32,799 --> 02:39:38,639
not raising children not being a child

4629
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:40,800
um you know they require work and and

4630
02:39:38,639 --> 02:39:43,039
they require thinking and they require

4631
02:39:40,799 --> 02:39:44,959
creating the conditions

4632
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:47,040
to thrive and that's the sense in which

4633
02:39:44,959 --> 02:39:48,159
it's it's conditional you you have to

4634
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:51,600
look at it

4635
02:39:48,159 --> 02:39:53,280
and it it's in in

4636
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:55,200
it's very easy

4637
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:56,720
not to do the work and it's very easy to

4638
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:58,640
drift away and i think most people don't

4639
02:39:56,719 --> 02:40:00,559
do the work most people take it and

4640
02:39:58,639 --> 02:40:03,358
generally in life they the only place

4641
02:40:00,559 --> 02:40:04,719
people seem to work is at work

4642
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:06,479
and then they take the rest of their

4643
02:40:04,719 --> 02:40:08,639
life as i'm gonna cruise

4644
02:40:06,478 --> 02:40:10,159
and yet every aspect of your life the

4645
02:40:08,639 --> 02:40:12,239
art you choose

4646
02:40:10,159 --> 02:40:13,200
the friends you choose the lovers you

4647
02:40:12,239 --> 02:40:16,799
choose

4648
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:18,960
all require real thinking and real work

4649
02:40:16,799 --> 02:40:20,879
to be successful at them none of them

4650
02:40:18,959 --> 02:40:22,478
are just

4651
02:40:20,879 --> 02:40:24,719
just there because there is no such

4652
02:40:22,478 --> 02:40:26,239
thing as just the intrinsic right i

4653
02:40:24,719 --> 02:40:29,199
agree with all of that i was going to

4654
02:40:26,239 --> 02:40:32,559
say before that the rabbis have this uh

4655
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:32,560
sort of shocking expression

4656
02:40:34,719 --> 02:40:39,760
the pain of raising

4657
02:40:37,279 --> 02:40:42,000
raising children and uh

4658
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:45,040
i i find when i speak to audiences about

4659
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:46,879
relationships i find that that in

4660
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:48,240
general and this is a this is

4661
02:40:46,879 --> 02:40:49,599
cross-cultural it's for different

4662
02:40:48,239 --> 02:40:52,159
countries different religious

4663
02:40:49,600 --> 02:40:53,279
backgrounds that in general

4664
02:40:52,159 --> 02:40:56,239
young people

4665
02:40:53,279 --> 02:40:59,200
do not know that the only way to make a

4666
02:40:56,239 --> 02:41:02,478
marriage work is through a lot of pain

4667
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:04,479
and overcoming they don't know that

4668
02:41:02,478 --> 02:41:07,679
raising children involves a great deal

4669
02:41:04,478 --> 02:41:10,000
of pain they don't know that caring for

4670
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:12,318
and helping your parents approach the

4671
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:14,079
end of their lives causes a great deal

4672
02:41:12,318 --> 02:41:16,318
of pain and and

4673
02:41:14,079 --> 02:41:18,478
everything is kind of this sketchy you

4674
02:41:16,318 --> 02:41:20,719
know very very sketchy glimpsy kind of

4675
02:41:18,478 --> 02:41:23,519
and i i mentioned hollywood just because

4676
02:41:20,719 --> 02:41:24,879
it it it everything is is made to look

4677
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:26,800
easy except you know there's kind of a

4678
02:41:24,879 --> 02:41:28,639
funny breakdown of something but then it

4679
02:41:26,799 --> 02:41:29,920
you know maybe there's a divorce they

4680
02:41:28,639 --> 02:41:31,519
you know they shoot one another so

4681
02:41:29,920 --> 02:41:32,239
that's so then they should get divorced

4682
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:35,200
but

4683
02:41:32,239 --> 02:41:38,959
but the the reality of

4684
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:39,840
of how hard it is to do

4685
02:41:38,959 --> 02:41:42,159
and

4686
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:44,639
how heroic it is to to do it and then

4687
02:41:42,159 --> 02:41:47,760
overcome and then actually in the end

4688
02:41:44,639 --> 02:41:49,199
achieve something create something that

4689
02:41:47,760 --> 02:41:51,359
that was really

4690
02:41:49,200 --> 02:41:53,359
it's almost it's almost not it's almost

4691
02:41:51,359 --> 02:41:56,720
not discussed and and so i look to me

4692
02:41:53,359 --> 02:41:59,520
it's just not surprising that

4693
02:41:56,719 --> 02:42:02,478
if if there's no parallel to ein rand

4694
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:04,079
about you know the the the heroic saving

4695
02:42:02,478 --> 02:42:05,599
of a marriage that was on the rocks how

4696
02:42:04,079 --> 02:42:06,959
does it actually happen

4697
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:08,079
so

4698
02:42:06,959 --> 02:42:09,599
so

4699
02:42:08,079 --> 02:42:10,559
it's a good point you're making an in

4700
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:11,760
but

4701
02:42:10,559 --> 02:42:13,439
something just came to me that i've

4702
02:42:11,760 --> 02:42:16,318
never thought of before so that's always

4703
02:42:13,439 --> 02:42:18,239
good this is where conversation is good

4704
02:42:16,318 --> 02:42:20,559
look

4705
02:42:18,239 --> 02:42:22,159
take the talmud and and and by i can't

4706
02:42:20,559 --> 02:42:24,559
remember how many years after the bible

4707
02:42:22,159 --> 02:42:26,159
talmud is written how many over how how

4708
02:42:24,559 --> 02:42:28,239
long of a period it's written how many

4709
02:42:26,159 --> 02:42:30,239
people participating in writing it

4710
02:42:28,239 --> 02:42:31,359
ein rand was one individual

4711
02:42:30,239 --> 02:42:33,119
she wrote a series of books in

4712
02:42:31,359 --> 02:42:35,120
philosophy which i think

4713
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:36,240
are true and and but they're the

4714
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:38,160
beginning

4715
02:42:36,239 --> 02:42:40,478
there's a lot of work to be done

4716
02:42:38,159 --> 02:42:42,478
it's it to apply this so

4717
02:42:40,478 --> 02:42:43,599
uh hopefully there will be one of her

4718
02:42:42,478 --> 02:42:45,278
students who writes a book on

4719
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:47,200
relationships

4720
02:42:45,279 --> 02:42:48,960
and there'll be a a a a somebody who

4721
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:50,880
writes a book on on developing a

4722
02:42:48,959 --> 02:42:53,199
political theory in greater detail and

4723
02:42:50,879 --> 02:42:54,719
and develop her ethics she's got like

4724
02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:56,720
she's got she's got a few writings on

4725
02:42:54,719 --> 02:42:58,318
ethics and it's in the novels but but

4726
02:42:56,719 --> 02:43:00,000
there's a lot of work to be done

4727
02:42:58,318 --> 02:43:00,639
fleshing it out what does it mean how do

4728
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,559
you

4729
02:43:00,639 --> 02:43:03,680
so to to say iron man didn't do

4730
02:43:02,559 --> 02:43:06,318
everything

4731
02:43:03,680 --> 02:43:08,800
is a truism she didn't do everything

4732
02:43:06,318 --> 02:43:11,039
okay so what but she laid this amazing

4733
02:43:08,799 --> 02:43:13,519
philosophical foundation that allows us

4734
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:16,080
to take those principles and to apply

4735
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:17,920
them to all these realms of human life

4736
02:43:16,079 --> 02:43:19,439
and she does it on a scope that few

4737
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:21,120
philosophers in human history have done

4738
02:43:19,439 --> 02:43:23,279
because she goes from metaphysics all

4739
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:25,120
the way to aesthetics hitting the key

4740
02:43:23,279 --> 02:43:26,479
and she's an original think on each one

4741
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:27,279
of those things

4742
02:43:26,478 --> 02:43:28,879
and

4743
02:43:27,279 --> 02:43:30,880
she might be right she might be wrong on

4744
02:43:28,879 --> 02:43:32,318
certain aspects of it

4745
02:43:30,879 --> 02:43:33,920
always happy to have a debate about

4746
02:43:32,318 --> 02:43:36,478
whether where she's wrong or where she's

4747
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:39,279
not but there's a lot of work to be done

4748
02:43:36,478 --> 02:43:41,599
right it's not like and if if there were

4749
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:43,200
objectivists out there who presented as

4750
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:45,200
okay human knowledge is over because

4751
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:47,760
iron man wrote these books that's absurd

4752
02:43:45,200 --> 02:43:49,920
right this huge amount of work to be

4753
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:52,239
done in applying these particular ideas

4754
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:54,000
just like they was for any philosophy

4755
02:43:52,239 --> 02:43:56,318
take these ideas and now apply them to

4756
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:58,719
all these realms and human experience

4757
02:43:56,318 --> 02:44:00,398
that flesh it out and make it and one of

4758
02:43:58,719 --> 02:44:02,159
the reasons i don't think objectivism

4759
02:44:00,398 --> 02:44:04,719
has taken off is because there's all

4760
02:44:02,159 --> 02:44:07,119
this work still to be done that allows

4761
02:44:04,719 --> 02:44:09,199
it to be relatable to to people in every

4762
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:11,040
aspect of them let me ask a hard

4763
02:44:09,200 --> 02:44:12,399
question here we've we've got we've

4764
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:14,960
taken can i say what i agreed with you

4765
02:44:12,398 --> 02:44:18,239
all sure sure this is good it's a good

4766
02:44:14,959 --> 02:44:20,079
transition here this is the clip this is

4767
02:44:18,239 --> 02:44:22,079
this is the clip i mean i agree about

4768
02:44:20,079 --> 02:44:24,639
nations so i i don't like the term

4769
02:44:22,079 --> 02:44:26,239
nationalism because i i i fear what

4770
02:44:24,639 --> 02:44:28,959
happens when you put in ism at the end

4771
02:44:26,239 --> 02:44:32,398
of any anywhere anything yes but but the

4772
02:44:28,959 --> 02:44:34,879
nation is is a good thing then and and

4773
02:44:32,398 --> 02:44:36,719
having a diversity of nations in a sense

4774
02:44:34,879 --> 02:44:38,559
it's a good thing and in this sense

4775
02:44:36,719 --> 02:44:42,559
in this sense i don't think one can come

4776
02:44:38,559 --> 02:44:44,559
up so look i i i said i hold that the

4777
02:44:42,559 --> 02:44:46,478
ideal nation is a nation that protects

4778
02:44:44,559 --> 02:44:48,079
individual rights

4779
02:44:46,478 --> 02:44:49,840
how do you do that

4780
02:44:48,079 --> 02:44:51,520
what are the details how do we define

4781
02:44:49,840 --> 02:44:52,559
property rights exactly in an internet

4782
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:54,000
world

4783
02:44:52,559 --> 02:44:56,478
there's going to be disagreement

4784
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:59,120
rational reasonable disagreement they're

4785
02:44:56,478 --> 02:45:01,199
going to be in in my

4786
02:44:59,120 --> 02:45:03,359
future in the 300 years from now when my

4787
02:45:01,200 --> 02:45:05,439
ideas have won finally right there will

4788
02:45:03,359 --> 02:45:07,200
be multiple nations trying to apply the

4789
02:45:05,439 --> 02:45:09,359
principle of applying individual rights

4790
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:11,680
and they'll do it differently one of the

4791
02:45:09,359 --> 02:45:12,880
one of the benefits of federalism

4792
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:14,800
is that while you have a national

4793
02:45:12,879 --> 02:45:16,719
government there are certain issues that

4794
02:45:14,799 --> 02:45:19,519
you relegate to states and they can try

4795
02:45:16,719 --> 02:45:22,159
different things and learn because there

4796
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:23,920
is a huge value in the empirical

4797
02:45:22,159 --> 02:45:26,079
knowledge comes the you can't just

4798
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:28,799
deduce it all and figure it all out you

4799
02:45:26,079 --> 02:45:30,959
have to experiment so i do

4800
02:45:28,799 --> 02:45:32,719
i hate the idea of a one world na one

4801
02:45:30,959 --> 02:45:34,799
world government because

4802
02:45:32,719 --> 02:45:37,199
experimentation is gone and if you make

4803
02:45:34,799 --> 02:45:39,039
a mistake everybody suffers

4804
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:41,760
i like the idea and then i like the idea

4805
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:45,200
of people being able to to choose

4806
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:47,120
where they live but but this notion of

4807
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:48,640
experimentation i think is crucial but

4808
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:50,640
you need a principle

4809
02:45:48,639 --> 02:45:52,159
this is you need a principle so i don't

4810
02:45:50,639 --> 02:45:53,920
like the idea of nations if all the

4811
02:45:52,159 --> 02:45:55,760
nations are going to be

4812
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:58,079
bad right if all the nations are going

4813
02:45:55,760 --> 02:46:00,398
to be horrible then i don't like it what

4814
02:45:58,079 --> 02:46:01,680
i like is a variety of nations all

4815
02:46:00,398 --> 02:46:03,760
practicing

4816
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:05,520
basically good ideas

4817
02:46:03,760 --> 02:46:07,600
and then we try to figure out okay what

4818
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:09,600
works better than other things and and

4819
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:10,399
and what is sustainable and what is not

4820
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:13,279
given

4821
02:46:10,398 --> 02:46:15,119
how many difficult aspects of

4822
02:46:13,279 --> 02:46:16,880
history and society we've talked about

4823
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:18,399
let me ask a hard question of both of

4824
02:46:16,879 --> 02:46:21,679
you

4825
02:46:18,398 --> 02:46:25,199
breathe up until now yeah

4826
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:28,000
what gives you hope about the future

4827
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:31,359
so we've been describing um

4828
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:33,680
reasons to maybe not have hope

4829
02:46:31,359 --> 02:46:35,120
what gives you hope when you look at the

4830
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:37,279
world

4831
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:39,760
what gives you hope that in 200 years

4832
02:46:37,279 --> 02:46:41,680
and 300 years and 500 years like the the

4833
02:46:39,760 --> 02:46:42,960
founders look into the future

4834
02:46:41,680 --> 02:46:45,600
that

4835
02:46:42,959 --> 02:46:47,919
human civilization will be all right and

4836
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:49,359
and more than that it would flourish two

4837
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:52,559
things for me

4838
02:46:49,359 --> 02:46:54,559
one is history so in the very long run

4839
02:46:52,559 --> 02:46:57,039
good ideas went out

4840
02:46:54,559 --> 02:46:58,559
i think in the very long run you can go

4841
02:46:57,040 --> 02:46:59,920
through dark ages but you come out of

4842
02:46:58,559 --> 02:47:01,199
the dark ages

4843
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:03,439
um

4844
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:06,560
you know the the the the the good and

4845
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:08,960
the just does win in the end even if it

4846
02:47:06,559 --> 02:47:10,719
is bloody and difficult and and hard to

4847
02:47:08,959 --> 02:47:12,478
get there so while i am quite

4848
02:47:10,719 --> 02:47:15,119
pessimistic unfortunately about the

4849
02:47:12,478 --> 02:47:17,840
short run i'm ultimately optimistic that

4850
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:19,520
that in the long run good ideas win and

4851
02:47:17,840 --> 02:47:21,279
and they're justified and and and i

4852
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:23,040
think the fundamental

4853
02:47:21,279 --> 02:47:26,239
behind that is

4854
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:28,399
i i think is is that i'm fundamentally

4855
02:47:26,239 --> 02:47:29,840
positive about human nature i i think

4856
02:47:28,398 --> 02:47:32,639
human beings

4857
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:33,760
um can think uh they're capable of

4858
02:47:32,639 --> 02:47:35,920
reasoning

4859
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:37,840
they're capable of figuring out the

4860
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:40,079
truth they're capable of learning from

4861
02:47:37,840 --> 02:47:42,079
experience they don't always do it it's

4862
02:47:40,079 --> 02:47:44,719
an achievement to do it

4863
02:47:42,079 --> 02:47:46,318
but over time they do

4864
02:47:44,719 --> 02:47:48,639
and and if you create the right

4865
02:47:46,318 --> 02:47:51,119
circumstances they will and when things

4866
02:47:48,639 --> 02:47:53,680
get bad enough they look

4867
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:55,200
for way out they look at maybe at

4868
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:57,600
history if the history is available to

4869
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:59,040
them maybe at just

4870
02:47:57,600 --> 02:48:01,600
learning from the

4871
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:03,359
from from what's around them to find

4872
02:48:01,600 --> 02:48:06,318
better ways of doing things and that

4873
02:48:03,359 --> 02:48:08,479
reinforces itself but human beings are

4874
02:48:06,318 --> 02:48:11,199
an amazing

4875
02:48:08,478 --> 02:48:13,358
creature right we're just amazing in our

4876
02:48:11,200 --> 02:48:15,359
capacity to be creative in our capacity

4877
02:48:13,359 --> 02:48:17,200
to think in a capacity to love and that

4878
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:18,479
capacity to change our environment to

4879
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:20,240
fit our needs and to fit our

4880
02:48:18,478 --> 02:48:23,438
requirements for survival

4881
02:48:20,239 --> 02:48:25,920
and to learn and to grow and to progress

4882
02:48:23,439 --> 02:48:28,159
and uh

4883
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:30,478
you know so so again long term i think

4884
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:34,398
all that wins out short-term in any

4885
02:48:30,478 --> 02:48:35,920
point in history short-term um

4886
02:48:34,398 --> 02:48:37,920
it doesn't right now it doesn't look too

4887
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:40,318
good

4888
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:44,000
what about you yeah well

4889
02:48:40,318 --> 02:48:48,559
as usual i i moved by by what euron says

4890
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:51,359
and i and uh and i hear scripture and uh

4891
02:48:48,559 --> 02:48:52,318
the the source for euron's

4892
02:48:51,359 --> 02:48:53,520
hope

4893
02:48:52,318 --> 02:48:54,478
um

4894
02:48:53,520 --> 02:48:56,800
is

4895
02:48:54,478 --> 02:48:58,879
uh the book of exodus

4896
02:48:56,799 --> 02:49:00,719
which is the first place in human

4897
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:03,759
history where

4898
02:49:00,719 --> 02:49:06,478
we we are presented with the possibility

4899
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:08,478
that an enslaved people that's being

4900
02:49:06,478 --> 02:49:10,799
persecuted and murdered and living under

4901
02:49:08,478 --> 02:49:12,959
the worst possible regime

4902
02:49:10,799 --> 02:49:15,599
can free itself

4903
02:49:12,959 --> 02:49:16,799
and have a shot a life of independence

4904
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:20,239
and worth

4905
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:22,959
and it's another inherited jewish idea

4906
02:49:20,239 --> 02:49:24,079
in the in in the tradition

4907
02:49:22,959 --> 02:49:25,278
um

4908
02:49:24,079 --> 02:49:27,439
the way that we

4909
02:49:25,279 --> 02:49:31,120
express this is by saying

4910
02:49:27,439 --> 02:49:34,159
um that that there is a god who judges

4911
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:36,560
the the the israelites in egypt were

4912
02:49:34,159 --> 02:49:38,398
were enslaved for hundreds of years

4913
02:49:36,559 --> 02:49:40,559
according to the exodus story hundreds

4914
02:49:38,398 --> 02:49:42,478
of years before god wakes up and

4915
02:49:40,559 --> 02:49:45,199
and and and hears them and and he

4916
02:49:42,478 --> 02:49:48,159
doesn't do anything until until you know

4917
02:49:45,200 --> 02:49:50,640
moses uh uh kills the oppressor and and

4918
02:49:48,159 --> 02:49:52,639
and goes out into the desert so

4919
02:49:50,639 --> 02:49:55,278
um so i i think it's

4920
02:49:52,639 --> 02:49:58,799
pretty realistic that you know there's a

4921
02:49:55,279 --> 02:50:01,359
god that god judges and acts but

4922
02:49:58,799 --> 02:50:03,119
probably you know often not for a very

4923
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:05,200
very long time and not until there's

4924
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:06,640
there's a human being who who gets up

4925
02:50:05,200 --> 02:50:08,399
and says enough

4926
02:50:06,639 --> 02:50:10,000
i know that today people don't want to

4927
02:50:08,398 --> 02:50:13,199
read the bible they don't like reading

4928
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:14,639
the bible but i always hear in my ear uh

4929
02:50:13,200 --> 02:50:16,800
this uh

4930
02:50:14,639 --> 02:50:20,639
uh cry of the prophet

4931
02:50:16,799 --> 02:50:24,318
jeremiah who saw his his nation

4932
02:50:20,639 --> 02:50:27,039
destroyed and and these people exiled

4933
02:50:24,318 --> 02:50:28,959
and he says um

4934
02:50:27,040 --> 02:50:30,640
in in god's name he says he's not my

4935
02:50:28,959 --> 02:50:32,318
word

4936
02:50:30,639 --> 02:50:34,559
like fire

4937
02:50:32,318 --> 02:50:37,119
like the hammer that shatters rock a

4938
02:50:34,559 --> 02:50:37,119
petition

4939
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:41,600
my word is like fire like the hammers

4940
02:50:39,840 --> 02:50:43,279
that shatters rock

4941
02:50:41,600 --> 02:50:44,960
and this is actually this is the

4942
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:46,960
traditional way of saying something like

4943
02:50:44,959 --> 02:50:49,519
what you're on is saying that it may

4944
02:50:46,959 --> 02:50:52,079
take a long long time but that but there

4945
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:54,079
there is a truth and it has its own

4946
02:50:52,079 --> 02:50:55,680
strength and it will

4947
02:50:54,079 --> 02:50:58,398
in the end

4948
02:50:55,680 --> 02:50:59,279
shatter the things that are opposing it

4949
02:50:58,398 --> 02:51:01,199
that's

4950
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:02,880
that's our traditional hope we

4951
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:03,840
we grow up like that

4952
02:51:02,879 --> 02:51:05,199
and um

4953
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:08,000
[Music]

4954
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:09,920
you know so so i i do have hope i i see

4955
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,879
the trends the trends are terrible right

4956
02:51:09,920 --> 02:51:12,559
now

4957
02:51:10,879 --> 02:51:14,318
and uh and

4958
02:51:12,559 --> 02:51:16,639
and and and it's frightening and it's

4959
02:51:14,318 --> 02:51:20,079
hard but we are terrible at seeing the

4960
02:51:16,639 --> 02:51:22,318
future and it is very possible that an

4961
02:51:20,079 --> 02:51:23,600
unexpected turn of events is going to

4962
02:51:22,318 --> 02:51:26,639
appear

4963
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:28,960
you know maybe soon maybe much later and

4964
02:51:26,639 --> 02:51:30,879
uh the possibility of

4965
02:51:28,959 --> 02:51:33,438
uh of a redemption

4966
02:51:30,879 --> 02:51:35,519
um is there

4967
02:51:33,439 --> 02:51:37,279
let me ask given that long arc of

4968
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:39,439
history given that you do study the

4969
02:51:37,279 --> 02:51:40,800
bible

4970
02:51:39,439 --> 02:51:42,720
what is

4971
02:51:40,799 --> 02:51:44,719
the meaning of this whole thing what's

4972
02:51:42,719 --> 02:51:47,119
the meaning of life

4973
02:51:44,719 --> 02:51:49,438
wow that's beautiful i think that the

4974
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:50,240
meaning of of life is

4975
02:51:49,439 --> 02:51:51,920
uh

4976
02:51:50,239 --> 02:51:54,879
is in part

4977
02:51:51,920 --> 02:51:56,239
um what euron touches on when when he

4978
02:51:54,879 --> 02:51:58,000
says that

4979
02:51:56,239 --> 02:52:00,799
uh that um

4980
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:02,239
the productive work labor creativity is

4981
02:52:00,799 --> 02:52:03,278
is at the heart of what it is to be

4982
02:52:02,239 --> 02:52:04,239
human

4983
02:52:03,279 --> 02:52:06,399
i i

4984
02:52:04,239 --> 02:52:08,959
i just think that there there are

4985
02:52:06,398 --> 02:52:11,358
some more arenas and maybe we even agree

4986
02:52:08,959 --> 02:52:12,318
with a lot of them and i i on a lot of

4987
02:52:11,359 --> 02:52:14,479
them

4988
02:52:12,318 --> 02:52:18,879
to be human is to

4989
02:52:14,478 --> 02:52:20,959
inherit a world which is imperfect

4990
02:52:18,879 --> 02:52:21,920
terribly imperfect and perfect in many

4991
02:52:20,959 --> 02:52:26,159
ways

4992
02:52:21,920 --> 02:52:28,639
and uh and and god created it

4993
02:52:26,159 --> 02:52:30,478
that way he created a world which is

4994
02:52:28,639 --> 02:52:33,760
terribly lacking

4995
02:52:30,478 --> 02:52:36,159
and he created us with the ability to

4996
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:38,880
stand up and to say

4997
02:52:36,159 --> 02:52:40,719
i can change the direction of this i can

4998
02:52:38,879 --> 02:52:41,839
do something to change the direction of

4999
02:52:40,719 --> 02:52:43,760
this i can

5000
02:52:41,840 --> 02:52:46,079
take the time and the abilities that are

5001
02:52:43,760 --> 02:52:47,920
given to me to be a partner with god in

5002
02:52:46,079 --> 02:52:50,879
creating the world it's not going to

5003
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:52,079
stay the way it was before me it'll be

5004
02:52:50,879 --> 02:52:53,839
something

5005
02:52:52,079 --> 02:52:56,719
different

5006
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:59,439
maybe a little bit maybe a lot but

5007
02:52:56,719 --> 02:53:02,318
that's that is that is the heart that is

5008
02:52:59,439 --> 02:53:04,960
the key that is the meaningful life is

5009
02:53:02,318 --> 02:53:06,879
to be a partner with god in creating the

5010
02:53:04,959 --> 02:53:08,799
world so that it is

5011
02:53:06,879 --> 02:53:11,358
moving that much more in the right

5012
02:53:08,799 --> 02:53:13,519
direction rather than

5013
02:53:11,359 --> 02:53:16,399
the way we found so nudge even if a

5014
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:19,760
little bit the direction of the world

5015
02:53:16,398 --> 02:53:21,358
well uh you're you're on uh

5016
02:53:19,760 --> 02:53:24,880
you've actually been talking on your

5017
02:53:21,359 --> 02:53:26,720
program about life quite a bit uh so let

5018
02:53:24,879 --> 02:53:28,799
me ask the same question

5019
02:53:26,719 --> 02:53:31,119
and i i never tire you asking this

5020
02:53:28,799 --> 02:53:31,119
question

5021
02:53:32,318 --> 02:53:35,840
what do you think is the is the meaning

5022
02:53:34,239 --> 02:53:38,959
of the soul well i mean i don't believe

5023
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:42,079
in god so it god doesn't play a role in

5024
02:53:38,959 --> 02:53:44,719
in my view of of the meaning of life i i

5025
02:53:42,079 --> 02:53:47,600
think the meaning of life is to live

5026
02:53:44,719 --> 02:53:51,119
i like to say to live with a capital l

5027
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:52,880
it's to embrace it and and

5028
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:55,840
agree with your arm in a sense you were

5029
02:53:52,879 --> 02:53:57,519
born into a world and as human beings

5030
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:58,960
one of the things that makes us very

5031
02:53:57,520 --> 02:54:01,120
different than other animals is our

5032
02:53:58,959 --> 02:54:02,959
capacity to change that world

5033
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:05,040
we can actually go out there and change

5034
02:54:02,959 --> 02:54:07,199
the world around us we can change it

5035
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:09,600
materially through production and

5036
02:54:07,200 --> 02:54:11,760
through we can change it spiritually

5037
02:54:09,600 --> 02:54:14,079
through changing the ideas of of people

5038
02:54:11,760 --> 02:54:17,439
we can we can change the direction into

5039
02:54:14,079 --> 02:54:19,680
which humanity works we can um we can

5040
02:54:17,439 --> 02:54:21,279
create a little universe part of

5041
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:23,359
that i think part of the joy of creating

5042
02:54:21,279 --> 02:54:25,760
a family is to create a little universe

5043
02:54:23,359 --> 02:54:28,720
right we're creating a little world uh

5044
02:54:25,760 --> 02:54:30,239
around us that's part of the the joy

5045
02:54:28,719 --> 02:54:32,318
and there is joy and family that's uh

5046
02:54:30,239 --> 02:54:34,559
make it all about uh difficulty and hard

5047
02:54:32,318 --> 02:54:36,398
work i agree i agree you know but part

5048
02:54:34,559 --> 02:54:38,879
of the part of the the idea of getting

5049
02:54:36,398 --> 02:54:40,719
married is is to create a little world

5050
02:54:38,879 --> 02:54:42,239
in which you and your spouse are

5051
02:54:40,719 --> 02:54:44,719
creating something that didn't exist

5052
02:54:42,239 --> 02:54:46,559
before and and and building something

5053
02:54:44,719 --> 02:54:48,478
building a universe but it's really to

5054
02:54:46,559 --> 02:54:51,278
live i mean one of the things that

5055
02:54:48,478 --> 02:54:52,799
i i see and and that saddens me is is

5056
02:54:51,279 --> 02:54:54,479
wasted lives

5057
02:54:52,799 --> 02:54:56,239
it's people who just

5058
02:54:54,478 --> 02:54:58,398
just cruise through life they just they

5059
02:54:56,239 --> 02:55:00,239
just they get bored they get born in a

5060
02:54:58,398 --> 02:55:01,680
particular place they never challenge it

5061
02:55:00,239 --> 02:55:02,959
they never question

5062
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:04,960
they just

5063
02:55:02,959 --> 02:55:06,478
you know they live die and nothing

5064
02:55:04,959 --> 02:55:07,679
really happened nothing really changed

5065
02:55:06,478 --> 02:55:10,159
they didn't produce they didn't make

5066
02:55:07,680 --> 02:55:12,479
anything of their life and produce here

5067
02:55:10,159 --> 02:55:14,879
again in the in their largest sense

5068
02:55:12,478 --> 02:55:16,478
so to me it's it's and every aspect of

5069
02:55:14,879 --> 02:55:18,159
life you know as you know because you've

5070
02:55:16,478 --> 02:55:20,239
listened to my show i love art i love

5071
02:55:18,159 --> 02:55:21,600
aesthetics i love the experience of

5072
02:55:20,239 --> 02:55:24,239
great art

5073
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:27,520
you know i love relationships i you know

5074
02:55:24,239 --> 02:55:30,159
i i love producing i'm you know i like

5075
02:55:27,520 --> 02:55:33,040
business i like that that aspect of it

5076
02:55:30,159 --> 02:55:35,840
um and and i think i think people people

5077
02:55:33,040 --> 02:55:38,240
are shallow in in so many parts of their

5078
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:39,840
lives which saddens me i mean if we if

5079
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:41,279
you had eight billion people on this

5080
02:55:39,840 --> 02:55:42,639
planet

5081
02:55:41,279 --> 02:55:44,800
even if it never grew even if we just

5082
02:55:42,639 --> 02:55:46,478
stayed at 8 billion but the 8 billion

5083
02:55:44,799 --> 02:55:48,398
all lived

5084
02:55:46,478 --> 02:55:50,799
fully wow i mean

5085
02:55:48,398 --> 02:55:52,719
what an amazing place this would be what

5086
02:55:50,799 --> 02:55:54,879
an amazing experience we would have so

5087
02:55:52,719 --> 02:55:56,959
so to me that is the meaning is just

5088
02:55:54,879 --> 02:55:58,559
make the most you have a short period of

5089
02:55:56,959 --> 02:56:01,039
time on earth

5090
02:55:58,559 --> 02:56:03,039
and that's it this is it and and live it

5091
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:05,120
experience it fully and and challenge

5092
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:07,120
yourself and push yourself and and let

5093
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:10,000
me just say something about optimism

5094
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:12,319
about you know one source of hope for me

5095
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:14,159
in the world in which we live right now

5096
02:56:12,318 --> 02:56:16,879
is that there are people who do that at

5097
02:56:14,159 --> 02:56:19,600
least in certain realms of of their

5098
02:56:16,879 --> 02:56:21,679
lives right and and i'm inspired

5099
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:23,200
and and i know a lot of people don't

5100
02:56:21,680 --> 02:56:24,800
like me for this but i'm inspired for

5101
02:56:23,200 --> 02:56:26,479
example by silicon valley in spite of

5102
02:56:24,799 --> 02:56:28,318
all the political disagreements i have

5103
02:56:26,478 --> 02:56:29,519
with them and all of that i'm inspired

5104
02:56:28,318 --> 02:56:31,199
by people

5105
02:56:29,520 --> 02:56:33,279
inventing new technologies and building

5106
02:56:31,200 --> 02:56:35,120
i'm inspired by by the people you talk

5107
02:56:33,279 --> 02:56:37,439
to about artificial intelligence and

5108
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:39,680
about about new ideas and about pushing

5109
02:56:37,439 --> 02:56:41,760
the boundaries of science those things

5110
02:56:39,680 --> 02:56:43,359
are exciting and it's it's terrific to

5111
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:46,079
see a world that i think generally is in

5112
02:56:43,359 --> 02:56:49,120
decline yet that these pockets in which

5113
02:56:46,079 --> 02:56:51,439
people are still creating new uh new

5114
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:53,439
ventures and new ideas and new things

5115
02:56:51,439 --> 02:56:55,200
that that inspires me and it gives me

5116
02:56:53,439 --> 02:56:57,279
hope that that is not dead that in spite

5117
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:59,359
of the decay that's in our culture

5118
02:56:57,279 --> 02:57:02,000
there's still pockets where

5119
02:56:59,359 --> 02:57:04,318
that spirit of being human is still is

5120
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:07,120
still alive and well yeah they inspire

5121
02:57:04,318 --> 02:57:10,079
