1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,240
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,878
carl hart department chair and professor

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,879
of psychology at columbia university

4
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,759
he's the author of several books on the

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,559
topic of drugs including his most recent

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,359
called drug use for grown-ups that

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:19,759
challenges us to quote use empirical

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,679
evidence to guide public policy even if

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
it makes us uncomfortable

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,039
his research on drugs including hard

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,960
drugs like heroin and cocaine challenges

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,359
much of what we think we know about

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,000
drugs and their role in society

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,480
his main thesis is that drug addiction

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,159
has less to do with the drugs themselves

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,878
and more to do with co-occurring

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:44,000
psychiatric disorders such as depression

18
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:46,079
and schizophrenia and socioeconomic

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,238
factors such as unemployment

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,759
underemployment and resource deprivation

21
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,839
within the community

22
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,320
in addition he believes that we should

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,039
legalize all drugs so if people choose

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,920
to use them they could do so responsibly

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,480
and openly and get help if needed in a

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,799
controlled safe environment

27
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,359
his ideas are controversial but are

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,439
fundamentally grounded in empirical data

29
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,118
and rigorous scientific studies

30
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:13,279
i don't know if his conclusions are

31
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:14,640
right but they are at least worth

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,519
thinking about

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,239
so i ask that you consider these ideas

34
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,158
with an open mind and as always make

35
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,319
sure you exercise your critical thinking

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,479
skills in making decisions about

37
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:30,000
substances you put in your body

38
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:32,959
you are a free thinking being

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,759
the main character if you will the hero

40
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,519
in a story that's being written by you

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,319
so at the end of the day you are

42
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,399
responsible for the choices you make so

43
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,639
choose wisely

44
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,799
this is the lex friedman podcast to

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,439
support it please check out our sponsors

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,280
in the description and now here's my

47
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,599
conversation with carl hart

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,680
i think it is bold and powerful to admit

49
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,438
to using in your private life the drugs

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,520
that you study in your research

51
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,639
including heroin and cocaine so let me

52
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,798
ask

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,640
what is the experience of taking heroin

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,800
like what happens to the body what

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,759
happens to the mind when you take it

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,520
well you know i take mdma cannabis and

57
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,959
all the rest of these drugs too i've

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,840
tried those drugs um the experience in

59
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,840
the body and the mind i i don't really

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,520
know what people want to know and in

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,920
that regard it's like saying what is the

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,879
experience of having an orgasm

63
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:31,518
in the body in the mind or or some other

64
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:34,079
sort of event that you really enjoy

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,759
um so i don't really know what people

66
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,280
say what poetry is for for describing

67
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,159
these kinds of experiences i mean i

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,199
guess

69
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,598
uh given mdma given psilocybin

70
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,199
in the full context of that maybe it's

71
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,639
more useful to say

72
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,199
what are the

73
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,518
differences in experiences that your

74
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,359
mind goes through uh like chemically

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,680
biologically

76
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,440
uh so it's like keeping it strictly to

77
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
the sort of the

78
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,158
the the biology of it versus the full

79
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,000
environmental human experience yeah see

80
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,759
this is a mistake that people make all

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,919
the time they try to act as if biology

82
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,318
is the only determinant of drug effects

83
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,399
and that's just not how it works uh you

84
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,119
need the environment you need the cage

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,519
as they say if you don't have the cage

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,319
you don't get the full extent of the

87
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,319
effects and so like you can take mdma

88
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,560
and have an awful time you can have a

89
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,958
time in which uh which you get paranoid

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,719
and so forth and then

91
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,878
you can take it that drug under the

92
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,799
right conditions and it'd just be like

93
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,719
one of the best moments you've ever had

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,920
it certainly enhanced

95
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,239
um a number of my relationships but i've

96
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,238
also had some times with mdma that

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,719
haven't been so lovely when the people

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,480
who you are hanging out with

99
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,719
you don't know them you're distrustful

100
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,878
and all of those kind of things so

101
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,359
it's important to put context in it now

102
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,598
we can talk about drugs at a biochemical

103
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,040
level at a biological level and we kind

104
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,959
of do that in this country with this

105
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,639
fascination with neuroscience

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,319
and um

107
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,039
that's an inappropriate kind of

108
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,560
fascination the way in the way we talk

109
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,239
about it so we can talk about opioids

110
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,120
and then we can talk about

111
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,438
endogenous opioid system in the brain we

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,160
can talk about dopamine and other sort

113
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,040
of

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,359
monoamine transmitters and and what uh

115
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,800
opioids are doing to them and we can do

116
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:27,758
the same thing with mdma um and

117
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,360
we won't be any closer to understanding

118
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,080
the sort of uh

119
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,240
experience that is induced by these

120
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,560
drugs certainly the experience that we

121
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,240
all seek you know what i'm saying so

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,839
getting a positive experience or getting

123
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,400
a negative experience is strongly

124
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,638
defined by the environment strongly

125
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,758
dependent upon that but the environment

126
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,600
is a very

127
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,800
it's a short word that can describe a

128
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,840
lot of things

129
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,439
so

130
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,039
would you say the environment is

131
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,519
important are the people

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,439
where you are currently in your life

133
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,680
or is it also dependent on the full

134
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,439
trajectory of your psychology of your

135
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,759
life experiences of your parents or the

136
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,000
people you came up with of the trauma

137
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,720
you've experienced of the hopes and

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,038
dreams that were crushed or or or not or

139
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,560
the opposite or the success levels or

140
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,639
all those things like what

141
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,120
what are the interesting sort of uh

142
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,960
landscape of experiences that contribute

143
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,360
to how you actually

144
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,439
feel when you take a drug right on

145
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,439
so all of those things are important but

146
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,519
you know like if someone had trauma in

147
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,600
childhood and they did the work and they

148
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,519
dealt with it that's not so important in

149
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,919
this case but if they didn't deal with

150
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,279
it and that trauma is being triggered in

151
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,799
that event

152
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,198
in that moment

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,478
then it's important but let's just take

154
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,199
somebody like me

155
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,199
i'm 54 years old i'll be 55 this month

156
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,360
actually and um

157
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,319
you know i've done a lot of work in

158
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,560
terms of figuring out who i am and i'm

159
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:56,319
comfortable with myself

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,240
and i know how to set limits for

161
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,160
whatever it is i'm doing

162
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,639
um and so

163
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,120
i know i need to work out i know i need

164
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,759
to eat well i know i need to sleep well

165
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,800
i know i need to be in an environment

166
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,120
with people within my trust

167
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,560
and then if all of those things are met

168
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,000
oh it's likely to be a good time you

169
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,319
know what i'm saying but if i haven't

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,079
slept if i haven't worked out if i don't

171
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,160
feel good

172
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,240
it won't be a good time but

173
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
i try and be responsible and take care

174
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,680
of my

175
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:34,000
eating habits sleeping habits make sure

176
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,639
my responsibilities are taken care of

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,839
and so when i'm in that moment

178
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,079
i just

179
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,799
enjoy that moment i'm there i'm not

180
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,719
thinking about a bill that i didn't paid

181
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
i'm not thinking about

182
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,240
oh i forgot to do this for my kid i'm

183
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,840
not thinking about that because all of

184
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,079
those things are taken care of if

185
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,318
they're not taken care of it will impact

186
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:57,359
the experience and it may negatively

187
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,360
impact the experience

188
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,318
well that is the counterintuitive even

189
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,960
controversial finding from your recent

190
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,960
book so we should kind of

191
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,719
i know it seems obvious to you but i

192
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,318
think a lot of people hearing this would

193
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,240
think it's quite non-obvious so um

194
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,479
in your new book uh drug use for

195
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
grown-ups you write

196
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,478
for the findings section i discovered

197
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,399
that the predominant effects produced by

198
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,680
the drugs discussed in this book are

199
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,758
positive

200
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,840
i it didn't matter whether the drug in

201
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,360
question was cannabis cocaine heroin

202
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,758
methamphetamine or psilocybin

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,960
overwhelmingly consumers express feeling

204
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,280
more altruistic empathetic euphoric

205
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,038
focused grateful and tranquil

206
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,879
they also experience enhanced social

207
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,639
interactions a great sense of purpose

208
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,279
and meaning and increased sexual

209
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,439
intimacy and performance this console

210
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,119
this constellation of findings

211
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,879
challenged my original beliefs about

212
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,360
drugs and their effects

213
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,360
i had been indoctrinated to be biased

214
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,319
toward the negative effects of drug use

215
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,000
but over the past two plus decades i had

216
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,080
gained a deeper more nuanced

217
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,319
understanding

218
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,758
these words are very counterintuitive to

219
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,199
a lot of people

220
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,879
um

221
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,199
i think like you also mentioned in the

222
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,160
book and elsewhere you know people have

223
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,120
come around to maybe psilocybin

224
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,039
uh being one such drug maybe cannabis

225
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,360
being once this drug but you also

226
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,199
mention other drugs like cocaine heroin

227
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,720
methamphetamine

228
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,879
um can you just linger on this point

229
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,560
how

230
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,719
do we get the positive effects of those

231
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,239
drugs and why in the media and the

232
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,680
general conception we have of these

233
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,320
drugs is that they were going to

234
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,199
make a bad life worse or ruin a good

235
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,120
life

236
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
well so your first question was how do

237
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,720
we

238
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,159
harness the positive effects how do we

239
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,040
increase the likelihood of getting the

240
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,240
positive effects again like i said we

241
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,480
want to make sure that people are

242
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,799
responsible and they've handled their

243
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,959
responsibilities make sure they eat well

244
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,359
sleep will exercise all of those sorts

245
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,518
of things play an important point role

246
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
and also if they know exactly what

247
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,200
they're getting and then they're not

248
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,919
paranoid about oh it's something

249
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,240
contaminated in some adulterant

250
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,639
in my drug um so you want to make sure

251
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,799
you know exactly what you have once you

252
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,958
satisfy those kind of things you

253
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,359
understand the dose and potency you

254
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:25,759
understand all those things to decrease

255
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,440
any sort of anxiety you might have about

256
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,120
the substance itself

257
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,200
it increases the likelihood that you

258
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,560
will have a better time so anxiety is

259
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,040
the big one you need to remove the

260
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,958
anxiety anxiety is critical

261
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,719
it's huge

262
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,679
many of the negative effects that we see

263
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,920
with drugs have to do with anxiety and

264
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,319
not necessarily anxiety because the drug

265
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:49,199
induced it it's the anxiety that the

266
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,680
situation induced a lot of times

267
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,399
and then you ask like well why does this

268
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,479
sound counter-intuitive why

269
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,958
does the media

270
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,200
report uh differently

271
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:04,159
well because it's money in reporting the

272
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,519
negative effects almost exclusively

273
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,159
think about

274
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,720
writing a newspaper article

275
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,799
it's really easy to get the population

276
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,360
all genned up about something like an

277
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,599
opioid crisis overdoses and you don't

278
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,759
even have to tell people

279
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,360
how to keep people safe if you're

280
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,838
talking about overdose you don't even

281
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,639
have to say why people are dying from

282
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,959
overdoses like overdoses in our country

283
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,360
happen largely because people get

284
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:34,159
contaminated drug because people are

285
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,039
combining sedatives and they don't know

286
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,879
that this enhances the respiratory

287
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,199
depressing effects of drugs they don't

288
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,600
know but when you read these newspaper

289
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,240
articles they don't say this they don't

290
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,480
say how to keep people safe all they do

291
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,000
is frighten the population

292
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,159
there's money in that and then we think

293
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,278
about people who write tv shows um the

294
00:10:54,159 --> 00:11:00,319
people who write movies uh most of the

295
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:03,039
stuff written by drugs is just [ __ ]

296
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,278
um i think about i love going to watch

297
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,958
comedians and the comedians when they

298
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:09,439
talk about drugs again most of the

299
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,599
things that they say about drugs

300
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,000
is [ __ ] i mean you can say the

301
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,240
stupidest things about drugs and be

302
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,039
believed you can

303
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,600
write a movie and you don't even have to

304
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,519
develop your characters if you throw

305
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,440
drugs into the mix you say oh he's a

306
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,039
drug dealer you don't have to say

307
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,760
anything about that person's background

308
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,319
or about that person being developed as

309
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,958
a character uh because the population

310
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,560
think they know and when and and the

311
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,399
writer uh is lazy and does not do any

312
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,479
sort of development just just think

313
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,399
about any

314
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,039
oh let's think about the sopranos for

315
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,879
example uh you know they they have a new

316
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,240
program coming out so let's think about

317
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:54,000
them for a second

318
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,879
the sopranos is a show in which um the

319
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,919
league character tony kills people for a

320
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:03,278
living that's what he does right

321
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:05,439
this character actually made a

322
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,519
sympathetic for him

323
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,279
when he is

324
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,919
besmirching and

325
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,559
denigrating his nephew christopher for

326
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:17,599
using a drug and we feel

327
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:20,799
sympathy for tony the character

328
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,278
who just killed somebody

329
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,639
who is a horrible person but

330
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,639
being a drug user is a worse person

331
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,399
that's what the show wants us to believe

332
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,039
tony's a racist

333
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,120
uh murderer all of these things but we

334
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,000
feel sympathy for him but we don't feel

335
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,078
sympathy for anyone who uses drugs

336
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,120
that's some crazy [ __ ] i mean and the

337
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:46,000
american public buys into it that is

338
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,159
that's wild to me and that we all bought

339
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,480
into this crap and that's what we do in

340
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,360
damnit everything

341
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,920
that's in film on television and it's

342
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,278
like what's wrong with you people

343
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,399
so

344
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:03,039
why aren't there not more stories of

345
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,639
grown-ups using drugs

346
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,120
the full spectrum of drugs that we're

347
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,278
talking about why isn't there so we

348
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,919
talked offline about joe rogan he's

349
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,519
somebody who started smoking weed later

350
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,919
in life which is an interesting story

351
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,360
like when he's already very successful

352
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,278
and he has a very interesting way of

353
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,159
describing his experience with weed that

354
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,600
it was like enhancing this productivity

355
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,519
it actually i think he says like it

356
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,399
increases anxiety a little bit in a way

357
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,320
that

358
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,519
was productive like paranoia and not

359
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,680
anxiety

360
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,000
and so that's an interesting story of an

361
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,879
adult talking about the use of weed for

362
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,399
for but for productivity purposes

363
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,240
but you don't get those stories very

364
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,958
often why

365
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,560
um i think fear people are afraid that

366
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,319
they will be uh belittled uh dismissed

367
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,719
all of these things that's a drug addict

368
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,879
or some negative thing but cannabis is

369
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,959
lightweight come on uh you can you can

370
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,159
admit cannabis these days and the fact

371
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,119
that

372
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,439
i don't know when joe started but if he

373
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,039
did start later in life that's cool i

374
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,079
mean you are mature developed um you

375
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,519
have developed some

376
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:12,479
responsibility skills all of these kind

377
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,480
of things this is a good thing um you

378
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,120
don't want people to

379
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,519
engage in any kind of behaviors

380
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,240
when they're young and immature that

381
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,320
might put them in harm's way and so we

382
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,560
want people to be

383
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,399
developed at least

384
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,319
i mean whether it's

385
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:35,519
being in a relationship with a a partner

386
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,120
uh or whether it's driving an automobile

387
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,879
all of these things that can be

388
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,519
potentially harmful but

389
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,159
uh extremely beneficial if you are

390
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,839
responsible enough to handle them um you

391
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,439
want people to be mature so that's a

392
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,120
good thing so

393
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,440
how are you supposed to like somebody

394
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,759
like me somebody like joe how are you

395
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,360
supposed to understand what the dangers

396
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,120
are what the negative effects are so you

397
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,199
said automobile

398
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,519
relationships

399
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:04,319
i think i have uh

400
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,000
a reasonably it's crappy but

401
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
reasonable understanding of all the

402
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,320
troubles i can get with in relationships

403
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,199
and what things to avoid same thing with

404
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,920
driving a car i have no idea i'm in the

405
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,879
dark in terms of what

406
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:21,599
are the things to be careful about what

407
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,919
to avoid with drucke with drug use

408
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,199
when we're talking about the heavy drugs

409
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,439
have you ever drank alcohol yes

410
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,758
i know i drink a lot but i understand

411
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,639
that because culturally i came up

412
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,800
i was taught a lot of like this is what

413
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,959
you don't do and this is what you do

414
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,799
yeah this is when you drink a lot i mean

415
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,399
you see the effects you see the there's

416
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,958
a lot of negative examples there's

417
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,839
positive examples of social stimulant

418
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,559
there's examples of great artists using

419
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,240
uh

420
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,359
alcohol to sort of

421
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,600
i don't know

422
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,240
to help be the catalyst for that magic

423
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,480
moment for you know all of that i don't

424
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,198
i have some examples now

425
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,120
especially in america the same with weed

426
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,599
more and more you're starting to get a

427
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,519
lot of stories on uh sec of the

428
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,800
psychedelics of different kinds there's

429
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,039
um

430
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:14,000
psilocybin where you have

431
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:16,879
uh mushrooms or even mdma used

432
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,639
sort of positively there's kind of like

433
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,559
negative

434
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,720
stories from the past about acid about

435
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,119
lsd being used

436
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,440
ultimately for productive like

437
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,120
uh for productive ends but it destroyed

438
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,320
the person that's kind of how the story

439
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,159
goes it was like a trade-off you take uh

440
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,000
it's like uh what is it robert johnson

441
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,240
sold his soul to the devil to learn

442
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,440
guitar like it's a trade-off you could

443
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,959
take the drug you're going to create

444
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,639
some good stuff but you have to pay for

445
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,039
it those are the stories that's some

446
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,959
[ __ ] we tell children come on

447
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,439
that's exactly right you're exactly

448
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,599
right these fairy tales these cautionary

449
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,680
tales that we tell people

450
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,399
we have to grow up that's what the book

451
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:59,278
is about drug use drug use for grown-ups

452
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,799
um you know we tell people

453
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,120
pinocchio

454
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,720
if you lie your nose grow

455
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,558
who believes that who believes that

456
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,400
there are fairy tales but that's exactly

457
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:12,318
what these stories are they're in the

458
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,400
same vein as those kind of stories as

459
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,918
pinocchio um

460
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,480
you know like you said when you were

461
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,280
learning about alcohol you were told

462
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,720
what to do what not to do so forth the

463
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:27,519
same can be true with mdma with cocaine

464
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,240
with heroin the same is true because

465
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,240
there are some times when you there are

466
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,919
some potential dangers that you should

467
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,960
avoid and um i wrote about some of them

468
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,038
um

469
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,200
certainly in my work just throughout all

470
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,558
of my writings we i talk about those

471
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,919
kind of things and other people talk

472
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,839
about these things

473
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,799
the problem is

474
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:52,000
is that we're getting our education

475
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:55,038
from [ __ ] sources from people who

476
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,759
believe in this kind of pinocchio thing

477
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,759
and it just does not fit with the

478
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,599
evidence and the evidence

479
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,200
we all publish in the scientific

480
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,399
literature all these things that i'm

481
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,200
saying

482
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,919
it's there in the literature i mean at a

483
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,759
place like columbia we give these drugs

484
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,520
thousands of doses

485
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,879
every year

486
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,359
do you think

487
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,360
we would be doing this and we do this

488
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,678
with research grants that's public

489
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:24,558
that's funded by the public taxpayers

490
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,360
dollars do you think we would be allowed

491
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:29,359
to do this if these drugs were so

492
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,079
dangerous

493
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,678
it's just nonsense i mean and the drugs

494
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:35,119
we're talking about

495
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,480
they are all

496
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:40,639
approved for medical use somewhere in

497
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,240
the world

498
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,799
and the studies you conduct are

499
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,319
basically asking what kinds of questions

500
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,160
so you take

501
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,720
uh the full range of drugs you're

502
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,000
talking about uh from from marijuana to

503
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,600
cell cybin to mdma to cocaine and heroin

504
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,200
what is the study looking at like what

505
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,639
the actual experience with the positive

506
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,919
and negative effects of the experience

507
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,720
on the drug are

508
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,480
in uh controlled conditions yeah so we

509
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,600
did these kind of experiments with

510
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,759
alcohol

511
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,119
nicotine all these drugs in order to

512
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:13,679
have an empirical database

513
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,279
to tell people um

514
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,240
exactly what these drugs do and what

515
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,399
they don't do the conditions under which

516
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,240
the drugs will produce positive effects

517
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,080
the conditions under which the drugs

518
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,038
were more likely to produce negative

519
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,359
effects

520
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,279
all of this information is important for

521
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,599
a society to know

522
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,918
and we do know and and that's why we're

523
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,399
collecting the data we're collecting the

524
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,320
data it to help us

525
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,559
with treatment if someone is having

526
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:43,038
problems with these data

527
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:45,119
hopefully we'll uh understand

528
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,319
more about the

529
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,558
how to

530
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,399
help them deal with their problems based

531
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,000
on some of the research that we're doing

532
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
so what kind of negative effects are we

533
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
looking out for like what what are the

534
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,759
properties of drugs we should be careful

535
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,519
about is it addictive properties how

536
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,480
addictive it is how

537
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,240
how uh destructive or painful whatever

538
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,839
the uh

539
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,120
the

540
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:08,319
withdrawal processes

541
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,319
what kind of things are we looking out

542
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,678
for yeah those are certain kind of

543
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,918
questions we certainly have asked

544
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,120
because like uh something like cry

545
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,159
cocaine versus alcohol or

546
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:22,798
heroin when it comes to uh withdrawal of

547
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,360
physical dependence like cocaine has a

548
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,839
very limited sort of uh withdrawal

549
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,158
symptoms i mean it's hard to see uh same

550
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,839
is true with methamphetamine but uh with

551
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,919
heroin you certainly can see a

552
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,359
withdrawal syndrome that's displeasing

553
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,759
that's unpleasant

554
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,240
but with alcohol that would draw

555
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,720
can actually kill you so heroin is

556
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,720
unpleasant and not lovely but with

557
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,480
alcohol withdrawal that's the one that's

558
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,600
the most dangerous i mean all of these

559
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,880
kind of questions we want to know um

560
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,359
answers to uh and and so when we think

561
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,880
about uh heroin or some other drugs and

562
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,038
you say like what kind of negative

563
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,520
effects negative effects we don't talk

564
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,200
about much in the society the main thing

565
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,798
that really concerns me about like

566
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:10,159
heroin use really is constipation so if

567
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:12,798
people uh are using uh heroin on a

568
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,559
regular basis and then they have a sort

569
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:18,240
of slowing of their gut motility they're

570
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,879
in they're likely to increase

571
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,679
constipation and that's not good i mean

572
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,679
for your general health but we never

573
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,798
talk about that in this society and

574
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,120
that's probably the most important thing

575
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,038
aside from the fact that people get

576
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,798
contaminated street drugs and that sort

577
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,400
of stuff and increase the likelihood of

578
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:40,400
maybe dying from some contaminant or

579
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,480
people who are inexperienced and they're

580
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,600
mixing heroin with other sedatives

581
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,120
that's not good but the constipation

582
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:52,319
is a huge one um and then other sort of

583
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:54,239
drugs negative effects um like the

584
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,240
amphetamines all of the amphetamines

585
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,798
they differ they disrupt sleep food

586
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,519
intake all of these things are so

587
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,200
critical for sustaining human life

588
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,918
but we never talk about that because

589
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,000
it's not as sexy as this nonsense that

590
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,159
people write about like addiction

591
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
addiction has almost nothing to do with

592
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,120
the drugs themselves and i make that

593
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
comment because um the vast majority

594
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,639
abuser for users for any drug

595
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,880
never become addicted and so if the vast

596
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,038
majority of users don't become addicted

597
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,039
then you have to move beyond the drug

598
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,759
when you're talking about the phenomena

599
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,000
interest in this case addiction and and

600
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,400
so when we think about addiction it has

601
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,798
much more to do with our psychosocial

602
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,400
environment than the drug itself

603
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,639
but that's not sexy

604
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,200
so addiction is even the property of the

605
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,200
environment not a property um a result

606
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,200
of the environment it certainly can be

607
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,240
there are people who are

608
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,720
suffering from uh uh co-occurring mental

609
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,359
illness like uh depression anxiety i

610
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,360
mean that's within the person of course

611
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,079
and that increases the likelihood for

612
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:01,678
addiction so that could that's um

613
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,879
not so much the environment but there

614
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,120
are people who

615
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,679
for example they have chronic

616
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:10,079
unrealistic expectations heaped on them

617
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,840
and those people are more likely to have

618
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,240
some problems with drugs

619
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,199
there are people who are just immature

620
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,440
not

621
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,080
develop having developed responsibility

622
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,519
skills they are likely to have some

623
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,599
problems if they

624
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:27,038
engage in some of these behaviors there

625
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:29,519
are people who lost their jobs covert

626
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,440
factories went away a wide range of

627
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,839
things and those people used to have

628
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,798
standing in their community now they

629
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:39,199
have none um those people might be

630
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,200
susceptible to having a drug related

631
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,759
problem if they indulge

632
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,400
all of these kind of issues are far more

633
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,679
important than the drug itself

634
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,320
so they could seek escape in a

635
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,320
particular drug i mean there is a

636
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,558
biochemical thing to each of these drugs

637
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,558
and some more some pull you in harder

638
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,720
than others when you need the escape

639
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,240
right when you're not doing well in life

640
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,159
what evidence you have for that belief i

641
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,359
don't i yeah because there is none there

642
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,400
is absolutely none i mean people say

643
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:10,558
stuff like that and um

644
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,880
that's the problem that's precisely the

645
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,639
problem see i'm operating from limited

646
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,400
personal evidence

647
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,960
well this is a problem though but we

648
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,080
have a scientific database yeah we don't

649
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,919
need personal evidence for this we have

650
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,839
in my book i try to go through some of

651
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,440
the science so people could unders

652
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,839
understand it's like

653
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,519
uh when you have a math problem you

654
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,000
don't want people saying well you know i

655
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,839
feel like this [ __ ] what you feel what

656
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,720
does the data say

657
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,720
so

658
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,120
one of the problems with the data so one

659
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,400
day it is the the there's the studies

660
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,079
that you're doing this is excellent

661
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,440
research work but there's some of the

662
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:50,240
drugs are illegal yes and some are legal

663
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,320
um so you have just

664
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,798
it's unfortunate that some of the drugs

665
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,798
are illegal or how whatever you believe

666
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,038
but there's not enough of a data set of

667
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:02,000
uh public in the open use that's like

668
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,158
you in the wild data set it'd be nice to

669
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,359
do you know thousands of people and see

670
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,278
from all the different kinds of

671
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,839
environments and all that kind of stuff

672
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:13,359
to get an understanding i think we have

673
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:17,038
a substantial a substantial database but

674
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,399
people just ignore it got it

675
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,000
that said

676
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,440
let me ask you the question of

677
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,960
legalization

678
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,798
so

679
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,079
should in your view all drugs be

680
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,319
legalized

681
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,678
the drugs that people seek certainly

682
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,399
should be legally

683
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,240
regulated and available to adults so

684
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:39,759
when i say the drugs people seek like

685
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,599
cannabis mdma cocaine heroin um

686
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,839
those drugs certainly should be

687
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,480
available and some of the psychedelics

688
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,000
that people seek um now the thing about

689
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,000
it is that

690
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,400
some people uh

691
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,400
think that oh we'll be a free fall these

692
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,720
drugs are available to everyone that's

693
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
not true i mean it will be there will be

694
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,240
age requirements and maybe other

695
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,080
requirements but they should be

696
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,000
available and

697
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,879
we should also do like what we do with

698
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,839
alcohol we can put enough alcohol in a

699
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,400
bottle to kill you but we don't so we

700
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:15,359
regulate it such that the amount that's

701
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,240
in the bottle uh enhances the safety and

702
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,000
minimizes the potential harms

703
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,120
we can do the same thing with these

704
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,119
other drugs and we can also say okay we

705
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:28,798
won't be selling intravenous

706
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:30,558
preparations of any of these drugs these

707
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,519
the drugs that the routes of

708
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,359
administration will be oral and i don't

709
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:38,558
know let's say uh

710
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:41,599
uh intranasal

711
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:44,798
again routes of administration the dose

712
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:48,480
that you have in each unit um

713
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:50,079
all can minimize harm based on how you

714
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,599
do these things and we can do that we

715
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:55,278
have the technology we have the know-how

716
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,519
so you're actually making me think about

717
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,960
alcohol a little bit so if i were say

718
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,278
the drugs become legalized in the way

719
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,519
you're describing and me

720
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:06,798
lex wanted to

721
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:10,079
as an adult explore some of these drugs

722
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:12,400
what are some procedures do you think

723
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,798
for sort of safe

724
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,320
positive exploration of those drugs

725
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,240
the reason i say i'm thinking about

726
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,720
alcohol because i don't think

727
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,399
besides not putting enough alcohol in a

728
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,159
bottle to kill you

729
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,239
i don't think anyone ever gave me

730
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,600
specific instructions i think it's kind

731
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,519
of word of mouth and examples of people

732
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,398
doing the wrong thing you kind of get it

733
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,720
through osmosis that way yeah is that

734
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,798
basically what we would do this kind of

735
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,200
free exploration of use no we have to

736
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,158
change our education about these things

737
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,080
i mean

738
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,159
um let's just take a drug like cocaine

739
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,439
cocaine is a stimulant

740
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,640
and you want to make sure people

741
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,120
understand that they shouldn't be taking

742
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,520
cocaine their bedtime and you know they

743
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,959
need to get a certain amount of

744
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,879
hours of sleep

745
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,798
and um they need to get up in the

746
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,120
morning cocaine probably isn't a drug

747
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,679
for you at night certainly not

748
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,678
um certainly not amphetamines at night

749
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,200
for most people and also if you want to

750
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,360
make sure that you they need to

751
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,000
understand that cocaine

752
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,918
can also disrupt your food intake not as

753
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,679
much as the amphetamines but all of

754
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,200
these kind of things people need to know

755
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,720
so they can have

756
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:24,080
proper nutrition and they can

757
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,079
time their drug use around these other

758
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,240
important functions that's the same

759
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:32,960
human night so we have to make sure that

760
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:35,919
we um educate people we can't just uh

761
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,759
throw people in a while that's stupid

762
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,520
i gotta tell you i mean for me

763
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:42,319
and even given your book and for people

764
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,000
listening to this it's still

765
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,759
it's still tough to hear that the thing

766
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,319
we should be concerned about with

767
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:48,319
cocaine

768
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,399
is the same as with caffeine

769
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:54,398
don't take it before bed and the thing

770
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:58,359
we should be concerned with heroin

771
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,359
is constipation yeah

772
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,679
okay

773
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,640
but

774
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,320
the questions i keep wanting to ask you

775
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,759
i should be asking the same things of

776
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,519
alcohol

777
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,679
but when you're not doing well

778
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:15,119
psychologically in the ways you describe

779
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,120
when the environment is not right

780
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,759
there's some aspect in which saying that

781
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:25,038
drugs can be used responsibly and

782
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:28,240
effectively and mostly positive

783
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:30,000
can uh give those folks a pass

784
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,679
to use it instead of working on

785
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,640
themselves and fixing their environment

786
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,480
first

787
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,399
i i don't know what what do you want me

788
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,759
to say to that i mean they have access

789
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,839
to alcohol they have access to them

790
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,000
you know we live in this country called

791
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,319
the united states where our declaration

792
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,319
of independence says that

793
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:50,798
we are free to live like we want to live

794
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,558
so long as we don't uh disrupt other

795
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,839
people from doing the same

796
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:57,918
um but it's remarkable to me how we try

797
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,359
to control the behaviors of other people

798
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,640
that's just

799
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:01,599
remarkable

800
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,278
yeah

801
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,798
and uh that's partially what your book

802
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,960
is about i mean it's not just about

803
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,359
drugs it's about freedom that's the

804
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,079
bigger issue that we can't get to it's

805
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:11,759
like

806
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,599
this issue of

807
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,398
freedom and freedom comes with a

808
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,879
tremendous amount of responsibility i am

809
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,759
responsible for my neighbors my brothers

810
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,120
i mean

811
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:23,599
i can't

812
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,439
impede their freedoms like some people

813
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,918
think that their freedom supersedes

814
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,840
everybody else's freedoms no and that's

815
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,960
what i'm trying to remind people in this

816
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,480
book

817
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,720
i am

818
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,519
uh responsible to you um as a citizen um

819
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,440
and

820
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:41,599
we're in this together

821
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,759
and i tried to make that point in the

822
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,918
book and people

823
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,119
have conveniently ignored things like

824
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,600
that

825
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,678
do you think the war on drugs

826
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,439
has done more positive or negative for

827
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,440
the world

828
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,720
depends on which world you live in the

829
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,880
war on drugs has been hugely beneficial

830
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,558
to law enforcement

831
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,320
to the media

832
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:09,200
to people who make [ __ ] tv shows um

833
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,439
uh the sopranos the what the wire all of

834
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,600
those shows they benefit from this kind

835
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,600
of nonsense um

836
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,158
um

837
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,798
who else have benefited people who

838
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,600
provide treatment many of them benefit

839
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:26,158
from the war on drugs the folks who do

840
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,879
urine testing for drugs they've all

841
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,120
benefited they're making mad money

842
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,519
people who run prisons

843
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,239
the phone companies who charge the

844
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,798
prisoners on the people who run the

845
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,200
hotels that are around the prisons where

846
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,839
people's family have to come and stay

847
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,600
the restaurants they they're making out

848
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,000
like bandits

849
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,119
but many of us are getting screwed as a

850
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,839
society

851
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:52,079
we

852
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,158
in general we're getting screwed but

853
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,240
there are people who are just benefiting

854
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,399
handsomely that's why it continues

855
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,558
politicians benefit i mean whether

856
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,278
you're democrat or republican you have

857
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:05,839
the same stance on drugs anyway so you

858
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,359
they all benefit from this

859
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,480
so many questions i want to ask you

860
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,639
because you're challenging a lot of

861
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,360
beliefs that people have

862
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,200
about drugs about society in general so

863
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,918
it's difficult for me to ask the right

864
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,000
questions here but

865
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:24,240
if you could if you were uh with a

866
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,519
sort of uh snap of a finger change the

867
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,038
world

868
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,240
what from a policy perspective

869
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,158
would you and from just a i don't know a

870
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,839
human to human perspective what would

871
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,960
you like to see in the united states of

872
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,319
america

873
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,000
in terms of that fixes some of the

874
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,079
problems we're discussing here first of

875
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,319
all i would not we wouldn't be arresting

876
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:45,278
anybody for drugs anymore that would go

877
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:47,678
away

878
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,839
um the folks who are imprisoned for

879
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,759
drugs that would go away their records

880
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:52,798
would be a sponge that would just go

881
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,278
away

882
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:58,720
and then we work on a system

883
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:59,519
to make sure that uh responsible adults

884
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,399
can

885
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,558
legally attain obtain these substances

886
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,319
and we will have a corresponding

887
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,720
educational system to teach people how

888
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:12,240
to do this um

889
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,440
that's where i would start initially

890
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,319
yeah the the arresting for drug use

891
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,840
or anything drug related is absurd

892
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,798
especially in the context of how

893
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:24,558
destructive alcohol is and tobacco

894
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,038
alcohol can be destructive to some

895
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,960
people but alcohol also is a

896
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,798
hugely beneficial drug to be honest

897
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,679
which i couldn't have gotten through

898
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:35,759
uh many of the sort of receptions and

899
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,840
functions i had to go through as the

900
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,759
chair of the department um without

901
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,480
alcohol yeah you have a line i really

902
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,480
liked um the vast amount of predictably

903
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,798
favorable favorable drug effects

904
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,720
intrigued me so much so that i expanded

905
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,240
my own drug use to take advantage of the

906
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,880
wide array of beneficial outcomes

907
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,038
specific drugs can offer the the part

908
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,880
that entertained me was this to put this

909
00:33:55,038 --> 00:34:00,398
in personal terms my position as

910
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,320
department chairman from 2016 to 2019

911
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:05,038
was far more detrimental to my health

912
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,960
than my drug use ever was i mean there

913
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,280
is there is a standard we're treating

914
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,639
drugs certain kinds of drugs that's

915
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,599
completely different understand we're

916
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,720
treating everything else in our lives

917
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,480
yeah i mean

918
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,638
it's it's almost difficult to snap out

919
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,679
of it as i'm listening to you and and

920
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,240
reading your work um

921
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,039
it's it's uh

922
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,759
it's difficult because it's like

923
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,759
why is everybody living this

924
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,240
idea that certain drugs

925
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,440
are so horribly destructive and others

926
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,759
are not

927
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,760
and we just kind of fix that idea and

928
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,960
then there's this narrative

929
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,639
um

930
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,480
i hate to be so cynical to think that

931
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,240
there is just like a system that just

932
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,800
propagates narratives

933
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,158
i always kind of think that uh truth

934
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,000
wins out

935
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,919
truth is the best narrative i believe

936
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
that too obviously that's why i'm out

937
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,400
here and putting subjecting myself to

938
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,239
this sort of criticism and so forth but

939
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,880
because i believe that truth

940
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:05,919
ultimately wins out but i might be wrong

941
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,200
but uh i have to live my life

942
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,838
like it's true otherwise then i have no

943
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,439
hope then why be here well kind of if

944
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:16,639
you can steal man or at least show

945
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,079
respect to a criticism you've i'm sure

946
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,920
received

947
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,039
uh quite a bit of criticism for your

948
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,358
work i i've heard quite a bit of bs

949
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,960
criticism sort of ignorance

950
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,880
stuff that don't actually pay attention

951
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,720
to your work

952
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,720
but is there some serious like is there

953
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,078
some pushback that makes you think

954
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:37,358
uh twice

955
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,480
people say like i'm presenting a too

956
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:42,799
rosy picture of drugs you know like um i

957
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,358
don't want to do that or i don't want

958
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,720
people to think that i'm not aware of

959
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:52,480
the potential negative effects of any

960
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:55,519
activity including drug use um and so

961
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,679
i do acknowledge that uh there are

962
00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:00,000
potential harms associated with drugs i

963
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,078
acknowledge that in the book

964
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
but the fact remains the beneficial

965
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,920
effects far outweigh the potential

966
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,400
harmful effects and we have technology

967
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,079
information to help people to minimize

968
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,960
the likelihood of the negative effects

969
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,440
but

970
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,320
this sort of approach that we have where

971
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,200
we

972
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,519
say we're only exclusively presenting

973
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,559
the harmful effects and that should make

974
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:27,838
people keep people safe i just have a

975
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:31,039
problem with that but i i certainly i

976
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:33,279
i take the point that um people say

977
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:35,039
there are negative effects absolutely i

978
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,200
absolutely agree

979
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,838
what do you if i can just talk about

980
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:42,319
specific drugs um what's the difference

981
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:44,000
between opioids and

982
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,640
benzos for example

983
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,639
specifically

984
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,838
i mean these are drugs

985
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:54,239
that you often read about being misused

986
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,078
at scale i mean the misuse is the

987
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,239
problem right yeah

988
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,599
no matter what the drug is yes

989
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,439
and that's actually what you're pushing

990
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,760
for is education and it should be it

991
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,280
should be legal and should be good so

992
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,880
people should know what's the difference

993
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,480
between um

994
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,480
proper use

995
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,800
positive use and misuse

996
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,199
i mean one public figure who has been

997
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,119
going through this is uh jordan peterson

998
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,519
he's been public about his struggle of

999
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,119
getting off benzos the withdrawal he's

1000
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:22,639
going through i mean what are your

1001
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,480
thoughts about

1002
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,879
um

1003
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,199
the misuse of benzos or opioids and so

1004
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,000
on the epic epidemic that people talk

1005
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,759
about

1006
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,760
yeah i don't know

1007
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,240
jordan's specific case but certainly

1008
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,920
with benzodiazepines in general we

1009
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:39,598
talked about withdrawal earlier when i

1010
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,079
said that with alcohol withdrawal you

1011
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,800
can die so benzos and alcohol they're

1012
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,400
closely related so benzoyl withdrawal

1013
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,480
too can kill you

1014
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,720
just like alcohol so when we think about

1015
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,679
the effects that

1016
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:54,078
benzodiazepines produce think about the

1017
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:57,440
effects that alcohol produce they're

1018
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:00,240
comparable or similar and so i know

1019
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,639
that it's a difficult one to

1020
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:06,479
wean yourself off if you develop the

1021
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,598
dependence but we we have uh protocols

1022
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,280
for that

1023
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,240
and i hope he's okay

1024
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,680
it's interesting to say we have

1025
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,439
protocols for that but from my

1026
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,919
understanding was that

1027
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,119
like the protocols aren't standardized

1028
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,960
it feels like

1029
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,960
a lot of doctors aren't as helpful as

1030
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,240
they could be in this process like it's

1031
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,039
a bit of a mess

1032
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:27,679
certainly with withdrawal they're more

1033
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,599
uh standardized than anything so

1034
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,519
uh like if someone is going through

1035
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,838
alcohol withdrawal there is a standard

1036
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,480
protocol that most physicians in this

1037
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:37,920
business they follow and the same is

1038
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,400
true with uh

1039
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,720
benzo withdrawal but the thing where it

1040
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,039
gets murky is when they're treating

1041
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:47,919
addiction itself so when you're thinking

1042
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:50,400
about the substance use disorder in the

1043
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,039
dsm not just withdrawal but the entire

1044
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,440
addiction that's where you have this

1045
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,279
sort of uh

1046
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,679
divergence or

1047
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,400
diversity diversity in terms of

1048
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:03,519
approaches and many of those approaches

1049
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,838
are rubbish

1050
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,759
what uh can you just elaborate

1051
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,920
like technically what the term addiction

1052
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,119
means that you're referring to when i

1053
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,480
use the term addiction i'm referring to

1054
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,720
the diagnostics this statistical manual

1055
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,440
of the american psychiatric association

1056
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:23,279
number five now the dsm-5 that's never

1057
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,240
been wrong right oh

1058
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,240
no

1059
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,399
i'm just kidding oh you're right

1060
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:31,598
that's that point is well taken and your

1061
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,000
point is that um um

1062
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,519
their definition of substance use

1063
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,920
disorder that's addiction that's what

1064
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:41,440
i'm talking about but that definition

1065
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,880
continues to evolve and so you're right

1066
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,800
they still

1067
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,200
are working it out we're getting new

1068
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,280
information from scientific studies and

1069
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,480
so forth and so it's supposed to be

1070
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,240
incorporated into the dsm but uh there

1071
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,920
are some problems with the dsm like for

1072
00:39:54,239 --> 00:40:00,399
example um they also have this sort of

1073
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,960
once an addict always an addict thing

1074
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,760
and there's no evidence to support that

1075
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,519
um but it's evolving and it's the

1076
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,720
definition

1077
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:12,800
that people in science and medicine use

1078
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,439
and so we all know we're talking about

1079
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,680
the same language when we call someone a

1080
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,599
substance use disorder patient or

1081
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:22,078
someone who meets criteria for addiction

1082
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,079
we all are speaking the same language

1083
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,160
we're not saying that simply because

1084
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,160
this person used heroin they are an

1085
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,239
addict that's not what we're saying you

1086
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,199
have to meet these criteria where you

1087
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,358
have

1088
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:37,199
disruptions in your psychosocial

1089
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:40,480
functioning that's one and two uh you

1090
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:43,838
the person are distressed by this these

1091
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,800
dis these uh disruptions so people have

1092
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:50,078
to meet those two basic criteria before

1093
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,400
we say they are addicted

1094
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,519
so once an addict owes an addict this

1095
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,240
idea

1096
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:56,239
uh so i've

1097
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,159
i mean some of it is always mapped to

1098
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,078
the person all right but i've just

1099
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:04,239
the people i've interacted with who have

1100
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,480
struggled with alcohol addiction i i

1101
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:09,039
don't know if what the proper term is it

1102
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,079
seems like with alcohol anonymous

1103
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:14,719
the process of

1104
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,960
putting that addiction behind you

1105
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:19,118
is a very very long process it's

1106
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,599
surprisingly long to me that almost

1107
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,079
seems like a whole life like he's not

1108
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,240
always an addict but it takes decades

1109
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,519
it seems like uh

1110
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,559
what is that

1111
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,400
what

1112
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,920
can you maybe just

1113
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,358
from your understanding as a scientist

1114
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,760
from your understanding is a human who

1115
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,598
studies human nature why does it take so

1116
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,440
long to treat

1117
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,519
to

1118
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,200
to to deal with that

1119
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:47,599
uh addiction well you you cited alcohol

1120
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:49,759
anonymous right and so

1121
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,880
i don't think of alcohol anonymous as

1122
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,119
like a

1123
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,680
a a treatment that i would send any

1124
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,800
relative to you know like for a

1125
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:02,879
drug-related problem you know i think

1126
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:05,599
alcohol anonymous a-a is really good for

1127
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,119
social interactions um making sure

1128
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,240
people um

1129
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,480
have a social group and they have peers

1130
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,559
i mean that's a good thing we all need

1131
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,240
that social interaction

1132
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:18,639
but i don't think they know much about

1133
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:20,078
drugs that's not that's uh it's like

1134
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,639
saying uh

1135
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,680
well you know my uncle broke his knee

1136
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:27,519
and uh he he has his support group and

1137
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,480
they said this

1138
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:31,039
um

1139
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,920
and then we follow that uh that doesn't

1140
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:38,400
make any sense but in our society

1141
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,838
judges even sentence people to go to a.a

1142
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,838
uh are you kidding me uh but but that's

1143
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:46,318
the kind of thing that has been allowed

1144
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:48,400
to happen in this society because we

1145
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:51,279
think of drugs

1146
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,000
as this moral failing or drug drug

1147
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,200
addiction as it's moral failing

1148
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,960
and any idiot can provide treatment and

1149
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,639
no disrespect to aaa because i think

1150
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,800
what they do

1151
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,759
is a lot more than what some people do

1152
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,839
because at least they have the social

1153
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,640
these social interactions you have a

1154
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,440
social group um that's better than what

1155
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:16,318
a lot of these other idiots out here do

1156
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,440
well in that social support group

1157
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:21,279
unrelated to the drug it helps cure some

1158
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,960
of the environment issues you might be

1159
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,480
in that's the whole point absolutely so

1160
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,199
we kind of coupled the drug to the

1161
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,318
environment but the reality is as as you

1162
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,919
argue

1163
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:31,838
most the problems come from the

1164
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,680
environment certainly with people who

1165
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:36,719
are experiencing drug related problems

1166
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:38,719
with most of the people not all but most

1167
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,719
there are differences

1168
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:42,959
like that psychedelics

1169
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,759
and uh like psilocybin has versus

1170
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,159
alcohol yeah i personally think

1171
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,040
uh you know i've enjoyed both

1172
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,879
experiences in different ways i

1173
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,800
is it possible or is this are we getting

1174
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,480
into the realm of poetry

1175
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,119
to describe the benefits like how it

1176
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,880
alters the how the different drugs alter

1177
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,960
the mind

1178
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,599
and the places it can take you that

1179
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,960
produce a positive experience yeah

1180
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,838
no it's very real you know like

1181
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,159
some drugs uh take people in places that

1182
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,119
other drugs can't and that's that's very

1183
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:21,440
real

1184
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:23,358
i have friends uh some of them you know

1185
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,920
they um

1186
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,400
they for example say that they've never

1187
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,039
had an experience like the one they had

1188
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,680
with ayahuasca and they've done a number

1189
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:36,079
of sort of things

1190
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:37,199
but they did the ayahuasca in a setting

1191
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,359
with

1192
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,199
a shaman and

1193
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,358
this group and

1194
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,639
they felt like

1195
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:48,960
they actually began to heal or solve

1196
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:51,679
some problems that they were trying to

1197
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,838
solve for some years and that's that's

1198
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:55,919
great that's great for them

1199
00:44:53,838 --> 00:45:00,799
and nothing else does it for them like

1200
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,920
that and that's absolutely fantastic um

1201
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,480
all i

1202
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,880
argue is that um

1203
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,599
if that kind of thing happens for you

1204
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,119
with ayahuasca facili with psilocybin

1205
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:12,480
with some other

1206
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,559
psychedelic

1207
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,039
why isn't it possible

1208
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,920
that heroin does that for someone or

1209
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:23,199
cocaine does that for someone else or

1210
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,119
mdma does it for someone that that's it

1211
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,199
that's interesting to imagine like a

1212
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,800
shaman for heroin

1213
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,559
like why not

1214
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,000
and or cocaine you said creating an

1215
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,239
environment for yourself for use of

1216
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,079
these different substances and that

1217
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:37,759
environment has a

1218
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,800
has a very

1219
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,640
uh

1220
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,760
strong impact on the actual experience

1221
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,719
that you have

1222
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,560
but i mean so um

1223
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:47,439
cocaine is an upper

1224
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,599
and then

1225
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:52,400
yeah the way we define drugs like uppers

1226
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:54,640
and down downers that's uh

1227
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,400
that's a really uh

1228
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:58,799
kind of inappropriate way but it's a

1229
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,599
quick way but so we certainly say

1230
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,560
cocaine is an upper or stimulant yes but

1231
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,559
um

1232
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,480
you know it depends on the activity of

1233
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,799
the person before they take the drug say

1234
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,039
like if you're like really active before

1235
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,440
taking a drug like cocaine it might

1236
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:15,519
actually calm you you know so it all

1237
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,679
depends on the activity of the person

1238
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,199
before they take the drug i remember uh

1239
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,358
i don't know if you know matthew johnson

1240
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,759
is of course

1241
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:25,279
he did all these studies on or

1242
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,040
i remember just reading a paper i didn't

1243
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,280
get a chance to talk with him much about

1244
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,639
it but it was about condom use

1245
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,119
and cocaine

1246
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:35,519
and then you know what like the doses

1247
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,680
and whether people are more less likely

1248
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,800
like the unsafe thing there

1249
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:41,838
is the

1250
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,240
using or not using or not using i guess

1251
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,480
uh condoms during

1252
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:49,358
sexual intercourse i don't know i just i

1253
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,119
love that these drugs that have um

1254
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:53,199
connotation probably because of

1255
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,720
hollywood negative connotations are

1256
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:56,559
actually being studied by science and

1257
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,639
then they actual impact they have and

1258
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,358
what are the negative effects again in

1259
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:03,838
those studies often

1260
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:06,239
the positive effects are difficult to

1261
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,078
quantify i think maybe i guess you can

1262
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,598
from self-report and so on

1263
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,200
but positive effects are not difficult

1264
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,880
to quantify

1265
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:17,358
you ask people about their euphoria

1266
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,440
uh you can see how well people are

1267
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:21,039
getting along like in our studies that

1268
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,440
we have people

1269
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:26,719
uh sometimes in groups and you see how

1270
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,838
well they get along um on the various

1271
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,039
drug conditions or placebo conditions uh

1272
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:32,880
it's really

1273
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:35,199
it's not that difficult then you can see

1274
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:39,039
these uh amazing studies with uh like

1275
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:42,000
rick goblin like the looking at mdma and

1276
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:44,558
combined with therapy

1277
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,960
like how you can overcome certain ptsd

1278
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:49,200
things or depression and so on

1279
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,880
yeah it's really interesting it's uh

1280
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,000
it's really interesting

1281
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,358
i gotta ask you because you mentioned

1282
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,199
the wire

1283
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:56,719
do you think the wire using movies like

1284
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,919
transporting do you think they're

1285
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:02,159
ultimately destruct because okay

1286
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,159
yes they celebrate murder right the

1287
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:07,440
godfather a little bit

1288
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:10,078
yeah but another one i mean it's like

1289
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,960
these racist ass [ __ ]

1290
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,039
and they also are killing people but yet

1291
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,960
they say we don't do drugs what kind of

1292
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:18,239
[ __ ] is that yeah i mean people who are

1293
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,358
doing drugs

1294
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:23,919
psilocybin or whatever

1295
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:26,400
the thing is we're trying to be better

1296
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,559
people and trying to make our society

1297
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,519
better and you're killing people and you

1298
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,880
are

1299
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,199
denigrating

1300
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,039
people for using are you [ __ ] kidding

1301
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,279
me and we let them get away with that as

1302
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,279
a society do you see those movies i

1303
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,800
apologize if i'm not sufficiently

1304
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,640
informed you see them as denigrating

1305
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:46,160
drugs of course i mean the godfather

1306
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,879
yes that's right that's a good example

1307
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:52,000
and the godfather sopranos is all about

1308
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,599
that i mean christopher is using heroin

1309
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,400
in the sopranos

1310
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,200
and

1311
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,039
they have an intervention at that one in

1312
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:00,318
one one season and

1313
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,039
they are

1314
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:05,119
they are denigrating him it's are you

1315
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:07,838
kidding me you just cut somebody's head

1316
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,400
off yeah but they're to be fair they

1317
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,000
were denigrating i think all drugs

1318
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,200
and then they're drinking alcohol in the

1319
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,440
butter bean

1320
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:18,000
yeah yeah

1321
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,639
first of all they're killing people yeah

1322
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,119
they don't have any space

1323
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:25,039
none to denigrate somebody who's just

1324
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,800
trying to

1325
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:29,519
alter their consciousness are you

1326
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,960
kidding me and not bothering anyone else

1327
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,599
but you know there's a lot of other mob

1328
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,920
movies that you know scarface celebrates

1329
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:39,280
the murder and the drugs equally

1330
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,760
so i i mean it it doesn't

1331
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,960
it celebrates all of the

1332
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,400
just uh not just drugs or so on it's

1333
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,000
those movies

1334
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,639
you know i loved all those movies i'm

1335
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,400
from miami i loved scarface i even liked

1336
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,159
the sopranos that i started looking at

1337
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,400
that [ __ ] with a critical eye and see

1338
00:49:54,159 --> 00:50:00,078
what it's doing yeah um

1339
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,559
but scarface is dependent upon the

1340
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,440
american viewer

1341
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:08,400
having a certain view of people who deal

1342
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:11,119
in drugs and that view is that these

1343
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,318
people are animals basically and in the

1344
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:16,960
end uh the animal kills himself with too

1345
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:19,199
much cocaine and he was high and that's

1346
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,559
what they show and so it's like

1347
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:24,000
what the [ __ ]

1348
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:27,839
so it's leveraging is playing into

1349
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,838
not the better angels of our nature

1350
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,200
the question don't take away these great

1351
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,480
movies for me but it's true you have to

1352
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,799
think about them critically in the

1353
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,318
continent wait wait wait wait wait wait

1354
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,200
i like these movies it's not a matter of

1355
00:50:40,318 --> 00:50:44,558
taking away it's a matter of making the

1356
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:47,279
writers

1357
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,359
uh be more honest to the reality that's

1358
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,960
that's it that's true that's really true

1359
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:52,880
and the the writers the people the

1360
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,960
culture all of it i mean they write

1361
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,440
these things you you know i just think

1362
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:00,000
about some some hip-hop artists they say

1363
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,280
like this is real this is my experience

1364
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,119
and so forth

1365
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,119
and that's how these movie writers they

1366
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,440
write this [ __ ] and then say well

1367
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,318
this is real um

1368
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,280
anyway i i i get so upset talking about

1369
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:15,679
it because i know the harm is doing and

1370
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,800
i know those kind of movies are the

1371
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:20,879
reason that we have this war on drugs um

1372
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,480
and all of these people are going to

1373
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,960
jail because of those kind of movies

1374
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,599
in the epilogue of your book you quote

1375
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,920
james baldwin you cannot know you will

1376
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:34,318
discover on the journey what you will do

1377
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,480
with what you find or

1378
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:39,358
what you find will do to you

1379
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,838
so let me ask how has drug use or the

1380
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:44,799
study of drugs change you as a human

1381
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:47,199
being uh it just helped me think about

1382
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,519
other people's experience right so

1383
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:51,598
how other how we're all connected like

1384
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:53,358
going to northern ireland i don't know

1385
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,880
if you know much about the situation

1386
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:56,880
with the troubles and

1387
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,680
what those people went through

1388
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,160
and so i see people there

1389
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:04,799
northern ireland by the way is all white

1390
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:07,358
and you see those people there suffering

1391
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,839
for the same reasons that people in

1392
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:13,039
appalachian are suffering for um

1393
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:15,519
neglected by politicians who told them

1394
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:17,599
lies about drugs and not dealing with

1395
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:18,960
the real problems like west virginia for

1396
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,359
example

1397
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,240
their water is polluted the factories

1398
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:27,519
have gone away people are desperate and

1399
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,318
they're blaming drugs are you kidding me

1400
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,559
so

1401
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:33,440
the politicians don't have to bring back

1402
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,200
the jobs so we don't have to

1403
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,599
really make sure they have clean

1404
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,519
drinking water things of that nature and

1405
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,800
so those people are connected to the

1406
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,519
people in northern ireland they're

1407
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,240
connected to the people in brownsville

1408
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:48,559
they're connected to the people in other

1409
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:50,479
places in the united states for the same

1410
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,079
reason they're connected to the people

1411
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,719
in

1412
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:57,119
sao paulo uh brazil

1413
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:59,679
same thing people are catching hell for

1414
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,039
the same reason in the philippines for

1415
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:04,879
the same reason and and that's why i

1416
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,480
feel so strongly about this thing

1417
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,440
because i know

1418
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:13,119
there are people getting paid and their

1419
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:16,960
paycheck is predicated on subjugating

1420
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,960
and the suffering of those other people

1421
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,838
so when we hear about

1422
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,400
the destructive effects of drugs

1423
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:26,400
it's essentially

1424
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,079
a scapegoat

1425
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,318
for the failures of leaders and

1426
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,839
politicians to help alleviate the

1427
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:34,480
suffering of people in those communities

1428
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:36,719
absolutely it's so easy to say

1429
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:40,318
i'm going to rid your community of drugs

1430
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:42,879
i'm going to put more cops on the street

1431
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:44,880
if you want a problem

1432
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,160
not to be solved

1433
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,838
just give it to the military or the cops

1434
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,679
you had a tough childhood growing up in

1435
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:53,279
miami like you said

1436
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,358
one memory's

1437
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,720
memory stands out in particular that was

1438
00:53:55,358 --> 00:54:00,480
formative

1439
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:03,358
and helping make you the man you are

1440
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,800
that's so hard to you know

1441
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:06,719
say

1442
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,480
you know my grandmother was really

1443
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,558
important

1444
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,920
so maybe just her

1445
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,839
trying to make sure that i think

1446
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,440
critically that was i guess that's the

1447
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:17,599
biggest one

1448
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,358
so you moved in with her your parents

1449
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,079
split

1450
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:23,519
six seven yeah what have you learned

1451
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,519
about life from her

1452
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:28,719
be self-sufficient

1453
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:30,800
be critical and keep your eyes open and

1454
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:32,000
watch out for the okie doke you know and

1455
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,839
that's what

1456
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,519
this whole drug thing is about it's the

1457
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:36,558
okie doke people

1458
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,960
um

1459
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:42,079
it really boils down to

1460
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,400
just simple thing we're all similar in

1461
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,318
that we're all just trying to live our

1462
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,880
life trying to take care of our kids we

1463
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:49,759
want the best for our kids all of us but

1464
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,798
yet

1465
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,839
somehow

1466
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:56,480
um we are being we've been made to

1467
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:58,558
believe that we are different in in that

1468
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,798
way but fundamentally we're all the same

1469
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,559
so when people are

1470
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:08,318
seeking to feel pleasure to feel better

1471
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:11,760
uh why don't we celebrate that instead

1472
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:14,798
we denigrate people for that i mean if i

1473
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:17,040
feel better i'm more likely to treat you

1474
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:17,039
well

1475
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:21,598
i gotta say still though you're going

1476
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:25,359
against the grain

1477
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,359
and uh you're a colombia

1478
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,200
it takes a lot of guts to sort of speak

1479
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:33,680
out about these ideas so boldly

1480
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,919
um i don't know how to ask this question

1481
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:38,078
where do you find the guts

1482
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,920
what uh

1483
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,400
because it's also perhaps inspirational

1484
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,920
to others in different disciplines that

1485
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,599
are sort of taking on the conventional

1486
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,000
wisdom of the day

1487
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,680
and challenging it what does it take to

1488
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,280
do that what advice would you give to

1489
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,279
others

1490
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,559
like you kind of a little bit afraid to

1491
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,880
do so once you know you cannot not know

1492
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:01,599
as they say and so i have to look in the

1493
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,280
mirror and then looking in the mirror i

1494
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,440
have to face myself

1495
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:09,040
have i lived honestly

1496
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:13,358
and if i can't face myself then

1497
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:15,920
uh what am i doing here um

1498
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:17,519
you know that's how i i see it

1499
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,639
one of the things that people don't

1500
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:20,639
really talk about

1501
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:25,679
with drugs and people who die from some

1502
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,680
drug related death and

1503
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:31,118
i've been thinking about this a whole

1504
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:33,759
lot over the past couple years it's like

1505
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:36,318
some of these drugs can take you to a

1506
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,000
place where you feel so optimistic and

1507
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:40,239
positive about

1508
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,079
humans our fellow humans

1509
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,399
and you want to

1510
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,880
do your best to contribute

1511
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,639
and because you know the possibilities

1512
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,240
of what we can be as a society

1513
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,159
and then

1514
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:56,000
you come up with resistance and you like

1515
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:58,000
you say there are a lot there's a lot of

1516
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,039
resistance and people just have a hard

1517
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,079
time

1518
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:04,239
and and so if you know

1519
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,960
humans can be better

1520
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:08,399
and they refuse to be better

1521
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,519
why be here

1522
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,838
as someone who knows that they we can do

1523
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:16,000
this better i certainly don't want to do

1524
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:18,000
it the way we're doing it

1525
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,519
so you kind of see drugs

1526
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,519
as

1527
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,519
mechanisms for potentially elevating the

1528
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:26,000
human spirit sort of

1529
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:28,318
making people feel better so you want to

1530
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,318
communicate that message so it's that

1531
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:32,239
plus

1532
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,558
the fact that drugs are used as

1533
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:36,159
scapegoat to uh

1534
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:37,839
to not alleviate the suffering of

1535
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:40,639
certain communities so those two those

1536
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:42,318
two things come up one one of the sort

1537
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:44,480
of main points of the book two was to

1538
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:48,480
try and get people to understand

1539
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:52,960
um possibilities that we could have

1540
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:56,000
if we embraced um uh certain drug use uh

1541
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,318
if we allowed adults to do this sort of

1542
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,559
thing uh

1543
00:57:57,318 --> 00:58:05,199
relationships uh can be better um a wide

1544
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,920
range of beneficial effects people would

1545
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:10,399
be

1546
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,720
or can learn to be more magnanimous um

1547
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,519
all of these pro-social things that we

1548
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:17,118
say we value

1549
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:21,759
in your previous book high price you

1550
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:24,000
talk about rap and djing chapter five

1551
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,520
there's a nice picture of you djing from

1552
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,199
1983.

1553
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:29,199
so uh let me ask

1554
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:31,118
who in your view this is the toughest

1555
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:32,879
question of this interview uh is the

1556
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,519
greatest hip-hop artist of all time

1557
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,440
maybe give some candidates oh wow who is

1558
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:39,039
the greatest hip-hop artist so

1559
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,760
you know i don't know if i'm qualified

1560
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:42,960
to make that back because you you know

1561
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,839
um

1562
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,039
uh

1563
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:46,880
when i

1564
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:49,599
i have to go back to like gil scott

1565
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,960
herron you know like people think of him

1566
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:56,000
as one of the fathers of hip-hop um

1567
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,838
that's my all-time favorite you know um

1568
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,920
and people like chuck d from public

1569
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,558
enemy some of the things that they were

1570
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,358
doing i was really digging but even

1571
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,559
though

1572
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:09,358
i was digging like public enemy um but

1573
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:12,160
even they got it wrong on drugs even gil

1574
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:13,358
scott herron got it wrong on drugs um

1575
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:15,920
but

1576
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:20,719
they were doing so much other good stuff

1577
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,760
uh it helped me to develop as a person

1578
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:24,000
and so

1579
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,160
um

1580
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,280
i think uh

1581
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:31,118
like my son is a hip-hop artist now i

1582
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,519
think those those folks who are in the

1583
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:36,000
game now they might be they are a lot

1584
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:38,079
more qualified to talk about who's the

1585
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,079
greatest hip-hop artist i i'm not

1586
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,000
qualified the evolution i mean have you

1587
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:45,760
tracked the evolution from sort of the

1588
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:48,239
90s with uh wu-tang and tupac and biggie

1589
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,079
and then to uh what we have today so

1590
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:51,919
there's there's just been a crazy amount

1591
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,880
of progress that's like almost difficult

1592
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,798
to track yeah i mean i really love what

1593
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,160
they're doing i like what they accept

1594
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:00,239
the part where

1595
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:03,358
they get over 40 and they become [ __ ]

1596
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:05,279
cops on tv i mean other than that i dig

1597
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:06,960
what's that about

1598
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,519
yeah i don't understand that you know

1599
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,159
but that's what they do again those

1600
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:13,599
uh this sort of glorious glorification

1601
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:16,239
of cops

1602
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:18,640
that's dangerous for a society

1603
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:20,399
and and those cats who do that kind of

1604
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:22,879
thing you know i have a problem with

1605
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,318
that is it all sort of to push back a

1606
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,920
little bit because i come from the

1607
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:28,239
soviet union where there's a huge amount

1608
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,480
of corruption and when i see what's

1609
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:32,239
going on with cops in this country

1610
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,960
there's a lot of proper criticism you

1611
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:36,000
can apply but like relative to other

1612
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,480
places

1613
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,079
this is well on in on so many ways this

1614
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,199
country is incredible

1615
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:45,599
uh is your criticism towards

1616
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:48,639
cops or towards what cops are asked to

1617
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,599
do yeah towards what cops are asked to

1618
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:52,639
do

1619
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:56,318
cops provide the shield for politician

1620
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:58,239
and those in power uh absolutely because

1621
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:00,000
i was in the military i spent four years

1622
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:03,439
in the military and i did what i was

1623
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,239
told to do and i was ignorant and

1624
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,200
and thought i was doing the right thing

1625
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:09,039
and i

1626
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:10,719
did what i was told to do and so just

1627
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:11,838
like these guys are doing what they're

1628
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:14,959
told to do

1629
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:16,480
but no i my real beef is with the power

1630
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,720
structure the folks who are telling them

1631
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,280
what to do um and

1632
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:24,480
also those those the the folks who go

1633
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:27,680
play cops on on television um that

1634
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:30,798
imagery that sort of um

1635
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,078
glorifying cops that's a problem in a

1636
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:34,400
democracy

1637
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:38,960
yeah all sides of the glorification of

1638
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:41,760
the drug war is a problem yeah

1639
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:44,000
if i can just linger in a little longer

1640
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:46,720
in terms of the effects of drugs

1641
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,880
on the the positive like mind expanding

1642
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:50,159
uh components of it

1643
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,519
um

1644
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:53,679
what

1645
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:56,079
have uh mind altering drugs teach you

1646
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:58,318
about the human mind sort of from a

1647
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,680
neuroscience not even like a

1648
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:02,318
biochemical

1649
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,480
but just like the human mind is amazing

1650
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:06,079
right yeah the places it can go

1651
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,920
have

1652
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,079
like are there some insights you've

1653
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,119
learned yeah from studying drugs about

1654
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,000
the mind

1655
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,000
yeah

1656
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,679
can i start from a neurochemical

1657
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,239
perspective first and then we'll go

1658
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:20,639
larger just from a neurochemical

1659
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:23,679
perspective i mean everything i know

1660
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,598
about the brain i learned through drugs

1661
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:27,598
you know because of my interest in drugs

1662
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,680
so i learned a lot about dopamine

1663
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,400
neurons in certain regions of the brain

1664
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:35,038
about neuropathy neurons and

1665
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,960
a wide range of other sort of how neural

1666
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,720
transmission happens because of drugs

1667
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,920
and so that's a really

1668
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:43,679
valuable tool lessons for me uh but then

1669
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,599
when we think that we

1670
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,838
uh move out a bit and we think more

1671
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,280
globally what have i learned in terms of

1672
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:51,920
the mind

1673
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,920
from drugs

1674
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:59,680
i have really learned

1675
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:01,920
how to be more forgiving of people

1676
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:02,719
and myself

1677
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,079
and

1678
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:06,639
um

1679
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,599
tolerant and more tolerant of people

1680
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:09,920
and

1681
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:12,880
certainly learned a lot more about

1682
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:15,200
empathy as a result of

1683
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:18,720
drug use

1684
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:19,519
uh and like i said earlier

1685
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:23,199
i'm

1686
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:26,318
learning what we can be as a species and

1687
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,358
it's quite incredible uh but because of

1688
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:28,960
drugs

1689
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:30,558
yeah there's a certain property of drugs

1690
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,318
in different ways they take you out of

1691
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,640
your body like

1692
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:36,480
they help you evaluate yourself from

1693
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:38,159
like a third person perspective it's

1694
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,838
almost like you have a consciousness in

1695
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:40,798
here and you get to step outside of it a

1696
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:42,239
little bit

1697
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:44,480
i mean that's kind of what meditation

1698
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:47,439
does too all of these processes that's

1699
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,358
what a hell of a good workout does too

1700
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,480
it makes you evaluate yourself and that

1701
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,719
somehow

1702
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,798
that allows you to

1703
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:56,480
um be forgiving to yourself and

1704
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:58,559
forgiving to others

1705
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,719
sort of empathize he trains that part of

1706
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,920
your brain so stepping outside of

1707
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:03,838
yourself not taking yourself too

1708
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,440
seriously yeah that that process and

1709
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:06,880
different drugs do that

1710
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,240
in different ways obviously i don't know

1711
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,480
from personal experience than some of

1712
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:14,479
them but

1713
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:17,119
i'm i'm now curious you know it it um

1714
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:20,159
it's unfortunate that the the

1715
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:22,559
hollywood and different stories we have

1716
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,598
uh demonize certain drugs and sort of

1717
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,798
basically

1718
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:26,318
i don't know make it difficult for

1719
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:27,519
people like me to explore those ideas

1720
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:29,038
but then

1721
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:30,719
i'm really thankful for people like you

1722
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,480
who are pushing the science forward and

1723
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,719
are unafraid to talk about this kind of

1724
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,079
stuff

1725
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:38,159
because i'm really fascinated with

1726
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,880
consciousness on the engineering side i

1727
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:42,719
really want to build robots that are

1728
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,838
that have elements of intelligence

1729
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:47,759
emotion even consciousness and for that

1730
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:49,199
we need to understand ourselves and

1731
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,440
drugs is

1732
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:53,919
all the different kinds of drugs if you

1733
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,760
safely seems like an incredible tool to

1734
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,920
understand ourselves and if we're

1735
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,599
limiting ourselves from certain drugs

1736
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,440
because of certain political games that

1737
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:03,280
being played

1738
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,960
it's sad

1739
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,280
and people know this

1740
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,519
a lot of middle to upper class people

1741
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,559
know this the illicit drug trade

1742
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:12,798
business

1743
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:15,119
is a multi-million dollar industry

1744
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:17,759
multi-billion dollar industry

1745
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:19,039
that could not be supported by people

1746
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,520
who are poor

1747
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,839
and so and that and that has to be

1748
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:26,400
supported by a lot of customers

1749
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:27,679
and a lot of people around the world

1750
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,318
know this

1751
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:32,798
they're in the closet and in the book i

1752
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:33,599
call for them to get out of the closet

1753
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:35,519
so

1754
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:37,359
we can start being more honest and we

1755
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:38,400
can take the pressure off of those

1756
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:40,719
people

1757
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,838
who are not as privileged

1758
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:45,759
like i said you're brave you're bold i

1759
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:47,599
gotta ask you for some advice what

1760
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,520
advice would you give to a young person

1761
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:52,079
today high school

1762
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:54,318
maybe undergrad and college

1763
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,160
thinking about their career

1764
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,599
thinking about how to live a life they

1765
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,239
can be proud of

1766
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,920
yeah whatever career they choose

1767
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:03,919
just make sure

1768
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:07,119
that they dedicate themselves to and be

1769
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:09,200
the best at what they do first that's

1770
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:10,400
what you have to do first uh like people

1771
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:13,199
see me

1772
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,920
um advocating for this position

1773
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:19,919
30 years of science is in

1774
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:22,480
these opinion this view um and trust me

1775
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,960
i would be dismissed if i didn't know my

1776
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,559
[ __ ] if i was not yeah you did the work

1777
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,400
you proved yourself you're legit and by

1778
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,119
by the people in the eyes of the people

1779
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,480
who know absolutely so that's the main

1780
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,358
thing that i would encourage people to

1781
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:41,519
do really know your craft if you know

1782
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:44,159
your craft um and then maybe you will be

1783
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:45,838
a service to

1784
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:47,598
your fellow citizens

1785
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:50,318
there are so many people out here faking

1786
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:52,880
the funk and they don't know their craft

1787
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:55,119
and they're not a service to the people

1788
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:57,519
that they claim to serve and that's a

1789
01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:00,000
problem and when you have

1790
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,920
a fair number of people like that in

1791
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,639
positions of power

1792
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,798
your society is going to crumble

1793
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:09,759
what about the scientific path

1794
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:12,000
you recommend people get a phd

1795
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,760
not necessarily you know

1796
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,480
like my own children i don't recommend

1797
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,160
that

1798
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:19,358
so um

1799
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:21,920
uh science came certainly my science can

1800
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:23,519
be a bit very petty sort of space to be

1801
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,680
in um

1802
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,639
but it was the only sort of path that i

1803
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:31,679
had

1804
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:34,719
and so i i had to do it uh but uh no i

1805
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:35,519
um i would really encourage people to

1806
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:38,078
just

1807
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:40,838
do something that they enjoy

1808
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:44,000
and something that makes them happy

1809
01:07:40,838 --> 01:07:45,838
because the greater number of happy

1810
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,880
people in our society

1811
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:50,960
the better off we all are

1812
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,720
all right since you mentioned happiness

1813
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:54,318
gotta ask you about the pursuit of

1814
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:57,038
happiness and the

1815
01:07:54,318 --> 01:07:59,119
the ridiculous question about meaning

1816
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:02,160
do you think this life has meaning

1817
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:04,160
what do you think is the meaning of life

1818
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:06,558
i'm sorry i certainly hope it has

1819
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:08,558
meaning i mean i'm i'm certainly trying

1820
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:12,480
to live mind like it has meaning you

1821
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:15,280
know um i really love my life now i just

1822
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:18,399
got back from geneva um i

1823
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:20,480
spent the summer abroad in europe and

1824
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,000
trying to be in a more civilized place

1825
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:25,278
where you can

1826
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,600
enjoy yourself as a responsible adult

1827
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:30,319
and then it allowed me to decompress and

1828
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:32,079
then come back here um the thing about

1829
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,480
coming back here is that you have to be

1830
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:36,798
ready to fight and i don't want to fight

1831
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:39,919
anymore you know i just want to be able

1832
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:42,479
to help a society and people

1833
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,279
and so i'll have to like keep a place in

1834
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:47,519
europe to go and decompress and then

1835
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,520
come back to be able to tolerate the

1836
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,920
situation so

1837
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,359
life for me has a lot of meaning i'm i'm

1838
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:57,119
enjoying life

1839
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:59,440
this is like um the the greatest the

1840
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:01,759
best part of my life ever right now at

1841
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,278
this moment it's just a joy

1842
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,679
but you also enjoy the fight a little

1843
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,920
bit or no i don't really i'm tired of

1844
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:10,239
that you know it's like uh

1845
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,039
why you

1846
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:14,879
you're trying to i'm trying to help

1847
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:16,880
people to see

1848
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,199
how they can be happy

1849
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,480
and then people are fighting me on that

1850
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:22,479
i don't want to be happy i want to be

1851
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,919
ignorant leave me alone that's what

1852
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:25,519
people are saying

1853
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,279
