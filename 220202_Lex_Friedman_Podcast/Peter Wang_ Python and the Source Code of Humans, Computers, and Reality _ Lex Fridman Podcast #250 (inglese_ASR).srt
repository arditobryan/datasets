1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,359
peter wang one of the most impactful

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,000
leaders and developers in the python

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,719
community former physicist current

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,120
philosopher and someone who many people

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,599
told me about and praised as a truly

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,160
special mind that i absolutely should

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,839
talk to recommendations ranging from

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,278
travis oliphant to eric weinstein so

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,679
here we are

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,599
this is the lex friedman podcast to

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,920
support it please check out our sponsors

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,280
in the description and now here's my

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,600
conversation with peter wang

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,079
you're one of the most impactful humans

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,760
in the python ecosystem

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,799
so you're an engineer leader of

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,039
engineers but you're also a philosopher

19
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,280
so let's talk both in this conversation

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,120
about programming and philosophy

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
first programming

22
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,078
what do you is the best or maybe the

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,440
most beautiful feature of python or

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,960
maybe the thing that made you fall in

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,599
love or

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,120
stay in love with python well those are

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,559
three different things what i think is

28
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,319
most beautiful what made me fall in love

29
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,759
with me stay in love when i first

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,399
started using it

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,880
was when i was a c plus computer

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,640
graphics performance nerd in the 90s and

33
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,158
yeah in late 90s and that was my first

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,040
job out of college

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,200
um

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,118
and we kept trying to do more and more

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,439
uh like abstract and higher order

38
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:24,159
programming in c plus which at the time

39
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,478
was quite difficult with templates the

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,759
the compiler support wasn't great etc

41
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,599
so when i started playing around with

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,759
python that was my first time

43
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:33,919
encountering really first class support

44
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,000
for types for functions and things like

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,118
that and it felt so incredibly

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,799
expressive

47
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,719
so that was what kind of made me fall in

48
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,880
love with a little bit and also

49
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,359
once you spend a lot of time in a c plus

50
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,959
dev environment the ability to just whip

51
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,640
something together that basically runs

52
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,478
and works the first time

53
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,879
is amazing so really productive

54
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:55,438
scripting language i mean i i knew pearl

55
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,599
i knew bash i was decent at both but

56
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,839
python just made everything it made the

57
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,118
whole world accessible right i could

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,399
script this and that and the other

59
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:03,920
network things

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,280
you know little hard drive utilities i

61
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,799
could write all these things in the

62
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,000
space of an afternoon and that was

63
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,840
really really cool that's what made me

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,439
fall in love is there something specific

65
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,120
you could put your finger on

66
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,959
that you're not programming in perl

67
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,159
today like why python for scripting

68
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
i think

69
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,639
there's not a specific thing as much as

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,239
the design motif of both the the creator

71
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,598
of the language and the core

72
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,680
uh group of people that built the

73
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,799
standard library around him

74
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,480
um

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,480
there was definitely

76
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,238
there was a taste to it i mean steve

77
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,919
jobs you know used that term you know in

78
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,080
somewhat of an arrogant way but i think

79
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,839
it's a real thing that it was designed

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,040
to fit a friend of mine actually

81
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,800
expressed this really well he said

82
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,719
python just fits in my head

83
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
and there's nothing better to to say

84
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,318
than that now now people might argue

85
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,959
modern python there's a lot more

86
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:53,199
complexity but certainly as version 5

87
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,800
152 i think is my first version

88
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,479
that fit in my head very easily so

89
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,000
that's what made me fall in love with it

90
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,679
okay so

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,158
the most beautiful

92
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,800
feature of python that made you stay in

93
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,120
love it's like over the years

94
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,080
what has like you know you do a double

95
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,080
take you you return too often as a thing

96
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,480
that just brings you a smile i really

97
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,800
still like the um

98
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,199
the ability to play with meta classes

99
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,280
and express higher order things when i

100
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,280
have to create some new

101
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,360
object model to model something right

102
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,280
it's easy for me because i'm i'm pretty

103
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,200
expert as a python programmer i can

104
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,878
easily put all sorts of lovely things

105
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,958
together and use properties and

106
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,798
decorators and other kinds of things and

107
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,199
create something that feels very nice so

108
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,000
that that to me i would say that's tied

109
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,399
with the numpy and vectorization

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,919
capabilities i love thinking in terms of

111
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200
the matrices and the vectors and these

112
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,518
kind of

113
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,000
data structures so i would say those two

114
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,640
are kind of uh tied for me so the

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,158
elegance of the numpy data structure

116
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,359
like slicing through the different

117
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,039
multi-dimensions yeah there's just

118
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,480
enough things there it's like a very

119
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:02,639
it's a very simple comfortable tool just

120
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,878
it's easy to reason about what it does

121
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,039
when you don't stray too far afield

122
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,639
can you uh put your finger on

123
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,959
how to design

124
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,839
a language such that it fits in your

125
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,319
head

126
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,199
certain things like the colon or the

127
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:20,238
certain notation aspects of python that

128
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,720
just kind of work is it uh something you

129
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,359
have to kind of write out on paper look

130
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,440
and say it's just right is it a taste

131
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,800
thing or is there a systematic process

132
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,439
what's your sense

133
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,600
i think it's more of a taste thing

134
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,639
but one one thing that should be said is

135
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
that

136
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,040
you have to pick your audience right so

137
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,439
the better defined the user audience is

138
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,759
or the users are the easier it is to

139
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,240
build something that fits in their minds

140
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,160
because their needs will be more compact

141
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,840
and coherent it is possible to find a

142
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,759
projection right a compact projection

143
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,198
for their needs the more diverse the

144
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,000
user base

145
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,160
the harder that is yeah and so as python

146
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
has grown in popularity that's also

147
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,680
naturally created more complexity as

148
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,520
people try to design any given thing

149
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,439
there will be multiple valid

150
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,719
opinions about a particular design

151
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:10,240
approach and so i do think that's the

152
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
that's the downside of popularity it's

153
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
almost an intrinsic aspect of the

154
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,680
complexity of the problem well at the

155
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,000
very beginning aren't you an audience of

156
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,918
one isn't ultimately aren't all the

157
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,839
greatest projects in history were just

158
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,560
solving a problem that you yourself had

159
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,399
well so clay shirky in his um book on

160
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,478
crowdsourcing or his kind of thoughts on

161
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,239
crowdsourcing he identifies the first

162
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,159
step of crowdsourcing is me first

163
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,759
collaboration you first have to make

164
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520
something that works well for yourself

165
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,759
yeah it's very telling that when you

166
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,279
look at all of the impactful

167
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,439
big project well they're fundamental

168
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,079
projects now in the scipy and pi data

169
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,120
ecosystem they all started with

170
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,279
the

171
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,879
people in the domain trying to scratch

172
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,079
their own itch and the whole idea of

173
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,600
scratching your own itch is something

174
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,680
that the open source or the free

175
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,479
software world has known for a long time

176
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,160
but in the scientific computing areas

177
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,478
you know these are assistant professors

178
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,160
or electrical engineering grad students

179
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,599
they didn't have really a lot of

180
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,919
programming skills necessarily but

181
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,919
python was just good enough for them to

182
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:11,279
put something together that fit in their

183
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,839
domain right so it's almost like a it's

184
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,879
a necessity as a mother invention aspect

185
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,679
and also it was a really harsh filter

186
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,680
for

187
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,918
utility and compactness and

188
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,199
expressiveness like it was too hard to

189
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,639
use then they wouldn't have built it

190
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,160
because it was just too much trouble

191
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,519
right it was a side project for them and

192
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,960
also necessity creates a kind of

193
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,959
deadline it seems like a lot of these

194
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,279
projects are quickly thrown together

195
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,439
in the in the first step and that even

196
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,519
though it's flawed

197
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,918
that just seems to work well for

198
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,439
software projects well it does work well

199
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,918
for software projects in general and in

200
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,600
this particular space um well one one of

201
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,159
my colleagues uh stan siebert identified

202
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
this that all the projects in the scipy

203
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,120
ecosystem

204
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,360
um you know if we just rattle them off

205
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,959
there's num pai there's scipy built by

206
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,319
different collaborations of people

207
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,879
although travis is the heart of both of

208
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,560
them um but numpy coming from numeric

209
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,159
and numero these are different people

210
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,199
and then you've got pandas you've got

211
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,800
jupiter

212
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,800
or ipython there's um there's matplotlib

213
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,240
there's just so many others i'm you know

214
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
not going to justify trying to name them

215
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,720
all but all of them are actually

216
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,279
different people

217
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,520
and as they rolled out their projects

218
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,079
the fact that they had limited resources

219
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:23,519
meant that they were humble about scope

220
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,918
um a a great famous hacker jamie zawiski

221
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,120
once said that every every geek's dream

222
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,359
is to build

223
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,519
the uh the ultimate middleware right and

224
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,800
the the thing is with these scientists

225
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,918
turned programmers they had no such

226
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,598
theme they were just trying to write

227
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,758
something that was a little bit better

228
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,879
for what they needed the matlab and they

229
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,120
were going to leverage what everyone

230
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,639
else had built so naturally almost in

231
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,918
kind of this annealing process or

232
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,319
whatever we built a very modular

233
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,159
cover of the basic needs of a scientific

234
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,000
computing library

235
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,520
if you look at the whole human story how

236
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,439
much of a leap is it

237
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,639
we've developed all kinds of languages

238
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,038
all kinds of methodologies for

239
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,560
communication he just kind of like grew

240
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,959
this collective intelligence the

241
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,759
civilization grew it expanded

242
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,878
wrote a bunch of books and now we tweet

243
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,960
uh how big of a leap is programming if

244
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,039
programming is yet another language is

245
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,359
it just a nice little trick that's

246
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,079
temporary in our human history or is it

247
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
like

248
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,598
a big

249
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,598
leap in the uh

250
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,918
almost us becoming

251
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,959
uh another organism at a higher level of

252
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:29,038
abstraction something else i think the

253
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,079
act of programming or

254
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,278
using

255
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,879
grammatical constructions of some

256
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,360
underlying primitives

257
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,038
that is something that humans do learn

258
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,038
but every human learns this anyone who

259
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,479
can speak learns how to do this

260
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,879
what makes programming different has

261
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,440
been that up to this point

262
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,958
when we try to give instructions to

263
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,880
computing systems

264
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,958
all of our computers well actually this

265
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,159
is not quite true but i'll first say it

266
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,000
and then i'll tell you to tell you why

267
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,278
it's not true but for the most part we

268
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,879
can think of computers as being these

269
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,439
iterated systems

270
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,759
so when we program we're giving very

271
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,600
precise instructions to uh iterated

272
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,200
systems that then run at um

273
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,040
incomprehensible speed

274
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,160
and run those instructions in my

275
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,360
experience

276
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,159
some people

277
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,720
are just better equipped to model

278
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,319
systematic iterated systems

279
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,610
well whatever iterated systems in their

280
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
head

281
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,759
[Music]

282
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,639
some people are really good at that and

283
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,919
other people are not um and so

284
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,199
when you have like for instance

285
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,199
sometimes people have tried to build

286
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,440
systems that uh make programming easier

287
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,120
by making a visual drag and drop and the

288
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,399
issue is you can have a drag and drop

289
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,600
thing but once you start having to

290
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,120
iterate the system with conditional

291
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,480
logic handling case statements and

292
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,519
branch statements and all these other

293
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,039
things

294
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,639
the visual drag and drop part doesn't

295
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,559
save you anything you still have to

296
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,679
reason about this giant iterated system

297
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,079
with all these different conditions

298
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,278
around it that's the hard part right

299
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,959
so handling iterated logic um

300
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,278
that's the hard part the languages we

301
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,119
use then emerge to give us ability and

302
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,559
capability over these things

303
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,919
now the one exception to this rule of

304
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,919
course is the most popular programming

305
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,319
system in the world which is excel which

306
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,159
is a data flow and a data driven

307
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,240
immediate mode data transformation

308
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,399
oriented programming system

309
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,600
and this actually not an accident that

310
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
that system is the most popular

311
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,600
programming system because it's so

312
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,800
accessible to much of a much broader

313
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,720
group of people

314
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,039
i do think as

315
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,160
we build future computing systems

316
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,599
you're actually already seeing this a

317
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,600
little bit it's much more about

318
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,399
composition of modular blocks

319
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,240
they themselves um actually maintain all

320
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,000
their internal state and the interfaces

321
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,079
between them are well-defined data

322
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,039
schemas and so to stitch these things

323
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,719
together using like ifttt or zapier or

324
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,719
any of these kind of you know i would

325
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,759
say compositional scripting kinds of

326
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,440
things

327
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,879
i mean hypercard was also a little bit

328
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,560
in this vein

329
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:47,519
that's much more accessible to most

330
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,838
people

331
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,078
it's it's really that implicit state

332
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,600
that's so hard for people to track yeah

333
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:54,958
okay so that's modular stuff but there's

334
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,079
also an aspect where you're standing on

335
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,759
the shoulders of giants so you're

336
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,239
building like

337
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,159
higher and higher levels of abstraction

338
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,399
you do that a little bit with language

339
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,519
so with language you develop sort of

340
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,799
ideas philosophies from plato and so on

341
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,799
and then you kind of leverage those

342
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,958
philosophies as you try to have

343
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,199
deeper and deeper conversations but with

344
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,039
programming it seems like you can build

345
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,879
much more complicated systems like

346
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,199
without knowing how everything works you

347
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,958
can build on top of the work of others

348
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,800
and it seems like you're developing more

349
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,159
and more sophisticated

350
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,838
uh

351
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,078
expressions

352
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,480
ability to express ideas

353
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,599
in a computational space i think

354
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,360
it's worth

355
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
pondering the difference here between

356
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,440
complexity and

357
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,320
complication

358
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,160
uh sure okay right back to excel well

359
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,879
not quite back to excel but but the the

360
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:49,199
idea is um you know when we have a human

361
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:52,240
conversation all languages

362
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,440
uh for humans emerged to support um

363
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,720
human uh relational communications

364
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,880
which is that the person we're

365
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,120
communicating with is a person

366
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,720
and they would communicate back to us

367
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,278
and so

368
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,879
we sort of um hit a residence point

369
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,720
right when we actually agree on some

370
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,320
concepts so there's a messiness to it

371
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,240
and there's a fluidity to it with

372
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,079
computing systems when we express

373
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,000
something to the computer and it's wrong

374
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,838
we just try again so we can basically

375
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,440
live many virtual worlds of having

376
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,519
failed at expressing ourselves to the

377
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,440
computer until the one time we expressed

378
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,639
ourselves right then we kind of put in

379
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,399
production and then discover that it's

380
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,200
still wrong you know a few days down the

381
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,639
road so i think the

382
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,480
the sophistication of things that we

383
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,240
build with computing

384
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,440
one has to

385
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,278
really pay attention to the difference

386
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,839
between when an end user is expressing

387
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,399
something onto a system that exists

388
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,040
versus when they're extending the system

389
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,720
to to increase the system's capability

390
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,559
um for someone else to then interface

391
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,320
with we happen to use the same language

392
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,078
for both of those things and usu in most

393
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,600
cases but it doesn't have to be that and

394
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:54,399
excel is actually a great example of

395
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,159
this

396
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,200
of kind of a counterpoint to that

397
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,360
okay so what about the idea of

398
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,440
you said messiness

399
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,720
wouldn't you put

400
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,720
the software 2.0 idea this idea of

401
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,480
machine learning

402
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,200
into the

403
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,480
further and further steps into the world

404
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,079
of messiness

405
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,079
the same kind of beautiful messages of

406
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:21,199
human communication isn't that what

407
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:24,078
machine learning is is uh building

408
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,440
on levels of abstraction that don't have

409
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,278
messiness in them

410
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,800
that uh at the operating system level

411
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,720
then there's python the programming

412
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,479
languages that have more and more power

413
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,680
but then finally

414
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,480
there's a neural networks that

415
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,838
ultimately work with data and so the

416
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,399
programming is almost in the space of

417
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,240
data and the data is allowed to be messy

418
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,720
isn't that a kind of program so the idea

419
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,720
of software 2.0 is a lot of the

420
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,800
programming happens

421
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,240
in the space of data

422
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,159
so back to excel

423
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,919
all roads lead back to excel in the

424
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,439
space of data and also the hyper

425
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,439
parameters of the neural networks and

426
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,040
all of those allow

427
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,480
this the

428
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,240
same kind of messiness that human

429
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,000
communication allows

430
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,759
it does but

431
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,159
you know my background is a physics i

432
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,720
took like two cs courses in college so i

433
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,719
don't have now i did cram a bunch of cs

434
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,278
uh in prep when i applied for grad

435
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,519
school but um but still i don't have a

436
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,360
formal background in computer science um

437
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,039
but what i have observed in studying

438
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,120
programming languages and programming

439
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,799
systems and things like that is that

440
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,919
there seems to be this this this

441
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,479
triangle it's one of these beautiful

442
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,000
little iron triangles in it that you

443
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,399
find in life sometimes

444
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,839
and it's the connection between

445
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,559
the code correctness and kind of

446
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,839
expressiveness of code the semantics of

447
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,919
the data

448
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,440
and then the kind of correctness or

449
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,799
parameters of the underlying hardware

450
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,480
compute system

451
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,759
so there's the algorithms that you want

452
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,720
to you know apply um there's what the

453
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,319
bits

454
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,560
that are stored on whatever media

455
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,000
actually represent so the semantics of

456
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,439
the data you know within the

457
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,600
representation and then there's what the

458
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,120
computer can actually do

459
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,720
in every programming system every

460
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,919
information system

461
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,759
ultimately

462
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,360
finds some spot in the middle of this

463
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,759
little triangle

464
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,519
sometimes some systems collapse them

465
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,919
into just one edge are we are we

466
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,039
including humans as a system no no i'm

467
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,958
just thinking about computing systems

468
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,879
here okay and the reason i bring this up

469
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,719
is because i believe there's no free

470
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,519
lunch around this stuff so if we build

471
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,680
if we build machine learning systems to

472
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,120
sort of write the correct code that is

473
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,359
at a certain level of performance so

474
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,440
it'll sort of select right with the

475
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,199
hyper parameters we can tune kind of how

476
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,920
we want the performance boundary and sla

477
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,958
to

478
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,759
look like

479
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,439
for

480
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,440
transforming some set of inputs into

481
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,320
certain kinds of outputs

482
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,079
that training process itself is

483
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,399
intrinsically sensitive to the kinds of

484
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,439
inputs we put into it it's and it's

485
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,198
quite sensitive to the boundary

486
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,199
conditions we put around the performance

487
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,639
so i think even as we move to using

488
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,719
automated systems to build this

489
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,799
transformation as opposed to humans

490
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,720
explicitly from a top-down perspective

491
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,399
figuring out well this schema and this

492
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,160
database and these columns get selected

493
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,679
for this algorithm and here we put a you

494
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,799
know a fibonacci heap for some other

495
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,719
thing

496
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,559
human design or computer design

497
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,680
ultimately what we hit the boundaries

498
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,638
that we hit with these information

499
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,479
systems is when the representation of

500
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,000
the data hits the real world is where

501
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,440
there's a lot of slop and a lot of

502
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,120
interpretation

503
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,959
and that's where actually i think a lot

504
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,320
of the work will go in the future is

505
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,198
actually understanding kind of how to

506
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,519
better

507
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,439
in this in the view of these live data

508
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,198
systems how to better encode the

509
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,480
semantics of the world

510
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,319
for those things they'll be less about

511
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,720
the details of how we write a particular

512
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,160
sql query okay but given the semantics

513
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,480
of the real world and the messiness of

514
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,719
that what does the word correctness mean

515
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,759
when you're talking about code

516
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,879
there's a lot of dimensions to

517
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,399
correctness

518
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,838
historically and this is one of the

519
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,839
reasons i say that we're coming to the

520
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,160
end of the era of software because for

521
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,800
the last 40 years or so software

522
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:55,039
correctness was really defined

523
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,479
about functional correctness i write a

524
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,559
function it's got some inputs does it

525
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,759
produce the right outputs if so then i

526
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,359
can turn it on hook it up to the live

527
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,440
database and it goes

528
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,038
and more and more now we have i mean in

529
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,880
fact i think the bright line in the sand

530
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,640
between machine learning systems or

531
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,799
modern data-driven systems versus

532
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,240
software classical software systems

533
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,599
is that the values of the input

534
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,959
actually

535
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,240
have to be considered with the function

536
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,000
together to say this whole thing is

537
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,160
correct or not and usually there's a

538
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,480
performance sla as well like did it

539
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,240
actually finish making sla sorry service

540
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,439
level agreement so it has to return

541
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,599
within some time you have a 10

542
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,679
millisecond time budget to return a

543
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,159
prediction of this level of accuracy

544
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,600
right um so these are things that were

545
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,600
not traditionally in most business

546
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,279
computing systems the last 20 years at

547
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,439
all people didn't think about it

548
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:43,279
but now we have value dependence on

549
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,480
functional correctness so that that

550
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,079
question of correctness is becoming a

551
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,079
bigger and bigger question why does that

552
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,839
map to the end of software

553
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,000
we've thought about software as just

554
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,798
this thing that you can do in isolation

555
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,720
with some you know test trial inputs and

556
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,639
in a very you know um

557
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,640
very sort of sandboxed environment and

558
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,400
we can quantify how does it scale how

559
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,440
does it you know perform how many nodes

560
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,038
do we need to allocate if we want to

561
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,880
scale this many inputs

562
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,119
when we start turning this stuff into

563
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,440
prediction systems real cybernetic

564
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,558
systems you're going to find scenarios

565
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,600
where you get inputs that you don't want

566
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,279
to spend a little more time thinking

567
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,558
about you're going to find inputs that

568
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,319
are not it's not clear what you should

569
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,240
do right so then the software has a

570
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,240
varying amount of runtime

571
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,440
and correctness with regard to input and

572
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,120
that is a different kind of system

573
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,720
altogether now it's a full on cybernetic

574
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:28,399
system it's a next generation

575
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,319
information system that is not like

576
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,400
traditional software systems can you

577
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,480
maybe describe what is a cybernetic

578
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,720
system do you include humans in that

579
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,599
picture so is it as a human in the loop

580
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,600
kind of complex mess of the whole kind

581
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,918
of interactivity of software with the

582
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,759
real world or is it something more

583
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,600
concrete well when i say cybernetic i

584
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,000
really do mean that the software itself

585
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,558
is closing the observe orient decide act

586
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,200
loop by itself so humans being out of

587
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:58,319
the loop is is the fact what

588
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,960
for me uh makes it a cybernetic system

589
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,159
and humans are out of that loop when

590
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,160
humans are out of the loop when the

591
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,160
machine is actually sort of deciding on

592
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,600
its own what it should do next to get

593
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,679
more information

594
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,359
that makes it a cybernetic system so

595
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,160
we're just at the dawn of this right i

596
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,079
think everyone talking about mlai it's

597
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,080
it's it's great but really the thing we

598
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,240
should be talking about is when we

599
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,839
really enter the cybernetic era

600
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,599
and all of the questions of ethics and

601
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,480
governance and all correctness and all

602
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,319
these things

603
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,240
they really are the most important

604
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,678
questions okay can we just linger on

605
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,279
this what does it mean for the human to

606
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,120
be out of the loop in a cybernetic

607
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,119
system because isn't the cybernetic

608
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,798
system that's

609
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,599
ultimately accomplished in some kind of

610
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,359
purpose that at the at the bottom

611
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,079
you know the the turtles all the way

612
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,279
down at the bottom turtle is a human

613
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,359
well the human may have set some

614
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,200
criteria but the human wasn't precise so

615
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,439
for instance i just read the other day

616
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,360
that um earlier this year or maybe it

617
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,600
was last year at some point the um

618
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,000
libyan army i think um sent out some

619
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,519
automated killer drones with explosives

620
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,960
um and there was no human in the loop at

621
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,879
that point they basically put them in a

622
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,319
geofenced area said find any moving

623
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,600
target like a truck or vehicle it looks

624
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,200
like this and boom um that's not a human

625
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,079
in the loop right

626
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,759
so increasingly the less human there is

627
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,480
in the loop the more concerned you are

628
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:18,480
about these kinds of systems because uh

629
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,360
there's unintended consequences like

630
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,360
less

631
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,599
the original designer and engineer of

632
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,279
the system is able to predict

633
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:26,879
even one with good intent is able to

634
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,798
predict the consequences of such a

635
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,559
system is that that's right there are

636
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,000
some software systems right that run

637
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,119
without humans in the loop that are

638
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,798
quite complex and that's like the

639
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,279
electronic markets and we get flash

640
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,679
crashes all the time we get um you know

641
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,038
in the in the heyday of high frequency

642
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,480
trading there's a lot of market

643
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,279
microstructure people doing all sorts of

644
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,038
weird stuff that the market

645
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,519
designers had never really thought about

646
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,798
contemplated or intended so when we run

647
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,038
these full-on systems with these

648
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,558
automated trading bots um

649
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,240
now they become automated you know

650
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,279
killer drones and then all sorts of

651
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,120
other stuff

652
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,720
we we are that's what i mean by we're at

653
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,759
the dawn of the cybernetic era and the

654
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,839
end of the era of just pure software

655
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,279
are you more concerned

656
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,519
if you're thinking about cybernetic

657
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,240
systems or even like self-replicating

658
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,000
systems so systems that aren't just

659
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,000
doing a particular task but are able to

660
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,200
sort of multiply and scale in some

661
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,880
dimension

662
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,640
in the digital or

663
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,640
even the physical world are you more

664
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,200
concerned about uh

665
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,038
like the lobster being boiled so a

666
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,840
gradual with us not noticing

667
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,519
collapse of civilization or

668
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,399
a big explosion

669
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,000
uh it's like oops

670
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,000
kind of a big thing where everyone

671
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
notices but it's too late

672
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,079
i think that

673
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,839
it will be a different experience for

674
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:49,439
different people

675
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,839
um i do i do um share a common point of

676
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,880
view with some of the climate um

677
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:55,439
you know people who are concerned about

678
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,280
climate change and and just the

679
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,798
uh this uh

680
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,359
the the big existential risks that we

681
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,798
have but unlike a lot of people who are

682
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,879
who share my level of concern i think

683
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,440
the collapse will not be

684
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,000
quite so dramatic as some of them think

685
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,840
and what i mean is that i think that for

686
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,558
certain tiers of let's say economic

687
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,798
class or certain locations in the world

688
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,558
people will experience dramatic collapse

689
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,440
scenarios but for a lot of people

690
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:23,839
especially in the developed world the

691
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,600
realities of collapse will be managed

692
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,519
there will be narrative management

693
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,359
around it so that

694
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,798
they essentially insulate the middle

695
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,158
class will be used to insulate the upper

696
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,639
class from

697
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,919
the pitch forks and the and the um

698
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,840
flaming torches and everything it's

699
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,679
interesting because uh so my specific

700
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,038
question wasn't is

701
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,759
my question was more about cybernetic

702
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:45,279
systems the software okay uh it's

703
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,679
interesting but it would nevertheless

704
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,359
perhaps be about class so the effect of

705
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,679
algorithms might affect certain classes

706
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,678
more than others absolutely i was more

707
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,200
thinking about whether it's social media

708
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,679
algorithms or actual robots

709
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,919
is there going to be a gradual effect on

710
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,919
us where we wake up

711
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,120
one day and don't recognize the humans

712
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,440
we are

713
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,519
or or is it something truly dramatic

714
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,840
where there's you know like

715
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,158
a meltdown of a nuclear reactor kind of

716
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,119
thing chernobyl like uh catastrophic

717
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,039
events

718
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,759
that um

719
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:22,319
are almost bugs in a program that scaled

720
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:26,158
itself too quickly yeah i'm not as

721
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,918
concerned about the visible stuff

722
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,760
and the reason is because the big

723
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,200
visible explosions i mean this is

724
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,558
something i said about social media is

725
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,558
that you know at least with nuclear

726
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,240
weapons when a newt goes off you can see

727
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,158
it and you're like well that's really

728
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,319
wow that's kind of bad right i mean

729
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,520
oppenheimer was reciting the baha'i gita

730
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,960
right when he saw one of those things go

731
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,440
off so

732
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,840
we can see nukes are really bad he's not

733
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,240
reciting anything about twitter

734
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:52,558
well but right but then when when you

735
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,558
have social media when you have um all

736
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,639
these different things that conspire to

737
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:59,359
create a layer of virtual experience for

738
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,960
people that alienates them from you know

739
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,879
reality and from each other

740
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,360
that's very pernicious it's impossible

741
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,039
to see right and it kind of slowly gets

742
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,479
in there so

743
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,960
you've written about this idea of

744
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,240
virtuality on this topic which you

745
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,159
define as the subjective phenomenon of

746
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,400
knowingly engaging with virtual

747
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,640
sensation and perception and suspending

748
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,919
or forgetting the context that it's uh

749
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,759
somalicum

750
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,799
so let me ask

751
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,319
uh

752
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,119
what is real

753
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,678
is there a hard line between reality and

754
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,599
virtuality like perception drifts from

755
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,919
some kind of physical reality we have to

756
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,639
kind of have a sense of what is the line

757
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,038
that's to we've gone too far right right

758
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,000
for me it's not about any hard line

759
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:46,400
about physical reality as much as

760
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,200
um a simple question of

761
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,679
um

762
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,240
does the particular technology

763
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,038
help people connect in a more integral

764
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,880
way with other people with their

765
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,798
environment with all of the full

766
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,720
spectrum of things around them so it's

767
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,440
less about oh this is a virtual thing

768
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,600
and this is a hard real thing more about

769
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,919
when we create virtual representations

770
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,678
of the real things um

771
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,480
always some things are lost in

772
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,559
translation usually many many dimensions

773
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,679
are lost in translation right we're now

774
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:17,278
coming to

775
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,480
almost two years of covet people on zoom

776
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:19,759
all the time you know it's different

777
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,960
when you meet somebody in person than

778
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:22,319
when you see them i've seen you on

779
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,079
youtube lots right

780
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,278
but the senior person is very different

781
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:28,319
and so

782
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,679
i think when we engage in virtual

783
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,918
experiences

784
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,159
all the time and we only do that there

785
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,320
is absolutely a level of embodiment

786
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,640
there's a level of embodied experience

787
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:40,158
some participatory interaction that is

788
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,600
lost

789
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,278
and it's very hard to put your finger on

790
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,158
exactly what it is it's hard to say oh

791
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,240
we're gonna spend a hundred million

792
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,799
dollars building a new system that

793
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,038
captures this five to five five percent

794
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,960
better higher fidelity human expression

795
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:55,440
no one's gonna pay for that right so

796
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,038
when we rush madly into

797
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,159
a world of simulacrum and and virtuality

798
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,640
um

799
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,159
you know the things that are lost are

800
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,759
it's difficult

801
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,360
once everyone moves there it can be hard

802
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,240
to look back and see what we've what

803
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,959
we've lost so is it irrecoverably lost

804
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,079
or rather when you put it all on the

805
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,840
table

806
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,480
is it possible for more to be gained

807
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,839
than is lost if you look at video games

808
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,558
they create

809
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:24,480
virtual experiences that are surreal

810
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,240
and can bring joy to a lot of people can

811
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,240
connect a lot of people

812
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,759
uh and can get people to talk a lot of

813
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,359
trash uh

814
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,759
so they can bring out the best and the

815
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,599
worst in people so is it possible to

816
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,480
have a future world

817
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,000
where the pros outweigh the cons

818
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,400
it is i mean it's possible to have that

819
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,640
in the in the current world but

820
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,840
um when

821
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,880
literally trillions of dollars of

822
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,918
capital are tied to using those things

823
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,799
to

824
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,880
groom the worst of our inclinations

825
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,720
and to attack our weaknesses in the

826
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,159
limbic system to create these things

827
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,120
into id machines versus connection

828
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,080
machines

829
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,759
then um then the those good things don't

830
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,960
stand a chance can you make a lot of

831
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,119
money by building connection machines is

832
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,120
it possible do you think

833
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,959
to bring out the best in human nature to

834
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,278
uh create fulfilling connections and

835
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,919
relationships in the digital world and

836
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:20,880
make a ton of money

837
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,480
um if i it out i'll let you know

838
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,480
but what's your intuition without

839
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,319
concretely knowing what's

840
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,798
my intuition is that a lot of our

841
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:31,200
digital technologies give us the ability

842
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,038
to have synthetic connections or to

843
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,840
experience virtuality

844
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,119
they have co-evolved

845
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,199
with

846
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:41,278
sort of the human expectations it's sort

847
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,880
of like sugary drinks as people have

848
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,200
more sugary drinks they get they need

849
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,679
more sugary drinks to get that same hit

850
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,278
right so with these virtual things

851
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,360
and with tv

852
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,640
and fast cuts and you know tick tocks

853
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,959
and all these different kinds of things

854
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,679
we're co-creating essentially humanity

855
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,278
that

856
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,360
sort of asks and needs those things and

857
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,278
now becomes very difficult to get people

858
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,359
to slow down it gets difficult for

859
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,759
people to hold their attention

860
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,839
on on slow things and actually feel that

861
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,398
embodied experience right so mindfulness

862
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,959
now more than ever is so important in

863
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,719
schools and um as a therapy technique

864
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,480
for people because our environment has

865
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,759
been accelerated and mcluhan actually

866
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,519
talks about this in the electric

867
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,038
environment of the television and that

868
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,119
was before tick-tock and before

869
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,200
front-facing cameras so

870
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,038
i think for me the the concern is that

871
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,200
it's not like we can ever switch to

872
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,919
doing something better but more of

873
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,600
the humans and technology

874
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,840
they're not independent of each other

875
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:38,000
the technology that we use

876
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,839
kind of molds what we need for the next

877
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,079
generation of technology yeah but humans

878
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,240
are intelligent and they're uh

879
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,000
introspective and they can reflect on

880
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,519
the experiences of their life so for

881
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,759
example there's been many years in my

882
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,839
life where i i ate an excessive amount

883
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,879
of sugar and then a certain moment i

884
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:54,639
woke up

885
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,240
and said uh

886
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,600
why do i keep doing this this doesn't

887
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,000
feel good

888
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:01,678
like long term and i think

889
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,519
uh so going through the tick tock

890
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,240
process of realizing

891
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,879
okay when i shorten my attention span

892
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,159
actually that does not make me feel good

893
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,840
longer term

894
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,120
and realizing that and then going to

895
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:15,359
platforms

896
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,398
going to places that

897
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,599
um

898
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:21,199
are away from the sugar so so in in so

899
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,119
doing you can create platforms that can

900
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,720
make a lot of money when so to help

901
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,038
people wake up to what actually makes

902
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,360
them feel good long-term develop grow as

903
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,000
human beings and it just feels like

904
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:34,959
humans are more intelligent than

905
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,960
uh mice looking for cheese

906
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,399
they're able to sort of think i mean we

907
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,038
can think we can contemplate our

908
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,158
mortality right and contemplate things

909
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:43,359
like

910
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,000
long-term

911
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,240
love and we can have a long-term fear of

912
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,240
certain things like mortality we can

913
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,720
contemplate whether the

914
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,519
experiences the sort of the drugs of

915
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,319
daily life that we've been partaking in

916
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,319
is making us happier a better people and

917
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,558
then once we contemplate that we can

918
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:04,240
make financial decisions

919
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,000
in using services and paying for

920
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,200
services that are making us better

921
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,319
people so it just seems that

922
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,679
we're in the very first stages of social

923
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,119
networks

924
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,759
that just were able to make a lot of

925
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:20,000
money really quickly but in

926
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,000
bringing out sometimes

927
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
the bad parts of human nature they

928
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
didn't destroy humans they just they

929
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,480
just fed everybody a lot of sugar and

930
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,159
now everyone's gonna wake up and say

931
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,798
hey we're gonna start having like

932
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,720
sugar-free social media right

933
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,240
right well there's a lot to unpack there

934
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,558
i think some people certainly have the

935
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,839
capacity for that and i certainly think

936
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,440
i mean it's very interesting even the

937
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,959
way you said it you woke up one day and

938
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,200
you thought well this doesn't feel very

939
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,319
good yeah well that's still your limbic

940
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,120
system saying this doesn't feel very

941
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:48,639
good

942
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,278
right you have a cat brains worth of

943
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,120
neurons around your gut right and so

944
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:54,960
maybe that exaggerated and that was

945
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,398
telling you hey this isn't good

946
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,159
humans are

947
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,158
more than just mice looking for cheese

948
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,519
or monkeys looking for sex and power

949
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,159
right so

950
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,599
let's slow down now you're um now a lot

951
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,440
of people would argue with you on that

952
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,278
one but we're more than just that but

953
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,759
we're at least that and we're

954
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,480
very very seldom not that

955
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,960
so

956
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,880
um my i don't actually disagree with you

957
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,480
that we could be better and that we can

958
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,159
that better platforms exist and people

959
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,000
are voluntarily noping out of things

960
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,840
like facebook and noting

961
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,519
awesome verb it's a great term yeah i

962
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,798
love it i use it all the time

963
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,480
you're going to have to know part of

964
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,398
that i want to nope out of that right

965
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,798
it's going to be a hard pass and

966
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,479
and that's and that's that's great but

967
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,119
that's again to your point that's the

968
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,240
first generation of front-facing cameras

969
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:43,678
of social pressures and you as a you

970
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,759
know self-starter self-aware adult have

971
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,120
the capacity to say yeah i'm not going

972
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,640
to do that i'm going to go and spend

973
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,319
time on long form reads i'm going to

974
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,000
spend time managing my attention i'm

975
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,798
going to do some yoga

976
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,119
if you're a 15 year old in high school

977
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:58,398
and your entire social environment is

978
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,759
everyone doing these things guess what

979
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:01,199
you're going to do you're going to kind

980
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,119
of have to do that because your limbic

981
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,880
system says hey i need to get the guy or

982
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,798
the girl or whatever and that's what i'm

983
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,320
going to do and so one of the things

984
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,398
that we have to reason about here is the

985
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,240
social media systems or you know social

986
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:13,518
media i think is a

987
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,000
first

988
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,558
our first encounter with

989
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,679
a technological system

990
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:24,079
that runs a bit of a loop around

991
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,759
our own cognition and attention

992
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,480
it's not the last

993
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,000
it's it's far from the last and it gets

994
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,640
to the heart of some of the

995
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,480
philosophical achilles heel of the

996
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,600
western philosophical system which is

997
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,599
each person gets to make their own

998
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:39,678
determination each person is an

999
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:41,119
individual that's you know sacrosanct in

1000
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,120
their agency and their sovereignty and

1001
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,359
all these things the problem with these

1002
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,759
systems is they come down and they are

1003
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,199
able to manage everyone on mass

1004
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,919
and so every person is making their own

1005
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,240
decision but together the the bigger

1006
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,200
system is causing them to act with a

1007
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,599
group

1008
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,480
um dynamic that's very profitable for

1009
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,879
people

1010
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,960
so this is the issue that we have is

1011
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,880
that our philosophies are actually not

1012
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,360
geared to understand

1013
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,159
what is it for a person to be to have an

1014
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,719
uh

1015
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,320
high trust connection uh as part of a

1016
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,159
collective and for that collective to

1017
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,558
have its right to coherency and agency

1018
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,440
that's something like when when a social

1019
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,879
media app causes a family to break apart

1020
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,000
it's done harm to more than just

1021
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,278
individuals right so that concept is not

1022
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,519
something we really talk about or think

1023
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,200
about very much but that's actually the

1024
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,200
problem is that we're vaporizing

1025
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,640
molecules into atomic units and then

1026
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,399
we're hitting all the atoms with certain

1027
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,799
things that's like yeah well that person

1028
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:41,199
chose to look at my app so our

1029
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:43,200
understanding of human nature is at the

1030
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,360
individual level it emphasizes the

1031
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,278
individual too much because ultimately

1032
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,278
society operates at the collective level

1033
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,839
and these apps do as well and the apps

1034
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:54,000
do as well so for us to understand the

1035
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,918
progression the development of this

1036
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,359
organism we call human civilization we

1037
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,120
have to think of the collective level

1038
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,439
too i would say multi-tiered

1039
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,359
multi-tiered multi-so individual as well

1040
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,480
individuals family units social

1041
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,199
collectives

1042
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,358
um and and on the way up okay two so

1043
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,679
you've said that individual humans are

1044
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:14,078
multi-layered susceptible to signals and

1045
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,000
waves and multiple strata the physical

1046
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,679
the biological social cultural

1047
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,519
intellectual so

1048
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,119
sort of going along these lines can you

1049
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:23,679
describe

1050
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,200
the layers of the cake that that is a

1051
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,760
human being

1052
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,039
and maybe the human collective human

1053
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,359
society

1054
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,719
so i'm just stealing wholesale here from

1055
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,078
robert persig

1056
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,398
who is the author of zen in the art of

1057
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,679
motorcycle maintenance and in his um

1058
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:38,559
follow-on

1059
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,720
book

1060
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,239
uh has a sequel to it called lila he

1061
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,358
goes into this in a little more detail

1062
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,759
but um it's it's a it's a crude approach

1063
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:48,960
to thinking about people but i think

1064
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,119
it's still an advancement over

1065
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,878
traditional subject object metaphysics

1066
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,000
where we look at people as

1067
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,920
a dualist would say well is is your mind

1068
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,079
you know your consciousness is that

1069
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,240
is that just merely the matter that's in

1070
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,839
your brain or is there something kind of

1071
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,399
more beyond that and they would say yes

1072
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:08,239
there's a soul sort of ineffable

1073
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,559
soul beyond just merely the physical

1074
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,639
body right and then and i'm not one of

1075
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,400
those people right i think that we don't

1076
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,719
have to draw a line between

1077
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,240
are things only this or only that

1078
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,399
collectives of things can emerge

1079
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,559
structures and patterns that are just as

1080
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,320
real as the underlying pieces but you

1081
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,480
know they're transcendent but they're

1082
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,800
still of the underlying pieces

1083
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,440
so your body is this way i mean we just

1084
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,440
know physically you consist of atoms and

1085
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,800
uh and and whatnot and then the atoms

1086
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,960
are arranged into molecules which then

1087
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,359
arrange into certain kinds of structures

1088
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,599
that seem to have a homeostasis to them

1089
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:44,400
we call them cells and those cells form

1090
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,838
you know sort of biological structures

1091
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,720
those biological structures give your

1092
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:48,639
body

1093
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,159
its physical ability and biological

1094
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:53,039
ability to consume energy and to

1095
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:55,039
maintain homeostasis but humans are

1096
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,838
social animals and a human by themselves

1097
00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,079
is is not very long for the world so we

1098
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,239
also part of our biology is wire to

1099
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,400
connect to other people to you know from

1100
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,159
the mirror neurons to our language uh

1101
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,880
centers and all these other things

1102
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,039
so

1103
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,119
we are intrinsically there's a layer

1104
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,039
there's a part of us that wants to be

1105
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,800
part of a thing if we're around other

1106
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,320
people not saying a word but they're

1107
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,480
just up and down jumping and dancing

1108
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,400
laughing we're gonna feel better right

1109
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,159
and they didn't there was no exchange of

1110
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,880
physical anything they didn't give us

1111
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:27,039
like five atoms of happiness right but

1112
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,519
there's an induction in our own sense of

1113
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:32,079
self that is at that social level

1114
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,759
and then beyond that um

1115
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,119
person puts the intellectual level kind

1116
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,720
of one level higher than social i think

1117
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,119
they're actually more intertwined than

1118
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,439
that but the intellectual level is

1119
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,599
the the level of pure ideas that you are

1120
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,960
a vessel for memes you're a vessel for

1121
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,240
philosophies

1122
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,599
you will conduct yourself in a

1123
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:48,959
particular way

1124
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,920
i mean i think part of this is if we

1125
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,240
think about it from a physics

1126
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,159
perspective you're not you know there's

1127
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:55,838
a joke that physicists like to um

1128
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,279
approximate things and we'll say well

1129
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,400
approximate a spherical cowl right

1130
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,720
you're not a spherical cow you're not a

1131
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,358
spherical human you're a messy human and

1132
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:05,118
we can't even um say what the dynamics

1133
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,519
of your emotion will be unless we

1134
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,400
analyze all four of these layers

1135
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,400
right

1136
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,680
if it's if you're if you're muslim at a

1137
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,960
certain time of day guess what you're

1138
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,639
going to be on the ground kneeling and

1139
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,240
praying right and that has nothing to do

1140
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,799
with your biological need to get on the

1141
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:20,479
ground or physics of gravity it is an

1142
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,400
intellectual drive that you have it's a

1143
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,480
cultural phenomenon and an intellectual

1144
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,880
belief that you carry so that's what the

1145
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,719
four layered stack

1146
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,480
is is all about it's that a person is

1147
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:31,759
not only one of these things they're all

1148
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,199
of these things at the same time it's a

1149
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,599
superposition

1150
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,199
of dynamics that run through us that

1151
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,838
make us who we are

1152
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:41,759
so no layers is special

1153
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,519
um not so much nowhere especially each

1154
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,680
layer is just different

1155
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,199
um but we are

1156
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,159
each layer against the participation

1157
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,000
trophy

1158
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:51,519
yeah each layer is a part of what you

1159
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,079
are you are a layer cake right of all

1160
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,519
these things and if we try to deny

1161
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,480
right so many philosophies do try to

1162
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:58,559
deny

1163
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,320
the reality of some of these things

1164
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,480
right some people say well we're only

1165
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,359
atoms well we're not only atoms because

1166
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,760
there's a lot of other things that are

1167
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,838
only atoms i can reduce a human being to

1168
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,960
a bunch of soup and it's not they're not

1169
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:11,599
the same thing even though it's the same

1170
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,240
atoms so i think the the order and the

1171
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,838
patterns that emerge within humans

1172
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:17,358
to understand

1173
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:18,880
to really think about what a next

1174
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:20,480
generation philosophy would look like

1175
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,720
that would allow us to reason about

1176
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,400
extending humans into the digital realm

1177
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,639
or to interact with autonomous

1178
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,960
intelligences that are not biological

1179
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:30,799
nature we really need to appreciate

1180
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,199
these that human what human beings

1181
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,640
actually are is the superposition of

1182
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,480
these different layers

1183
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,559
you mentioned consciousness

1184
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,599
are each of these layers of cake

1185
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,159
conscious

1186
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,880
is consciousness a particular quality of

1187
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,879
one of the layers is there like a spike

1188
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,720
if you have a consciousness detector at

1189
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,480
these layers or it's something that just

1190
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:52,319
permeates all of these layers and just

1191
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,320
takes different form i believe what

1192
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,480
humans experience as consciousness

1193
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,519
is something that sits on a gradient

1194
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,559
scale

1195
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:00,639
of

1196
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,159
a general principle in the universe that

1197
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:04,960
seems to

1198
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:07,118
look for order and reach for order when

1199
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,559
there's an excess of energy you know

1200
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,160
it's it would be odd to say a proton is

1201
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,358
alive right it'd be odd to say like this

1202
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:15,838
particular atom or molecule of of

1203
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:18,159
hydrogen gas is alive

1204
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,920
but there's certainly something

1205
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:22,000
we can make

1206
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,240
assemblages of these things that that

1207
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,159
are that have autopoetic aspects to them

1208
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,919
that will create structures that will

1209
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,879
you know crystalline solids will form

1210
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,680
very interesting and beautiful

1211
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,119
structures um this gets kind of into

1212
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,559
weird mathematical territories you start

1213
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,200
thinking about penrose and game of life

1214
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,799
stuff uh about the generativity of math

1215
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,960
itself like the hyper real numbers

1216
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,720
things like that but um without going

1217
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,440
down that rabbit hole i would say that

1218
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,838
there seems to be a tendency

1219
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,400
in the world that when there is

1220
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,679
excess energy things will structure and

1221
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,760
pattern themselves and they will then

1222
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:56,000
actually furthermore try to create an

1223
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,839
environment that furthers their

1224
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,838
continued stability

1225
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,239
it's the concept of externalized

1226
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:02,960
extended phenotype or niche construction

1227
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,358
so

1228
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,079
um this is ultimately what leads to

1229
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:09,679
certain kinds of amino acids forming

1230
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,280
certain kinds of structures and so forth

1231
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,118
until you get the ladder of life so what

1232
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,640
we experience as consciousness no i

1233
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,760
don't think cells are conscious of that

1234
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:20,078
level but is there something beyond mere

1235
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,040
equilibrium state biology and and

1236
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,400
chemistry and biochemistry that drives

1237
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:25,279
what makes things

1238
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,358
work

1239
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,200
i think there is um

1240
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:31,039
so adrian bajan has this constructive

1241
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,399
law there's other things you look at

1242
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:33,920
when you look at the life sciences and

1243
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,920
you look at

1244
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,358
any kind of statistical physics and

1245
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,639
statistical mechanics

1246
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:40,559
when you look at things far out of

1247
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,639
equilibrium

1248
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,159
when you have excess energy what happens

1249
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,759
then life

1250
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,279
doesn't just make a harder soup it

1251
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,599
starts making structure

1252
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,839
there's something there the poetry of

1253
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,000
reaches for order when there's an excess

1254
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:57,119
of energy

1255
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,760
because you brought up game of life

1256
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,920
you did it not me my i love cellular

1257
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,240
automata so i have to sort of

1258
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,480
linger on that for a little bit

1259
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,719
so cellular automata i guess is uh or

1260
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,159
game of life is a very simple example of

1261
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,919
reaching for order when there's an

1262
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,440
excess of energy

1263
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,639
or reaching for order and somehow

1264
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,200
creating complexity it within like this

1265
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:24,400
explosion of just

1266
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:27,279
turmoil somehow trying to construct

1267
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,680
structures and so doing

1268
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,400
uh creates very elaborate

1269
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:34,078
organism-looking type things

1270
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,720
what intuition do you draw from this

1271
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,960
simple mechanism well i i like to turn

1272
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,118
that around on its head and um

1273
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,519
and look at it as what if every single

1274
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,760
one of the patterns created

1275
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,440
life or created you know not life but

1276
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,119
created interesting patterns because you

1277
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,039
know some of them don't and sometimes

1278
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,079
you make cool gliders and other times

1279
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:53,838
you know you start with certain things

1280
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,680
and you make gliders and other things

1281
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,199
that then construct like you know and

1282
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,759
gates and not gates right and you build

1283
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:01,039
computers on them um all of these rules

1284
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,440
that create these patterns that we can

1285
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,480
see those are just the patterns we can

1286
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,079
see

1287
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,240
what if our subjectivity is actually

1288
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,560
limiting our ability to perceive

1289
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,358
the order in all of it

1290
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,480
you know what are some of the things

1291
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:13,838
that we think are random are actually

1292
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,400
not that random we're simply not

1293
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:18,318
integrating at a final f level across a

1294
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,838
broad enough time horizon

1295
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:21,279
um and this is again i said we go down

1296
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:23,039
the rabbit holes and the penrose stuff

1297
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,880
or like wolf runs explorations on these

1298
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,199
things um

1299
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,039
there is something deep and beautiful in

1300
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,239
the mathematics of all this that is

1301
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,559
hopefully one day i'll have enough money

1302
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:33,919
to work and retire and just ponder those

1303
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:35,279
those questions but there's something

1304
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,960
there but you're saying there's a

1305
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,560
ceiling to when you have enough money

1306
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,240
and you retire and you ponder it there's

1307
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,679
a ceiling to how much you can truly

1308
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:42,959
ponder because there's cognitive

1309
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,639
limitations

1310
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,318
in what you're able to

1311
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,358
perceive as a pattern

1312
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,239
yeah so and maybe mathematics extends

1313
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,318
your

1314
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:55,358
perception capabilities but it's still

1315
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:57,039
it's still finite it's just like

1316
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:58,880
yeah the mathematics we use is the

1317
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,480
mathematics that can fit in our head

1318
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,599
yeah

1319
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,679
you know did god really create the

1320
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,280
integers or did god create all of it and

1321
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,039
we just happen at this point in time to

1322
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,640
be able to perceive integers

1323
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,880
well she just did the the positive

1324
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:10,879
energy

1325
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,078
and then we

1326
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,680
um

1327
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,039
she just graded the natural numbers and

1328
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,399
then we screwed all up with zero and

1329
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,480
then i guess okay

1330
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,599
but we did we created mathematical uh

1331
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,599
operations so we can have iterated steps

1332
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,440
to approach bigger problems

1333
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,599
right i mean the entire the entire point

1334
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,000
of the arabic numeral system and it's a

1335
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,359
rubric for mapping a certain set of

1336
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,199
operations and folding them into a

1337
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:37,119
simple little expression

1338
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,639
but that's just the operations that we

1339
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,160
can fit in our heads

1340
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,039
there are many other operations besides

1341
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,598
right

1342
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:45,920
the thing that worries me the most about

1343
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,880
aliens and humans

1344
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,720
is that their aliens are all around us

1345
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,599
and we're too dumb

1346
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:56,159
yeah see them oh certainly yeah or life

1347
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,800
let's say just life life of all kinds of

1348
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:01,920
forms or organisms you know what just

1349
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,480
even the intelligence of organisms

1350
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,039
is uh imperceptible to us because we're

1351
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,599
too dumb and

1352
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,159
we're looking self-centered

1353
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,838
a particular kind of thing yeah

1354
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,318
when i was at cornell i had a lovely

1355
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,639
professor of asian religions jamerry law

1356
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,960
and she would tell this um story about a

1357
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:21,039
musical a musician a western musician

1358
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,400
who went to japan and he taught you know

1359
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:23,519
classical music and

1360
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,920
could play you know all sorts of

1361
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,519
instruments he went to japan um and he

1362
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,960
would ask people you know he would

1363
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,639
basically be looking for things in the

1364
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,119
style of

1365
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,879
western you know chromatic scale and

1366
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,838
these kinds of things and then finding

1367
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,680
none of it he would say well there's

1368
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,039
really no music in japan but they're

1369
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:40,480
using a different scale they're playing

1370
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,079
different kinds of instruments right the

1371
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,838
same thing she was using as sort of a

1372
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,680
metaphor for religion as well in the

1373
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:47,838
west we center a lot of religion

1374
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,239
certainly the the religions of abraham

1375
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:52,318
we center them around belief and in the

1376
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,759
east it's more about practice right

1377
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,920
spirituality and practice rather than

1378
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,280
belief so anyway the point is here to

1379
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,519
your point um life we i think so many

1380
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,200
people are so fixated on certain aspects

1381
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,920
of self-replication

1382
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:08,239
or you know homeostasis or whatever

1383
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,720
but if we kind of broaden and generalize

1384
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,239
this thing of things reaching for order

1385
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,239
under which conditions can they then

1386
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:15,118
create an environment that sustains that

1387
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:18,159
order

1388
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,680
that um allows them you know the the

1389
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,358
invention of death is an interesting

1390
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:23,279
thing there are some organisms on earth

1391
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:24,880
that are thousands of years old

1392
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,960
and it's not like they're incredibly

1393
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,400
complex actually simpler than the cells

1394
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,679
that comprise us

1395
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,440
but they never die so at some point um

1396
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,960
death was invented you know somewhere

1397
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,039
along the eukaryotic scale i mean even

1398
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,519
the protists right there's death

1399
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,679
and why is that along with the

1400
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,759
sexual reproduction right there is

1401
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:45,440
something about

1402
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,960
the renewal process something about the

1403
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,960
ability to respond to a changing

1404
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,480
environment where

1405
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,920
it just becomes you know just killing

1406
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,280
off the old generation and letting new

1407
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,079
generations

1408
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,839
try seems to be the best way to fit into

1409
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,240
the niche you know human historian seems

1410
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,480
to write about wheels and fires the

1411
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,639
greatest inventions but it seems like

1412
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,920
death and sex are pretty good and

1413
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:07,358
they're they're kind of essential

1414
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,960
inventions at the very beginning at the

1415
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:10,400
very beginning yeah well we didn't

1416
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,079
invent them right

1417
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,639
well broad we

1418
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,200
you didn't invent life i see us as one

1419
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:19,679
uh you particular homo sapien did not

1420
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:21,759
invent them but uh we together it's a

1421
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,598
team project just like you're saying i

1422
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,839
think the greatest homo sapien

1423
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,079
invention is collaboration so when you

1424
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:29,078
say collaboration

1425
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,720
peter where do ideas come from

1426
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,079
and how do they take hold in society

1427
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,000
what's is that the nature of

1428
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,318
collaboration is that the basic atom of

1429
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,400
collaboration is ideas

1430
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,000
it's not not ideas but it's not only

1431
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,680
ideas there's a book i just started

1432
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,440
reading called death from a distance

1433
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:50,239
have you heard of this no it's a really

1434
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,039
fascinating thesis which is that

1435
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,919
humans are the only conspecific

1436
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:55,358
the

1437
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,159
the only species that can kill other

1438
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,838
members of the species from range

1439
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:01,199
and maybe there's a few exceptions but

1440
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:02,960
if you look in the animal world you see

1441
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,480
like pronghorns butting heads right you

1442
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,079
see the alpha

1443
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,240
lion and the beta lion and they take

1444
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,920
each other down humans we develop the

1445
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,078
ability to chuck rocks at each other and

1446
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,079
while at prey but also at each other and

1447
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,240
that means the beta male can chunk a

1448
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,280
rock at the alpha male and take them

1449
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:19,199
down

1450
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,720
and with very he can throw a lot of

1451
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,598
rocks actually miss a bunch of times so

1452
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:25,759
just hit once and be good so

1453
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,680
this ability to actually kill members of

1454
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,839
our own species from range without a

1455
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,279
threat of harm to ourselves

1456
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,119
created essentially mutually assured

1457
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,200
destruction where we had to evolve

1458
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,200
cooperation if we didn't

1459
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,279
then if we just continue to try to do

1460
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:40,960
like i'm the biggest monkey in the tribe

1461
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,119
and i'm gonna you know

1462
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,440
own this tribe and you have to go

1463
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,358
if we do it that way then those tribes

1464
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,358
basically failed and the tribes that's

1465
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:51,598
that persisted and that have now given

1466
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:53,920
rise to the modern homo sapiens are the

1467
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,838
ones where respecting the fact that we

1468
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,119
can kill each other from range

1469
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:59,519
uh without heart like there's an

1470
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,838
asymmetric ability to to snipe the

1471
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,838
leader from range that

1472
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:05,358
meant that we sort of had to learn how

1473
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:06,480
to cooperate with each other right come

1474
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:08,558
back here don't throw that rock at me

1475
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,400
let's talk our witnesses out so violence

1476
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,160
is also part of collaboration the threat

1477
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,559
of violence let's say

1478
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,558
well the recognition i was maybe the

1479
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,760
better way to put it is the recognition

1480
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,960
that we have more to gain by working

1481
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,680
together

1482
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,440
than the prisoner's dilemma of both of

1483
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,440
us defecting

1484
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:27,440
so uh mutually assured destruction in

1485
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,519
all his forms is part of this idea of

1486
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,358
collaboration well and eric weinstein

1487
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:32,800
talks about our nuclear piece right i

1488
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,239
mean it kind of sucks with thousands of

1489
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,400
warheads aimed at each other we mean

1490
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:37,598
russia and the us but it's like on the

1491
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,680
other hand

1492
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,280
you know we only fought proxy wars right

1493
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,039
we did not have another world war three

1494
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,280
of like hundreds of millions of people

1495
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,679
dying to like machine gun fire and and

1496
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,240
you know giant you know guided missiles

1497
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:52,159
so the original nuclear weapon is a rock

1498
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:53,358
that we learned how to throw essentially

1499
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,039
the original yeah well the original

1500
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:58,078
scope of the world for any human being

1501
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,079
was their little tribe

1502
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,838
i would say it still is to the most for

1503
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:03,599
the most

1504
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:05,679
part eric weinstein

1505
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,838
speaks very highly of you

1506
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:10,239
which was very surprising to me at first

1507
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:13,039
because i didn't know there's this depth

1508
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:14,318
to you because i knew you as a as a as

1509
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:16,159
an amazing

1510
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,400
leader of engineers and engineer

1511
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:21,920
yourself and so on so it's fascinating

1512
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,318
maybe just as a comment uh a side

1513
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,480
tangent that we can take uh what's your

1514
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:29,039
nature of your friendship with eric

1515
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,358
weinstein how did the two how did such

1516
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:33,920
two interesting paths cross is it

1517
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:36,239
your origins in physics is it your

1518
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,760
interest in philosophy and the ideas of

1519
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,439
how the world works what is it it's

1520
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,240
actually it's very random it's uh eric

1521
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,119
found me um he actually found travis uh

1522
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:46,558
and and i um sheriff elephant yeah we

1523
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,480
were both working at a company called

1524
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,720
nthot uh back in the mid 2000's and

1525
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,960
we're doing um a lot of consulting

1526
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:55,279
around scientific python um and we'd

1527
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,280
made some some tools and uh eric was

1528
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,519
trying to use some of these python tools

1529
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,880
to visualize he had a fiber bundle

1530
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,440
approach to

1531
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,640
modeling certain aspects of economics he

1532
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,318
was doing this and that's how he kind of

1533
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,879
got in touch with us and so

1534
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:10,838
um this was in the early

1535
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,838
mid

1536
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:17,039
2000s 07 time frame oh six or seven eric

1537
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:18,318
weinstein trying to use python right

1538
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:19,838
hyper bundles

1539
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:21,759
uh using some of the tools that we've

1540
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:23,358
built in the open source that's somehow

1541
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,000
entertaining to me that's the thought of

1542
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,119
that it's really funny but then um you

1543
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,400
know we met with him a couple of times

1544
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,720
really interesting guy and then in the

1545
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,358
wake of the 0708 kind of financial

1546
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:35,919
collapse he uh helped organize with lee

1547
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:36,960
smolin um a symposium at the perimeter

1548
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,519
institute

1549
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,119
about um okay well clearly

1550
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:42,079
you know big finance can't be trusted

1551
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,200
governments in its pockets would

1552
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:47,039
regularly capture what the f do we do

1553
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:49,039
um and all sorts of people nasim talib

1554
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:50,480
was there and uh andy lowe from mit was

1555
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:52,159
there and you know

1556
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,880
bill jainway i mean just a lot of you

1557
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:54,960
know

1558
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,079
top billing people were there and he

1559
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:00,400
invited me and uh travis and uh another

1560
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,640
one of her co-workers uh robert kern who

1561
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,880
is a anyone in the scipy numpy community

1562
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:06,159
knows robert um really great guy so the

1563
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,280
three of us also got invited to go to

1564
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:09,279
this thing and that's where i met brett

1565
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:11,599
weinstein for the first time as well

1566
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,240
yeah i knew him before he got all famous

1567
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,318
for unfortunate reasons i guess but uh

1568
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:17,919
but but anyway we um

1569
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,400
so we met then and kind of had a

1570
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,000
friendship um you know throughout

1571
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:25,599
since then you have a depth of thinking

1572
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,599
that uh kind of

1573
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,200
runs with eric in terms of just thinking

1574
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,680
about the world deeply and thinking

1575
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:34,838
philosophically and then there's eric's

1576
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:37,919
interest in programming i actually never

1577
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:40,000
um you know he'll bring up programming

1578
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,318
to me quite a bit as a metaphor for

1579
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,318
stuff right but i never kind of pushed

1580
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:45,759
the point of like

1581
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:47,838
what's the nature of your interest in

1582
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,160
programming i think you saw it probably

1583
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:52,159
as a tool yeah absolutely the to

1584
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,639
visualize to explore mathematics and

1585
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:56,000
explore physics but and i was wondering

1586
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:59,598
like what's the

1587
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,639
his uh depth of interest and also his

1588
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,280
uh

1589
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:05,838
vision for what programming

1590
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,440
would look like in the future have you

1591
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:09,119
have you had interaction with him like

1592
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,039
discussion in the space of python no

1593
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,480
programming well um in the sense of

1594
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:15,358
sometimes he asked me why is this stuff

1595
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,400
still so hard

1596
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:18,159
um

1597
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,639
uh yeah you know everybody's a critic

1598
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,879
but uh but actually no eric programming

1599
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,078
i mean like yes yes well not programming

1600
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,318
in general but certain things in the

1601
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,559
python ecosystem

1602
00:52:26,318 --> 00:52:30,079
but he uh but he actually i think what i

1603
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,200
find in listening some of his stuff is

1604
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,119
that he does

1605
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:35,279
use programming metaphors a lot right

1606
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,880
he'll talk about apis or object oriented

1607
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,160
and things like that so i think that's a

1608
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,880
useful

1609
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:43,279
set of frames for him to draw upon for

1610
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,358
uh discourse um i haven't paired

1611
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,319
programmed with him in a very long time

1612
00:52:45,358 --> 00:52:50,000
you've you've previously well i mean

1613
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:51,199
trying to try to help like put together

1614
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,559
some of the visualizations around these

1615
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,480
things but it's been a

1616
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,079
very not really pair program but like

1617
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,119
even looked at his code right i mean how

1618
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,880
legendary would be is that like uh get

1619
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,640
repo

1620
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,640
with peter wang and eric weinstein well

1621
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:05,759
honestly honestly robert kearn did all

1622
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,598
the heavy lifting so i have to give

1623
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,640
credit where credit is due robert is is

1624
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,800
the silent but incredibly deep um quiet

1625
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,318
not silent but quiet but incredibly deep

1626
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,839
individual at the heart of a lot of

1627
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,400
those things that eric was trying to do

1628
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:19,599
um but we did have you know in the

1629
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,760
as travis and i were starting our

1630
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,519
company in um

1631
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,960
2012 time frame

1632
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,358
we went to new york eric was still in

1633
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,119
new york at the time he hadn't moved to

1634
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:31,358
this is before he joined teal capital we

1635
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,400
just had like a steak dinner somewhere

1636
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:34,400
maybe it was keane's i don't know

1637
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,639
somewhere in new york so it's me travis

1638
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,039
eric and then wes mckinney the creative

1639
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:41,199
pandas and then wes is um then business

1640
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:42,960
partner adam the five is sat around

1641
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,519
having this just a

1642
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,119
hilarious time amazing dinner um i

1643
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:48,880
forget what all we talked about but it

1644
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,280
was it was one of those conversations

1645
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,680
which i wish um as soon as covet is over

1646
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,839
maybe eric and i can sit down recreate

1647
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:56,960
recreate it somewhere in uh in la or

1648
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:58,480
maybe he comes here because a lot of

1649
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,880
cool people here in austin right exactly

1650
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,440
yeah we're all here here come here yeah

1651
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,519
so he uses uh the metaphor source code

1652
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,679
sometimes to talk about physics we

1653
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:08,838
figure out our own source code so you

1654
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,318
with the physics

1655
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:14,000
background um and uh somebody who's

1656
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:15,838
quite a bit of an expert in source code

1657
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,679
do you think we'll ever figure out our

1658
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:19,199
own source code

1659
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:20,318
in the way that eric means do you think

1660
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:21,679
we'll figure out the nature of

1661
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:22,880
constantly working on that problem i

1662
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:24,960
mean i think we'll

1663
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,960
we'll make more and more progress for me

1664
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,480
there's some things i don't

1665
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,440
really doubt too much like i don't

1666
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,920
really doubt that one day we will create

1667
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,240
um a synthetic maybe not maybe not fully

1668
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,440
in silicon but a synthetic approach

1669
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,199
to

1670
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,559
um

1671
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:44,639
cognition that rivals uh the biological

1672
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,040
20 watt computers in our heads

1673
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:49,039
what's cognition here cognition which

1674
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:51,679
aspect perception attention memory

1675
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,119
recall asking better questions

1676
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:54,960
that for me is a measure of intelligence

1677
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,720
doesn't roomba vacuum cleaner already do

1678
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,119
that or do you mean oh it doesn't ask

1679
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:00,959
questions i mean no it's

1680
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,318
so i mean i have a roomba but it's well

1681
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,000
yeah it's not even as smart as my cat

1682
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:06,239
right so yeah but it asks questions

1683
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,239
about what is this wall it now new

1684
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:10,479
feature asks is this poop or not

1685
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:11,919
apparently yes a lot of our current

1686
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,599
cybernetics system it's a cybernetic

1687
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,280
system it will go and it'll happily

1688
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,480
vacuum up some poop right the older

1689
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,760
generations would

1690
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,039
a new one just released does not

1691
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,559
this is a commercial i wonder if it

1692
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:25,199
still gets stuck under my first rung of

1693
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:27,200
my stair um in any case i these

1694
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:28,558
cybernetic systems we have

1695
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,439
they are

1696
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,040
mold they're designed to be

1697
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,119
sent off into a relatively static

1698
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,558
environment and whatever dynamic things

1699
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,720
happen in the environment they have a

1700
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,519
very limited capacity to respond to

1701
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:44,558
a human baby a human toddler of you know

1702
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:46,159
18 months of age has more capacity to

1703
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,000
manage its own attention and its own

1704
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:49,118
capacity to make better sense of the

1705
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,480
world

1706
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:54,160
than the most advanced robots today so

1707
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,318
again my cat i think can do a better job

1708
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:57,039
of my two and they're both pretty clever

1709
00:55:56,318 --> 00:55:58,719
so

1710
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,880
i do think though back to my kind of

1711
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,519
original point i think that it's not for

1712
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,920
me it's not question at all that we will

1713
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,599
be able to create synthetic systems that

1714
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,599
are able to do this

1715
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,838
um better than the human at an equal

1716
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,519
level or better than the human mind it's

1717
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:14,798
also for me

1718
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,838
not a question

1719
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:20,880
that we will be able to

1720
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:23,440
put them alongside humans so that they

1721
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,280
capture the full broad spectrum of what

1722
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,838
we are seeing as well

1723
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,200
and also looking at our responses

1724
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,920
listening to our responses even maybe

1725
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:34,399
measuring certain vital signs about us

1726
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:37,680
so in this kind of sidecar mode a

1727
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:40,880
greater intelligence could use us and

1728
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:42,960
our whatever 80 years of life to train

1729
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,760
itself up and then be a very good

1730
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,639
simulacrum of us moving forward right

1731
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,280
so

1732
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:51,039
who is in the sidecar in that picture of

1733
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,880
the future exactly is the

1734
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:54,318
the baby version of our immortal selves

1735
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,880
okay so

1736
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:59,920
once the baby grows up is there any use

1737
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,318
for humans i think so

1738
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,079
i think that out of out of epistemic

1739
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,440
humility we need to keep humans around

1740
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,960
for a long time

1741
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,960
and i would hope that anyone making

1742
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,838
those systems would believe that to be

1743
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,000
true

1744
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:13,920
out of epistemic humility what's the

1745
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,318
nature of the humility that that we

1746
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,798
don't know what we don't know

1747
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:18,798
so we don't

1748
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,640
right so we don't first i mean first we

1749
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,400
have to build systems that that help us

1750
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,000
do the things that we do know about that

1751
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,079
can then probe the unknowns that we know

1752
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,079
about but the unknown unknowns we don't

1753
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,280
know we could always know

1754
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,318
nature is the one thing that is

1755
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,760
infinitely

1756
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:35,519
able to surprise us

1757
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,520
so we should keep biological humans

1758
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:39,759
around for a very very very long time

1759
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:42,079
even after our immortal selves have

1760
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,839
transcended have gone off to explore

1761
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,119
other worlds gone to go communicate with

1762
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:47,519
the life forms living in the sun or

1763
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,480
whatever else so yeah um you know i

1764
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,480
think that's

1765
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,318
that's for me these are

1766
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,240
these seem like things that are going to

1767
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:55,599
happen like i don't really question that

1768
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:57,199
that they're gonna happen

1769
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,200
assuming we don't completely you know

1770
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:00,719
destroy ourselves is it possible to

1771
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:04,399
create

1772
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:06,318
an ai system that you fall in love with

1773
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,798
and it falls in love with you and you

1774
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,639
have a romantic relationship with it or

1775
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:12,159
a deep friendship let's say

1776
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,159
i would hope that that is the design

1777
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:16,000
criteria for any of these systems

1778
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,719
and if we cannot have

1779
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,480
a

1780
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:20,399
meaningful relationship with it then

1781
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,798
it's still just a chunk of silicon so

1782
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,400
then what is meaningful because um

1783
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:26,079
back to sugar well sugar doesn't love

1784
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,000
you back right so the computer has to

1785
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:30,079
love you back and what does love mean

1786
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,920
well in this context for me love i'm

1787
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,240
going to take a page from ellen de baton

1788
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,400
love means that it wants to help us

1789
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:37,919
become the best version of ourselves

1790
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,200
yes um

1791
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,880
that's beautiful

1792
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,239
that's a beautiful definition of love so

1793
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,559
what

1794
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,118
what role does love play in the human

1795
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,280
condition at the individual level and at

1796
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,880
the group level because you were kind of

1797
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,480
saying that humans

1798
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,838
we should really consider humans both

1799
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,079
the individual and the group and the

1800
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,920
societal level what's the role of love

1801
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:00,000
in this whole thing we talked about sex

1802
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,318
we talked about death thanks to the

1803
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,920
bacteria they invented it

1804
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:05,679
at which point did we invent love by the

1805
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,079
way i mean is that is that also no i

1806
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:10,558
think i think love is is the the start

1807
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:14,079
of it all and the feelings of and this

1808
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:16,240
gets this is sort of beyond uh just

1809
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,318
you know romantic sensual whatever kind

1810
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:20,000
of things but actually genuine love as

1811
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:22,558
we have for another person love as it

1812
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,358
would be used in a religious text right

1813
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:27,280
i think that capacity to feel love

1814
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:29,440
more than consciousness that is the

1815
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,119
universal thing our feeling of love is

1816
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,039
actually a sense of that generativity

1817
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,039
when we can look at another person and

1818
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,159
see that they can be something more

1819
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,279
than

1820
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:40,078
than they are and more than just what we

1821
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,079
you know

1822
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,359
a pigeonhole we might stick them in we

1823
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,960
see i mean i think there's in any

1824
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:47,679
religious text you'll find

1825
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,519
um voiced some concept of this that you

1826
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:52,078
should see the grace of god in the other

1827
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:54,639
person right they're they're made in the

1828
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,400
spirit of of what you know the love that

1829
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:58,879
god feels for his creation or her

1830
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,880
creation and so i think this thing is

1831
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,119
actually the root of it so i would say

1832
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,599
before i don't think i don't think

1833
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,318
molecules of water feel conscious of

1834
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,519
consciousness but there is some

1835
01:00:07,318 --> 01:00:12,880
proto-micro quantum

1836
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:14,318
thing of love that's the generativity

1837
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,079
when there's more energy than what they

1838
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,480
need to maintain equilibrium

1839
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,559
and that when you sum it all up is

1840
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,798
something that leads to i mean

1841
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:24,559
i had my mind blown one day as an

1842
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:27,199
undergrad at the physics computer lab i

1843
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,480
logged in and you know when you log into

1844
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:30,558
bash for a long time there was a little

1845
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,119
fortune that would come out and it said

1846
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:35,200
man was created by water to carry itself

1847
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,559
uphill

1848
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,919
and i was logging in to work on some you

1849
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,760
know problem set

1850
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,920
and i logged in and i saw that and i

1851
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,160
just said son of a you know i just

1852
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,599
i logged out i went to the coffee shop

1853
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,879
and i got a coffee and i sat there on

1854
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,640
the quad like

1855
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,960
you know

1856
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:55,440
it's not wrong and yet wtf right

1857
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,760
um so when you look at it that way it's

1858
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,960
like yeah okay non-equilibrium physics

1859
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,880
is a thing

1860
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:04,240
um and so when we think about love when

1861
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,240
we think about these kinds of things

1862
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:08,078
i would say that in the modern day human

1863
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,119
condition

1864
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:13,359
there's a lot of talk about freedom and

1865
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,559
individual liberty and rights and all

1866
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:15,679
these things

1867
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:17,200
but

1868
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:18,558
that's a and that's very hegelian it's

1869
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:19,759
very kind of following from the western

1870
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,640
philosophy

1871
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,520
of of the the individual as sacrosanct

1872
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:25,519
but

1873
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,358
it's not really couched i think the the

1874
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:30,159
right way because it should be how do we

1875
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:32,239
maximize people's ability to love each

1876
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:35,199
other to love themselves first to love

1877
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:36,479
each other their responsibilities to the

1878
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:37,759
previous generation to the future

1879
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,838
generations

1880
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,599
those are the kinds of things that

1881
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:42,960
should be our design criteria right

1882
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,000
those should be

1883
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,079
what we start with to then come up with

1884
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,880
the philosophies of self and of rights

1885
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:52,318
and responsibilities um but that that

1886
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,838
love being at the center of it i think

1887
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:58,159
when we design systems for cognition

1888
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:00,000
um it it should absolutely be built that

1889
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:01,279
way i think if we simply focus on

1890
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,440
efficiency

1891
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,440
and productivity these kind of very uh

1892
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,960
industrial era

1893
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,358
you know all the things that marx had

1894
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,679
issues with right those that's that's a

1895
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:14,159
way to go and and really i think go off

1896
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:17,358
the deep end in the wrong way so one of

1897
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:20,000
the interesting consequences of

1898
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,880
thinking of life in this hierarchical

1899
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,880
way

1900
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,960
of an individual human and then there's

1901
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,318
groups in their societies

1902
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,159
is uh

1903
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:31,519
i believe that

1904
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:33,519
you believe that corporations are people

1905
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:35,038
so this is a this is a kind of a

1906
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:37,280
politically

1907
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,200
dense idea and all those kinds of things

1908
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,119
if we just throw politics aside if we

1909
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,199
throw all of that aside

1910
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:46,400
in which sense do you believe that

1911
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:48,558
corporations are people so um and how

1912
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:52,000
does love connect to that right so the

1913
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:54,559
belief is that groups of people

1914
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,119
have some kind of higher level i would

1915
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,519
say mesoscopic claim to agency i you

1916
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,200
know so so where do i you know

1917
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:03,519
let's let's start with this most people

1918
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:05,679
would say okay individuals have claims

1919
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:08,000
to agency and sovereignty nations we

1920
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:10,558
certainly act as of nations so at a very

1921
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,119
large large scale nations have

1922
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,039
rights to sovereignty and agency like

1923
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:16,798
everyone plays the game of modernity as

1924
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,000
if that's true right we believe france

1925
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:20,239
is a thing we believe the united states

1926
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,760
is a thing but to say that

1927
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:24,000
groups of people

1928
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,960
at a smaller level than that

1929
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,798
um

1930
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,720
like a family unit is the thing well in

1931
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:30,480
our law in our laws we actually do

1932
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:31,759
encode this concept

1933
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,679
i believe that

1934
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,839
in a relationship in a marriage right

1935
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,919
one partner can sue

1936
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:40,000
for loss of consortium right if someone

1937
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,519
breaks up the marriage or whatever so

1938
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,760
these are concepts that even in law we

1939
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:47,119
do respect there is something about the

1940
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,720
union and about the family so for me i

1941
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,400
don't think it's so weird to think that

1942
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:51,759
groups of people have

1943
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,838
a right to

1944
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,480
a claim to rights and sovereignty of

1945
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:58,880
some degree i mean we and we

1946
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,639
uh look at our clubs we look at churches

1947
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,960
these are we we talk about these

1948
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:06,000
collectives of people as if they have a

1949
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,240
real agency to them and then they do but

1950
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,159
i think if we take that one step further

1951
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:12,959
and say okay they can accrue resources

1952
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:15,838
well yes check you know by law they can

1953
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,358
um they can own land they can

1954
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:20,239
engage in contracts they can do all

1955
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:22,558
these different kinds of things so we in

1956
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:26,078
legal terms uh support this idea that

1957
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:28,960
groups of people have rights

1958
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:31,680
where we go wrong on this stuff is that

1959
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:35,280
the most popular version of this is the

1960
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:37,279
for-profit absentee owner corporation

1961
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,440
that then is able to amass larger

1962
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:41,440
resources than anyone else in the

1963
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,960
landscape anything else any other entity

1964
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,400
of equivalent size

1965
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,159
and they're able to essentially bully

1966
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,599
around individuals whether it's laborers

1967
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:48,798
whether it's people whose resources they

1968
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,480
want to capture

1969
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:53,199
they're also able to bully around our

1970
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:55,519
system of representation which is still

1971
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:56,558
tied to individuals right

1972
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:58,480
so

1973
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:01,039
um i don't believe that's correct i

1974
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,240
don't think it's good that they you know

1975
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,520
they're people but they're i

1976
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:05,519
don't think that corporations as people

1977
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:06,798
acting like is a good thing but

1978
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:08,400
the idea that collectives and

1979
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:09,199
collections of people

1980
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,358
that we should treat them

1981
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:12,159
philosophically as having

1982
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,279
some

1983
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:17,279
agency some agency and some some mass

1984
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,880
at a mesoscopic level i think that's an

1985
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,000
important thing because one one thing i

1986
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,720
do

1987
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,119
think

1988
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,798
we under-appreciate sometimes is

1989
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,559
the fact that relationships have

1990
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:27,920
relationships so it's not just

1991
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,960
individuals having relationships with

1992
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,798
each other

1993
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,639
but if you have eight people seated

1994
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:34,079
around a table right each person has a

1995
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:36,798
relationship with each of the others and

1996
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:39,039
that's obvious but then if it's four

1997
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:40,239
couples each couple also has a

1998
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,359
relationship with each of the other

1999
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:43,679
couples

2000
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:45,838
right the dyads do and if it's couples

2001
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:48,318
but one is the the you know father

2002
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:51,279
mother older and then you know one of

2003
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:53,358
their children and their spouse

2004
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,798
that that family unit of four has a

2005
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:56,880
relationship with the other family unit

2006
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:58,400
of four so the idea that relationships

2007
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,400
have relationships is something that we

2008
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,559
intuitively know in navigating the

2009
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,559
social landscape but it's not something

2010
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,640
i hear expressed like that

2011
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,160
it's certainly not something that is i

2012
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,159
think taken into account very well when

2013
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:12,798
we design these kinds of things so i

2014
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:13,920
think um the reason why i care a lot

2015
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:15,038
about this

2016
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,480
is because i think the future of

2017
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:19,520
humanity

2018
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:22,159
requires us to form better sense make

2019
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:24,960
collective sense making units at

2020
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:28,000
something you know around dunbar number

2021
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,480
you know half to 5x dunbar

2022
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,838
and that's very different than right now

2023
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:36,639
where we um defer sense making to

2024
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:38,639
massive aging zombie institutions

2025
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:40,000
um or we just do it ourselves we go it

2026
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:41,038
alone go to the dark force of the

2027
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,798
internet

2028
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:45,200
so that's really interesting so you've

2029
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:47,280
talked about agency

2030
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:49,519
i think maybe calling it a convenient

2031
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,920
fiction at all these different levels

2032
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:53,759
so even at the human individual level

2033
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,200
it's kind of a fiction we all believe

2034
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,520
because we are like you said made of

2035
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:59,118
cells and cells are made of atoms

2036
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:00,639
so that's a useful fiction and then

2037
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:04,000
there's nations

2038
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:06,159
that seems to be a useful fiction but

2039
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,440
it seems like some fictions are better

2040
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:09,598
than others you know there's a lot of

2041
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,920
people that argue the fiction of nation

2042
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:14,079
is a bad idea one of them

2043
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,000
lives two doors down from me michael

2044
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,839
malus he's an anarchist

2045
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,519
you know i'm sure there's a lot of

2046
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:21,679
people who are into meditation that

2047
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:24,000
believe the idea

2048
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:26,719
this useful fiction of agency of an

2049
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,280
individual is uh troublesome as well we

2050
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:31,598
need to let go of that in order to truly

2051
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,200
like to transcend

2052
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,359
i don't know i don't know what words you

2053
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,639
want to use but suffering or to uh to

2054
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:38,318
elevate the

2055
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:39,279
experience of life

2056
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:41,279
so

2057
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,119
you're kind of arguing that okay so we

2058
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,559
have some of these useful fictions of

2059
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,039
agency

2060
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,839
we should add a stronger

2061
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:54,480
fiction that we tell ourselves about the

2062
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:57,119
agency of groups in the hundreds of the

2063
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,880
half of dunbar's number five x dunbar's

2064
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,079
number yeah something on that order and

2065
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,720
we call them fictions but really they're

2066
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,559
rules of the game right rules that we we

2067
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:06,480
we feel are fair or rules that we

2068
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,640
consent to yeah i always question the

2069
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,318
rules when i lose like a monopoly that's

2070
01:08:08,639 --> 01:08:11,598
when i usually question when i'm winning

2071
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:12,960
i don't question the rules we should

2072
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,039
play game monopoly someday there's a

2073
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,119
trippy version of it that we could do

2074
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,279
what what kind of contract monopoly is

2075
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:21,599
induced by a friend of mine to me where

2076
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:24,159
you can write contracts on

2077
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,239
future earnings or landing on various

2078
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:27,599
things and you can hand out like

2079
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:29,439
you know you can land first three times

2080
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,039
you land a park places free or whatever

2081
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:33,358
just and then you start trading those

2082
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:36,319
contracts for money

2083
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,239
and then you create human civilization

2084
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:41,279
uh and somehow bitcoin comes into it

2085
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:43,119
okay uh but some of these actually i bet

2086
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:44,719
if me and you and eric sat down to play

2087
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,318
a game of monopoly and we were to make

2088
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:47,838
nfts out of the contracts we wrote we

2089
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,359
could make a lot of money

2090
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:51,198
now it's a terrible idea yes i would

2091
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:54,319
never do it but i bet we could actually

2092
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:56,798
sell the nfts around i have other ideas

2093
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:59,199
to make money that i could tell you and

2094
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:02,158
they're all terrible ideas

2095
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:04,479
um including cat videos on the internet

2096
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:06,479
okay but some of these rules of the game

2097
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,599
some of these fictions are it seems like

2098
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,919
they're

2099
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,798
better than others they have worked this

2100
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,319
far

2101
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:14,238
to cohere

2102
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,400
um human to organize human collective

2103
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:19,198
action but you're saying something about

2104
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,559
especially this technological age

2105
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:23,599
requires

2106
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:26,159
modified fictions stories of agency

2107
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,159
why the dunbar number and also you know

2108
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:30,318
how do you select a group of people you

2109
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:32,000
know del mar numbers i think

2110
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:33,759
it did i have the sense that it's

2111
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,319
overused

2112
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:37,920
as a kind of law

2113
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,080
that somehow

2114
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,798
we can have deep human connection at

2115
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:45,359
this scale like some of it

2116
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:48,079
feels like an interface problem too it

2117
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,920
feels like if i have the right tools i

2118
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:51,759
can deeply connect with a large number

2119
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,600
larger number of people

2120
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,640
it just feels like

2121
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:59,360
uh there's a huge value to interacting

2122
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,280
just in person getting to share

2123
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:03,198
traumatic experiences together beautiful

2124
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:05,599
experiences together but there's other

2125
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:07,198
experiences like um

2126
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,280
that in the digital space that you can

2127
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:11,439
share it just feels like dunbar's number

2128
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:12,880
could be expanded significantly perhaps

2129
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:14,879
not

2130
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,159
to to the level of millions and billions

2131
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,640
but it feels like it could be expended

2132
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:20,639
so how yeah how do we find the right

2133
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,679
interface you think

2134
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,039
um

2135
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,640
for uh

2136
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:26,560
having a little bit of a collective here

2137
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,560
that has agency you're right that

2138
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,039
there's many different ways that we can

2139
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,520
build trust with each other um my friend

2140
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:34,719
joe edelman talks about a few different

2141
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,600
ways that

2142
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:37,760
um

2143
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,640
you know mutual appreciation trustful

2144
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,840
conflict um just experiencing something

2145
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,520
like you know there's a variety of

2146
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,560
different things that we can do

2147
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,239
but

2148
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,320
all those things take time

2149
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:49,599
and you have to be present

2150
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,198
the less presence you are i mean there's

2151
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,199
just again a no free lunch principle

2152
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:55,119
here the less present you are the more

2153
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:56,639
of them you can do but then the less

2154
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:57,920
less connection you build

2155
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,840
so i think there is sort of a human

2156
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,760
capacity issue around some of these

2157
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,800
things now that being said

2158
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,119
if

2159
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,440
we can use certain technologies so for

2160
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:09,198
instance if i write a little monograph

2161
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:10,639
on my view of the world you read it

2162
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,639
asynchronously at some point and you're

2163
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:14,239
like wow peter this is great here's mine

2164
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,119
i read it i'm like wow lex this is

2165
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:16,718
awesome

2166
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:18,800
we can be friends

2167
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,079
without having to spend 10 years you

2168
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,679
know figuring all this stuff out

2169
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:23,840
together we just read each other's thing

2170
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:26,319
and be like oh yeah this guy's exactly

2171
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,239
in my wheelhouse and vice versa and we

2172
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:30,319
can then um

2173
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:32,079
you know connect just a few times a year

2174
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:34,158
and maintain a high trust

2175
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:36,079
relationship it can expand a little bit

2176
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:37,599
but it also requires these things are

2177
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:39,920
not all technological nature it requires

2178
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,600
the individual themselves to have a

2179
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,399
certain level of capacity

2180
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,239
to have a certain lack of neuroticism

2181
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:47,920
right if you want to use like the ocean

2182
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:49,678
big five sort of model

2183
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,960
people have been pretty centered the

2184
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,239
less centered you are the fewer

2185
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,640
authentic connections you can really

2186
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:56,079
build for a particular unit of time

2187
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,199
it just takes more time other people

2188
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:58,319
have to put up with your crap like

2189
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:01,119
there's a lot of the stuff that you have

2190
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:04,158
to deal with if you are not so well

2191
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:05,359
balanced right so yes we can help people

2192
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:07,119
get better to where they can develop

2193
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:08,880
more relationships faster and then you

2194
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:10,559
can maybe expand dunbar number by quite

2195
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,719
a bit but you're not going to do it i

2196
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,039
think it's be hard to get it beyond 10x

2197
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,158
kind of the rough swag of what it is

2198
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,960
you know

2199
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:18,719
well

2200
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,119
don't you think

2201
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,480
that ai systems could be an addition to

2202
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:24,319
dunbar's number

2203
01:12:22,479 --> 01:12:26,079
so like why do you count as one system

2204
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,719
or multiple ai systems multiple ai

2205
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:30,479
systems so i do believe that ai systems

2206
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,079
for them to integrate into human society

2207
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,000
as it is now have to have a sense of

2208
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:35,119
agency so there has to be a

2209
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,880
individual

2210
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:39,519
because otherwise we wouldn't relate to

2211
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:41,520
them we could engage certain kinds of

2212
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,440
individuals to make sense of them for us

2213
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,560
and be almost like did you ever watch uh

2214
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:46,238
star trek

2215
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,679
uh like voyager like there's the volta

2216
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:50,718
who were like the interfaces the

2217
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:53,679
ambassadors for the dominion um we may

2218
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:55,359
have ambassadors that speak on behalf of

2219
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:57,119
these systems they're like the mentats

2220
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:59,119
of dune maybe or something like this i

2221
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:00,559
mean we already have this to some extent

2222
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:02,399
if you look at the biggest

2223
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,000
sort of i wouldn't say ai system but the

2224
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:06,079
biggest cybernetic system in the world

2225
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,760
is the financial markets it runs outside

2226
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:09,198
of any individual's control

2227
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,199
and you have an entire stack of people

2228
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:14,158
on wall street wall street analysts to

2229
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:15,839
cnbc reporters whatever they're all

2230
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:16,719
helping to communicate what does this

2231
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,319
mean

2232
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:19,920
you know like jim cramer like running

2233
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:21,519
around and yelling and stuff like all of

2234
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,800
these people are part of that

2235
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,760
lowering of the complexity there to

2236
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,840
meet

2237
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,600
since you know to help do sense making

2238
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,039
for people whatever capacity they're at

2239
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,640
and i don't see this changing with ai

2240
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:34,319
systems i think you would have ringside

2241
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,600
commentators talking about all the stuff

2242
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:37,198
that this ai system is trying to do over

2243
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,120
here over here because it's a it's

2244
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:40,559
actually a super intelligence so if you

2245
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:41,679
want to talk about humans interfacing

2246
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,600
making first contact with the super

2247
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:45,199
intelligence we're already there we do

2248
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,679
it pretty poorly and if you look at the

2249
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:48,799
gradient of power and money what happens

2250
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:50,880
is the people closest to it will

2251
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,560
absolutely exploit their distance

2252
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,239
for

2253
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,159
personal financial gain

2254
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:57,119
so we should look at that and be like oh

2255
01:13:56,158 --> 01:13:59,119
well that's probably what the future

2256
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:00,399
will look like as well

2257
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:01,519
um but nonetheless i mean we're already

2258
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:04,158
doing this kind of thing so in the

2259
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,760
future we can have ai systems but you're

2260
01:14:04,158 --> 01:14:08,238
still gonna have to trust people to

2261
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,320
bridge the sense making gap to them

2262
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:13,119
see i don't i just feel like there could

2263
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:15,279
be of like millions of ai systems that

2264
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:17,920
have

2265
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:20,238
have agencies you have when you say one

2266
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,158
super intelligence superintelligence in

2267
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:23,519
that context means

2268
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:26,000
it's able to

2269
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,480
solve particular problems extremely well

2270
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,079
but there's some aspect of human-like

2271
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:32,639
intelligence that's necessary to be

2272
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:34,719
integrated into human society so not

2273
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:37,360
financial markets not

2274
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:39,679
sort of weather prediction systems or i

2275
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:42,319
don't know logistics optimization i'm

2276
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:44,399
more referring to things that you

2277
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:47,359
interact with on the intellectual level

2278
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:49,279
yeah and that i think requires there has

2279
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:51,279
to be a backstory there has to be a

2280
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:53,679
personality i believe it has to fear its

2281
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:55,679
own mortality in a genuine way like

2282
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:56,480
there has to be

2283
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:58,480
all

2284
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:00,559
many of the elements that we humans

2285
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:02,639
experience that are fundamental to the

2286
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,679
human condition because otherwise we

2287
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:06,640
would not have a deep connection with it

2288
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:08,800
but i don't think having a deep

2289
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,560
connection with it is necessarily going

2290
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,159
to stop us from building a thing that

2291
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,960
has quite an alien intelligence aspect

2292
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:15,119
sure

2293
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,719
um so another now the other kind of

2294
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:18,800
alien intelligence on this planet is

2295
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,079
octopuses or octopates or whatever you

2296
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,679
want to call them

2297
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:23,359
octopi yeah there's a there's a little

2298
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,840
controversy as to what the plural is i

2299
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:25,839
guess but

2300
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,920
an octopus

2301
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:31,519
um

2302
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,840
you know it really acts as a collective

2303
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,280
intelligence of eight intelligent arms

2304
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,880
right its arms have a tremendous amount

2305
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:37,759
of neural density to them

2306
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,279
and

2307
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,960
i see

2308
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:42,960
if we can build i mean just let's let's

2309
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:45,439
go with what you're saying if we build a

2310
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,920
singular intelligence that interfaces

2311
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,678
with humans that has a sense of agency

2312
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,119
so it can run the cybernetic loop and

2313
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:53,119
develop its own theory of mind as well

2314
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:55,039
as it's a theory of action all these

2315
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:56,719
things i agree with you that that's

2316
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:58,000
the necessary components to build a real

2317
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,119
intelligence right there's got to be

2318
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,880
something at stake it's got to make a

2319
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:02,880
decision it's got to then run the ooda

2320
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,840
loop okay so we build one of those well

2321
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,600
if we can build one of those we'll

2322
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,279
probably build 5 million of them so

2323
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,800
build five million of them

2324
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:11,198
and if their cognitive systems are

2325
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,119
already digitized and already kind of

2326
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:15,279
there we stick an antenna on each of

2327
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:16,640
them bring it all back to a hive mind

2328
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,559
that maybe doesn't make all the

2329
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,400
individual decisions for them but treats

2330
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,320
each one as almost like a neural

2331
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:24,559
neuronal input of a much higher

2332
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:26,639
bandwidth and fidelity going back to a

2333
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,920
central system that is then able to

2334
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,360
perceive

2335
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,119
much broader

2336
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:32,479
uh dynamics that we can't see in the

2337
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:33,599
same way that a phased array radar right

2338
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:36,158
you think about how phase phase-to-radar

2339
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:38,159
works it's just sensitivity

2340
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:39,920
it's just radars and then it's

2341
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:41,839
hypersensitivity and really great timing

2342
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,600
between all of them and with a flat

2343
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,600
array it's as good as a curved radar

2344
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,600
dish right so with these things it's a

2345
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,280
phased array of cybernetic systems

2346
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,800
that'll give the centralized

2347
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:53,039
intelligence

2348
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,960
uh much much better

2349
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:56,000
much higher fidelity understanding of

2350
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,920
what's actually happening in the

2351
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,158
environment but the more power the more

2352
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,399
understanding the central

2353
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:04,479
superintelligence has

2354
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:06,719
the dumber

2355
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:08,319
the individual like fingers of this

2356
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,158
intelligence are i think i think

2357
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:11,679
necessarily

2358
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:13,519
i don't see what has to be this argument

2359
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,600
there has to be

2360
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,239
the experience of the individual agent

2361
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:21,039
has to have the full richness

2362
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:22,238
of the human-like experience you have to

2363
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:24,158
be able to be

2364
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:27,119
driving the car in the rain listening to

2365
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:28,960
bruce springsteen and all of a sudden

2366
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:30,559
break out in tears because remembering

2367
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,520
some something that happened to you in

2368
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,280
high school we can implant those

2369
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,120
memories if that's really needed but no

2370
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:37,920
no no but the central agency like i

2371
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:41,279
guess i'm saying for for in my view for

2372
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:43,679
intelligence to be born you have to have

2373
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:47,198
uh a decentralization

2374
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:48,800
like each one has to struggle and reach

2375
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:50,960
so each one

2376
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,600
in excess of energy has to reach for

2377
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:55,198
order as opposed to a central place

2378
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,159
doing so have you ever read like some

2379
01:17:55,198 --> 01:18:00,639
sci-fi where um there's like hive minds

2380
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:02,399
uh like the vern revenge i think has one

2381
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,600
of these and then um some of the stuff

2382
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:05,519
from um

2383
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,199
yes on the commonwealth saga the idea

2384
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:08,719
that uh you're an individual but you're

2385
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:10,399
connected with like a few other

2386
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:12,480
individuals telepathically as well and

2387
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:15,039
together you form a swarm

2388
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:17,759
so if you are i'd ask you what do you

2389
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:19,920
think it is the experience of if you are

2390
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,560
like well a borg right if you are

2391
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,000
one if you're part of this hive mind

2392
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,360
outside of all the aesthetics forget the

2393
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,158
aesthetics

2394
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:29,439
internally what is your experience like

2395
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:30,559
because i have a theory as to what that

2396
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:31,359
looks like

2397
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,039
the

2398
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:34,238
one question i have for you about that

2399
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:36,960
experience is

2400
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:41,359
how much is there a feeling of freedom

2401
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:43,198
of free will because i obviously as a

2402
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:45,119
human very biased

2403
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:48,319
but also somebody who values freedom and

2404
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:50,719
biased it feels like the experience of

2405
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:52,719
freedom is essential for

2406
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:55,279
um

2407
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:57,359
trying stuff out to being to being

2408
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:59,119
creative and doing something truly novel

2409
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:00,399
which is at the core of

2410
01:18:59,119 --> 01:19:01,920
yeah well i don't think you have to lose

2411
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:04,479
any freedom when you're in that mode

2412
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,920
because i think what happens is we think

2413
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:07,599
we still think and i mean you're still

2414
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,600
thinking about this in a sense of a

2415
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,159
top-down command and control hierarchy

2416
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,159
which is not what it has to be at all

2417
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:15,198
i think the experience so i'll just you

2418
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:16,559
know

2419
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:18,158
show my cards here i think the

2420
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,520
experience of being a robot in that

2421
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:21,759
robot swarm

2422
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,440
a robot who has agency over their own

2423
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:25,280
local environment that's doing sense

2424
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:26,319
making and reporting it back to the hive

2425
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:28,319
mind

2426
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:29,119
um i think that robot's experience would

2427
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:31,039
be

2428
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:31,840
one of when the hive mind is working

2429
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:33,840
well

2430
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,679
it would be an experience of like

2431
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,360
talking to god right that you

2432
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:38,239
essentially are reporting

2433
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:39,599
to

2434
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:40,559
you're sort of saying here's what i see

2435
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,079
i think this is what's going to happen

2436
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,679
over here i'm going to go do this thing

2437
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,198
because i think if i'm going to do this

2438
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,319
this will make this change happen in the

2439
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:48,719
environment

2440
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:50,479
and and then and

2441
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:52,158
god she may tell you

2442
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:53,359
that's great and in fact your your

2443
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:55,599
brothers and sisters will join you to

2444
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:56,880
help make this go better right and then

2445
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,640
she can let your brothers and sisters

2446
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,560
know hey you know peter is going to go

2447
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,679
do this thing would you like to help him

2448
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,800
because we think that this will make

2449
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:04,480
this thing go better and they'll say yes

2450
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,639
we'll help him so the whole thing could

2451
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:07,759
be actually a very emergent the the

2452
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:09,600
sense of

2453
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,840
you know what does it feel like to be a

2454
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,000
cell in a network that is alive that is

2455
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:16,079
generative and i think actually the

2456
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,439
feeling is serendipity

2457
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:21,679
that that there's random order not

2458
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:24,158
random disorder or chaos but random

2459
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:26,000
order just when you needed to hear bruce

2460
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,960
springsteen you turn on the radio and

2461
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,039
bam it's bruce springsteen right that

2462
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,960
feeling of serendipity i feel like um

2463
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:35,039
this is a bit of a flight of fancy but

2464
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,560
every cell in your body

2465
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:38,639
must have like what does it feel like to

2466
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,880
be a cell in your body when it needs

2467
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,719
sugar there's sugar when it is oxygen

2468
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,039
there's just oxygen now when it needs to

2469
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,639
go and do its work and pull like as one

2470
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:48,000
of your muscle fibers right

2471
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:49,359
it does its work

2472
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,439
and it's great it contributes to the

2473
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:53,599
cause right so this is all again a

2474
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:55,279
flight of fancy but i think as we

2475
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,440
extrapolate up what does it feel like to

2476
01:20:55,279 --> 01:20:59,119
be an independent individual with some

2477
01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:00,399
bounded sense of freedom all sense of

2478
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:02,238
freedom is actually bounded but it with

2479
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:04,638
about a sense of freedom that still

2480
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:05,919
lives within a network that has order to

2481
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,319
it and i feel like it has to be a

2482
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,158
feeling of serendipity so the cell

2483
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:11,119
there's a feeling of serendipity even

2484
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:12,559
though

2485
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,000
it has no way of explaining why it's

2486
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,080
getting oxygen and sugar when it gets it

2487
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,279
so you have to each individual component

2488
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:20,238
has to be

2489
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:21,759
too dumb to understand the big picture

2490
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:23,599
no the big picture's bigger than what it

2491
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,960
can understand but isn't that an

2492
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,079
essential characteristic of the

2493
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:30,239
individual is to be too dumb to

2494
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:32,880
understand the bigger picture like a bit

2495
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:34,479
not dumb necessarily but limited in its

2496
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:37,039
capacity to understand because the mo

2497
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:38,799
okay the moment you understand i feel

2498
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:41,039
like that leads to

2499
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:43,440
if you tell me now

2500
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:45,600
that there's some bigger intelligence

2501
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:47,759
controlling everything i do

2502
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,000
intelligence broadly defined meaning

2503
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,440
like you know even the sam harris thing

2504
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,238
there's no free will

2505
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:56,399
if i'm smart enough to truly understand

2506
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:59,119
that that's the case

2507
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:00,879
that's gonna i don't know if i have

2508
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:02,399
philosophical breakdown yeah right

2509
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,319
because we're in the west and we're

2510
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:06,960
pumped full of this stuff of like you

2511
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,399
are a golden fully free individual with

2512
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,679
all your freedoms and all your liberties

2513
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:11,920
and go grab a gun and shoot whatever you

2514
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:13,520
want to no it's actually you don't

2515
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,760
actually have

2516
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:17,840
a lot of these you're not unconstrained

2517
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,079
but the areas where you can

2518
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,920
manifest agency

2519
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,119
you're free to do those things you can

2520
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,800
say whatever you want on this podcast

2521
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:26,238
you can create a podcast right yeah

2522
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,320
you're not you're i mean you have a lot

2523
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:30,079
of this kind of freedom but even as

2524
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,639
you're doing this you are actually i

2525
01:22:30,079 --> 01:22:33,519
guess where the the the demo of this is

2526
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:35,760
that

2527
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:38,560
we are already intelligent agents

2528
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,560
in such a system right in that one of

2529
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,560
these these like robots of one of five

2530
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,520
million little swarm robots or one of

2531
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,560
the borg

2532
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,000
they're just posting an internal

2533
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,440
bulletin board i mean maybe the board

2534
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,039
cube is just a giant facebook machine

2535
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:50,960
floating in space and everyone's just

2536
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:52,960
posting on there they're just posting

2537
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,239
really fast and like oh yeah it's called

2538
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,119
the metaverse now then that's called the

2539
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:56,399
metaverse that's right here's the

2540
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:57,679
enterprise maybe we shall go shoot it

2541
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:00,238
yeah everyone up votes and they're gonna

2542
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:01,520
go shoot it right but we already are

2543
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:03,759
part of a human

2544
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,760
online collaborative environment and

2545
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:08,480
collaborative sense making system it's

2546
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:11,039
not very good yet it's got the overhangs

2547
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:13,519
of zombie sense-making institutions all

2548
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:15,439
over it but as that washes away and as

2549
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:18,560
we get better at this

2550
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:21,519
we are going to see humanity improving

2551
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,800
at speeds that um are unthinkable in the

2552
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,320
past and it's not because anyone's

2553
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,520
freedoms were limited in fact the open

2554
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:27,679
source when we started this with open

2555
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:29,600
source software right the collaboration

2556
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:31,359
what the internet surfaced was the

2557
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,960
ability for people all over the world to

2558
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:34,960
collaborate and produce some of the most

2559
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,800
foundational software that's in use

2560
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,920
today right that entire ecosystem was

2561
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,880
created by collaborators all over the

2562
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,840
place

2563
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,400
so

2564
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,920
these online kind of swarm kind of

2565
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:45,920
things are not

2566
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,239
novel it's just i'm just suggesting that

2567
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,440
future ai systems if you can build one

2568
01:23:48,238 --> 01:23:51,359
smart system

2569
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:52,638
you have no reason not to build multiple

2570
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,799
if you build multiple there's no reason

2571
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:56,719
not to integrate them all into a

2572
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:59,039
collective sense making

2573
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,800
substrate and that thing will certainly

2574
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:02,560
have emergent intelligence that none of

2575
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,639
the individuals and probably not in the

2576
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,719
human designers will be able to really

2577
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:09,920
you know put a bow around and explain

2578
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:12,239
but in some sense would that ai system

2579
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:15,119
still be able to go

2580
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:17,599
like rural texas buy a ranch go off the

2581
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:19,198
grid go full survivalist

2582
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:22,239
can you disconnect

2583
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:22,238
from the hive mind

2584
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:26,960
you may not want to

2585
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:28,960
so to be ineffective

2586
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,399
to be intelligent you have access to way

2587
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,760
more intelligence capability if you're

2588
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:34,799
plugged into five million other really

2589
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:36,639
really smart cyborgs why would you leave

2590
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,159
so like there's a word control that

2591
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:39,920
comes to mind

2592
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:43,119
so it doesn't it it doesn't feel like

2593
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:46,000
control like over over uh overbearing

2594
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:47,519
control it's it's just i think systems

2595
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,039
now this is your point i mean look at

2596
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,880
look at how much how uncomfortable you

2597
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:52,399
are with this concept right i think

2598
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,760
systems that feel like overbearing

2599
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:56,960
control will not evolutionarily win out

2600
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,880
i think systems that give their

2601
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,359
individual elements the feeling of

2602
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:03,920
serendipity and the feeling of agency

2603
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:05,519
that that will

2604
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,800
those systems will win but that's not to

2605
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:10,080
say that there will not be emergent

2606
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,880
higher level order on top of it

2607
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:12,719
and that's the thing that's the

2608
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:15,039
philosophical breakdown that we're

2609
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,800
staring right at which is in the western

2610
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:18,079
mind i think there's a very sharp

2611
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,199
delineation

2612
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:23,840
between explicit control

2613
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:26,079
now cartesian like what is the vector

2614
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,840
where is the position where is it going

2615
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:28,800
it's completely deterministic

2616
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,360
and

2617
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,800
kind of this idea that things emerge

2618
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:35,359
everything we see is the emergent

2619
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:37,440
patterns of other things

2620
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:40,238
and there is agency when there's extra

2621
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:42,559
energy

2622
01:25:40,238 --> 01:25:45,839
so you have spoken about a kind of

2623
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:48,239
meaning crisis that we're going through

2624
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:52,400
but it feels like

2625
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:54,799
since uh since we invented sex and death

2626
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:57,119
we broadly speaking we've been searching

2627
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,719
for a kind of meaning so it feels like

2628
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:00,158
uh human civilization has been going

2629
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:03,760
through a meaning crisis of different

2630
01:26:00,158 --> 01:26:04,879
flavors throughout its history why is

2631
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,360
how is

2632
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:09,520
this particular meaning crisis different

2633
01:26:07,359 --> 01:26:11,839
or is it really a crisis and it wasn't

2634
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,920
previously what's your sense a lot of

2635
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,440
human history there wasn't so much a

2636
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,199
meaning crisis there was just a like

2637
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:18,559
food and not getting eaten by bears

2638
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:19,759
crisis right

2639
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,440
once you get to a point where you can

2640
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,480
make food there was the like not getting

2641
01:26:21,439 --> 01:26:26,399
killed by other humans crisis so sitting

2642
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,559
around wondering what is all about is

2643
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:29,679
actually a relatively recent luxury

2644
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,840
um

2645
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:33,600
and the and to some extent the meaning

2646
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,960
crisis coming out of that is precisely

2647
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,960
because

2648
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:40,480
well not precisely because i i believe

2649
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:43,198
that meaning is the consequence of um

2650
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:44,879
when we make consequential decisions

2651
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,799
it's tied to agency

2652
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,920
right when we make consequential

2653
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,679
decisions

2654
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,440
that generates meaning

2655
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:53,359
so if we make a lot of decisions but we

2656
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:54,960
don't see the consequences of them then

2657
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:56,559
it feels like what was the point

2658
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,600
right but if there's all these big

2659
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,199
things happening but we're just along

2660
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,719
for the ride then it also does not feel

2661
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:02,319
very meaningful

2662
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:04,639
meaning as far as i can tell is my

2663
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:05,439
working definition circuit 2021

2664
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:07,760
is

2665
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:09,759
uh generally the result of

2666
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,880
a person making a consequential decision

2667
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,880
acting on it and then seeing the

2668
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,639
consequences of it so

2669
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,560
historically

2670
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,920
just when humans are in survival mode

2671
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,360
you're making consequential decisions

2672
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,960
all the time

2673
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,119
so there's not a lack of meaning because

2674
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,480
like you either got eaten or you didn't

2675
01:27:23,119 --> 01:27:26,238
right you got some food and that's great

2676
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:29,198
you feel good like these are all

2677
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:30,959
consequential decisions only in

2678
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:33,599
you know the post

2679
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:36,719
fossil fuel and industrial revolution

2680
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:38,079
could we create a massive leisure class

2681
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:39,198
i could sit around not being threatened

2682
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:41,679
by bears

2683
01:27:39,198 --> 01:27:43,439
not starving to death

2684
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:45,119
making and

2685
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:46,799
making decisions somewhat but a lot of

2686
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:49,119
times not making not seeing the

2687
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,600
consequences of any decisions they make

2688
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:53,519
the general sort of sense of anamiy i

2689
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,520
think this is the french term for it in

2690
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,960
the in the wake of the consumer society

2691
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:59,360
in the wake of mass

2692
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:01,520
mass media telling everyone hey

2693
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:03,439
you know choosing between hermes and

2694
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,239
chanel is a meaningful decision no it's

2695
01:28:03,439 --> 01:28:05,599
not

2696
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:09,439
i don't know what either of those means

2697
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:11,360
oh there's high-end uh luxury um uh

2698
01:28:09,439 --> 01:28:13,678
purses and crap like that but the point

2699
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:15,679
is that we we give people the idea that

2700
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:17,520
consumption is meaning that making a

2701
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:19,039
choice of this team versus that team

2702
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:21,360
spectating

2703
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:23,600
has meaning so we produce all of these

2704
01:28:21,359 --> 01:28:26,479
different things that are

2705
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:28,880
as if meaning right but really making a

2706
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:30,959
decision that has no consequences for us

2707
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,800
and so that creates the meaning crisis

2708
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,560
well you're saying uh choosing between

2709
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,400
chanel and the other one is has no

2710
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,920
consequence i mean i

2711
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:39,279
why is one more meaningful than the

2712
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,039
other it's not that it's more meaningful

2713
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:42,479
the other it's that you make a decision

2714
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:44,560
between these two brands

2715
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:46,000
and you're told this brand will make me

2716
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,600
look better in front of other people if

2717
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,079
i buy this brand of car

2718
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:52,480
if i wear that brand of apparel right

2719
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:54,800
the idea like a lot of decisions we make

2720
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:57,119
are around consumption but consumption

2721
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,360
by itself doesn't actually yield meaning

2722
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:02,719
gaining social status does provide

2723
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:04,479
meaning so that's why in this era of um

2724
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:06,880
abundant production

2725
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:08,638
we uh so many things turn into status

2726
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,960
games the nft kind of explosion is a

2727
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:12,800
similar kind of thing everywhere there

2728
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,679
are status games because

2729
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,840
you know

2730
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:17,760
we just have so much excess production

2731
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,079
um but aren't those status games a

2732
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:22,320
source of meaning like what why

2733
01:29:20,079 --> 01:29:24,238
do the games we play have to be grounded

2734
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:26,319
in physical reality like they are when

2735
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:27,279
you're trying to run away from lions why

2736
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:30,238
can't we

2737
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,840
in this virtuality world on social media

2738
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:34,238
why can't we play the games on social

2739
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,000
media even the dark ones right we can

2740
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:38,158
yeah and you're but you're saying that's

2741
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,840
crazy there's a meaningful crisis well

2742
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:42,238
there's a meeting crisis in that there's

2743
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:44,560
two aspects of it number one

2744
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:46,238
playing those kinds of status games uh

2745
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,360
oftentimes requires destroying the

2746
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:48,718
planet

2747
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:51,439
because um

2748
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:52,480
it's it's it ties to

2749
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:53,759
consumption

2750
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:56,158
consuming the latest and greatest

2751
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:58,079
version of a thing buying the latest

2752
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:59,359
limited edition sneaker and throwing out

2753
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:01,039
all the old ones maybe it keeps on the

2754
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:03,279
old ones but the amount of sneakers we

2755
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:05,039
have to cut up and destroy every year

2756
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:07,039
to create artificial scarcity for the

2757
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:08,960
next generation right this is kind of

2758
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:10,560
stuff that's not great it's not great at

2759
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,800
all

2760
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:15,199
so conspicuous consumption

2761
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:17,679
fueling status games is really bad for

2762
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:19,519
the planet not sustainable the second

2763
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:22,158
thing is you can play these kinds of

2764
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:24,080
status games but then what it does is it

2765
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:25,198
renders you captured to the virtual

2766
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:26,639
environment

2767
01:30:25,198 --> 01:30:28,399
the status games the really wealthy

2768
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:30,079
people are playing are all around the

2769
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:31,279
hard resources

2770
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:32,399
where they're gonna build the factories

2771
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:33,759
they're gonna have the fuel in the rare

2772
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:35,599
earths to make the next generation of

2773
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:37,199
robots they're then going to one game

2774
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,159
run circles around you and your your

2775
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:39,599
children

2776
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:41,439
so that's another reason not to play

2777
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:44,000
those virtual status games so you're

2778
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:45,839
saying ultimately the the the big

2779
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,238
picture game is won if

2780
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:51,199
by people who have access or control

2781
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:53,359
over actual hard resources so you can't

2782
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:56,399
you don't see a society where most of

2783
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:57,679
the games are um played in the virtual

2784
01:30:56,399 --> 01:30:59,359
space they'll be captured in the

2785
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:00,639
physical space it's it it all builds

2786
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:04,238
it's just like the stat the stack of

2787
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:06,480
human being right if you only play

2788
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:08,158
the game at the cultural and

2789
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:10,479
intellectual level the people the hard

2790
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:12,799
resources and access to layer zero

2791
01:31:10,479 --> 01:31:15,599
physical are going to own you

2792
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:17,360
but isn't money not connected to or less

2793
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,440
and less connected to hard resources and

2794
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:21,198
money still seems to work it's a virtual

2795
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:22,319
technology um there's different kinds of

2796
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:23,439
money

2797
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:26,399
part of the reason that some of the

2798
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:27,678
stuff is able to go a little unhinged is

2799
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:31,920
because

2800
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:33,920
uh the the the big sovereignties

2801
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,840
where one spends money and uses money

2802
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:39,119
and plays money games and inflates money

2803
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:40,560
um their their ability to adjudicate

2804
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:42,238
the physical resources and hard

2805
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,600
resources on land and things like that

2806
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:45,519
those have not been challenged in a very

2807
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,120
long time

2808
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:49,360
so you know we went off the gold

2809
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:51,679
standard most money is not connected to

2810
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:53,679
physical resources

2811
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:54,639
it's an idea

2812
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:55,760
and that

2813
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:58,800
idea is

2814
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:01,679
very closely connected to status

2815
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:03,600
um so why but it's also tied to like

2816
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:05,119
it's actually tied to law it is tied to

2817
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,760
some physical hard things so you have to

2818
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,639
pay your taxes yes so it's always at the

2819
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,800
end

2820
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:13,520
going to be connected to the the

2821
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:16,159
blockchain of physical reality so in the

2822
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,280
case of law and taxes it's connected to

2823
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:20,399
government

2824
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:22,559
and uh government is what violence

2825
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:23,759
is the i'm playing the monopoly on

2826
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:27,760
violence

2827
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:29,840
devil's advocates here

2828
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,639
and popping one devil off the stack at a

2829
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,840
time

2830
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:33,920
isn't ultimately of course it'll be

2831
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:35,279
connected to physical reality but just

2832
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,679
because people control the physical

2833
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:39,359
reality it doesn't mean the status

2834
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:42,319
lebron james in theory could make more

2835
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:44,559
money than the owners of the teams

2836
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:47,359
in theory and to me that's a virtual

2837
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:48,639
idea so somebody else constructed a game

2838
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:51,198
and now you're playing in the space of

2839
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:53,440
virtual uh in the virtual space of the

2840
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:57,439
game so it just feels like there could

2841
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:59,279
be games where status we build realities

2842
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:01,919
that give us meaning in the virtual

2843
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:04,158
space like i can imagine such things

2844
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,119
being possible oh yeah okay so i see

2845
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:07,519
what you i think i see what you're

2846
01:33:05,119 --> 01:33:09,119
saying there with the idea there i mean

2847
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,360
we'll take the lebron james side and put

2848
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:13,519
in like some youtube influencer yes sure

2849
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:15,679
right so the youtube influencer

2850
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:18,880
it is status games but at a certain

2851
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:20,800
level it precipitates into real dollars

2852
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:22,719
and into like well you look at mr beast

2853
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,920
right he's like sending off half a

2854
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:25,840
million dollars worth of fireworks or

2855
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,760
something right on a youtube video and

2856
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:29,279
also like saving you know like saving

2857
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,159
trees and so on sure right you're trying

2858
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:31,599
to plant a milling tree with the mark

2859
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:33,439
robert or whatever it was yeah like it's

2860
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,360
not that those kinds of games can't lead

2861
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:37,839
to real consequences

2862
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:41,119
it's that for the vast majority of

2863
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:44,480
people in consumer culture

2864
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:45,840
they are incented by the

2865
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:47,678
i would say mostly i'm thinking about

2866
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,520
middle class consumers

2867
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:50,800
they're incented by advertisements

2868
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:53,120
they're centered by their memetic

2869
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,000
environment to treat

2870
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:56,000
the

2871
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,600
purchasing of certain things the need to

2872
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
buy the latest model whatever that need

2873
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,440
to appear however the need to pursue

2874
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,679
status games

2875
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:05,279
as a driver of meaning

2876
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:07,119
and my point would be that it's a very

2877
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:08,800
hollow driver of meaning

2878
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:11,198
and that is what creates a meaning

2879
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:13,039
crisis because at the end of the day

2880
01:34:11,198 --> 01:34:14,559
it's like eating a lot of empty calories

2881
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:16,238
right yeah it tasted good going down a

2882
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:17,520
lot of sugar but man it did not it was

2883
01:34:16,238 --> 01:34:19,359
not enough protein to help build your

2884
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,400
muscles and you kind of feel that in

2885
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:21,920
your gut

2886
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:23,279
and i think that's i mean to all the

2887
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,399
stuff aside and setting aside a

2888
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:25,920
discussion on currency which i hope we

2889
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:27,839
get back get back to you

2890
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,000
that's what i mean about the meaning

2891
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:33,840
crisis part of it being created by the

2892
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:35,439
fact that we don't um we're not

2893
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,480
encouraged to have more and more direct

2894
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:41,759
relationships we're actually alienated

2895
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:43,839
from relating to even even our family

2896
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:46,560
members sometimes right we're we're

2897
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:48,079
encouraged to relate to brands we're

2898
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,000
encouraged to relate to these kinds of

2899
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:52,479
things that then tell us

2900
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,679
to um do things that are really of low

2901
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:54,879
consequence

2902
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,960
and that's where the meaning crisis

2903
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,480
comes from so the role of technology in

2904
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,760
this so there's somebody you mentioned

2905
01:34:58,479 --> 01:35:01,919
who's jacques

2906
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:04,079
elio

2907
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:06,000
his view of technology

2908
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,960
he warns about the towering piles of

2909
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,760
technique which i guess is a broad idea

2910
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:14,319
of technology yes so i think correct me

2911
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:17,039
if i'm wrong for him technology is a is

2912
01:35:14,319 --> 01:35:19,359
a is bad moving away from human nature

2913
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:20,639
and it's ultimately destructive

2914
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:22,559
my question broadly speaking this

2915
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:24,480
meaning crisis can technology what are

2916
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:26,960
the pros and cons of technology can it

2917
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:28,799
be good yeah i think it can be i

2918
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:31,039
certainly draw on some of the lowell's

2919
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:33,440
ideas and i think some of them are are

2920
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:35,359
pretty good um but the way he defines

2921
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:37,839
technique is

2922
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:39,519
uh well also somandon as well i mean he

2923
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,800
speaks to the general mentality of

2924
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,800
efficiency

2925
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,400
homogenized processes homogenized

2926
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,800
production homogenized labor to produce

2927
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:50,479
homogenized artifacts

2928
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:52,159
that then are not actually

2929
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:53,599
they they don't sit well in the

2930
01:35:52,158 --> 01:35:57,759
environments it's essentially you can

2931
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:59,600
think of as the antonym of craft

2932
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:02,320
whereas a craftsman will come

2933
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:04,159
to you know a problem uh maybe a piece

2934
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:05,920
of wood and then make it to a chair it

2935
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:08,319
may be a site to build a house or build

2936
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:11,118
a stable or build you know whatever

2937
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:13,759
and they will consider how to bring

2938
01:36:11,118 --> 01:36:16,719
various things in to build something

2939
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:18,719
well contextualized that's in uh

2940
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:20,079
in right relationship with that

2941
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:22,079
environment

2942
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:24,880
but the way we have driven technology

2943
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:27,439
over the last 150 years is not that at

2944
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:30,400
all it is how can we

2945
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:32,638
you know make sure the input materials

2946
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:33,359
are homogenized cut to the same size you

2947
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:35,118
know

2948
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:37,279
diluted and doped exactly the right

2949
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:38,639
alloy concentrations how do we create

2950
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:39,840
machines that then consume exactly the

2951
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:41,520
right kind of energy to be able to run

2952
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,920
at this high speed to stamp out the same

2953
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:45,520
parts which then go out the door

2954
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,800
everyone gets the same tickle me elmo

2955
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,800
and the reason why everyone wants it is

2956
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,560
because we have broadcast that tells

2957
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,880
everyone this is the cool thing so we

2958
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:55,280
homogenize demand right and we're like

2959
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:57,039
beaudelard um and look other critiques

2960
01:36:55,279 --> 01:36:59,118
of modernity coming from that direction

2961
01:36:57,039 --> 01:37:01,279
you know the situation list as well they

2962
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:03,279
it's that their point is that at this

2963
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:05,599
point in time consumption is the thing

2964
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:07,519
that drives a lot of the economic stuff

2965
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:09,360
not the need but the need to consume and

2966
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:11,440
build status games on top

2967
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:13,198
so we have homogenized when we

2968
01:37:11,439 --> 01:37:14,799
discovered i think this is uh this is

2969
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:16,479
really like bernays and stuff right in

2970
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,760
the early 20th century we discovered we

2971
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:19,759
can create

2972
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,800
we can create demand we can create

2973
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,239
desire

2974
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,760
in a way that

2975
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:25,439
was not possible before because of

2976
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,679
broadcast media

2977
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:29,359
and one not only do we create desire we

2978
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:31,279
don't create a desire for each person to

2979
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:32,399
connect to some bespoke thing to build a

2980
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:33,599
relationship with their neighbor or

2981
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:35,039
their spouse

2982
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,800
we are telling them you need to consume

2983
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:38,158
this brand you need to drive this

2984
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,760
vehicle you got to listen to this music

2985
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:42,158
have you heard this have you seen this

2986
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,199
movie right so creating homogenized

2987
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:45,039
demand

2988
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:47,118
makes it really cheap to create

2989
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:48,399
homogenized product and now you have

2990
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:50,079
economics of scale

2991
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:52,479
so we make the same tickle me elmo give

2992
01:37:50,079 --> 01:37:54,399
it to all the kids and all the kids are

2993
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:56,000
like hey i got to tickle me elmo right

2994
01:37:54,399 --> 01:37:57,198
so this is

2995
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,039
ultimately

2996
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:01,519
where this ties in then to run away

2997
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:02,880
hyper capitalism is that

2998
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,719
we then

2999
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,000
capitalism is always looking for growth

3000
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:08,158
it's always looking for growth and

3001
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,840
growth only happens the margins so you

3002
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:10,960
have to squeeze more and more demand out

3003
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,760
you got to make it cheaper and cheaper

3004
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:15,039
to make the same thing but tell everyone

3005
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,320
they're still getting meaning from it

3006
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:18,880
you're still like this is still your

3007
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:20,399
tickle me elmo right and we we see

3008
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,000
little bits of this

3009
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:24,079
dripping critiques of this dripping in

3010
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,920
popular culture you see it sometimes

3011
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:28,158
it's when buzz lightyear

3012
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:30,719
walks into the thing he's like oh my god

3013
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:32,158
at the toy store i'm just a toy like

3014
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,520
there's millions of other or there's

3015
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:34,879
hundreds of other buzz lightyears just

3016
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,360
like me right

3017
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:40,079
that is i think you know a fun pixar

3018
01:38:37,359 --> 01:38:42,399
critique on this homogenization dynamic

3019
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:43,679
i agree with you on most of the things

3020
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:46,399
you're saying so i'm playing devil's

3021
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,079
advocate here but you know this

3022
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:50,559
homogenized

3023
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:54,158
machine of capitalism

3024
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:56,159
is also the thing that is able to fund

3025
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:57,759
if channeled correctly

3026
01:38:56,158 --> 01:38:58,960
innovation

3027
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:00,639
invention

3028
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:02,480
and development of totally new things

3029
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:04,239
that in the best possible world create

3030
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:06,158
all kinds of new experiences that can

3031
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:08,399
enrich lives

3032
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:11,198
um the quality of lives for

3033
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:14,238
uh all kinds of people so isn't this the

3034
01:39:11,198 --> 01:39:15,678
machine that actually enables the

3035
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:18,559
experiences and more and more

3036
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:21,199
experiences that would then give meaning

3037
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:23,199
it has done that to some extent i mean

3038
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:25,678
it's not all good or bad in my

3039
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:28,158
perspective you know we can always look

3040
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:30,079
backwards and offer a critique of the

3041
01:39:28,158 --> 01:39:31,279
path we've taken to get to this point in

3042
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:32,960
time

3043
01:39:31,279 --> 01:39:34,319
um but that's a different that's

3044
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:35,359
somewhat different it informs the

3045
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:37,279
discussion

3046
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:39,279
um but it's somewhat different than the

3047
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:40,559
question of where do we go in the future

3048
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:42,319
right sure

3049
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,679
is this still the same rocket we need to

3050
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:44,880
ride to get to the next point we'll even

3051
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,319
get us to the next point well how does

3052
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,719
this so you're predicting the future how

3053
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:52,079
does it go wrong in your view

3054
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:54,639
we have the mechanisms we have now

3055
01:39:52,079 --> 01:39:59,359
explored enough technologies to where we

3056
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:59,359
can actually i think sustainably produce

3057
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:03,360
what most people in the world need to

3058
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:04,319
live

3059
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:05,198
we

3060
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:07,920
have

3061
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:10,319
also created the infrastructures to

3062
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:11,600
allow continued research and development

3063
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:13,519
of additional

3064
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:16,079
science and medicine and various other

3065
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,080
kinds of things

3066
01:40:16,158 --> 01:40:21,039
the organizing principles that we use to

3067
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:24,080
govern all these things today

3068
01:40:21,039 --> 01:40:25,519
have been a lot of them have been

3069
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:28,399
just inherited

3070
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,679
from honestly medieval times

3071
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:31,920
some of them have refactored a little

3072
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,639
bit in the industrial era

3073
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,840
but

3074
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:36,880
a lot of these modes of organizing

3075
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:39,600
people are

3076
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:40,639
deeply problematic

3077
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,960
and

3078
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:45,279
furthermore they're rooted in

3079
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,520
i think a very industrial mode

3080
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:49,118
perspective on human labor

3081
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:50,400
and this is one of those things i'm

3082
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:52,719
going to go back to the open source

3083
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:55,039
thing there was a point in time

3084
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:57,520
when well let me ask you this if you

3085
01:40:55,039 --> 01:40:58,960
look at the core scipy sort of

3086
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:01,199
collection of libraries that's scipy

3087
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,639
numpy map plot lib right there's ipython

3088
01:41:01,198 --> 01:41:05,039
notebook let's throw pandas in there

3089
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:05,920
psychic learn a few of these things

3090
01:41:05,039 --> 01:41:06,800
um

3091
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:09,440
how

3092
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,800
much value do you think economic value

3093
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:13,039
would you say they drive in the world

3094
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,800
today

3095
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:17,679
that's one of the fascinating things

3096
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:20,480
about talking to you and travis is like

3097
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:22,480
it it's it's immeasurable it's like uh

3098
01:41:20,479 --> 01:41:24,559
at least a billion dollars a day maybe a

3099
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:26,399
billion dollars sure i mean it's like

3100
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:29,280
it's similar question of like how much

3101
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:31,439
value does wikipedia create right it's

3102
01:41:29,279 --> 01:41:31,439
like

3103
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,960
all of it i don't know well i mean if

3104
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:36,319
you look at our systems when you do a

3105
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:38,239
google search right now some of that

3106
01:41:36,319 --> 01:41:40,238
stuff runs through tensorflow but when

3107
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:42,559
you look at you know siri when you do

3108
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:43,678
credit card transaction fraud like just

3109
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:45,119
everything right every intelligent

3110
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:46,880
station under the sun

3111
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:49,118
they're using some aspect of these kinds

3112
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:51,118
of tools so i would say that

3113
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:53,279
these create billions of dollars of

3114
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:55,118
value you mean like direct use of tools

3115
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:57,118
that leverage direct yeah yeah even

3116
01:41:55,118 --> 01:41:59,118
that's billions a day yeah yeah right

3117
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:00,238
easily i think like the things they

3118
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:02,799
could not do if they didn't have these

3119
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:04,799
tools right yes so

3120
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,719
that's billions of dollars a day great i

3121
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:09,600
think that's about right now if we take

3122
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:11,118
how many people did it take to make that

3123
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,239
right and there was a point in time not

3124
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:13,599
anymore but there was a point in time

3125
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:15,359
when they could fit in a van i could

3126
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,760
have fit them in my mercedes center

3127
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:19,118
right and so if you look at that like

3128
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:22,320
holy crap

3129
01:42:19,118 --> 01:42:24,799
literally a van of maybe a dozen people

3130
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:27,198
could create value to the tune of

3131
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,920
billions of dollars

3132
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:31,359
a day what lesson do you draw from that

3133
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:35,039
well here's the thing

3134
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:36,639
what can we do to do more of that

3135
01:42:35,039 --> 01:42:38,399
like that's open source the way i've

3136
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:39,679
talked about this in other

3137
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:42,638
environments is

3138
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:45,840
when we use generative participatory

3139
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:47,440
crowdsourced approaches we unlock human

3140
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:49,600
potential

3141
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:52,000
at a level that is better than what

3142
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:54,000
capitalism can do

3143
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,639
i would challenge you know anyone to go

3144
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:58,158
and try to hire the right 12 people in

3145
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:00,560
the world

3146
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:02,879
to build that entire stack the way those

3147
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,400
12 people did that right they'd be very

3148
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,800
very hard to press to do that if a hedge

3149
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:08,319
fund could just hire a dozen people and

3150
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:10,400
create like something that is worth

3151
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:11,439
billions of dollars a day every single

3152
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:13,599
one of them will be racing to do it

3153
01:43:11,439 --> 01:43:14,960
right but finding the right people

3154
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,400
fostering the right collaborations

3155
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:18,079
getting it adopted by the right other

3156
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:20,238
people to then refine it

3157
01:43:18,079 --> 01:43:22,238
that is a thing that was organic in

3158
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:24,079
nature that that took crowdsourcing that

3159
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:26,079
took a lot of the open source ethos and

3160
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:27,279
it took the right kinds of people

3161
01:43:26,079 --> 01:43:29,118
right now those people who started that

3162
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:31,198
said i need to have a part of a

3163
01:43:29,118 --> 01:43:33,039
multi-billion dollar a day sort of

3164
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:34,399
enterprise they're like i'm doing this

3165
01:43:33,039 --> 01:43:36,880
cool thing to solve my problem for my

3166
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:39,198
friends right so the point of telling

3167
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,279
the story is to say that our way of

3168
01:43:39,198 --> 01:43:43,279
thinking about value our way of thinking

3169
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:44,880
about allocation of resources our ways

3170
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:47,840
of thinking about property rights and

3171
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:50,319
all these kinds of things they come from

3172
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:52,000
finite game scarcity mentality medieval

3173
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:54,880
institutions

3174
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,960
as we are now entering to some extent we

3175
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:58,159
are sort of in a post-scarcity era

3176
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,760
although some people are hoarding a

3177
01:43:58,158 --> 01:44:02,000
whole lot of stuff

3178
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:04,079
we are at a point where if not now soon

3179
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,319
we'll be in a post-scarcity era the

3180
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:08,000
question of how we allocate resources

3181
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:10,000
has to be revisited at a fundamental

3182
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,960
level because the kind of software these

3183
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,679
people built the modalities that those

3184
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:17,840
human ecologies that built this software

3185
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:20,399
it treats software's on property

3186
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:23,039
actually sharing creates value

3187
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:25,439
restricting a forking reduces value

3188
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:26,719
so that's different than any other

3189
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:28,000
physical resource that we've ever dealt

3190
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:30,480
with it's different than how most

3191
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,520
corporations treat software ip

3192
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:36,319
right so if treating software

3193
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:37,920
in this way created this much value so

3194
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:39,439
efficiently so cheaply because feeding a

3195
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,480
dozen people for 10 years is really

3196
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:41,678
cheap

3197
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:43,118
right

3198
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:45,440
that's the that's the reason i care

3199
01:44:43,118 --> 01:44:47,039
about this right now is because looking

3200
01:44:45,439 --> 01:44:49,519
forward when we can automate a lot of

3201
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:51,600
labor where we can in fact

3202
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:52,960
the the programming for your robot in

3203
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,639
your part neck of the woods and you're

3204
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,960
part of the amazon to build something

3205
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:58,719
sustainable for you and your tribe to

3206
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:00,158
deliver the right medicines to take care

3207
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:02,639
of the kids

3208
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:04,799
that's just software that's just code

3209
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:07,279
that could be totally open sourced

3210
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,480
right so we can actually get to a mode

3211
01:45:07,279 --> 01:45:10,719
where

3212
01:45:08,479 --> 01:45:12,319
all of this additional generative things

3213
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,480
that humans are doing

3214
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:16,559
they they don't have to be

3215
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:18,238
wrapped up in a container and then we

3216
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,239
charge for all the exponential dynamics

3217
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:22,000
out of it that's what facebook did

3218
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:23,198
that's what modern social media did

3219
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,198
right because the old internet was

3220
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:26,399
connecting people just fine facebook

3221
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:28,238
came along and said well anyone can post

3222
01:45:26,399 --> 01:45:29,759
a picture anyone can post some text

3223
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:32,158
and we're gonna amplify the crap out of

3224
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:34,480
it to everyone else and it exploded this

3225
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:35,679
generative network of human interaction

3226
01:45:34,479 --> 01:45:36,718
and then said how do i make money off

3227
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:37,920
that oh yeah i'm going to be a

3228
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:39,679
gatekeeper

3229
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,960
on everybody's attention

3230
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:43,359
and that's how i'm going to make money

3231
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:45,439
so how do we create

3232
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:47,359
uh more than one van

3233
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:49,678
how do we have millions of vans full of

3234
01:45:47,359 --> 01:45:51,839
people that create numpy scipy that

3235
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:54,399
create python so

3236
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:56,480
you know the story of those people is

3237
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:58,000
often they have some kind of job outside

3238
01:45:56,479 --> 01:45:58,799
of this this is what they're doing for

3239
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,719
fun

3240
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,639
don't you need to have a job

3241
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:05,198
don't you have to be connected plugged

3242
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:07,199
in to the capitalist system isn't that

3243
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:10,839
what like um

3244
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:12,879
isn't this consumerism the engine that

3245
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:14,480
results in

3246
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:15,840
the individuals that kind of take a

3247
01:46:14,479 --> 01:46:17,759
break from it every once in a while to

3248
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,000
create something magical like at the

3249
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:21,520
edges right the question of surplus

3250
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,920
right this is this is the question like

3251
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:25,280
if everyone were to go and run their own

3252
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,359
farm no one would have time to go and

3253
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:29,359
write numpy sci-fi right

3254
01:46:27,359 --> 01:46:31,039
maybe but that's that's that's what i'm

3255
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:33,039
talking about when i say we're

3256
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:34,158
maybe at a post scarcity point for a lot

3257
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:36,800
of people

3258
01:46:34,158 --> 01:46:39,439
the question that we're never encouraged

3259
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,560
to ask in a super bowl ad is how much do

3260
01:46:39,439 --> 01:46:42,638
you need

3261
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:45,039
how much is enough do you need to have a

3262
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:46,400
new car every two years every five if

3263
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:48,000
you have a reliable car can you drive

3264
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:50,079
one for 10 years is that all right you

3265
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,439
know i had a car for 10 years was fine

3266
01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:53,198
you know your iphone do you have to

3267
01:46:51,439 --> 01:46:54,559
upgrade every two years i mean sort of

3268
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:56,079
you you're using the same apps you did

3269
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:58,159
four years ago

3270
01:46:56,079 --> 01:46:59,359
right this should be a super bowl ad

3271
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:01,279
this should be a super bowl ad that's

3272
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:02,799
great maybe you really need a new iphone

3273
01:47:01,279 --> 01:47:04,960
maybe one of our listeners will will

3274
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,880
fund something like this of like no but

3275
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:08,880
just actually bringing it back

3276
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:11,440
bringing it back to actually the

3277
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:14,239
question of what do you need

3278
01:47:11,439 --> 01:47:15,839
how do we create the infrastructure for

3279
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:18,879
collectives of people

3280
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:20,880
to live on the basis of providing you

3281
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,639
know what we need meeting people's needs

3282
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,319
with a little bit of excess to handle

3283
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:26,239
emergencies and things like that

3284
01:47:24,319 --> 01:47:28,079
pulling our resources together

3285
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:29,678
to handle the really really big you know

3286
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:31,840
emergencies somebody with a really rare

3287
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:33,679
care form cancer or some massive fire

3288
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:36,560
sweeps through you know half the the

3289
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:39,600
village or whatever but can we actually

3290
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:41,520
unscale things and solve for

3291
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:44,079
people's needs

3292
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:46,080
and then give them the capacity

3293
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:47,198
to explore how to be the best version of

3294
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:48,880
themselves

3295
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:51,198
and for travis that was you know

3296
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:52,800
throwing away his shot a tenure in order

3297
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:54,559
to write numpy

3298
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,039
for others it's uh there is a saying in

3299
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:58,639
the in the sci-fi uh community that you

3300
01:47:57,039 --> 01:48:00,800
know sci-fi advance is one failed

3301
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:02,480
postdoc at a time

3302
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:04,320
and that's you know

3303
01:48:02,479 --> 01:48:06,158
we can do these things we can actually

3304
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:08,238
do this kind of collaboration because

3305
01:48:06,158 --> 01:48:09,519
code software information organization

3306
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:11,118
that's cheap

3307
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,880
that those bits are very cheap to fling

3308
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:14,639
across the oceans

3309
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,239
so you mentioned travis

3310
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:19,359
we've been talking and we'll continue to

3311
01:48:16,238 --> 01:48:20,959
talk about open source um

3312
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:24,000
maybe you can comment how did you meet

3313
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:25,840
travis who who is travis alphon

3314
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,679
what's what's your relationship been

3315
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,639
like through the years

3316
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:30,639
uh

3317
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:31,760
where did you work together how did you

3318
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:33,039
meet

3319
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,960
what's uh

3320
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:36,880
the present and the future look like

3321
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:39,279
yeah so the first time i met travis was

3322
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:40,719
at a sci-fi conference in pasadena do

3323
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:44,000
you remember the year

3324
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:45,840
2005. i was working at again at nthot

3325
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,960
you know working on scientific computing

3326
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,239
consulting

3327
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:49,198
and um

3328
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:51,118
a

3329
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:54,238
couple of years later

3330
01:48:51,118 --> 01:48:55,118
he joined us at nthot i think 2007

3331
01:48:54,238 --> 01:48:58,079
um

3332
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:59,359
and he came in as president uh the the

3333
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:01,760
one of the founders of and thought was

3334
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:03,439
the ceo eric jones um

3335
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:04,560
and we're all very excited that travis

3336
01:49:03,439 --> 01:49:06,960
was joining us and that was you know

3337
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:09,039
great fun so i worked with travis um on

3338
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,239
a number of consulting projects and we

3339
01:49:09,039 --> 01:49:12,319
worked on

3340
01:49:10,238 --> 01:49:14,319
um some open source stuff i mean it was

3341
01:49:12,319 --> 01:49:17,198
just a really it was a good a good time

3342
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:19,359
there and then it was primarily python

3343
01:49:17,198 --> 01:49:21,198
related oh yeah it was all python numpy

3344
01:49:19,359 --> 01:49:22,639
consulting kind of stuff um towards the

3345
01:49:21,198 --> 01:49:24,799
end of that time

3346
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:27,199
uh we started getting called into more

3347
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:28,800
and more finance shops

3348
01:49:27,198 --> 01:49:31,279
um they were adopting python pretty

3349
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,599
heavily i did some work on like a high

3350
01:49:31,279 --> 01:49:35,279
frequency trading shop um working some

3351
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:38,319
stuff and then we worked together on

3352
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:39,759
some um at a couple investment banks in

3353
01:49:38,319 --> 01:49:40,719
in manhattan

3354
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:42,000
and so

3355
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:44,000
we started seeing that there was a

3356
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,760
potential to take python in the

3357
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,359
direction of business computing more

3358
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:50,400
than just being this niche like matlab

3359
01:49:47,359 --> 01:49:51,839
replacement for big vector computing

3360
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:53,198
what we were seeing was oh yeah you

3361
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,360
could actually use python as a swiss

3362
01:49:53,198 --> 01:49:57,598
army knife to do a lot of shadow data

3363
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:58,799
transformation kind of stuff so that's

3364
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:00,480
when we

3365
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:01,760
realize the potential is much greater

3366
01:50:00,479 --> 01:50:03,678
and so

3367
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:05,280
we started anaconda i mean it was called

3368
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:08,158
continuum analytics at the time but we

3369
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:09,039
started in january of 2012 with a vision

3370
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:10,799
of

3371
01:50:09,039 --> 01:50:13,279
shoring up the parts of python that

3372
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:14,800
needed to get expanded to handle data at

3373
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:17,039
scale to do web visualization

3374
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:19,520
application development et cetera

3375
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:21,359
and that was that yeah so he was ceo and

3376
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:22,080
i was president

3377
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:23,118
for

3378
01:50:22,079 --> 01:50:25,439
the first

3379
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:27,598
five years and then um

3380
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:29,279
we raised some money and then the board

3381
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:31,119
sort of put in a new ceo they hired a

3382
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:32,399
kind of professional ceo

3383
01:50:31,118 --> 01:50:34,479
and then travis

3384
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:36,638
you laugh about that um i took over the

3385
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:39,519
cto role travis then left after a year

3386
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:42,000
to do his own thing through kwan site um

3387
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:43,280
which was more oriented around some of

3388
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,639
the bootstrap years that we did at

3389
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:46,800
continuum where it was you know open

3390
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:48,639
source some consulting it wasn't sort of

3391
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:50,079
like gung-ho product development and it

3392
01:50:48,639 --> 01:50:51,760
wasn't focused on you know we

3393
01:50:50,079 --> 01:50:53,679
accidentally stumbled into the package

3394
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:55,360
management problem

3395
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:56,880
at anaconda

3396
01:50:55,359 --> 01:50:58,238
but we had a lot of other visions of

3397
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:01,039
other technology that we built in the

3398
01:50:58,238 --> 01:51:03,598
open source and travis was really trying

3399
01:51:01,039 --> 01:51:05,920
to push again the frontiers of numerical

3400
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:07,360
computing vector computing handling

3401
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,800
things like auto differentiation and

3402
01:51:07,359 --> 01:51:09,920
stuff intrinsically in the open

3403
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,400
ecosystem

3404
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:13,279
so i think that's the

3405
01:51:12,399 --> 01:51:14,238
the

3406
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:15,920
you know that's kind of the direction

3407
01:51:14,238 --> 01:51:18,158
he's he's

3408
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:20,960
working on in some of his his work

3409
01:51:18,158 --> 01:51:22,479
we remain great friends and um you know

3410
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,560
and colleagues and collaborators even

3411
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:26,319
though he's no longer uh day-to-day you

3412
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:27,840
know working at anaconda but he gives me

3413
01:51:26,319 --> 01:51:28,960
a lot of feedback about you know this

3414
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,880
and then the other

3415
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:33,279
what's uh what's a big lesson you

3416
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:35,359
learned from travis about life or about

3417
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:37,519
programming about leadership

3418
01:51:35,359 --> 01:51:39,519
wow there's a lot there's a lot travis

3419
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:42,000
is a really really good guy

3420
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:43,599
he really his heart is really in it he

3421
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,560
cares a lot

3422
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:46,560
um

3423
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:48,159
i've gotten that sense having interacted

3424
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,239
with them it's so interesting yeah such

3425
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:51,359
a good he's a really good dude and he

3426
01:51:50,238 --> 01:51:53,279
and i you know it's so interesting we

3427
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:55,118
come from very different backgrounds

3428
01:51:53,279 --> 01:51:56,880
we're quite different as people

3429
01:51:55,118 --> 01:51:57,679
um but

3430
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,480
we

3431
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:00,319
uh

3432
01:51:58,479 --> 01:52:01,678
i think we can like not talk for a long

3433
01:52:00,319 --> 01:52:03,679
time and then

3434
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:07,199
and then be on a conversation and be eye

3435
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:08,719
to eye on like 90 of things and so he's

3436
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:11,279
someone who i believe no matter how much

3437
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:12,719
fog settles into the ocean his ship my

3438
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:14,960
ship are pointed sort of in the same

3439
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:17,039
direction of the same star wow so that's

3440
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:19,439
a beautiful way to phrase it no matter

3441
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:20,319
how much fog there is appointed the same

3442
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:21,839
star

3443
01:52:20,319 --> 01:52:23,039
yeah and i hope he feels the same way i

3444
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:25,279
mean i hope he knows that over the years

3445
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:26,479
now um we both care a lot about the

3446
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:28,079
community

3447
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:28,959
um for someone who cares so deeply i

3448
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:30,880
would say this about travis that's

3449
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:33,198
interesting for someone who cares so

3450
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:35,359
deeply about the nerd details

3451
01:52:33,198 --> 01:52:37,279
of like type system design and vector

3452
01:52:35,359 --> 01:52:38,639
computing and efficiency of expressing

3453
01:52:37,279 --> 01:52:40,399
this and then the other

3454
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:43,359
memory layouts and all that stuff

3455
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:45,759
he cares even more about the people in

3456
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:48,399
the ecosystem the community

3457
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:50,960
and i have um

3458
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:53,039
a similar kind of alignment i care a lot

3459
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:54,800
about the tech i really do

3460
01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:55,599
but for me

3461
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:58,079
the

3462
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:59,279
the beauty of what this human ecology

3463
01:52:58,079 --> 01:53:01,599
has produced

3464
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:03,198
is i think a touchstone

3465
01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:04,639
it's an early version we should look at

3466
01:53:03,198 --> 01:53:06,559
it and say how do we replicate this for

3467
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:08,719
humanity at scale what this open source

3468
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:10,960
collaboration was able to produce

3469
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:12,560
how can we be generative in human

3470
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,960
collaboration moving forward and create

3471
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:17,360
that as a civilizational kind of dynamic

3472
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:18,639
like can we seize this moment to do that

3473
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:20,719
because like a lot of the other open

3474
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:22,719
source movements it's all nerds nerding

3475
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:23,520
out on code for nerds you know

3476
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:25,760
um

3477
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:27,520
and the this because it's scientists

3478
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:30,719
because it's people working on data that

3479
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:32,719
all of it faces real human problems

3480
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:34,319
um i think we have an opportunity to

3481
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:36,639
actually make a bigger impact

3482
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:39,039
is there a way for this kind of open

3483
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:41,599
source vision to make money

3484
01:53:39,039 --> 01:53:44,238
absolutely to fund the people involved

3485
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:45,920
is that yes it's hard it's hard

3486
01:53:44,238 --> 01:53:48,799
but but we're trying to do that in our

3487
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:50,239
own way um at anaconda uh because we

3488
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,920
know that business users as they use

3489
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:53,118
more of the stuff they have needs that

3490
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:56,079
like business specific needs around

3491
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:57,198
security provenance um you know they

3492
01:53:56,079 --> 01:53:58,000
really can't

3493
01:53:57,198 --> 01:54:00,479
tell

3494
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
their vps and their investors hey we're

3495
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:03,678
having you know our data scientists are

3496
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,520
installing random packages from who

3497
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:06,719
knows where and running on customer data

3498
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:09,599
so they have to have someone to talk to

3499
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:11,039
and that's what anaconda does so we are

3500
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:12,159
you know a governed source of packages

3501
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:14,560
for them and that's great that makes

3502
01:54:12,158 --> 01:54:17,198
some money we take some of that and we

3503
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:18,480
just uh take that as a dividend we take

3504
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:20,079
a percentage of revenues and write that

3505
01:54:18,479 --> 01:54:22,559
as a dividend for the open source

3506
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:24,559
community but beyond that

3507
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:27,599
i really see the development of a

3508
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:30,800
marketplace for people to create

3509
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:32,960
notebooks models data sets curation of

3510
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:35,039
these different kinds of things

3511
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:36,480
and to really have a long tail

3512
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:37,920
marketplace dynamic

3513
01:54:36,479 --> 01:54:39,598
with that

3514
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:42,399
can you speak about this problem that

3515
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:46,560
you stumbled into of package management

3516
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:46,559
python package management what is that

3517
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:50,480
a lot of people speak very highly of

3518
01:54:48,399 --> 01:54:52,000
conda which is part of anaconda which is

3519
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:53,039
the package manager there's a ton of

3520
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,198
packages

3521
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:58,560
so first what are package managers and

3522
01:54:55,198 --> 01:54:59,439
second what was there before what is pip

3523
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:02,320
and

3524
01:54:59,439 --> 01:55:04,559
why is condom more awesome the package

3525
01:55:02,319 --> 01:55:06,158
problem is this which is that in order

3526
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:08,080
to do

3527
01:55:06,158 --> 01:55:10,000
um

3528
01:55:08,079 --> 01:55:11,599
numerical computing efficiently with

3529
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,399
python

3530
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:16,639
there are a lot of low-level libraries

3531
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:18,479
that need to be compiled compiled with a

3532
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:19,679
c compiler or c plus plus compiler for

3533
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:21,039
trend compiler

3534
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:22,239
they need to not just be compiled but

3535
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:23,599
they need to be compiled with all of the

3536
01:55:22,238 --> 01:55:25,039
right settings

3537
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:27,279
and oftentimes those settings are tuned

3538
01:55:25,039 --> 01:55:29,198
for specific chip architectures

3539
01:55:27,279 --> 01:55:31,439
and and when you add gpus to the mix

3540
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:33,759
when you look at different operating

3541
01:55:31,439 --> 01:55:36,399
systems you may be on the same chip but

3542
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:38,400
if you're running mac versus linux

3543
01:55:36,399 --> 01:55:39,920
versus windows on the same x86 chip you

3544
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:41,759
compile link differently

3545
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:43,359
all of this complexity

3546
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:45,360
is

3547
01:55:43,359 --> 01:55:47,279
beyond the capability of most data

3548
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:48,319
scientists to reason about and it's also

3549
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:50,319
beyond

3550
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:52,079
what most of the package developers want

3551
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:53,519
to deal with too yes because your

3552
01:55:52,079 --> 01:55:56,000
package developer you're like i code on

3553
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:57,119
linux this works for me i'm good it is

3554
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,880
not my problem to figure out how to

3555
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:00,799
build this on an ancient version of

3556
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:01,920
windows right that's just simply not my

3557
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,079
problem

3558
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:06,880
so what we end up with is we have a

3559
01:56:04,079 --> 01:56:08,479
creator econ or create a a very creative

3560
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,920
crowdsourced environment

3561
01:56:08,479 --> 01:56:11,279
where people want to use this stuff but

3562
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:13,760
they can't

3563
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:16,158
and so we ended up creating

3564
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:18,560
a new set of technologies like a build

3565
01:56:16,158 --> 01:56:21,920
recipe system a build system and an

3566
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:23,760
installer system that is able to

3567
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:25,679
um well

3568
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:27,599
to put it simply it's able to build

3569
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:28,800
these packages correctly

3570
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:30,480
on each of these different kinds of

3571
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,920
platforms and operating systems and make

3572
01:56:30,479 --> 01:56:32,879
it so when people want to install

3573
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,319
something

3574
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:35,199
they can it's just one command they

3575
01:56:34,319 --> 01:56:36,799
don't have to

3576
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:38,158
you know set up a big compiler system

3577
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,239
and do all these things

3578
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:42,479
so when it works well it works great

3579
01:56:40,238 --> 01:56:44,158
now the difficulty is

3580
01:56:42,479 --> 01:56:46,399
we have literally thousands of people

3581
01:56:44,158 --> 01:56:47,679
writing code in the ecosystem building

3582
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:49,439
all sorts of stuff and each person

3583
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:52,158
writing code they may take a dependence

3584
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:54,719
on something else and so all this web

3585
01:56:52,158 --> 01:56:57,598
incredibly complex web of dependencies

3586
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:59,039
so installing the correct package

3587
01:56:57,599 --> 01:57:00,880
for any given

3588
01:56:59,039 --> 01:57:03,198
set of packages you want getting that

3589
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:04,560
right sub graph is an incredibly hard

3590
01:57:03,198 --> 01:57:05,839
problem

3591
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,880
and again most data scientists don't

3592
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:09,360
want to think about this they're like i

3593
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:11,118
want to install numpy and pandas i want

3594
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:13,279
this version of some like geospatial

3595
01:57:11,118 --> 01:57:15,519
library i want this other thing like why

3596
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:17,599
is this hard these exist right

3597
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:19,440
yes and it is hard because it's well

3598
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:21,360
you're installing this on a version of

3599
01:57:19,439 --> 01:57:23,279
windows right and half of these

3600
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:24,960
libraries are not built for windows

3601
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:26,559
or the latest version isn't available

3602
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,679
but the old version was if you go to the

3603
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:28,560
old version of this library that means

3604
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:29,920
you need to go to a different version of

3605
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:31,119
that library

3606
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:33,520
and so

3607
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:35,598
the python ecosystem by by virtue of

3608
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:38,000
being crowdsourced we were able to fill

3609
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:40,480
a hundred thousand different niches but

3610
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,960
then we also suffer this problem that

3611
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:44,559
because it's crowdsourced and no one

3612
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:47,198
it's like a tragedy the commons right no

3613
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:49,119
one really needs wants to support their

3614
01:57:47,198 --> 01:57:51,678
thousands of other dependencies

3615
01:57:49,118 --> 01:57:53,039
so we end up sort of having to do a lot

3616
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:54,399
of this and of course the condo forge

3617
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:56,158
community also steps up as an open

3618
01:57:54,399 --> 01:57:58,238
source community that you know maintains

3619
01:57:56,158 --> 01:57:59,759
some of these recipes that's what conda

3620
01:57:58,238 --> 01:58:01,839
does now pip

3621
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:04,159
is a tool that came along after conda to

3622
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:07,440
some extent it came along as an easier

3623
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:08,719
way for the um for the python developers

3624
01:58:07,439 --> 01:58:10,638
writing

3625
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:13,439
python code that didn't have as much

3626
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:15,279
compiled you know stuff they could then

3627
01:58:13,439 --> 01:58:16,000
install different packages

3628
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:17,118
and

3629
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,039
what ended up happening in the python

3630
01:58:17,118 --> 01:58:20,799
ecosystem was that a lot of the core

3631
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:22,960
python and web python developers they

3632
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,079
never ran into any of this compilation

3633
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,960
stuff at all

3634
01:58:24,079 --> 01:58:28,880
so even we have you know uh uh on video

3635
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:30,239
we have uh guido and guido van rossum

3636
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:31,760
saying you know what the scientific

3637
01:58:30,238 --> 01:58:33,359
community's packaging problems are just

3638
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:36,000
too exotic and different i mean talking

3639
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:37,118
about fortran compilers right um like

3640
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,960
you guys just need to build your own

3641
01:58:37,118 --> 01:58:41,598
solution perhaps right

3642
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:44,000
so the python core python community went

3643
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:45,279
and built its own sort of packaging

3644
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,679
technologies

3645
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:49,279
not really contemplating the complexity

3646
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:51,440
of the stuff over here

3647
01:58:49,279 --> 01:58:53,118
and so now we have the challenge where

3648
01:58:51,439 --> 01:58:54,158
you can pip install some things in some

3649
01:58:53,118 --> 01:58:55,279
libraries if you just want to get

3650
01:58:54,158 --> 01:58:56,559
started with them

3651
01:58:55,279 --> 01:58:58,559
you can pimp and sell tensorflow and

3652
01:58:56,560 --> 01:59:00,159
that works great the instant you want to

3653
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:02,960
also install some other packages that

3654
01:59:00,158 --> 01:59:05,198
use different versions of numpy or some

3655
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:07,198
like graphics library or some opencv

3656
01:59:05,198 --> 01:59:08,719
thing or some other thing you now run

3657
01:59:07,198 --> 01:59:10,479
into dependency hell

3658
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:12,079
because you cannot you know opencv can

3659
01:59:10,479 --> 01:59:14,479
have a different version of jpeg over

3660
01:59:12,079 --> 01:59:15,760
here than pytorch over here like they

3661
01:59:14,479 --> 01:59:17,359
actually they all have to use that if

3662
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,400
you want to use gpu acceleration they

3663
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:21,039
have to all use the same underlying

3664
01:59:18,399 --> 01:59:23,279
drivers and same gpu cuda things so it's

3665
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:25,279
it gets to be very gnarly and it's a

3666
01:59:23,279 --> 01:59:26,880
level of technology that both the makers

3667
01:59:25,279 --> 01:59:28,399
and the users don't really want to think

3668
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:30,000
too much about

3669
01:59:28,399 --> 01:59:31,279
and that's where you step in and try to

3670
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,118
solve this we try to solve this sub

3671
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:35,118
graph problem how much is that and you

3672
01:59:33,118 --> 01:59:36,559
said you don't want to think they don't

3673
01:59:35,118 --> 01:59:38,000
want to think about it but how much is

3674
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:40,560
it a little bit on the developer and

3675
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,719
providing them tools to

3676
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:44,800
to be a little bit more clear of that

3677
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:46,399
subgraph of dependency that's necessary

3678
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:48,800
it is it is getting to a point where we

3679
01:59:46,399 --> 01:59:50,238
do have to think about look can we pull

3680
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:52,239
some of the most popular packages

3681
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:53,839
together and get them to work on a

3682
01:59:52,238 --> 01:59:55,759
coordinated release timeline get them to

3683
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:57,520
build against the same test matrix et

3684
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:59,760
cetera et cetera right and there is a

3685
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:02,080
little bit of dynamic around this but

3686
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:03,599
again it is a volunteer community

3687
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:04,479
um you know

3688
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:05,920
people working on these different

3689
02:00:04,479 --> 02:00:07,519
projects have their own timelines and

3690
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:09,359
their own things they're trying to meet

3691
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:11,360
so we end up

3692
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:13,039
trying to pull these things together and

3693
02:00:11,359 --> 02:00:15,198
then it's it's just incredibly and i

3694
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:17,279
would recommend just as a business tip

3695
02:00:15,198 --> 02:00:19,359
don't ever go into business where when

3696
02:00:17,279 --> 02:00:20,800
your hard work works you're invisible

3697
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:22,479
and when it breaks because of someone

3698
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:23,840
else's problem you get

3699
02:00:22,479 --> 02:00:25,598
flack for it because that's that's for

3700
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:27,119
our in our situation right when

3701
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:29,119
something doesn't install properly

3702
02:00:27,118 --> 02:00:30,639
usually it's some upstream issue but it

3703
02:00:29,118 --> 02:00:32,479
looks like condo's broken it looks like

3704
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:34,000
you know anaconda screwed something up

3705
02:00:32,479 --> 02:00:35,759
when things do work though it's like oh

3706
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,960
yeah cool it's worked assuming naturally

3707
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:39,840
of course that's very easy to make that

3708
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:43,039
work right so we end up in this kind of

3709
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:45,039
um problematic scenario but uh but it's

3710
02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:46,800
okay because i think we're still um you

3711
02:00:45,039 --> 02:00:48,158
know our hearts in the right place we're

3712
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,679
trying to move this forward as a

3713
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:50,719
community sort of affair i think most of

3714
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:52,079
the people in the community also

3715
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:53,840
appreciate the work we've done over the

3716
02:00:52,079 --> 02:00:56,319
years to try to move these things

3717
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:57,279
forward in a in a collaborative fashion

3718
02:00:56,319 --> 02:00:58,960
so

3719
02:00:57,279 --> 02:01:02,079
one of the

3720
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:03,920
sub-graphs of dependencies that

3721
02:01:02,079 --> 02:01:06,000
became super complicated is the move

3722
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:08,000
from python 2 to python 3. so there's

3723
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,198
all these ways to mess with these kinds

3724
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,520
of

3725
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:12,559
ecosystems of packages and so on so i

3726
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,960
just want to ask you about that

3727
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:17,760
particular one what do you think about

3728
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:19,679
the move from python 2 to 3

3729
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:22,239
now why did it take so long what were

3730
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:24,319
from your perspective just seeing the

3731
02:01:22,238 --> 02:01:26,158
packages all struggle in the community

3732
02:01:24,319 --> 02:01:27,679
all struggle through this process

3733
02:01:26,158 --> 02:01:29,359
what lessons do you take away from it

3734
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:30,560
why did it take so long

3735
02:01:29,359 --> 02:01:33,359
looking back

3736
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:34,560
some people perhaps underestimated

3737
02:01:33,359 --> 02:01:37,920
how much

3738
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:39,280
adoption python 2 had

3739
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:41,599
i think

3740
02:01:39,279 --> 02:01:44,319
some people also underestimated how much

3741
02:01:41,599 --> 02:01:46,000
or they overestimated how much value

3742
02:01:44,319 --> 02:01:48,158
some of the new features in python 3

3743
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,000
really provided like the things they

3744
02:01:48,158 --> 02:01:51,279
really loved about python 3 just didn't

3745
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,479
matter to some of these people in python

3746
02:01:51,279 --> 02:01:54,639
2. yeah

3747
02:01:52,479 --> 02:01:56,319
because this change was happening as

3748
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:58,239
python scipy

3749
02:01:56,319 --> 02:01:59,920
was starting to take off really like

3750
02:01:58,238 --> 02:02:01,598
past like a hockey stick of adoption in

3751
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:02,800
the early data science era in the early

3752
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:04,079
2010s

3753
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:06,239
a lot of people were learning and

3754
02:02:04,079 --> 02:02:08,399
onboarding in whatever just worked and

3755
02:02:06,238 --> 02:02:09,519
the teachers were like well yeah these

3756
02:02:08,399 --> 02:02:10,799
libraries i need are not supported on

3757
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:13,360
python 3 yet i'm going to teach you

3758
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:15,840
python 2. it took a lot of advocacy to

3759
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:18,079
get people to move over to python 3. so

3760
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:20,239
i think it wasn't any particular single

3761
02:02:18,079 --> 02:02:21,760
thing but it was one of those death by

3762
02:02:20,238 --> 02:02:24,000
you know a dozen cuts

3763
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:27,119
which just really made it hard to move

3764
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,800
off of python 2 and also python 3 itself

3765
02:02:27,118 --> 02:02:30,000
as they were kind of breaking things and

3766
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,199
changing these around reorganize the

3767
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,880
standard library there's a lot of stuff

3768
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:34,319
that was happening there

3769
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:35,840
that

3770
02:02:34,319 --> 02:02:37,599
kept giving people an excuse to say i'll

3771
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:38,960
put off to the next version

3772
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:40,800
2 is working fine enough for me right

3773
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:42,560
now so i think that's essentially what

3774
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:43,679
happened there and i will say this

3775
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:47,280
though

3776
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:48,560
the strength of the python data science

3777
02:02:47,279 --> 02:02:49,679
movement

3778
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:51,280
i think

3779
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:53,520
is what kept python alive in that

3780
02:02:51,279 --> 02:02:54,880
transition because a lot of languages

3781
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,880
have died in

3782
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:58,800
left left their user bases behind if

3783
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:01,039
there wasn't the use of python for data

3784
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:02,880
there's a good chunk of python users

3785
02:03:01,039 --> 02:03:04,960
that during that transition would have

3786
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:06,719
just left for go and rust and stayed in

3787
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,719
fact some people did they moved to go

3788
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:11,118
and rust and they just never looked back

3789
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:14,319
the fact that we were able to grow

3790
02:03:11,118 --> 02:03:15,839
by the by millions of users the python

3791
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:17,198
data community

3792
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:19,360
that is what kept the momentum for

3793
02:03:17,198 --> 02:03:21,678
python going and now the usage of python

3794
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:24,238
for data is over 50

3795
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:26,560
um of the overall python user base

3796
02:03:24,238 --> 02:03:28,399
so i will put i will make i'm happy to

3797
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:29,599
debate that on stage somewhere icon with

3798
02:03:28,399 --> 02:03:30,719
someone if they really want to take

3799
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:32,719
issue with that statement but from my

3800
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:34,719
where i sit i think that's true the

3801
02:03:32,719 --> 02:03:37,840
statement there the idea is that the

3802
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:40,560
switch from python 2 to python 3

3803
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:42,400
would have probably destroyed python if

3804
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:44,560
it didn't also coincide

3805
02:03:42,399 --> 02:03:45,759
with python for whatever

3806
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:47,440
reason

3807
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:49,599
just

3808
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:51,919
overtaking the data science community

3809
02:03:49,599 --> 02:03:54,078
anything that processes data yeah so

3810
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:55,279
like the timing was perfect

3811
02:03:54,078 --> 02:03:57,679
that this

3812
02:03:55,279 --> 02:04:00,158
maybe imperfect decision was coupled

3813
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:02,319
with the great timing and on the value

3814
02:04:00,158 --> 02:04:04,638
of data in in our world i would say the

3815
02:04:02,319 --> 02:04:07,279
troubled execution of a good decision

3816
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:08,639
it was a decision that was necessary

3817
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:09,920
it's possible if we had more resources

3818
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:12,319
we could have done in a way that was a

3819
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:15,039
little bit smoother but ultimately you

3820
02:04:12,319 --> 02:04:16,639
know the the the arguments for python 3

3821
02:04:15,039 --> 02:04:19,118
i bought them at the time and i buy them

3822
02:04:16,639 --> 02:04:21,440
now right having great text handling is

3823
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:23,439
like a non-negotiable table stakes thing

3824
02:04:21,439 --> 02:04:26,078
you need to have in a language

3825
02:04:23,439 --> 02:04:27,279
so um so that's great um

3826
02:04:26,078 --> 02:04:31,279
but

3827
02:04:27,279 --> 02:04:33,279
uh the execution you know python is the

3828
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:34,399
um it's volunteer driven it's like the

3829
02:04:33,279 --> 02:04:37,039
now the most popular language on the

3830
02:04:34,399 --> 02:04:39,039
planet but it's all literally volunteers

3831
02:04:37,039 --> 02:04:41,519
so the lack of resources meant that they

3832
02:04:39,039 --> 02:04:43,439
had to really they had to do things in a

3833
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:45,920
very uh hamstrung way

3834
02:04:43,439 --> 02:04:47,759
and i think to carry the python momentum

3835
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:49,440
and the language through that time the

3836
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:51,520
data movement was a critical part of

3837
02:04:49,439 --> 02:04:54,479
that so some of it was karen stick i

3838
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:56,480
actually have to uh

3839
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:58,000
shamefully admit that it took me a very

3840
02:04:56,479 --> 02:04:59,839
long time to switch from python 2 and

3841
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,840
python 3 because i'm a machine learning

3842
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:03,760
person it was just for the longest time

3843
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:05,039
you could just do fine with python 2.

3844
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:08,320
right

3845
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:10,960
but i think the moment where i switched

3846
02:05:08,319 --> 02:05:12,000
uh everybody i worked with and switched

3847
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:13,920
myself

3848
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,359
for small projects and big

3849
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:17,679
is when

3850
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:20,799
finally when numpy announced that

3851
02:05:17,679 --> 02:05:23,039
they're going to end support uh like in

3852
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:25,760
2020 or something like that right

3853
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:27,760
so like when i i realized oh this isn't

3854
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:29,599
going this is going to end right so

3855
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:31,199
that's the stick that's not a carrot

3856
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:33,119
that's not so for longest time was

3857
02:05:31,198 --> 02:05:35,279
carrots it was like all of these

3858
02:05:33,118 --> 02:05:37,519
packages were saying okay we have python

3859
02:05:35,279 --> 02:05:40,158
3 support now come join us we have

3860
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:41,679
python 2 and python 3 but one numpy one

3861
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:43,839
of the packages i

3862
02:05:41,679 --> 02:05:45,039
sort of love and depend on

3863
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:47,679
uh

3864
02:05:45,039 --> 02:05:49,198
said like nope it's over

3865
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:51,199
that's that's when i

3866
02:05:49,198 --> 02:05:52,078
uh decided to switch i wonder if you

3867
02:05:51,198 --> 02:05:54,000
think

3868
02:05:52,078 --> 02:05:57,359
it was possible much earlier for

3869
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:59,439
somebody like uh like numpy or some

3870
02:05:57,359 --> 02:06:01,679
major package to

3871
02:05:59,439 --> 02:06:03,839
step into the cold

3872
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:06,000
well it's like it's a chicken and egg

3873
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:08,000
problem too right you don't want to cut

3874
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,560
off a lot of users unless you see the

3875
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,198
user momentum going too so the decisions

3876
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:14,239
for the scientific community for each of

3877
02:06:13,198 --> 02:06:16,000
the different projects you know there's

3878
02:06:14,238 --> 02:06:17,598
not a monolith some projects are like

3879
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:19,840
we'll only be releasing new features on

3880
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:22,319
python three yeah and that was more of a

3881
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:26,000
sticky carrot or yeah a firm carrot if

3882
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:26,000
you will a firm carrot um

3883
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:30,719
a stick shaped carrot yeah but then for

3884
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:32,560
others yeah numpy in particular because

3885
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:34,239
it's at the base of the dependency stack

3886
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:36,320
for so many things

3887
02:06:34,238 --> 02:06:38,000
um that was the final stick that was a

3888
02:06:36,319 --> 02:06:40,078
stick shaped stick people were saying

3889
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,158
look if i have to keep maintaining my

3890
02:06:40,078 --> 02:06:43,439
releases for python 2 that's that much

3891
02:06:42,158 --> 02:06:45,519
less energy

3892
02:06:43,439 --> 02:06:47,759
that i can put into making things better

3893
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:48,960
for the python 3 folks or in my new

3894
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:51,360
version which is of course going to be

3895
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:53,840
python 3. so people were also getting

3896
02:06:51,359 --> 02:06:55,759
kind of pulled by this tension so the

3897
02:06:53,840 --> 02:06:58,000
overall community sort of had a lot of

3898
02:06:55,760 --> 02:07:00,239
input into when the numpy core folks

3899
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:03,039
decided they would end of life

3900
02:07:00,238 --> 02:07:04,638
on python 2. so as this these numbers

3901
02:07:03,039 --> 02:07:06,800
are a little bit loose but there are

3902
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:08,239
about 10 million python programmers in

3903
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,400
the world you could argue that number

3904
02:07:08,238 --> 02:07:11,359
but let's say 10 million uh that's

3905
02:07:10,399 --> 02:07:14,399
actually

3906
02:07:11,359 --> 02:07:17,118
where i was looking to 27 million total

3907
02:07:14,399 --> 02:07:19,279
programmers developers in the world

3908
02:07:17,118 --> 02:07:21,439
you mentioned in the talk that uh

3909
02:07:19,279 --> 02:07:22,960
changes need to be made for there to be

3910
02:07:21,439 --> 02:07:25,519
100 million

3911
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:27,118
programmers so first of all do you see a

3912
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:29,280
future where there's a hundred million

3913
02:07:27,118 --> 02:07:31,198
python programmers and second what kind

3914
02:07:29,279 --> 02:07:33,039
of changes need to be made

3915
02:07:31,198 --> 02:07:34,879
so anaconda minicon to get downloaded

3916
02:07:33,039 --> 02:07:37,519
about a million times a week

3917
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:38,960
so i think the idea that there's only

3918
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:41,840
10 million python programmers in the

3919
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:43,520
world is a little bit under counting

3920
02:07:41,840 --> 02:07:44,880
there are a lot of people who escape

3921
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:47,360
traditional accounting

3922
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:48,319
that are using python and data in their

3923
02:07:47,359 --> 02:07:51,359
jobs

3924
02:07:48,319 --> 02:07:53,198
i do believe that the future world for

3925
02:07:51,359 --> 02:07:54,639
it to well the world i would like to see

3926
02:07:53,198 --> 02:07:57,198
is one where people

3927
02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:59,679
are data literate so they are able to

3928
02:07:57,198 --> 02:08:01,118
use tools that let them express their

3929
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:02,399
questions and ideas

3930
02:08:01,118 --> 02:08:05,039
fluidly

3931
02:08:02,399 --> 02:08:06,719
um and the data variety and data

3932
02:08:05,039 --> 02:08:10,800
complexity will not go down it will only

3933
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:13,118
keep increasing so i think some level of

3934
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:14,079
code or code like things will continue

3935
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:15,439
to

3936
02:08:14,078 --> 02:08:17,039
be relevant

3937
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:19,678
and so

3938
02:08:17,039 --> 02:08:21,760
my my hope is that we can build systems

3939
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:24,800
that allow people to more seamlessly

3940
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:27,520
integrate python kinds of expressitivity

3941
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:30,960
with data systems and operationalization

3942
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:32,239
methods that are much more seamless

3943
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:34,000
and what i mean by that is you know

3944
02:08:32,238 --> 02:08:36,000
right now you can't punch python code

3945
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,760
into an excel cell i mean there's some

3946
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,960
tools you can do to kind of do this

3947
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:41,039
we didn't built a thing for doing this

3948
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:43,439
back in the day but

3949
02:08:41,039 --> 02:08:45,840
but i feel like the total addressable

3950
02:08:43,439 --> 02:08:48,078
market for python users if we do the

3951
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:49,840
things right is on the order of the

3952
02:08:48,078 --> 02:08:51,198
excel users which is you know a few

3953
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:52,800
hundred million

3954
02:08:51,198 --> 02:08:55,279
so um

3955
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:57,199
i think python has to get better at

3956
02:08:55,279 --> 02:08:58,960
being embedded

3957
02:08:57,198 --> 02:09:00,719
you know being a smaller thing that

3958
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:03,039
pulls in just the right parts of the

3959
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:05,439
ecosystem to

3960
02:09:03,039 --> 02:09:07,760
run numerix and do data exploration

3961
02:09:05,439 --> 02:09:09,678
meeting people where they're already at

3962
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:11,840
with their data and their data tools and

3963
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:13,199
then i think also

3964
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:14,639
it has to be easier to take some of

3965
02:09:13,198 --> 02:09:16,960
those things they've written

3966
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:19,359
and flow those back into deployed

3967
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:20,719
systems or apps or visualizations i

3968
02:09:19,359 --> 02:09:22,158
think if we don't do those things then

3969
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:24,158
we will always be

3970
02:09:22,158 --> 02:09:26,238
kept in the silo as sort of a

3971
02:09:24,158 --> 02:09:28,078
you know expert users tool and not a

3972
02:09:26,238 --> 02:09:29,759
tool for the masses you know i work with

3973
02:09:28,078 --> 02:09:31,279
a bunch of folks in the

3974
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:34,239
adobe

3975
02:09:31,279 --> 02:09:36,719
creative suite and i'm kind of forcing

3976
02:09:34,238 --> 02:09:38,399
them or inspired them to learn python uh

3977
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:39,439
to do a bunch of stuff that helps them

3978
02:09:38,399 --> 02:09:40,719
and it's interesting because they

3979
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:42,479
probably wouldn't call themselves a

3980
02:09:40,719 --> 02:09:43,679
python programmers but right while using

3981
02:09:42,479 --> 02:09:45,118
python

3982
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:46,800
i would love it if the tools like

3983
02:09:45,118 --> 02:09:48,960
photoshop and premiere and all those

3984
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:50,560
kinds of tools that are targeted towards

3985
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:52,000
creative people i guess that's where

3986
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:53,599
excel

3987
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,439
excel is targeted towards a certain kind

3988
02:09:53,599 --> 02:09:58,000
of audience that works for data

3989
02:09:55,439 --> 02:10:00,078
financial people all that kind of stuff

3990
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,399
if they if there would be easy ways to

3991
02:10:00,078 --> 02:10:05,279
leverage to use python for quick

3992
02:10:02,399 --> 02:10:07,439
scripting tasks yeah and i you know

3993
02:10:05,279 --> 02:10:09,519
there's an exciting application of uh

3994
02:10:07,439 --> 02:10:12,078
artificial intelligence in this space

3995
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:14,800
that i'm hopeful about looking at open

3996
02:10:12,078 --> 02:10:17,920
ai codex with um

3997
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:21,039
generating programs yeah so almost

3998
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:23,440
helping people bridge the gap from kind

3999
02:10:21,039 --> 02:10:26,399
of visual interface

4000
02:10:23,439 --> 02:10:27,759
to generating programs to

4001
02:10:26,399 --> 02:10:30,559
something formal and then they can

4002
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:32,159
modify it and so on but kind of

4003
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:34,000
without having to read the manual

4004
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:35,679
without having to do a google search on

4005
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,279
stack overflow which is essentially what

4006
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:40,239
a neural network does when it's doing

4007
02:10:37,279 --> 02:10:42,880
code generation uh is is actually

4008
02:10:40,238 --> 02:10:44,718
generating code and allowing a human to

4009
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:46,400
communicate with multiple programs and

4010
02:10:44,719 --> 02:10:48,719
then maybe even programs to communicate

4011
02:10:46,399 --> 02:10:50,399
with each other via python right so that

4012
02:10:48,719 --> 02:10:53,920
that to me is a really exciting

4013
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:56,078
possibility because i think there's a

4014
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:58,719
there's a friction to kind of like how

4015
02:10:56,078 --> 02:11:00,158
do i learn how to use python in my life

4016
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:02,480
there's a

4017
02:11:00,158 --> 02:11:05,519
oftentimes you kind of what start a

4018
02:11:02,479 --> 02:11:06,959
class you start learning about types yes

4019
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:08,719
i don't know functions

4020
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:10,399
like this is you know python is the

4021
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:11,920
first language with which you start to

4022
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:13,519
learn to program

4023
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:15,840
but

4024
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:17,520
i feel like that's going to take

4025
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:19,279
a long time for you to understand why

4026
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:22,079
it's useful you almost want to start

4027
02:11:19,279 --> 02:11:23,679
with a script well you you do in fact i

4028
02:11:22,078 --> 02:11:25,118
i think starting with the theory theory

4029
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:27,760
behind programming languages and types

4030
02:11:25,118 --> 02:11:30,319
and i mean types are there to make the

4031
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:31,679
compiler writer's jobs easier types are

4032
02:11:30,319 --> 02:11:32,960
not i mean

4033
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:35,440
heck do you have an ontology of types

4034
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:38,239
for just the objects in this table no

4035
02:11:35,439 --> 02:11:39,678
so types are there because compiler

4036
02:11:38,238 --> 02:11:41,519
writers are human and they're limited in

4037
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:44,960
what they can do but

4038
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:46,639
um i think that the beauty of scripting

4039
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:48,239
like there's a there's a python book

4040
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:49,118
that's uh called automate the boring

4041
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:52,158
stuff

4042
02:11:49,118 --> 02:11:54,559
which is exactly the right mentality um

4043
02:11:52,158 --> 02:11:55,839
i grew up with computers in a time when

4044
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:56,639
i could

4045
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:58,319
uh

4046
02:11:56,639 --> 02:11:59,760
when when steve job was still pitching

4047
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:01,439
these things as bicycles for the mine

4048
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:03,840
they were supposed to not be just media

4049
02:12:01,439 --> 02:12:05,198
consumption devices um but they were

4050
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:06,400
they were actually you could you could

4051
02:12:05,198 --> 02:12:07,678
write some code you could write basic

4052
02:12:06,399 --> 02:12:08,879
you could write some stuff to do some

4053
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:11,760
things

4054
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:13,679
and that feeling of a computer as the

4055
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:14,960
thing that we can use to extend

4056
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:17,760
ourselves has

4057
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:20,078
all but evaporated for a lot of people

4058
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:21,599
so you see a little bit in parts and the

4059
02:12:20,078 --> 02:12:23,920
current the generation of youth around

4060
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:26,078
minecraft or roblox right and i think

4061
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:27,039
python circuit python these things

4062
02:12:26,078 --> 02:12:29,679
um

4063
02:12:27,039 --> 02:12:31,039
could be a renaissance of that of people

4064
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:32,719
actually

4065
02:12:31,039 --> 02:12:34,238
shaping and using their computers as

4066
02:12:32,719 --> 02:12:35,439
computers

4067
02:12:34,238 --> 02:12:38,399
as an extension of their minds and their

4068
02:12:35,439 --> 02:12:40,078
curiosity their creativity so you know

4069
02:12:38,399 --> 02:12:41,359
you talk about scripting the adobe suite

4070
02:12:40,078 --> 02:12:44,319
with python

4071
02:12:41,359 --> 02:12:46,799
in the 3d graphics world python

4072
02:12:44,319 --> 02:12:49,118
is a scripting language some of these 3d

4073
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:50,239
graphics suites use and i think that's

4074
02:12:49,118 --> 02:12:52,639
great we should better support those

4075
02:12:50,238 --> 02:12:54,638
kinds of things but ultimately the idea

4076
02:12:52,639 --> 02:12:56,880
that i i should be able to have power

4077
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:58,639
over my computing environment if i want

4078
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:00,480
these things to happen repeatedly all

4079
02:12:58,639 --> 02:13:02,719
the time i should be able to say that

4080
02:13:00,479 --> 02:13:03,678
somehow to the computer right now

4081
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:05,920
whether

4082
02:13:03,679 --> 02:13:07,760
um the operating systems get there

4083
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:09,679
faster by having some you know siri

4084
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:11,119
backed with open ai with whatever so you

4085
02:13:09,679 --> 02:13:12,880
just say siri make this do this and

4086
02:13:11,118 --> 02:13:14,238
every other friday right

4087
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:15,760
we probably will get there somewhere and

4088
02:13:14,238 --> 02:13:17,678
apple's always had these ideas you know

4089
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:20,480
there's the apple script in the menu

4090
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:22,158
that no one ever uses but um you can do

4091
02:13:20,479 --> 02:13:23,759
these kinds of things but when you start

4092
02:13:22,158 --> 02:13:25,759
doing that kind of scripting the

4093
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:27,199
challenge isn't learning the type system

4094
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:28,239
or even the syntax of the language the

4095
02:13:27,198 --> 02:13:29,519
challenge is

4096
02:13:28,238 --> 02:13:31,118
all of the dictionaries on all the

4097
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:32,719
objects of all their properties and

4098
02:13:31,118 --> 02:13:34,238
attributes and parameters

4099
02:13:32,719 --> 02:13:35,359
like who's got time to learn all that

4100
02:13:34,238 --> 02:13:37,759
stuff right

4101
02:13:35,359 --> 02:13:40,399
so that's when then programming by

4102
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:42,239
prototype or by example becomes the

4103
02:13:40,399 --> 02:13:43,598
right way to get the user to express

4104
02:13:42,238 --> 02:13:44,559
their desire

4105
02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:45,599
so there's a lot of these these

4106
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:47,280
different ways that we can approach

4107
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:48,800
programming but i do think

4108
02:13:47,279 --> 02:13:50,000
when as you were talking about the the

4109
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:51,279
adobe scripting thing i was thinking

4110
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,840
about you know

4111
02:13:51,279 --> 02:13:55,679
when we do use something like numpy when

4112
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:57,520
we use things in the python data and

4113
02:13:55,679 --> 02:14:00,078
scientific

4114
02:13:57,520 --> 02:14:01,520
let's say expression system

4115
02:14:00,078 --> 02:14:04,319
there's a reason we use that which is

4116
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:06,079
that it gives us mathematical precision

4117
02:14:04,319 --> 02:14:08,238
it gives us actually quite a lot of

4118
02:14:06,078 --> 02:14:11,039
precision over precisely what we mean

4119
02:14:08,238 --> 02:14:12,399
about this data set that data set and

4120
02:14:11,039 --> 02:14:15,279
it's the fact that we can have that

4121
02:14:12,399 --> 02:14:16,238
precision that lets python be powerful

4122
02:14:15,279 --> 02:14:18,559
over

4123
02:14:16,238 --> 02:14:21,118
as a duct tape for data

4124
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:23,440
you know you give me a tsv or a csv

4125
02:14:21,118 --> 02:14:25,359
and you if you give me some massively

4126
02:14:23,439 --> 02:14:26,960
expensive vendor tool for data

4127
02:14:25,359 --> 02:14:28,479
transformation i don't know i'm gonna be

4128
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:30,480
able to solve your problem but if you

4129
02:14:28,479 --> 02:14:32,078
give me a python prompt

4130
02:14:30,479 --> 02:14:34,319
you can throw whatever data you want at

4131
02:14:32,078 --> 02:14:36,719
me i will be able to mash it into shape

4132
02:14:34,319 --> 02:14:39,279
so that ability to take it as sort of

4133
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:41,679
this like um you know machete out of the

4134
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:43,118
data jungle is really powerful and i

4135
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:45,279
think that's why

4136
02:14:43,118 --> 02:14:46,960
at some level we're not we're not going

4137
02:14:45,279 --> 02:14:49,359
to get away from some of these

4138
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:52,800
expressions and apis in libraries in

4139
02:14:49,359 --> 02:14:52,799
python for for data

4140
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:58,319
transformation you've been at the center

4141
02:14:55,599 --> 02:15:02,400
of the python community for many years

4142
02:14:58,319 --> 02:15:04,559
if you could change one thing

4143
02:15:02,399 --> 02:15:07,198
about the community to help it grow to

4144
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:08,400
help it improve to help it flourish and

4145
02:15:07,198 --> 02:15:10,559
prosper

4146
02:15:08,399 --> 02:15:12,238
what would it be i mean not you know it

4147
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:14,239
doesn't have to be one thing but what

4148
02:15:12,238 --> 02:15:15,279
what kind of comes to mind what are the

4149
02:15:14,238 --> 02:15:16,638
challenges

4150
02:15:15,279 --> 02:15:18,078
humility is one of the values that we

4151
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:20,319
have at anaconda at the company but it's

4152
02:15:18,078 --> 02:15:22,799
also on the values in the in the

4153
02:15:20,319 --> 02:15:24,158
community that it's been

4154
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:25,279
breached a little bit in the last few

4155
02:15:24,158 --> 02:15:27,279
years but

4156
02:15:25,279 --> 02:15:29,279
in general people are are quite decent

4157
02:15:27,279 --> 02:15:30,319
and reasonable and nice

4158
02:15:29,279 --> 02:15:34,238
and

4159
02:15:30,319 --> 02:15:34,238
that humility prevents them from seeing

4160
02:15:34,399 --> 02:15:40,158
the greatness that they could have

4161
02:15:37,760 --> 02:15:41,760
i don't know how many people in the core

4162
02:15:40,158 --> 02:15:43,839
python community

4163
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:46,239
really understand

4164
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:48,000
that they stand

4165
02:15:46,238 --> 02:15:51,039
perched at the edge of an opportunity to

4166
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:53,039
transform how people use computers yes

4167
02:15:51,039 --> 02:15:55,519
and actually pycon because the last

4168
02:15:53,039 --> 02:15:57,840
physical icon i went to uh russell keith

4169
02:15:55,520 --> 02:16:00,400
mcgee gave a great keynote

4170
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:02,159
about you know very much along the lines

4171
02:16:00,399 --> 02:16:03,519
of the challenges i have which is you

4172
02:16:02,158 --> 02:16:05,198
know python

4173
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:07,040
for a language that doesn't actually

4174
02:16:05,198 --> 02:16:08,399
they can't put an interface up

4175
02:16:07,039 --> 02:16:10,158
on like the most popular computing

4176
02:16:08,399 --> 02:16:11,598
devices it's done really well as a

4177
02:16:10,158 --> 02:16:12,719
language hasn't it

4178
02:16:11,599 --> 02:16:14,159
you can't write a web front end with

4179
02:16:12,719 --> 02:16:15,760
python really i mean everyone uses

4180
02:16:14,158 --> 02:16:16,960
javascript you certainly can't write

4181
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:18,639
native apps

4182
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:19,920
so for a language that you can't

4183
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:22,000
actually write

4184
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:23,679
apps in any of the front-end runtime

4185
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,840
environments python's done exceedingly

4186
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:28,000
well yeah um

4187
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:29,440
and so that that wasn't to pat ourselves

4188
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,039
in the back that was to challenge

4189
02:16:29,439 --> 02:16:32,398
ourselves the community to say we

4190
02:16:31,039 --> 02:16:34,318
through our current volunteer dynamic

4191
02:16:32,398 --> 02:16:36,638
have gotten to this point

4192
02:16:34,318 --> 02:16:38,398
what comes next and how do we seize you

4193
02:16:36,638 --> 02:16:39,839
know we've caught the tiger by the tail

4194
02:16:38,398 --> 02:16:41,760
how do we make sure we keep up with it

4195
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:43,200
as it goes forward so that's one of the

4196
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:45,439
questions i have about sort of open

4197
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:45,840
source

4198
02:16:45,439 --> 02:16:48,559
at communities

4199
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:51,439
best there's a kind of humility

4200
02:16:48,558 --> 02:16:54,398
is that humility prevent you to have a

4201
02:16:51,439 --> 02:16:55,840
vision for creating something like

4202
02:16:54,398 --> 02:16:57,679
very new and powerful and you've brought

4203
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:59,760
us back to consciousness again the

4204
02:16:57,679 --> 02:17:02,159
collaboration is a swarm emergent

4205
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:03,840
dynamic humility lets these people work

4206
02:17:02,159 --> 02:17:04,799
together without anyone trouncing anyone

4207
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,079
else

4208
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:07,438
how do they

4209
02:17:06,079 --> 02:17:08,959
you know in consciousness there's the

4210
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:10,000
question the binding problem how does a

4211
02:17:08,959 --> 02:17:12,159
singular

4212
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:14,159
our attention how does that emerge from

4213
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:15,920
you know billions of neurons yes so how

4214
02:17:14,159 --> 02:17:17,679
can you have a swarm of people

4215
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:19,840
emerge a consensus

4216
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:21,599
that has a singular vision to say we

4217
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:23,760
will do this and most importantly we're

4218
02:17:21,599 --> 02:17:25,359
not going to do these things

4219
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:28,000
emerging a

4220
02:17:25,359 --> 02:17:30,479
coherent pointed focused leadership

4221
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:33,040
dynamic from a collaboration being able

4222
02:17:30,478 --> 02:17:35,920
to do that kind of and then dissolve it

4223
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:37,280
so people can still do the swarm thing

4224
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:38,879
that's a problem there's a question so

4225
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:40,639
you have you have to have a charismatic

4226
02:17:38,879 --> 02:17:42,239
leader

4227
02:17:40,638 --> 02:17:43,759
for some reason lioness torval comes to

4228
02:17:42,239 --> 02:17:45,519
mind but he you know there's people who

4229
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:46,478
criticize you he rules that iron fist

4230
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:48,719
man

4231
02:17:46,478 --> 02:17:50,318
but there's still charisma there's a

4232
02:17:48,718 --> 02:17:53,438
charisma right there's a charisma to

4233
02:17:50,318 --> 02:17:55,920
that iron fist uh there's uh

4234
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:57,920
every leader is different i would say in

4235
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:59,439
their success so he doesn't

4236
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:02,239
i don't even know if you can say he

4237
02:17:59,439 --> 02:18:05,760
doesn't have humility

4238
02:18:02,239 --> 02:18:07,760
uh there's such a meritocracy of ideas

4239
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:09,599
that like

4240
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:11,679
this is a good idea and this is a bad

4241
02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:13,760
idea there's a step function to it once

4242
02:18:11,679 --> 02:18:15,760
you clear a threshold yeah he's open

4243
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:17,519
once you clear the bozo threshold he's

4244
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:19,439
open to your ideas i think yes right but

4245
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:21,920
see the the interesting thing is

4246
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:23,280
obviously that will not stand in an open

4247
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:25,920
source community

4248
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:28,159
if that threshold that is defined by

4249
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:30,159
that one particular person

4250
02:18:28,159 --> 02:18:31,599
is not actually that good

4251
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:33,599
so you actually have to be really

4252
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:36,239
excellent at what you do

4253
02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:38,239
so the the he's very good at what he

4254
02:18:36,239 --> 02:18:39,760
does and so there's some aspect of

4255
02:18:38,239 --> 02:18:41,760
leadership where

4256
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:43,599
you can get thrown out people can just

4257
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:45,920
leave you know that's how it works with

4258
02:18:43,599 --> 02:18:48,000
open source yeah they'll fork

4259
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:50,638
but at the same time you want to

4260
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,638
sometimes be a leader like with a strong

4261
02:18:50,638 --> 02:18:54,959
opinion because people i mean there's

4262
02:18:52,638 --> 02:18:57,598
some kind of balance here for this like

4263
02:18:54,959 --> 02:18:59,199
hive mind to get like behind leadership

4264
02:18:57,599 --> 02:19:00,398
is a big topic and i didn't you know i'm

4265
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,840
not one of these guys that went to mba

4266
02:19:00,398 --> 02:19:02,959
school and said i'm going to be an

4267
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:04,398
entrepreneur and i'm going to be a

4268
02:19:02,959 --> 02:19:05,759
leader and i'm going to read all these

4269
02:19:04,398 --> 02:19:08,239
harvard business review articles on

4270
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:09,920
leadership and all this other stuff like

4271
02:19:08,239 --> 02:19:11,280
it i was a physicist turned into a

4272
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:13,920
software nerd who then really like

4273
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:15,200
nerded out on python um i know i am

4274
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:16,558
entrepreneurial right i saw a business

4275
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:18,880
opportunity around the use of python

4276
02:19:16,558 --> 02:19:20,239
data but um for me

4277
02:19:18,879 --> 02:19:22,879
what has been interesting over this

4278
02:19:20,239 --> 02:19:25,199
journey with the last 10 years is how

4279
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:27,279
much i started really

4280
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:28,559
enjoying the

4281
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:31,120
understanding thinking deeper about

4282
02:19:28,558 --> 02:19:34,558
organizational dynamics and leadership

4283
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:36,399
and leadership does come down to a few

4284
02:19:34,558 --> 02:19:40,000
core things number one

4285
02:19:36,398 --> 02:19:43,840
a leader has to create belief or at

4286
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,840
least has to dispel disbelief

4287
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:49,200
leadership also you have to have vision

4288
02:19:46,318 --> 02:19:50,719
loyalty and experience

4289
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:53,120
so can you say

4290
02:19:50,719 --> 02:19:55,039
belief in a singular vision like what is

4291
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:56,800
belief yeah belief means a few things

4292
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,800
belief means here's what we need to do

4293
02:19:56,799 --> 02:20:00,478
and this is a valid thing to do

4294
02:19:58,799 --> 02:20:01,599
and we can do it

4295
02:20:00,478 --> 02:20:04,398
um

4296
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:05,920
that you have to be able to drive

4297
02:20:04,398 --> 02:20:07,840
that belief

4298
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:10,719
um and every step of leadership along

4299
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:12,478
the way has to help you amplify that

4300
02:20:10,719 --> 02:20:15,039
belief to more people

4301
02:20:12,478 --> 02:20:16,318
i mean i think at a fundamental level

4302
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:18,880
that's what it is you have to have a

4303
02:20:16,318 --> 02:20:19,920
vision you have to be able to um show

4304
02:20:18,879 --> 02:20:22,079
people

4305
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:24,559
that or you have to convince people to

4306
02:20:22,079 --> 02:20:25,760
believe in the vision and to to get

4307
02:20:24,559 --> 02:20:26,959
behind you and that's where the loyalty

4308
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:28,000
part comes in and the experience part

4309
02:20:26,959 --> 02:20:29,519
comes in

4310
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,439
there's all different flavors of

4311
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:35,280
leadership so if we talk about linus we

4312
02:20:31,439 --> 02:20:36,318
could talk about elon musk and steve

4313
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:38,239
jobs

4314
02:20:36,318 --> 02:20:39,519
there's sandra pachai

4315
02:20:38,239 --> 02:20:40,799
there's people that kind of put

4316
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:43,120
themselves at the center and are

4317
02:20:40,799 --> 02:20:45,920
strongly opinionated and some people are

4318
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:47,840
more like consensus builders right

4319
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:49,520
what works well for open source what

4320
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:52,079
works well in the space of programming

4321
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:54,000
so you you've been a programmer you've

4322
02:20:52,079 --> 02:20:56,000
led many programmers and now sort of at

4323
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:57,680
the center of this ecosystem what what

4324
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,879
works well in the programming world

4325
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:01,200
would you say

4326
02:20:58,879 --> 02:21:03,119
it really depends on the people what

4327
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:04,399
style leadership is best and it depends

4328
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:06,560
on the programming community i think for

4329
02:21:04,398 --> 02:21:08,478
the python community um servant

4330
02:21:06,559 --> 02:21:10,318
leadership is one of the values like at

4331
02:21:08,478 --> 02:21:14,959
the end of the day the leader has to

4332
02:21:10,318 --> 02:21:16,959
also be um the high priest of values

4333
02:21:14,959 --> 02:21:18,559
right so any kind of

4334
02:21:16,959 --> 02:21:19,839
any collection of people has values of

4335
02:21:18,559 --> 02:21:22,239
their living

4336
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:23,520
and if you want to

4337
02:21:22,239 --> 02:21:25,359
maintain

4338
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:27,439
uh certain values and those values help

4339
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:29,359
you as an organization become more

4340
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:32,318
powerful then the leader has to live

4341
02:21:29,359 --> 02:21:34,399
those values unequivocally and has to

4342
02:21:32,318 --> 02:21:36,959
you know has to hold the values

4343
02:21:34,398 --> 02:21:39,119
so in our case in this collaborative

4344
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:40,559
community around python

4345
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:42,800
i think

4346
02:21:40,559 --> 02:21:44,239
that the humility is one of those values

4347
02:21:42,799 --> 02:21:46,000
servant leadership you actually have to

4348
02:21:44,239 --> 02:21:48,879
kind of do the stuff you have to walk

4349
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:51,040
the walk not just talk the talk

4350
02:21:48,879 --> 02:21:52,799
i don't feel like the python community

4351
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:55,040
really demands that much from a vision

4352
02:21:52,799 --> 02:21:57,039
standpoint and they should and i think

4353
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:58,960
they should

4354
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:00,160
this is the interesting thing is

4355
02:21:58,959 --> 02:22:03,279
like so

4356
02:22:00,159 --> 02:22:04,559
many people use python from where comes

4357
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:07,120
the vision

4358
02:22:04,559 --> 02:22:10,799
you know like you have a elon musk type

4359
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:12,720
character who has makes bold statements

4360
02:22:10,799 --> 02:22:14,559
about the vision for particular

4361
02:22:12,719 --> 02:22:16,318
companies he's involved with

4362
02:22:14,559 --> 02:22:18,719
and it's like

4363
02:22:16,318 --> 02:22:21,119
i think a lot of people that work at

4364
02:22:18,719 --> 02:22:23,119
those companies

4365
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:24,240
kind of can only last if they believe

4366
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:26,800
that vision

4367
02:22:24,239 --> 02:22:28,799
because and some of it is super bold so

4368
02:22:26,799 --> 02:22:31,438
my question is and by the way those

4369
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:33,358
companies often use python uh

4370
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:35,920
what you know how do you establish a

4371
02:22:33,359 --> 02:22:37,280
vision like get to 100 million users

4372
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:39,359
right

4373
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:42,159
get to where

4374
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:43,280
you know the python is at the center

4375
02:22:42,159 --> 02:22:45,760
of

4376
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:47,280
the machine learning and

4377
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:49,840
was it data science machine learning

4378
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:51,120
deep learning artificial intelligence

4379
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:52,559
revolution

4380
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:54,479
right like

4381
02:22:52,559 --> 02:22:55,760
in many ways perhaps the python

4382
02:22:54,478 --> 02:22:58,079
community is not thinking of it that way

4383
02:22:55,760 --> 02:23:01,120
but it's leading the way on this

4384
02:22:58,079 --> 02:23:04,000
like the the tooling is like essential

4385
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:05,840
right well you know for a while um pycon

4386
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,359
people in the scientific python and the

4387
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:09,680
pi data community

4388
02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:12,239
um they would submit talks those early

4389
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:14,000
to early 2010s mid-2010s they would

4390
02:23:12,239 --> 02:23:15,680
submit talks for pycon

4391
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,439
and the talks would all be rejected

4392
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:19,280
because there was the separate sort of

4393
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:21,200
pi data conferences and like well these

4394
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:22,640
these probably belong more to pi data

4395
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:24,479
and instead there'd be yet another talk

4396
02:23:22,639 --> 02:23:26,478
about you know threads and

4397
02:23:24,478 --> 02:23:28,478
you know whatever some web framework and

4398
02:23:26,478 --> 02:23:29,840
it's like um that was an interesting

4399
02:23:28,478 --> 02:23:31,840
dynamic to see

4400
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:33,280
that there was i mean at the time it was

4401
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:34,799
a little annoying because we want to try

4402
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:36,239
to get more users and get more people

4403
02:23:34,799 --> 02:23:38,000
talking about these things and pycon is

4404
02:23:36,239 --> 02:23:40,559
a huge venue right it's

4405
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:42,079
thousands of python programmers but then

4406
02:23:40,559 --> 02:23:44,799
also came to appreciate that you know

4407
02:23:42,079 --> 02:23:47,200
parallel having an ecosystem that allows

4408
02:23:44,799 --> 02:23:48,639
parallel innovation is not bad right

4409
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:50,159
there are people doing embedded python

4410
02:23:48,639 --> 02:23:51,519
stuff there's people doing web

4411
02:23:50,159 --> 02:23:53,840
programming people do scripting there's

4412
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:55,760
cyber uses of python i think the

4413
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:58,239
ultimately at some point if your slide

4414
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:59,680
mode mold covers so much stuff you have

4415
02:23:58,239 --> 02:24:01,359
to respect the different things are

4416
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:03,359
growing in different areas and different

4417
02:24:01,359 --> 02:24:04,880
niches now some at some point that has

4418
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:06,079
to come together and the central body

4419
02:24:04,879 --> 02:24:08,079
has to

4420
02:24:06,079 --> 02:24:10,398
provide resources the principle here is

4421
02:24:08,079 --> 02:24:13,120
subsidiarity give resources to the

4422
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:14,879
various groups to then allocate as they

4423
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:16,240
see fit in their niches

4424
02:24:14,879 --> 02:24:17,438
that would be a really helpful dynamic

4425
02:24:16,239 --> 02:24:18,959
but again it's a volunteer community

4426
02:24:17,439 --> 02:24:21,040
it's not like that that many resources

4427
02:24:18,959 --> 02:24:23,199
to start with

4428
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:24,880
what was or is your favorite programming

4429
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:27,120
setup what operating system what

4430
02:24:24,879 --> 02:24:28,959
keyboard how many screens

4431
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:30,880
uh listening to

4432
02:24:28,959 --> 02:24:32,959
what time of day

4433
02:24:30,879 --> 02:24:34,719
are you drinking coffee tea

4434
02:24:32,959 --> 02:24:35,839
tea um sometimes coffee depending on how

4435
02:24:34,719 --> 02:24:39,519
well i slept

4436
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:41,359
um i used to have do you get a unite owl

4437
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:43,600
i remember somebody asked you somewhere

4438
02:24:41,359 --> 02:24:45,520
a question about work-life balance

4439
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:47,680
and and or like not just work-life

4440
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:50,800
balance but like a family you know you

4441
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:52,720
lead a company and your answer was

4442
02:24:50,799 --> 02:24:54,159
was basically like i still haven't

4443
02:24:52,719 --> 02:24:55,519
figured it out

4444
02:24:54,159 --> 02:24:57,200
yeah i think i've gotten a little bit

4445
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:59,120
better balance i have a really great

4446
02:24:57,200 --> 02:25:01,200
leadership team now supporting me and so

4447
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:03,439
that takes a lot of the day-to-day stuff

4448
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:05,520
um off my plate and uh my kids are

4449
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:07,359
getting a little older so that helps so

4450
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:09,040
um and of course i have a wonderful wife

4451
02:25:07,359 --> 02:25:10,399
who takes care of a lot of the things

4452
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:12,560
that i'm not able to take care of and

4453
02:25:10,398 --> 02:25:14,318
she's she's great i try to get to sleep

4454
02:25:12,559 --> 02:25:15,680
earlier now um because i have to get up

4455
02:25:14,318 --> 02:25:17,840
every morning at six to take my kid down

4456
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:19,760
to the bus stop oh wow so there's a hard

4457
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:21,200
there's a hard thing yeah for a while i

4458
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:22,639
was doing polyphasic sleep which is

4459
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:25,040
really interesting like i go to bed at

4460
02:25:22,639 --> 02:25:27,119
nine wake up at like two a.m work till

4461
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:28,560
five sleep three hours wake up at eight

4462
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:30,000
like that was actually

4463
02:25:28,559 --> 02:25:32,079
it was interesting it wasn't too bad how

4464
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:34,959
did it feel it was good i didn't keep it

4465
02:25:32,079 --> 02:25:37,039
up for years but once i have travel then

4466
02:25:34,959 --> 02:25:38,159
it just everything goes out the window

4467
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:39,840
right because then you're like time

4468
02:25:38,159 --> 02:25:42,318
zones and all these things socially was

4469
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:44,079
it except like were you able to live

4470
02:25:42,318 --> 02:25:46,000
outside of how you felt were you yes

4471
02:25:44,079 --> 02:25:47,680
able to live normal society oh yeah

4472
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,799
because like on the nights that i wasn't

4473
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:50,479
out hanging out with people or whatever

4474
02:25:48,799 --> 02:25:52,079
going to bed at night no one cares yeah

4475
02:25:50,478 --> 02:25:54,478
i wake up at two i'm still responding to

4476
02:25:52,079 --> 02:25:55,359
their slacks emails whatever and you

4477
02:25:54,478 --> 02:25:57,039
know

4478
02:25:55,359 --> 02:25:58,479
uh posting on twitter or whatever

4479
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:00,240
at two in the morning is

4480
02:25:58,478 --> 02:26:01,920
exactly right and then

4481
02:26:00,239 --> 02:26:03,280
you go to bed for a few hours and you

4482
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:05,120
wake up it's like you had an extra day

4483
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:06,319
in the middle yes and i'd read somewhere

4484
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:08,479
that you know humans naturally have

4485
02:26:06,318 --> 02:26:10,639
biphasic sleep or something i don't know

4486
02:26:08,478 --> 02:26:12,799
but um i i read basically everything

4487
02:26:10,639 --> 02:26:14,478
somewhere so right every option of

4488
02:26:12,799 --> 02:26:16,079
everything every option of everything i

4489
02:26:14,478 --> 02:26:18,000
will say that that worked out for me for

4490
02:26:16,079 --> 02:26:19,600
a while although i don't do it anymore

4491
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:21,040
um in terms of programming setup i had a

4492
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:22,318
27 inch

4493
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:24,960
high dpi

4494
02:26:22,318 --> 02:26:27,039
um setup that i really liked um but then

4495
02:26:24,959 --> 02:26:28,879
i moved to a curved monitor just because

4496
02:26:27,040 --> 02:26:31,600
uh when i moved to the new house i want

4497
02:26:28,879 --> 02:26:33,039
to have a bit more screen for zoom plus

4498
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:35,120
communications plus you know like

4499
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:37,520
various concepts it's like one large

4500
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:39,600
monitor one large curved monitor

4501
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:40,479
um what operating system

4502
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:42,479
mac

4503
02:26:40,478 --> 02:26:44,478
okay yeah is that is that what happens

4504
02:26:42,478 --> 02:26:46,879
when you become important is you stop

4505
02:26:44,478 --> 02:26:48,159
using uh linux and windows i would no i

4506
02:26:46,879 --> 02:26:50,478
actually have i have a windows box as

4507
02:26:48,159 --> 02:26:52,639
well on the next table over um

4508
02:26:50,478 --> 02:26:54,639
but uh but i have

4509
02:26:52,639 --> 02:26:56,719
i have three desks right yes so the main

4510
02:26:54,639 --> 02:26:58,478
one is the standing desk so that i can

4511
02:26:56,719 --> 02:26:59,840
you know whatever what i'm like i have a

4512
02:26:58,478 --> 02:27:00,959
teleprompter set up and everything else

4513
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:02,880
and then

4514
02:27:00,959 --> 02:27:06,478
i've got my imac

4515
02:27:02,879 --> 02:27:08,879
and then egpu and then windows pc the

4516
02:27:06,478 --> 02:27:11,119
reason i moved to mac was uh it's it's

4517
02:27:08,879 --> 02:27:13,119
got a linux prompt or no sorry it's got

4518
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:17,120
a unique it's got a unix prompt so i can

4519
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:18,960
do all my stuff but then um i uh i don't

4520
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:20,800
have to worry like when i'm presenting

4521
02:27:18,959 --> 02:27:23,438
for clients or investors or whatever

4522
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:26,079
like it i don't have to worry about

4523
02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:27,359
any like acpi related f sick things in

4524
02:27:26,079 --> 02:27:29,039
the middle of a presentation like none

4525
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:32,000
of that it just it will always wake from

4526
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:34,160
sleep um and it won't colonel panic on

4527
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:35,840
me and this is not a dig against linux

4528
02:27:34,159 --> 02:27:37,600
except that

4529
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:38,880
i just um

4530
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,720
i feel really bad i feel like a traitor

4531
02:27:38,879 --> 02:27:42,799
to my community saying this right but in

4532
02:27:40,719 --> 02:27:44,959
2012 i was just like okay started my own

4533
02:27:42,799 --> 02:27:47,599
company what did i get and linux laptops

4534
02:27:44,959 --> 02:27:49,199
were just not quite there um yes and so

4535
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:51,280
i've just stuck with max can i just

4536
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:54,720
defend something that nobody respectable

4537
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:57,280
seems to do which is uh so i i do a boot

4538
02:27:54,719 --> 02:28:00,318
on linux windows but in windows

4539
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:02,880
i have uh windows subsystems for linux

4540
02:28:00,318 --> 02:28:05,680
or whatever ws api

4541
02:28:02,879 --> 02:28:07,438
and i find myself being able to handle

4542
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:09,600
everything i need in almost everything i

4543
02:28:07,439 --> 02:28:11,280
need in linux for basic sort of tasks

4544
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:12,960
scripting tasks within wsl and it

4545
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:14,800
creates a really nice environment so

4546
02:28:12,959 --> 02:28:17,839
i've been but like whenever i hang out

4547
02:28:14,799 --> 02:28:20,559
with like especially important people

4548
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:21,760
like they're all on an iphone and a mac

4549
02:28:20,559 --> 02:28:22,639
and it's like

4550
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:25,359
yeah

4551
02:28:22,639 --> 02:28:27,840
like what there there is a messiness to

4552
02:28:25,359 --> 02:28:29,840
windows and a messiness to linux that

4553
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:31,760
makes me feel

4554
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:33,520
like you're still in it

4555
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:34,960
well the linux stuff

4556
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:36,720
windows subsystem for linux is very

4557
02:28:34,959 --> 02:28:38,879
tempting but

4558
02:28:36,719 --> 02:28:40,639
there's still the windows on the outside

4559
02:28:38,879 --> 02:28:42,879
where i don't know where and i've been

4560
02:28:40,639 --> 02:28:45,599
okay i've been i've i've used dos since

4561
02:28:42,879 --> 02:28:48,478
version 1.11 or 1.21 or something so

4562
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:50,479
i've been a long time microsoft user and

4563
02:28:48,478 --> 02:28:52,559
i will say that like

4564
02:28:50,478 --> 02:28:53,840
like it's really hard for me to know

4565
02:28:52,559 --> 02:28:55,279
where anything is how to get to the

4566
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:57,439
details behind something when something

4567
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:59,280
screws up as invariably does

4568
02:28:57,439 --> 02:29:01,040
and just things like changing group

4569
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:02,640
permissions on some shared folders and

4570
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:04,560
stuff just everything seems a little bit

4571
02:29:02,639 --> 02:29:06,318
more awkward more clicks than it needs

4572
02:29:04,559 --> 02:29:07,680
to be

4573
02:29:06,318 --> 02:29:08,799
not to say there aren't weird things

4574
02:29:07,680 --> 02:29:12,239
like hidden attributes and all those

4575
02:29:08,799 --> 02:29:13,920
other happy stuff on on uh on mac but

4576
02:29:12,239 --> 02:29:15,280
for the most part um

4577
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:16,639
and and well actually especially now

4578
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:18,000
with the new hardware coming out on mac

4579
02:29:16,639 --> 02:29:19,439
it'll be very interesting you know with

4580
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:21,120
the new m1

4581
02:29:19,439 --> 02:29:22,720
um there were some dark years the last

4582
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:25,040
few years when i was like i think maybe

4583
02:29:22,719 --> 02:29:26,478
i have to move off of mac as a platform

4584
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:28,479
but

4585
02:29:26,478 --> 02:29:30,000
i mean like my keyboard was just not

4586
02:29:28,478 --> 02:29:31,840
working like literally my keyboard just

4587
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:33,439
wasn't working right i had this touch

4588
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:35,600
bar didn't have a physical escape button

4589
02:29:33,439 --> 02:29:37,600
like i needed to because i used vim and

4590
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:39,359
now i think we're back so yeah so you

4591
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:42,559
use vim and you have a what kind of

4592
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:44,720
keyboard so i use the realforce 87u

4593
02:29:42,559 --> 02:29:46,159
uh it's a mechanical as a topra key

4594
02:29:44,719 --> 02:29:48,719
switch it's a weird shape there's a

4595
02:29:46,159 --> 02:29:48,719
normal shape

4596
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:53,040
i say that because i use a kinesis and i

4597
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:54,319
had right you said some dark you said

4598
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:56,800
you had dark

4599
02:29:54,318 --> 02:29:58,478
moments i've i've i've recently had a

4600
02:29:56,799 --> 02:30:00,159
dark moment like what am i doing with my

4601
02:29:58,478 --> 02:30:02,398
life i remember

4602
02:30:00,159 --> 02:30:03,680
sort of flying in a very kind of tight

4603
02:30:02,398 --> 02:30:06,000
space and

4604
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:08,720
as i'm working this is what i do on an

4605
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:10,398
airplane i pull out a laptop and on top

4606
02:30:08,719 --> 02:30:12,079
of the laptop i'll put a kinesis

4607
02:30:10,398 --> 02:30:14,159
keyboard that's hardcore man i was

4608
02:30:12,079 --> 02:30:16,000
thinking is this who i am is this what

4609
02:30:14,159 --> 02:30:17,600
i'm becoming will i be this person

4610
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,559
because i'm on emacs with this kinesis

4611
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:19,439
keyboard

4612
02:30:18,559 --> 02:30:20,559
sitting

4613
02:30:19,439 --> 02:30:23,520
like

4614
02:30:20,559 --> 02:30:26,719
with everybody around emacs on windows

4615
02:30:23,520 --> 02:30:29,120
on the wsl yeah yeah emacs on linux on

4616
02:30:26,719 --> 02:30:30,879
windows yeah on windows and like

4617
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:32,720
everybody around me

4618
02:30:30,879 --> 02:30:34,478
is using their iphone to look at tick

4619
02:30:32,719 --> 02:30:36,799
tock so i'm like in this

4620
02:30:34,478 --> 02:30:39,199
land and i thought you know what maybe i

4621
02:30:36,799 --> 02:30:40,799
need to become an adult and put the 90s

4622
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:43,280
behind me

4623
02:30:40,799 --> 02:30:45,199
and uh use like a normal keyboard and

4624
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:47,120
then i did some soul searching and i

4625
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:48,720
decided like this is who i am this is me

4626
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:50,800
like coming out of the closet to saying

4627
02:30:48,719 --> 02:30:52,639
i'm kinesis keyboard all the way i'm

4628
02:30:50,799 --> 02:30:54,799
going to use emacs

4629
02:30:52,639 --> 02:30:56,879
you know you know also kinesis fan um uh

4630
02:30:54,799 --> 02:30:58,959
uh west mckinney the creative pandas oh

4631
02:30:56,879 --> 02:31:00,159
he he just he banged out pandas on a

4632
02:30:58,959 --> 02:31:02,318
kinesis keyboard i believe i don't know

4633
02:31:00,159 --> 02:31:04,239
if he's still using one maybe but

4634
02:31:02,318 --> 02:31:05,920
certainly 10 years ago like he was if if

4635
02:31:04,239 --> 02:31:08,239
anyone's out there maybe we need to have

4636
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:10,239
a kinesis support group please reach out

4637
02:31:08,239 --> 02:31:14,199
isn't there already one is there one

4638
02:31:10,239 --> 02:31:14,199
there's got to be an rc channel man

4639
02:31:14,318 --> 02:31:17,840
oh no and you access it through emacs

4640
02:31:16,799 --> 02:31:19,840
okay

4641
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:21,520
do you still program these days i do a

4642
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:24,559
little bit um

4643
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:26,640
honestly the last thing i did was um

4644
02:31:24,559 --> 02:31:28,639
i had written i was working with my son

4645
02:31:26,639 --> 02:31:29,680
to script some minecraft stuff so i was

4646
02:31:28,639 --> 02:31:31,840
doing a little bit of that that was the

4647
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:32,880
last literally the last code i

4648
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:34,239
wrote

4649
02:31:32,879 --> 02:31:35,358
oh you know what also i wrote some code

4650
02:31:34,239 --> 02:31:37,199
to do some

4651
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:39,120
cap table evaluation waterfall modeling

4652
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:40,640
kind of stuff

4653
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:43,200
what advice would you give to a young

4654
02:31:40,639 --> 02:31:46,478
person said your son today in high

4655
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:48,399
school maybe even college about career

4656
02:31:46,478 --> 02:31:49,519
about life

4657
02:31:48,398 --> 02:31:51,039
this may be where i get into trouble a

4658
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:53,200
little bit

4659
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:55,200
we are coming to the end

4660
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:56,399
we're we're rapidly entering a time

4661
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:58,800
between worlds

4662
02:31:56,398 --> 02:32:00,719
so we have a world now that's starting

4663
02:31:58,799 --> 02:32:03,039
to really crumble under the weight of

4664
02:32:00,719 --> 02:32:04,478
aging institutions that no longer even

4665
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:05,600
pretend to serve the purposes they were

4666
02:32:04,478 --> 02:32:07,840
created for

4667
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:09,680
we are creating technologies that are

4668
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:12,079
hurtling billions of people headlong

4669
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:13,840
into philosophical crises who they don't

4670
02:32:12,079 --> 02:32:15,120
even know the philosophical operating

4671
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:16,559
systems in their firmware and they're

4672
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:17,760
heading into a time when that gets

4673
02:32:16,559 --> 02:32:18,478
vaporized

4674
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:20,239
so

4675
02:32:18,478 --> 02:32:21,760
for people in high school and certainly

4676
02:32:20,239 --> 02:32:22,959
i tell my son this as well he's in

4677
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:25,359
middle school

4678
02:32:22,959 --> 02:32:28,159
people in college

4679
02:32:25,359 --> 02:32:29,520
you are going to have to find your own

4680
02:32:28,159 --> 02:32:31,119
way

4681
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:33,120
you're going to have to have a pioneer

4682
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:35,520
spirit even if you live

4683
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:37,520
in the middle of the most dense urban

4684
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:41,200
environment

4685
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:43,680
all of human reality around you

4686
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:46,319
is the result of the last few

4687
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:48,398
generations of humans agreeing to play

4688
02:32:46,318 --> 02:32:52,000
certain kinds of games

4689
02:32:48,398 --> 02:32:53,920
a lot of those games no longer

4690
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:55,840
no longer operate according to the rules

4691
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:56,960
they used to

4692
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:58,639
um

4693
02:32:56,959 --> 02:33:01,119
collapse is non-linear but it will be

4694
02:32:58,639 --> 02:33:02,318
managed and so if you are in a

4695
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:04,880
particular

4696
02:33:02,318 --> 02:33:06,559
social caste or economic caste

4697
02:33:04,879 --> 02:33:08,959
and it's it's not

4698
02:33:06,559 --> 02:33:10,799
um i think it's it's not kosher to say

4699
02:33:08,959 --> 02:33:14,159
that about america but america is a very

4700
02:33:10,799 --> 02:33:16,398
stratified and classist society there's

4701
02:33:14,159 --> 02:33:18,478
some mobility but but it's really quite

4702
02:33:16,398 --> 02:33:20,719
classist in america

4703
02:33:18,478 --> 02:33:23,519
unless you're in the upper middle class

4704
02:33:20,719 --> 02:33:26,318
you are headed into very choppy waters

4705
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:28,399
so it is really really good to think and

4706
02:33:26,318 --> 02:33:31,359
understand the fundamentals of what you

4707
02:33:28,398 --> 02:33:34,000
need to build a meaningful life

4708
02:33:31,359 --> 02:33:35,359
for you your loved ones with your family

4709
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:37,359
um

4710
02:33:35,359 --> 02:33:39,439
and almost all of the technology being

4711
02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:41,680
created that's consumer facing

4712
02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:44,479
is designed to own people

4713
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:48,159
to take the four stack you know of

4714
02:33:44,478 --> 02:33:50,159
people to delaminate them and to own

4715
02:33:48,159 --> 02:33:51,439
certain portions of that stack

4716
02:33:50,159 --> 02:33:53,760
and so if you want to be an integral

4717
02:33:51,439 --> 02:33:55,520
human being if you want to have your

4718
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:57,520
agency and you want to

4719
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:59,600
find your own way in the world you know

4720
02:33:57,520 --> 02:34:02,239
when you're young would be a great time

4721
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:04,880
to spend time looking at some of the

4722
02:34:02,239 --> 02:34:06,398
classics around you know what it means

4723
02:34:04,879 --> 02:34:08,000
to live a good life what it means to

4724
02:34:06,398 --> 02:34:10,398
build connection with people

4725
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,359
and so much of the status games so much

4726
02:34:10,398 --> 02:34:12,318
of the

4727
02:34:11,359 --> 02:34:14,079
stuff

4728
02:34:12,318 --> 02:34:16,639
you know one of the things that i sort

4729
02:34:14,079 --> 02:34:18,478
of talk about as we create

4730
02:34:16,639 --> 02:34:19,840
more and more technology

4731
02:34:18,478 --> 02:34:21,279
there's a gradient technology and a

4732
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:23,040
gradient technology always leads to

4733
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:24,399
gradient of power and this is

4734
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:26,319
jacqueline's point to some extent as

4735
02:34:24,398 --> 02:34:28,799
well that gradient of power is not going

4736
02:34:26,318 --> 02:34:29,760
to go away the technologies are going so

4737
02:34:28,799 --> 02:34:31,599
fast

4738
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:33,040
that even people like me who helped

4739
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:34,239
create some of the stuff i'm being left

4740
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:36,000
behind that's on the cutting edge

4741
02:34:34,239 --> 02:34:37,600
research i don't know what's going on in

4742
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,359
gans today you know i go read some

4743
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:41,439
proceedings so

4744
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:43,520
as the world gets more and more

4745
02:34:41,439 --> 02:34:46,318
technological it will create more more

4746
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:48,319
gradients where people will seize

4747
02:34:46,318 --> 02:34:50,239
power economic fortunes

4748
02:34:48,318 --> 02:34:52,559
and the way they make the people who are

4749
02:34:50,239 --> 02:34:55,520
left behind okay with their lot in life

4750
02:34:52,559 --> 02:34:57,439
is they create lottery systems

4751
02:34:55,520 --> 02:35:00,479
they make you

4752
02:34:57,439 --> 02:35:02,000
take part in the narrative of your own

4753
02:35:00,478 --> 02:35:04,159
being trapped in your own

4754
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:06,559
economic sort of zone

4755
02:35:04,159 --> 02:35:08,799
so avoiding those kinds of things

4756
02:35:06,559 --> 02:35:10,639
is really important knowing when someone

4757
02:35:08,799 --> 02:35:11,679
is running game on you basically

4758
02:35:10,639 --> 02:35:13,199
so these are the things i would tell

4759
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:15,760
young people it's a dark message but

4760
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:17,920
it's realism i mean it's what i see

4761
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:19,760
so after you gave some realism you sit

4762
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:21,680
back you sit back with your son you're

4763
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:22,800
looking out of the sunset

4764
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:24,079
what

4765
02:35:22,799 --> 02:35:27,840
to him

4766
02:35:24,079 --> 02:35:30,639
can you give as words of hope and to you

4767
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:32,719
from where do you derive hope for the

4768
02:35:30,639 --> 02:35:34,318
future of our world so you said at the

4769
02:35:32,719 --> 02:35:36,318
individual level you have to have a

4770
02:35:34,318 --> 02:35:38,639
pioneer mindset

4771
02:35:36,318 --> 02:35:40,719
to go back to the classics to understand

4772
02:35:38,639 --> 02:35:43,519
what is in human nature you can find

4773
02:35:40,719 --> 02:35:44,879
meaning but at the societal level

4774
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:46,479
what's your jacket when you look at

4775
02:35:44,879 --> 02:35:47,279
possible trajectories what gives you

4776
02:35:46,478 --> 02:35:49,760
hope

4777
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:51,359
what gives me hope is that

4778
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:52,719
we have little

4779
02:35:51,359 --> 02:35:55,040
tremors now

4780
02:35:52,719 --> 02:35:56,398
shaking people out of the reverie of the

4781
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:58,000
fiction of modernity that they've been

4782
02:35:56,398 --> 02:36:00,478
living in kind of a late 20th century

4783
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:02,799
style modernity um

4784
02:36:00,478 --> 02:36:04,639
that's that's good i think

4785
02:36:02,799 --> 02:36:06,478
because um

4786
02:36:04,639 --> 02:36:07,599
and also to your point earlier people

4787
02:36:06,478 --> 02:36:08,719
are burning out on some of the social

4788
02:36:07,600 --> 02:36:10,318
media stuff they're sort of seeing the

4789
02:36:08,719 --> 02:36:12,559
ugly side especially the latest news

4790
02:36:10,318 --> 02:36:14,000
with uh facebook and the whistleblower

4791
02:36:12,559 --> 02:36:15,600
right it's quite clear

4792
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:17,200
these things are not

4793
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:19,600
all they're cracked up to be so do you

4794
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:21,200
believe like i believe better social

4795
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:23,680
media can be built because they are

4796
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:25,439
burning out they'll incentivize other

4797
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:27,520
competitors to be built do you think

4798
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:30,720
that's possible well the thing about it

4799
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:32,399
is that um when you have extractive

4800
02:36:30,719 --> 02:36:33,358
return on returns

4801
02:36:32,398 --> 02:36:35,279
um

4802
02:36:33,359 --> 02:36:36,880
you know capital coming in and saying

4803
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:38,880
look you own a network give me some

4804
02:36:36,879 --> 02:36:39,920
exponential dynamics out of this network

4805
02:36:38,879 --> 02:36:41,519
what are you going to do you're going to

4806
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:43,760
just basically put a toll keeper at

4807
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:46,239
every single node and every single

4808
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:47,920
graph uh edge every node every vertex

4809
02:36:46,239 --> 02:36:49,760
every edge

4810
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:51,200
but if you don't have that need for it

4811
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:53,120
if no one's sitting there saying hey

4812
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:54,880
wikipedia monetize every every character

4813
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:56,640
every byte every phrase

4814
02:36:54,879 --> 02:36:58,239
then generative human dynamics will

4815
02:36:56,639 --> 02:37:00,239
naturally sort of arise

4816
02:36:58,239 --> 02:37:02,959
assuming we do we respect a few

4817
02:37:00,239 --> 02:37:04,719
principles around online communications

4818
02:37:02,959 --> 02:37:06,959
so the greatest and biggest social

4819
02:37:04,719 --> 02:37:10,639
network in the world is still like email

4820
02:37:06,959 --> 02:37:12,559
sms right yes so we're fine there the

4821
02:37:10,639 --> 02:37:14,079
issue with the social media as we call

4822
02:37:12,559 --> 02:37:16,559
it now is they're all they're actually

4823
02:37:14,079 --> 02:37:17,840
just new amplification systems right now

4824
02:37:16,559 --> 02:37:20,398
it's benefit to certain people like

4825
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:23,200
yourself who have interesting content um

4826
02:37:20,398 --> 02:37:24,559
to to to to be amplified um so let's

4827
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:25,520
create a creator economy and that's

4828
02:37:24,559 --> 02:37:27,920
that's cool there's a lot of great

4829
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:29,760
content out there but giving everyone a

4830
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:31,920
shot at the fame lottery saying hey you

4831
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:33,920
could also have your if you wiggle your

4832
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:35,920
butt the right way on tick tock you

4833
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:38,000
could have your 15 seconds of microfame

4834
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:40,239
that's not healthy for society at large

4835
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:41,600
so i think if we can create tools that

4836
02:37:40,239 --> 02:37:43,359
help people

4837
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:45,040
be

4838
02:37:43,359 --> 02:37:47,200
conscientious about their attention

4839
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:49,680
spend time looking at the past and

4840
02:37:47,200 --> 02:37:51,359
really retrieving memory and culling not

4841
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:52,398
calling but processing and thinking

4842
02:37:51,359 --> 02:37:54,960
about

4843
02:37:52,398 --> 02:37:57,358
that i think that's certainly possible

4844
02:37:54,959 --> 02:37:58,559
and hopefully that's what we get um so

4845
02:37:57,359 --> 02:37:59,760
i'm so

4846
02:37:58,559 --> 02:38:01,279
the bigger picture the bigger question

4847
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:02,318
about uh you're asking about what gives

4848
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:03,439
me hope

4849
02:38:02,318 --> 02:38:06,079
is that

4850
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:08,159
um these early shocks of you know

4851
02:38:06,079 --> 02:38:10,959
coveted lockdowns

4852
02:38:08,159 --> 02:38:12,159
and remote work and all these different

4853
02:38:10,959 --> 02:38:13,358
kinds of things i think it's getting

4854
02:38:12,159 --> 02:38:15,600
people to

4855
02:38:13,359 --> 02:38:17,680
a point where

4856
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:19,840
they are look they're they're sort of

4857
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:21,600
no longer in the reverie right as my

4858
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:23,760
friend jim rutt says there's more people

4859
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:25,120
with ears to hear now right with

4860
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:27,040
pandemic

4861
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:28,240
and education everyone's like wait wait

4862
02:38:27,040 --> 02:38:30,080
what have you guys been doing with my

4863
02:38:28,239 --> 02:38:31,359
kids like how are you teaching them that

4864
02:38:30,079 --> 02:38:33,280
what is this crap you're giving them his

4865
02:38:31,359 --> 02:38:35,040
homework right so i think these are the

4866
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:36,720
kinds of things that are getting

4867
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:38,319
um in the supply chain disruptions

4868
02:38:36,719 --> 02:38:40,159
getting more people to think about how

4869
02:38:38,318 --> 02:38:42,799
do we actually just make stuff

4870
02:38:40,159 --> 02:38:44,799
this is all good

4871
02:38:42,799 --> 02:38:47,438
but the concern is that

4872
02:38:44,799 --> 02:38:49,358
it's still going to take a while for

4873
02:38:47,439 --> 02:38:50,880
these things for people to learn how to

4874
02:38:49,359 --> 02:38:51,760
be agentic again

4875
02:38:50,879 --> 02:38:53,438
um

4876
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:55,680
and to be in right relationship with

4877
02:38:53,439 --> 02:38:57,200
each other and with the world

4878
02:38:55,680 --> 02:38:59,200
so the the message of hope is still

4879
02:38:57,200 --> 02:39:00,319
people are resilient and we're build we

4880
02:38:59,200 --> 02:39:02,880
are building some really amazing

4881
02:39:00,318 --> 02:39:04,959
technology and i also like to me i

4882
02:39:02,879 --> 02:39:08,000
derive a lot of hope from

4883
02:39:04,959 --> 02:39:10,879
from individuals in that van

4884
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:12,639
the power of a single individual to uh

4885
02:39:10,879 --> 02:39:14,478
transform the world to do positive

4886
02:39:12,639 --> 02:39:16,239
things for the world is quite incredible

4887
02:39:14,478 --> 02:39:17,840
now you've been talking about it's nice

4888
02:39:16,239 --> 02:39:20,318
to have as many of those individuals as

4889
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:21,840
possible right but even the power of one

4890
02:39:20,318 --> 02:39:23,519
is kind of magical

4891
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:24,398
it is it is we're in a mode now where we

4892
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:26,479
can do that

4893
02:39:24,398 --> 02:39:28,639
i think also you know part of what i try

4894
02:39:26,478 --> 02:39:29,920
to do is in coming to podcasts like

4895
02:39:28,639 --> 02:39:31,760
yours and then you know spamming with

4896
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:34,079
all this philosophical stuff that i've

4897
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:37,120
got going on um there are a lot of good

4898
02:39:34,079 --> 02:39:40,959
people out there trying to put um words

4899
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:43,120
around the current technological social

4900
02:39:40,959 --> 02:39:44,559
economic crises that we're facing

4901
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:45,840
in the space of a few short years i

4902
02:39:44,559 --> 02:39:47,680
think there has been a lot of great

4903
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:49,439
content produced around this stuff for

4904
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:51,200
people who want to see

4905
02:39:49,439 --> 02:39:53,200
want to find out more or think more

4906
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:55,359
about this um we're popularizing certain

4907
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:56,720
kinds of philosophical ideas that uh

4908
02:39:55,359 --> 02:39:58,159
move people beyond just the oh you're

4909
02:39:56,719 --> 02:40:00,079
communist oh your capitalist kind of

4910
02:39:58,159 --> 02:40:01,119
stuff like it's sort of we're way past

4911
02:40:00,079 --> 02:40:01,920
that now

4912
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:03,600
so

4913
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:05,760
um that also gives me hope that i feel

4914
02:40:03,600 --> 02:40:07,280
like i myself am getting a handle on how

4915
02:40:05,760 --> 02:40:08,239
to think about these things

4916
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:09,760
um

4917
02:40:08,239 --> 02:40:11,039
it makes me feel like i can you know

4918
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:12,398
hopefully affect

4919
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:14,720
change for the better

4920
02:40:12,398 --> 02:40:16,398
we've been sneaking up on this question

4921
02:40:14,719 --> 02:40:18,799
all over the place let me ask the big

4922
02:40:16,398 --> 02:40:21,519
ridiculous question what is the meaning

4923
02:40:18,799 --> 02:40:23,759
of life wow

4924
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:26,960
um

4925
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:26,960
the meaning of life

4926
02:40:28,719 --> 02:40:32,398
yeah i don't know i mean that i've never

4927
02:40:30,559 --> 02:40:34,639
really understood that question when you

4928
02:40:32,398 --> 02:40:38,000
say meaning crisis

4929
02:40:34,639 --> 02:40:39,760
you're you're saying that there is

4930
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:41,200
a search

4931
02:40:39,760 --> 02:40:43,439
for a kind of

4932
02:40:41,200 --> 02:40:46,319
experience that's

4933
02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:48,960
could be described as fulfillment as

4934
02:40:46,318 --> 02:40:51,039
like the ah like the aha moment of just

4935
02:40:48,959 --> 02:40:53,199
like joy and

4936
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:54,720
maybe when you see something beautiful

4937
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:58,000
or maybe you have created something

4938
02:40:54,719 --> 02:41:00,318
beautiful that experience that you get

4939
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:02,478
it feels like

4940
02:41:00,318 --> 02:41:03,920
it all makes sense

4941
02:41:02,478 --> 02:41:05,519
so some of that is just chemicals coming

4942
02:41:03,920 --> 02:41:06,398
together in your mind and all kinds of

4943
02:41:05,520 --> 02:41:07,279
things

4944
02:41:06,398 --> 02:41:08,799
but

4945
02:41:07,279 --> 02:41:10,560
it seems like we're building a

4946
02:41:08,799 --> 02:41:12,799
sophisticated

4947
02:41:10,559 --> 02:41:15,359
uh collective intelligence that's

4948
02:41:12,799 --> 02:41:17,039
providing meaning in all kinds of ways

4949
02:41:15,359 --> 02:41:17,840
it's it's members

4950
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:18,560
and

4951
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:20,960
it

4952
02:41:18,559 --> 02:41:21,840
there's a theme to that meaning so for

4953
02:41:20,959 --> 02:41:23,679
for

4954
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:24,799
a lot of history i think

4955
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:27,600
faith

4956
02:41:24,799 --> 02:41:29,519
played an important role uh faith in god

4957
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:32,960
as a religion

4958
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:35,040
i think technology in the modern era is

4959
02:41:32,959 --> 02:41:36,799
kind of serving a little bit of a source

4960
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:39,520
of meaning for people like innovation of

4961
02:41:36,799 --> 02:41:39,519
different kinds

4962
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:43,359
i think the old school

4963
02:41:41,359 --> 02:41:45,760
things of love

4964
02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:47,520
and the basics of just being good at

4965
02:41:45,760 --> 02:41:48,559
stuff

4966
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:50,159
but

4967
02:41:48,559 --> 02:41:52,799
you were a physicist

4968
02:41:50,159 --> 02:41:54,398
so there's a desire to say okay yeah but

4969
02:41:52,799 --> 02:41:56,239
these seem to be like symptoms of

4970
02:41:54,398 --> 02:41:58,239
something deeper

4971
02:41:56,239 --> 02:42:00,079
right like why little meaning what's

4972
02:41:58,239 --> 02:42:02,959
capital m yeah what's capital i'm

4973
02:42:00,079 --> 02:42:06,799
meaning why are we reaching for order

4974
02:42:02,959 --> 02:42:09,199
when there is excess of energy

4975
02:42:06,799 --> 02:42:10,719
i don't know if i can answer the why

4976
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:13,520
any y that i come up with i think is

4977
02:42:10,719 --> 02:42:15,119
gonna be um

4978
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:16,880
i i'd have to think about that a little

4979
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:19,200
more maybe maybe get back to you on that

4980
02:42:16,879 --> 02:42:21,438
but i will say this

4981
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:23,040
we do look at the world through

4982
02:42:21,439 --> 02:42:24,880
a traditional i think most people look

4983
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:26,800
at the world through what i would say is

4984
02:42:24,879 --> 02:42:29,519
a subject object kind of a metaphysical

4985
02:42:26,799 --> 02:42:31,199
lens that we have our own subjectivity

4986
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:32,479
and then there's

4987
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:34,720
there's all of these

4988
02:42:32,478 --> 02:42:36,639
object things that are not us so i'm i'm

4989
02:42:34,719 --> 02:42:38,079
me and this is these things are not me

4990
02:42:36,639 --> 02:42:40,478
right and i'm interacting with them i'm

4991
02:42:38,079 --> 02:42:42,398
doing things to them but a different

4992
02:42:40,478 --> 02:42:44,159
view of the world that looks at it as

4993
02:42:42,398 --> 02:42:46,959
much more connected

4994
02:42:44,159 --> 02:42:48,159
that realizes oh i'm

4995
02:42:46,959 --> 02:42:50,478
i'm really

4996
02:42:48,159 --> 02:42:51,920
quite embedded in a soup of other things

4997
02:42:50,478 --> 02:42:53,920
and i'm simply

4998
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:55,680
um almost like a standing wave pattern

4999
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:56,478
of different things right

5000
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:58,079
um

5001
02:42:56,478 --> 02:42:59,679
so when you look at the world in that

5002
02:42:58,079 --> 02:43:02,159
kind of connected sense i

5003
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:03,920
i i've recently taken

5004
02:43:02,159 --> 02:43:05,600
a shine to this particular thought

5005
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:08,559
experiment which is

5006
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:09,920
what if it was the case

5007
02:43:08,559 --> 02:43:12,239
that

5008
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:14,079
everything that we touch with our hands

5009
02:43:12,239 --> 02:43:16,239
that we pay attention to that we

5010
02:43:14,079 --> 02:43:18,478
actually give intimacy to

5011
02:43:16,239 --> 02:43:22,079
what if there's actually

5012
02:43:18,478 --> 02:43:22,719
you know all the mumbo-jumbo like you

5013
02:43:22,079 --> 02:43:24,398
know

5014
02:43:22,719 --> 02:43:25,679
people with the magnetic healing

5015
02:43:24,398 --> 02:43:28,159
crystals and all this other kind of

5016
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:30,159
stuff and quantum energy stuff

5017
02:43:28,159 --> 02:43:32,239
what if that was a thing

5018
02:43:30,159 --> 02:43:34,559
what if when you literally when your

5019
02:43:32,239 --> 02:43:36,000
hand touches an object when you really

5020
02:43:34,559 --> 02:43:37,439
look at something and you concentrate

5021
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,879
and you focus on it and you really give

5022
02:43:37,439 --> 02:43:41,359
it attention

5023
02:43:38,879 --> 02:43:43,278
you actually give it there is some

5024
02:43:41,359 --> 02:43:45,520
physical residue

5025
02:43:43,279 --> 02:43:47,600
of something a part of you

5026
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:48,399
a bit of your life force that goes into

5027
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:50,479
it

5028
02:43:48,398 --> 02:43:52,000
okay now this is of course completely

5029
02:43:50,478 --> 02:43:54,159
mumbo jumbo stuff this is not like i

5030
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:56,000
don't actually think this is real but

5031
02:43:54,159 --> 02:43:57,520
let's do the thought experiment what if

5032
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:59,439
it was

5033
02:43:57,520 --> 02:44:01,840
what if there actually was

5034
02:43:59,439 --> 02:44:04,318
some the quantum magnetic crystal and

5035
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:07,040
you know energy field thing that just by

5036
02:44:04,318 --> 02:44:08,879
touching this can this can has

5037
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:10,399
changed a little bit somehow

5038
02:44:08,879 --> 02:44:12,000
and it's not much

5039
02:44:10,398 --> 02:44:14,159
unless you put a lot into it and you

5040
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,879
touch it all the time like your phone

5041
02:44:14,159 --> 02:44:16,799
right

5042
02:44:14,879 --> 02:44:18,719
these things gained they gave meaning to

5043
02:44:16,799 --> 02:44:19,519
you a little bit

5044
02:44:18,719 --> 02:44:21,760
um

5045
02:44:19,520 --> 02:44:23,359
but what if there's something

5046
02:44:21,760 --> 02:44:24,478
that

5047
02:44:23,359 --> 02:44:26,399
technical objects the phone is a

5048
02:44:24,478 --> 02:44:27,599
technical object it does not really

5049
02:44:26,398 --> 02:44:29,599
receive

5050
02:44:27,600 --> 02:44:32,079
attention or intimacy and then allow

5051
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:34,000
itself to be transformed by it but if

5052
02:44:32,079 --> 02:44:37,680
it's a piece of wood if it's the handle

5053
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:40,318
of a knife that your mother used for 20

5054
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:41,680
years to make dinner for you right

5055
02:44:40,318 --> 02:44:44,000
what if it's

5056
02:44:41,680 --> 02:44:46,559
a keyboard that you banged out your

5057
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:47,920
world transforming software library on

5058
02:44:46,559 --> 02:44:49,439
these are technical objects and these

5059
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:51,520
are physical objects but

5060
02:44:49,439 --> 02:44:53,520
somehow there's something to them we

5061
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:55,920
feel an attraction to these objects as

5062
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:58,000
if we have imbued them with life energy

5063
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:59,279
yeah right so if you walk that thought

5064
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,879
experiment through what happens when we

5065
02:44:59,279 --> 02:45:03,040
touch another person when we hug them

5066
02:45:00,879 --> 02:45:04,559
when we hold them

5067
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:06,960
and it

5068
02:45:04,559 --> 02:45:10,719
the the reason this ties into my answer

5069
02:45:06,959 --> 02:45:10,719
for your question is that um

5070
02:45:11,279 --> 02:45:14,079
there's

5071
02:45:12,239 --> 02:45:15,920
if there is such a thing if we were to

5072
02:45:14,079 --> 02:45:17,359
hypothesize uh you know hypothetically

5073
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:18,398
it's such a thing

5074
02:45:17,359 --> 02:45:19,760
um

5075
02:45:18,398 --> 02:45:20,879
it could be

5076
02:45:19,760 --> 02:45:23,359
that

5077
02:45:20,879 --> 02:45:26,318
the purpose of our lives

5078
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:29,720
is to imbue as many things with that

5079
02:45:26,318 --> 02:45:29,719
love as possible

5080
02:45:30,559 --> 02:45:35,278
that's a that's a beautiful answer and a

5081
02:45:32,879 --> 02:45:38,239
beautiful way to end it peter uh you're

5082
02:45:35,279 --> 02:45:41,439
an incredible person thank you spanning

5083
02:45:38,239 --> 02:45:43,840
so much in the space of engineering

5084
02:45:41,439 --> 02:45:44,639
and in the space of philosophy

5085
02:45:43,840 --> 02:45:47,279
i

5086
02:45:44,639 --> 02:45:48,959
i'm uh really proud to be living in the

5087
02:45:47,279 --> 02:45:51,279
same city

5088
02:45:48,959 --> 02:45:52,639
and uh i'm really grateful that you

5089
02:45:51,279 --> 02:45:53,760
would spend your valuable time with me

5090
02:45:52,639 --> 02:45:55,039
today thank you well thank you i

5091
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:56,398
appreciate the opportunity to speak with

5092
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:57,520
you

5093
02:45:56,398 --> 02:45:59,519
thanks for listening to this

5094
02:45:57,520 --> 02:46:01,279
conversation with peter wang to support

5095
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:04,319
this podcast please check out our

5096
02:46:01,279 --> 02:46:06,000
sponsors in the description and now let

5097
02:46:04,318 --> 02:46:07,760
me leave you with some words from peter

5098
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:09,760
wang himself

5099
02:46:07,760 --> 02:46:12,318
we tend to think of people as either

5100
02:46:09,760 --> 02:46:15,120
malicious or incompetent

5101
02:46:12,318 --> 02:46:17,680
but in a world filled with corruptable

5102
02:46:15,120 --> 02:46:19,040
and unchecked institutions there exists

5103
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:21,680
a third thing

5104
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:24,720
malicious incompetence it's a social

5105
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:26,800
cancer and it only appears once human

5106
02:46:24,719 --> 02:46:28,639
organizations scale beyond personal

5107
02:46:26,799 --> 02:46:30,398
accountability

5108
02:46:28,639 --> 02:46:34,119
thank you for listening and hope to see

5109
02:46:30,398 --> 02:46:34,119
you next time

5110
02:46:40,079 --> 02:46:42,159
you
