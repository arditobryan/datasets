1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,279
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,080
eric weinstein

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:06,798
his fourth time on the podcast both

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,359
sadness

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,080
and hope run through his heart and his

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,160
mind

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,599
and the result is a complicated

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,800
brilliant human being

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,960
who i am fortunate to call a friend

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,160
quick mention of our sponsors indeed

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,800
hiring site

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,719
theragun muscle recovery device wine

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,839
access online wine store

14
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,518
and blinkist app that summarizes books

15
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,920
click the sponsor links to get a

16
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,558
discount and to support this podcast

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,200
as a side note let me ask that whenever

18
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,039
we touch

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,200
difficult topics in this or other

20
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,320
conversations that you listen with an

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,120
open mind

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
and forgive me or the guest for a

23
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,799
misstep and an

24
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,238
imperfectly thought out statement to

25
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,320
have any chance of truth

26
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,279
i think we have to take risks and make

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,359
mistakes

28
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
in conversation and then learn from

29
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,399
those mistakes

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,079
please try not to close your mind and

31
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,799
heart to others because of a single

32
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,198
sentence

33
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,238
or an expression of an idea try to

34
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:03,280
assume that the people in this

35
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,158
conversation

36
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
or just people in general are good but

37
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,760
not perfect

38
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,680
and far from it but always striving to

39
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,040
add a bit more love into the world

40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,680
in whatever way we know how if you enjoy

41
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,759

46
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,879
and now here's my conversation with eric

47
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,798
weinstein you often talk about getting

48
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,920
off this planet

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:39,520
and i think you don't often talk

50
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,040
about extraterrestrial life intelligent

51
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,560
life out there

52
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,240
do you wonder about this kind of thing

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,960
about intelligent civilizations out

54
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,280
there

55
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,559
i do but i try to not wonder about it in

56
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,239
a particular way

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,000
um in a certain sense i do find that

58
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,759
speculating about bigfoot in the loch

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,680
ness monster and space aliens

60
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,359
is kind of a recreation for when things

61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,680
aren't going very well

62
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,438
uh at least it gives us some meaning and

63
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,320
purpose in our lives

64
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,560
so i worry about you for example the

65
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,478
simulation hypothesis is taking over

66
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,239
from religion you can't quite believe

67
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,520
enough to go to church or synagogue or

68
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,439
the mosque

69
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,719
on the weekend so then you just take up

70
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,159
an interest in

71
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,840
in the simulation theory because that's

72
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,878
something like what you do for your job

73
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,520
coding

74
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,318
i do think that in some sense the issue

75
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,800
of aliens

76
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,318
is a really interesting one but has been

77
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,239
spoiled by too much

78
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:36,000
sort of recreational escapism

79
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,878
the key question that i find is

80
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,080
let's assume that it is possible to look

81
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,000
at the night sky

82
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,599
and see all of these distant worlds and

83
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,039
then go visit them

84
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,598
if that is possible it's almost

85
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:51,280
certainly possible through some

86
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:53,679
uh as yet uh unknown or

87
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,439
not accepted theory of physics beyond

88
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,519
einstein

89
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,318
and i mean it doesn't have to be that

90
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,200
way but probably is

91
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,079
if that theory exists there would be a

92
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,759
percentage

93
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,440
of the worlds that have life and sort of

94
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,399
a drake equation kind of a way

95
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,400
that would have encountered the ability

96
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,680
to escape

97
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,560
soon enough after unlocking the power

98
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,480
of the atom at a minimum and whatever

99
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,800
they have that is probably analogous to

100
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,840
the cell

101
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,040
on that world so assuming

102
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,120
that life is a fairly generic thing that

103
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,560
arises

104
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,239
probably not carbon-based probably

105
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,519
doesn't have dna but

106
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,878
that something that fits the pattern of

107
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,319
uh darwinian theory which is

108
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:45,359
descent with variation um differential

109
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:46,878
success

110
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,560
and thereby constantly improving and so

111
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,878
on that through

112
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,479
time there will be a trajectory where

113
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,399
there'll be something increasingly

114
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,399
complex and fascinating and beautiful

115
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,799
like us humans but much more

116
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,519
they can also off gas whatever entropy

117
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,719
it creates

118
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,200
to give an illusion that you're

119
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,598
defeating thermodynamics right so

120
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,039
whatever

121
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,199
whatever these things are probably has

122
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,759
an analog of the bilipid layer

123
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,518
so that cells can get rid of the chaos

124
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,719
on one side of the barrier and keep

125
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,879
order on the other

126
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,879
whatever these things are that create

127
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,719
life assuming that there is a theory to

128
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,759
be found that allows

129
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,800
that civilization to diversify

130
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,040
um we would have to imagine that

131
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
such a civilization might have taken an

132
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,479
interest

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,399
in its concept of the universe and have

134
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,519
come here

135
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,120
they would come here they would have a

136
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,799
deep understanding of the physics of the

137
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,280
universe sufficient to

138
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
have arrived here well there's two

139
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,000
questions whether they could arrive

140
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,680
physically and whether their

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,918
information could be sent here

142
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,680
and whether they could gain information

143
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,198
from us it's possible

144
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,959
that they would have a way of looking

145
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,560
into our world without actually reaching

146
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,000
it i don't know

147
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,839
but yes if my hope which is that we can

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,478
escape this world

149
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,599
is can be realized if that's if that's

150
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,439
feasible

151
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,039
then you would have to imagine that the

152
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:15,120
reverse is true and that

153
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:17,439
somebody else should be here

154
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,959
first of all i want to say this my

155
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,519
purpose when i come on

156
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,719
to your show and i reframe the questions

157
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,680
is not

158
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,199
to challenge you i can sit inside all of

159
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,959
those it's to give you better audio and

160
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,800
video because i think we've been on an

161
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,519
incredible role i really love what you

162
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,079
do and so i am trying to honor you by

163
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,000
being

164
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,439
as disagreeable about frame breaking as

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,720
possible i think some of your listeners

166
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,560
don't understand

167
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,160
that it's actually a sign of respect as

168
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,319
opposed to some sort of a

169
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,520
complex dynamic which is i think you can

170
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,199
play outside

171
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,560
of some of the frames and that these are

172
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,319
sort of offerings to get the

173
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,839
conversation started so let me try to

174
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,319
break that frame and give you something

175
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,239
different

176
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:59,279
beautiful i think what's going on here

177
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,439
is that i can prove

178
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,119
effectively that we're not thinking

179
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,639
about this in very deep terms

180
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,959
as soon as i say we've got to get off

181
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,800
this planet the number of people who

182
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,120
assume that i'm talking about faster

183
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,520
than light travel

184
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,478
is very high and faster than light

185
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,719
travel

186
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:20,318
assumes some sort of einsteinian

187
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,560
paradigm that then is broken

188
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,439
by some small adjustment and i think

189
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,079
that

190
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,639
that's fascinating it shows me that our

191
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,439
failure to imagine what could be being

192
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,120
said

193
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:35,680
is profound we don't have an idea

194
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,560
of all of the different different ways

195
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,478
in which

196
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,038
we might be able to visit distant worlds

197
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,279
all we think about is okay it must be it

198
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,199
must be einsteinian space times

199
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,198
and then some means of exceeding the

200
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,879
speed limit and it's just

201
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,759
it's fascinating to me that we don't

202
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,759
really have

203
00:06:53,918 --> 00:07:00,478
we've lost the ability to just realize

204
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,680
we don't know the framework and what is

205
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:02,639
what does it even mean so one of the

206
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,478
things i think about

207
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,720
a lot is worlds with more than one

208
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,560
temporal dimension

209
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,720
it's very hard to think about one more

210
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,839
than one temporal dimension

211
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,720
so that's a really strong mental

212
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,719
exercise

213
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000
of breaking the framework in which we

214
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,199
think because uh

215
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,279
most of the frameworks would have a

216
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,879
single temporal dimension right well

217
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,399
first of all most of the frameworks in

218
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,918
which we think would have no temporal

219
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,519
dimension and have pure

220
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,038
like in mathematics the differential

221
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,879
geometry that

222
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:35,279
riemann came up with in the 1800s

223
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,000
we don't usually talk about what we

224
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,478
would call split signature metrics

225
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,399
or lorentzian signature in fact if it

226
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:42,719
weren't for relativity this would be the

227
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,079
most

228
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,240
obscure topic out there almost all the

229
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,399
work we do is an euclidean signature and

230
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,560
then there's this one freakish case of

231
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,799
relativity theory in physics that uses

232
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,879
this one time and the rest spatial

233
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,520
dimensions

234
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,280
fascinating so it's usually momentary

235
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,519
and just looking at space

236
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,478
yes you know we have these three kinds

237
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,399
of

238
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,000
uh equations that are very important to

239
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,519
us we have elliptic

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,160
hyperbolic and parabolic right and so

241
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,758
the idea is

242
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,479
if if i'm chewing gum after eating

243
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,479
garlic bread

244
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,840
when i open my mouth and i've got

245
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,478
chewing gum between my lips

246
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,959
maybe it's going to form an elliptic

247
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,120
object called a minimal surface

248
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,639
then when i pop that and blow through it

249
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,918
you're going to hear a noise that's

250
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,080
going to travel to you by a wave

251
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,598
equation which is going to be hyperbolic

252
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,038
but then the garlic breath is going to

253
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,000
diffuse towards you and you're

254
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,838
eventually going to be very

255
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,918
upset with me according to a heat

256
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,480
equation which will be parabolic

257
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,159
so those are the three basic paradigms

258
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,320
for most of the work that we do

259
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,240
and a lot of the work that we do in

260
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,600
mathematics is elliptic

261
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,200
whereas the physicists are in the

262
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,959
hyperbolic case and i don't even know

263
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,720
what to do about more than one temporal

264
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,759
dimension because i think almost no one

265
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,240
studies that

266
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,000
i can't believe you just captured uh

267
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,080
much of modern physics

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,919
in the example of chewing gum i have an

269
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,240
off-color one which i chose not to share

270
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,719
but

271
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,720
hopefully the kids at home can imagine

272
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,719
okay so okay that is the place where we

273
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,320
come from

274
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,320
now if we want to arrive at a

275
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,080
possibility of breaking the frameworks

276
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,720
at with two versus zero temporal

277
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,160
dimensions how do we even begin to think

278
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,080
about well let's think about it as

279
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,838
you and i getting together in new york

280
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,360
city okay

281
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,080
so if you tell me uh eric i want to meet

282
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,360
you in new york city go to the corner

283
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,360
of i don't know 34th street

284
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,519
and third avenue and you'll find a

285
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,839
building on the northwest corner and go

286
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,320
up to the 17th floor

287
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,560
right so when we have third avenue

288
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,080
that's one coordinate 34th street that's

289
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,958
the second coordinate and go up to the

290
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,920
17th

291
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,799
and what time is that oh 12 noon all

292
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,120
right well now imagine that we traded

293
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,639
the ability to get up to a particular

294
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,759
height in the building it's all flat

295
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,278
land but

296
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,519
i'm going to give you two temporal cords

297
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,559
so meet me at 5 00 pm

298
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,278
and 12 noon at the corner of 34th and

299
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,199
3rd

300
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,200
that gets to be too mind-blowing i've

301
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,519
got two separate watches

302
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,480
and presumably that's just specifying a

303
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,480
single point

304
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,159
in those two different dimensions but

305
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,879
then being able to travel along those

306
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,559
dimensions

307
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:31,679
let's let me see your right hand

308
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,000
you have no watch on that no okay i'm

309
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,599
very

310
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,039
concerned lex that you're going through

311
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,839
life without

312
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,599
a wrist watch that is my favorite and

313
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,519
most valued wrist watch

314
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,079
i want you to wear it this guy is

315
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,600
funnier than basically any human on

316
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:49,359
earth

317
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,839
that has been in my family for months

318
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,639
it's a fitbit now what i want you to

319
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,079
understand is

320
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:58,240
lex fritman is now in a position to live

321
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,239
in two spatial and two temporal

322
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,278
dimensions unlike the rest of us

323
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,560
i clearly am only fit for four four

324
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,278
spatial dimensions

325
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,759
so i'm frozen whereas you can double

326
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:09,519
move

327
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,278
i can double move yeah which is funny

328
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,000
because this is set in

329
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,039
uh austin time yes it's 4 00 p.m and

330
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,879
this is set

331
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,759
in los angeles times well that's just

332
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,679
with an affine shift in mod 12

333
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,799
but my point is is that wouldn't that be

334
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,399
interesting if there were two separate

335
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,439
time skills and you had to coordinate

336
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,799
both of those

337
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,160
but you didn't have to worry about what

338
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,679
floor of the building because everything

339
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,159
was on the ground floor

340
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,679
okay that is the confusion that we're

341
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,559
having

342
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,919
and if you do one more show right then

343
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,599
they're gonna put a watch on your ankle

344
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,958
and you're only gonna have one spatial

345
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,200
dimension that you can move around

346
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,639
but my claim is is that all of these are

347
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,519
actually

348
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,958
sectors of of my theory in case we're

349
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,078
interested in that which is geometric

350
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,359
unity

351
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:56,078
there is a 2 2 sector and a 3 1 and a 1

352
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,120
3 and a 0 4 and a 4 0 and all of these

353
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,199
sectors

354
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,440
have some physical reality we happen to

355
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,399
live in a 1-3 sector

356
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,079
but that's the kind of thinking that we

357
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,839
don't do when i say we have to get off

358
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,679
this planet people imagine oh okay it's

359
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,800
just einstein plus some ability to break

360
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,559
the law

361
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,000
by the way even though you did this for

362
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,679
humor sake

363
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,879
i perhaps am tempted to pull a putin

364
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:24,159
uh who who i'm gonna get whacked

365
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:27,439
no not quite but he was given a

366
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:30,000
a super bowl ring to uh to look at

367
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,320
and he instead of just looking at it put

368
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,350
it on his finger and walked away with it

369
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,000
robert robert craft that's right so

370
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,000
[Laughter]

371
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,078
in the same way i will if you don't mind

372
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
walk away with this fitbit and taking

373
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,759
the entirety of your life story with it

374
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,590
because there's all these steps on it

375
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,919
boy have you lost a lot of weight

376
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,879
[Laughter]

377
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,278
and where have i been exactly right

378
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,159
that's what

379
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:53,200
that's what we're talking about we're

380
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,879
talking about you want to get into

381
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,720
aliens let's have an interesting alien

382
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,879
conversation let's stop having

383
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,720
the typical free will conversation the

384
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,720
typical alien conversation the typical

385
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,639
agi morality conference

386
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,920
it's like we have to recognize that

387
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,519
we're amusing ourselves because we're

388
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,039
not making progress

389
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,879
time to have better versions of all

390
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,879
these conversations is there

391
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,159
some version of the alien conversation

392
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,078
that could incorporate

393
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,480
the breaking of frameworks well i think

394
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:21,120
so i mean the key question would be

395
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,039
we've had the pentagon release multiple

396
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,519
videos of strange ufos

397
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,078
that undermined a lot of us i just think

398
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,600
it's also

399
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,120
really fascinating to talk about the

400
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,920
fact that those of us

401
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,959
who were trained to call bs on all of

402
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,799
this stuff

403
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,559
just had the rug pulled out from under

404
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,240
us by the pentagon choosing to do this

405
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,198
and you know what the effect of that is

406
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,320
you've opened the door for every stupid

407
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:46,559
theory

408
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,800
known to man my aunt saw a ghost

409
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,599
okay now we're gonna have to listen to

410
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,120
well hey

411
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,000
the pentagon used to deny it then it

412
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,120
turned out there were ufos dude

413
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,720
whoever is in charge of lying to the

414
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,159
public

415
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,839
they need a cost function that

416
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,679
incorporates the

417
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,680
damage and trust because i held this

418
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,120
line that this was all garbage and all

419
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:09,198
bs

420
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,560
now i don't know what to think there's a

421
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:11,919
fascinating aspect to this

422
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,919
alien discussion the breaking of

423
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,479
frameworks that involves the release of

424
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,639
videos

425
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,159
from the pentagon which is almost like

426
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,480
another dimension

427
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,838
that trust in itself or the nature of

428
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,159
truth and information

429
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,839
is a kind of dimension along which we're

430
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,719
traveling constantly

431
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,880
that is uh messing with my head to think

432
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,399
about because

433
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,759
i mean like because it almost feels like

434
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,320
you need to incorporate that

435
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:38,958
into your study of the nature of reality

436
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,399
it's like

437
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,799
the constant shifting of the

438
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,919
notation the tools we use to communicate

439
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,519
that reality

440
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,278
and so like what am i supposed to think

441
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,519
about these videos is it

442
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:53,198
is it a complete distraction is it a

443
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,879
kind of cosmic joke

444
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,399
i don't know but you know what i'm tired

445
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,039
of these people just completely tired of

446
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,039
these the

447
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,159
the the people on the pentagon side or

448
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,599
the people who are interpreting the

449
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,958
stuff on the pentagon side i'm tired of

450
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,800
the entirety i'm tired of the

451
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:08,159
authorities

452
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,599
playing games with what we can know

453
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,679
the fact that you and i don't do you

454
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,519
have a security clearance

455
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,039
some level of it for because i was

456
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,278
finding for darpa for a while

457
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,078
i don't have a security clearance you

458
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,480
know i

459
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,198
i am going to release whatever theory i

460
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,440
have

461
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,479
and my guess is is that there is zero

462
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,240
interest from our own government

463
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,560
and so the chinese will find out about

464
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
at the same time our government does

465
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,399
because lord knows what they do in these

466
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,480
buildings i i watch

467
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,240
crazy people walk in and out of the

468
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,199
intelligence community walk in and out

469
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,560
of darpa and

470
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,120
i think wow you're talking to that

471
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:47,679
person that's really fascinating to me

472
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,879
we don't seem to have a clue as to who

473
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:50,559
might have the ball

474
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,919
complete lack of transparency do you

475
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,479
think it's possible there's

476
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,360
the government is in possession of

477
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,759
something

478
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,399
deeply fundamental to understanding of

479
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,959
the world

480
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,759
that they're not releasing so this is

481
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,719
one one thing

482
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,399
is this is one of the famous

483
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,079
distractions that people play with the

484
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,600
narrative assume that that were true

485
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,559
of alien life forms uh spacecraft and

486
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,000
possession

487
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,518
that the government is in possession of

488
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,240
alien spacecraft that's assuming that

489
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,720
true narrative

490
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,120
yeah i don't think the government really

491
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,360
exists at the moment

492
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,480
i believe and this is not an idea that

493
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,480
was original to me

494
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,240
there was a guy named michael teitelbaum

495
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,800
who used to be at the sloan foundation

496
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,879
and at some point i pointed out the us

497
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,799
government had completely contradictory

498
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,078
objectives when it came to the military

499
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,000
and science

500
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,679
and one one branch said this one branch

501
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,159
said that i said you know i i don't

502
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,278
understand

503
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,399
which is true what does the government

504
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:43,519
want he said do you think there's a

505
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,399
government

506
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,919
and i said what do you mean he said what

507
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,759
makes you think that the people in those

508
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:54,559
two offices have ever coordinated

509
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,639
what is it that allows each office to

510
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,599
have a coherent plan with respect to

511
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,879
every other office

512
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,480
and that's when i first started to

513
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,320
understand that there are periods where

514
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,440
the government coheres

515
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,199
and then there are periods where the

516
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,759
coherence just decays and i think that

517
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,439
that's been going on since 1945

518
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,119
that there have been a few places where

519
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,720
there's been increased coherence but in

520
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,000
general everything is just getting less

521
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,160
and less coherent

522
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,038
and that what ward did was focus us on

523
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,000
the need

524
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,798
to have a government of people a mission

525
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,160
capacity

526
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:26,160
technology commitment ideology and then

527
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,960
as soon as that was gone

528
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,279
um you know different people those who'd

529
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
been

530
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,359
through world war ii had one set of

531
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,759
beliefs those born in the 1950s

532
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,199
uh you know or late 40s by the time they

533
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,679
got to woodstock

534
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,279
uh they didn't buy any of that so

535
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,400
coherence is the

536
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:47,440
is that the complete opposite of like

537
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
per uh of bureaucracy being paralyzed by

538
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,600
bureaucracy

539
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,519
so coherence is efficient functional

540
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,240
government because when you say there's

541
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,200
no government meaning there's no

542
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,000
uh emergent function from a collection

543
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,640
of individuals

544
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,319
it's just a bunch of individuals stuck

545
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,840
in their offices without any kind of

546
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,279
efficient communication with each other

547
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,399
on a single mission

548
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,879
and so a a government that is

549
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
truly at the epitome of what a

550
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,440
government is supposed to be

551
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,200
is when a bunch of people working

552
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,679
together what are we about are we about

553
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,558
freedom

554
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,919
are we about growth are we about decency

555
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,000
and fairness

556
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,919
uh are we about the absence of a

557
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,798
national culture so that we can all just

558
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,880
do our own thing

559
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,440
i've called this thing the usa and the

560
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,400
united states of absolutely nothing

561
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
these are all different visions for our

562
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
country

563
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,360
so it's possible that there's a alien

564
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,919
spacecraft somewhere

565
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,719
and there's of like 20 people that know

566
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,720
about it

567
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,319
and then they're kind of it like as you

568
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,120
communicate further and further into the

569
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,720
offices

570
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,639
that information dissipates it gets

571
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,558
distorted in some kind of way and then

572
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,600
it's completely lost the power the

573
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,678
possibility of that information is lost

574
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,798
we bought a house and i had this idea

575
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,160
that i wanted to find out what all the

576
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,119
switches did

577
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,600
and i quickly found out that your house

578
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,678
doesn't keep updating its plans

579
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,359
as people do modifications they just do

580
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,320
the modifications and they don't

581
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,678
actually record

582
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,119
why they were doing what they were doing

583
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,640
or what things lead you so they're all

584
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,079
sorts of bizarre

585
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,559
like there's a switch in my house that

586
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,319
says privacy

587
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,798
i don't know what privacy is does it

588
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:26,159
turn on an electromagnetic field that

589
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:29,200
is some lead shielding go over the house

590
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,720
um that's what we have we have a system

591
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,720
in which the people who've inherited

592
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,919
these structures have no idea why their

593
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,919
grandparents built them

594
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,600
i'd be fine if there's a freedom of

595
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,480
speech switch that you could also

596
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,240
control

597
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,599
and it would be perfect for well that's

598
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,279
different because

599
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,759
what they figured out is is that if they

600
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,720
can just make sure that we don't have

601
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,200
any public options for communication

602
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,240
then

603
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,600
hey every pri uh thing that we say to

604
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,880
each other goes to a private company

605
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,359
private companies can do whatever they

606
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,120
want

607
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,279
and this is like one of the greatest

608
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:02,079
moves that we didn't really notice

609
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,079
uh electronic and digital speech makes

610
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,279
every other kind of speech irrelevant

611
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,519
and because there is no public option

612
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,798
uh guess what there's always somebody

613
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,079
named sundar

614
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:15,519
or jack or mark who controls whether or

615
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,599
not you can speak and

616
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,599
what it appears to be that is being said

617
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,319
and whose stuff is weighted more highly

618
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,558
than other

619
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,798
it's an absolute nightmare and by the

620
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:27,678
way the silicon valley

621
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:30,558
intellectual elite lord knows what is

622
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,798
going on people are so busy making money

623
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,079
that they are not actually upholding any

624
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,158
of the values

625
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,519
so silicon valley is sort of maximally

626
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,200
against it it has this kind of

627
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:42,400
libertarian

628
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,240
uh free progressive

629
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,519
sheen to it when it goes to burning man

630
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,519
and then it quickly just

631
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,960
imposes rules on all of the rest of us

632
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,879
as to what we can say to each other if

633
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,360
we're not part of the inner elite

634
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,280
so what do you think the ideal of the

635
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,519
freedom of speech means

636
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,519
well this is very interesting i keep

637
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,440
getting lectured on social media by

638
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,079
people who have no idea how much power

639
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,840
the supreme

640
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,439
court has to abstract things right now

641
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,119
you have the concept of the letter of

642
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,759
the law and the spirit of the law

643
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,558
and the spirit of the law would have to

644
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,480
say that our speech that matters is free

645
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,678
at least at the level of ideas i don't

646
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,079
claim that i have the right

647
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,840
to endanger your life with speech or to

648
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,558
reveal your private information

649
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,279
so i really am not opining about

650
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,399
directed

651
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,200
speech intended to smear you and that

652
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,640
that's a different

653
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,080
kettle of fish and maybe i have some

654
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,840
rights to do that but i don't think that

655
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,558
they're infinite

656
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:40,079
um what i am saying is is that the

657
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,079
freedom of speech for ideas

658
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,000
is essential that the court abstracted

659
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,319
and

660
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,079
shove it down the throat of google

661
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,200
facebook twitter

662
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,480
amazon whoever these infrastructure

663
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
companies are

664
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,880
because it really matters which

665
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,679
abstraction you use the the case that i

666
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,559
really like

667
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,038
is search and seizure if i have private

668
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:02,798
data

669
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,319
that i entered in my house that is

670
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,759
stored on a server that you

671
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:10,480
hold outside of my house but

672
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,158
i view the is the abstraction that it's

673
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,440
only the perimeter of my house that i

674
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,280
have the right to protect

675
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,600
or does my password extend

676
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,519
the perimeter of my house to the data on

677
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,879
the server that is located outside of my

678
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,359
house

679
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,720
these are court our choices for the

680
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,879
court and the court is supposed to

681
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,558
pretend that they can divine the true

682
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,039
intent of the framers

683
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,639
but all of the sort of and i've taken

684
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,798
the calling this the problem of internet

685
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,038
hyenas people with ready-made answers

686
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,558
and

687
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:42,158
lols and you're such a these folks

688
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,480
love to remind you it's a private

689
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,360
company dude it can do whatever it wants

690
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,360
no the court has to figure out what the

691
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,479
abstractions are and just the way for

692
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,199
example

693
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,798
the griswold decision um found that

694
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,640
there was a penumbra because there was

695
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,240
too little in the constitution therefore

696
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,799
there were all sorts of things implied

697
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,000
that couldn't be in the document

698
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,158
somebody needs to come up with the

699
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,079
abstraction right now

700
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,880
that says jack cannot do whatever he

701
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,839
wants

702
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,600
it's really you say the courts but it's

703
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,000
also us

704
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,119
people who think about the world see you

705
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,640
it's the courts

706
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,879
but the courts don't do this we're toast

707
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,759
but we can still think about it i mean i

708
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,120
i'll sure

709
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,720
but i i don't feel like going down the

710
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,239
drain here's what i'm thinking about

711
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,400
because it's tricky how far

712
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,000
it should extend i mean that's an

713
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,080
ongoing conversation don't you think the

714
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,599
interpretation of the law

715
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,519
i think i'm trying to say something very

716
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,558
simple and it's just not going to be

717
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,558
popular for a while

718
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,000
tech dwarfs previous forms of

719
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,200
communication

720
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,880
print or shouting in a public park

721
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,960
and so you know i can go to a public

722
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,720
park and i can shout if i get a permit

723
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,240
even there i think was in the ninth late

724
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,240
1980s in atlanta

725
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,000
we came up with free speech zones where

726
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,480
you can't protest at a convention you

727
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,159
bet you can go to a park 23 miles out

728
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,200
and they'll fence off a little area

729
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,679
where you can have your free speech

730
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,400
no speech is dangerous ideas are

731
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,600
dangerous

732
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,159
we are a country about danger and risk

733
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,918
and yes i agree that targeted speech at

734
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,960
individuals trying to reveal their

735
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,720
private

736
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,960
stuff and all that kind of that is very

737
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,038
different so forget

738
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,000
a lot of that stuff but free speech for

739
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:30,558
ideas is meant to be dangerous

740
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,759
and people will die as a result of free

741
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,639
speech

742
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,720
the idea that one life is too much is

743
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,400
preposterous like why did we send

744
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,000
if one life is preposterous why do we

745
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,519
send anyone to the beaches of normandy i

746
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,519
just don't get this

747
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:47,440
so one thing that i was clearly bothered

748
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,798
by and maybe you could be my therapist

749
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,159
as well

750
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,839
i thought you were mine this is this is

751
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,960
a little bit of a miscommunication

752
00:24:53,839 --> 00:25:00,639
on both of our parts then uh

753
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:04,558
because who's paying who for this

754
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,360
i was really bothered by uh amazon

755
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,038
banning parlor from aws because my

756
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:11,599
assumption was

757
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:14,240
that the infrastructure i drew a

758
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:17,439
distinction between aws

759
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:21,359
the infrastructure on which competing

760
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,480
platforms could be created is different

761
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,839
than the actual platforms so i

762
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,319
the standard of the ideal of freedom of

763
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,759
speech

764
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,879
i in my mind in a shallow way perhaps

765
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,558
apply differently

766
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,520
to aws than i did to twitter

767
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,879
it felt that we've created a more

768
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,319
dangerous world

769
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,799
that freedoms were violated by banning

770
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,798
a parlor from aws which i saw as the

771
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,000
computing infrastructure which enables

772
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,960
the competition

773
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,880
of tools the competition of frameworks

774
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,720
of communication

775
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,320
what do you think about this first of

776
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,759
all let me give you the the

777
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:04,480
internet hyena answer i understand dude

778
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,119
just build your own amazon yeah right

779
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,120
yes

780
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,038
well so that's a very shallow statement

781
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:10,719
but it's also

782
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,158
one that has some legitimacy we can't

783
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,200
completely dismiss it

784
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,600
because uh there's levels to this

785
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,200
to this game yes and no but if you

786
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,879
really wanted to chase that down

787
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,720
yeah one of the great things about a

788
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,200
person-to-person conversation as opposed

789
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,519
to like

790
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,798
let's have 30 of our closest friends

791
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,918
whenever we have a conversation with 30

792
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:29,839
of our closest friends

793
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,440
you know what happens it's like passing

794
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:34,079
light through a prism

795
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,240
every person says something interesting

796
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,599
and as a result it's always muddled

797
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,159
you like nothing ever resolves well one

798
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,918
of my

799
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,760
conversational techniques you mentioned

800
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,880
uh you push back is uh

801
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,079
uh first this childlike naivete and

802
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,880
curiosity

803
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,399
but also you are simulated real i'm

804
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,320
afraid

805
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,240
real all right so in this paradigm yeah

806
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,918
how could you not see this coming i mean

807
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,159
this i did a show with

808
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,759
um ashley matthews who's the woman

809
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,760
behind riley reed

810
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,359
and specifically about this it was about

811
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,200
the idea that if i

812
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,719
move away from politics and go towards

813
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,600
sex

814
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,200
i know that there's always a move to use

815
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:20,240
the infrastructure to shut down

816
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,000
sex workers and in this case

817
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,359
we had operation chokepoint under the

818
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,398
obama

819
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,759
uh administration we have a positive

820
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:30,398
passion

821
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,960
for people who want to solve problems

822
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,158
that they

823
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,679
they don't like this company they don't

824
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,000
like that company payday loans would be

825
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,038
another

826
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,119
one and so you have legal companies

827
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,319
that are harassed by our financial

828
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,158
system that her

829
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:46,639
you can't you know as riley reed

830
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,000
ashley couldn't get a mailchimp account

831
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,520
according to her if i understand

832
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,480
her correctly and this idea that you

833
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,278
charge these people

834
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,880
higher rates because of supposed

835
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,880
chargebacks on credit cards even if

836
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,278
their chargebacks are low

837
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,640
yes we have an unofficial policy of

838
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,398
harassment

839
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,278
there's something about everybody who

840
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:09,278
shows up at davos

841
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:11,038
they get drunk in the swiss alps and

842
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,519
then they come back home

843
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,200
and they coordinate and they coordinate

844
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,158
things like build back better

845
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,919
we don't really understand what

846
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,278
buildback better is but my guess is is

847
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,840
that buildback better

848
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:24,159
has to do with extremism in america how

849
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,879
do we shut down the republican party

850
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,640
as the source of extremism now i do

851
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,120
think the republican party has got very

852
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,600
extreme

853
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,519
under trump and i do believe that that

854
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,519
was responsive to how extreme the

855
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:40,240
democratic party

856
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:43,278
got under clinton first and then obama

857
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,880
and then hillary and in all of these

858
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:46,880
circumstances

859
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,640
it's amazing how much we want to wield

860
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,200
these things as weapons

861
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,120
well our extremism is fine because we

862
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,600
pretend that antifa doesn't exist and we

863
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,759
don't report what goes on in in portland

864
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,439
but your extremism my god that's

865
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,679
disgusting

866
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,320
this is the completely ridiculous place

867
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:08,159
that we're in and by the way

868
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,720
our friends in part are coked up on tech

869
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,080
money

870
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,519
and they don't appear to hold the

871
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,439
courage of their convictions at a

872
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,200
political level because

873
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,798
it's not in keeping with shareholder

874
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,519
value you know at some level

875
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,079
shareholder value is the ultimate shield

876
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,759
with

877
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:29,199
which everyone can cloak themselves well

878
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:32,000
on that point donald trump was

879
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,519
banned from twitter and i'm not sure it

880
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,558
was a good financial decision for

881
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,679
twitter

882
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,720
right uh but um perhaps you can correct

883
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,240
me if i'm wrong

884
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,079
but are you thinking locally or are you

885
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,558
thinking if twitter refused to

886
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,839
well if twitter refused to ban donald

887
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:47,759
trump what is the odds that

888
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,439
that the full force of the antitrust

889
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,000
division might find them i don't know oh

890
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,320
i see

891
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,119
i see so there's a complicated thing

892
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,879
well there's a

893
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,158
look these guys are all having a

894
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,159
discussion

895
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,919
in very practical terms you know you can

896
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,200
say you can imagine the sorts of

897
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,440
conversation

898
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,120
jack marks under really glad you're all

899
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,038
here we're all trying to

900
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,558
sing from the same hymnal and row in the

901
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,000
same direction

902
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,839
we understand free speech we're

903
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,359
completely committed to it but

904
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,879
we have to draw along with extremism

905
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,639
guys we we just need

906
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,159
we need to make sure we're all on the

907
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,360
same page well they use the term

908
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,760
violence too and they i think over apply

909
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:23,089
it

910
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:27,519
so basically anybody

911
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:29,759
[Laughter]

912
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,960
i'm i'm telling you i'm i say dumb

913
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,599
things

914
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,640
to uh to incentivize uh thoughtful

915
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,918
conversation well

916
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,559
whatever these things are there is no

917
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,080
trace

918
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:43,200
like how old are you lex you're in your

919
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:46,000
mid-30s yeah to late 40s

920
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,600
mid late 20s to late 40s yeah somewhere

921
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,960
in there that that's the demographic

922
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,798
i do think that partially what's

923
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,720
happened is that your group has never

924
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,079
seen functional institutions

925
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,480
these institutions have been so

926
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:59,439
compromised for so long

927
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,120
you've probably never seen an adult

928
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,640
sometimes i think elon looks like an

929
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:05,359
adult

930
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,000
i know that he has a wild lifestyle but

931
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,000
i also

932
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,519
see him looking like an adult what does

933
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,919
an adult look like exactly oh

934
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,038
you know somebody who weighs things

935
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,720
speaks carefully

936
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:17,119
thinks about the future beyond their own

937
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,679
life's lifespan

938
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:21,119
somebody was a pretty good idea of how

939
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,360
to get things done

940
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:25,038
isn't wildly caught up in punitive

941
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,278
actions is more focused on

942
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,960
breaking new ground than playing

943
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:32,079
rent-seeking games

944
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,399
i mean i really had a positive i was so

945
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:36,000
completely jazzed when elon musk ended

946
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,239
up as the world's richest person

947
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,599
he was like well that's interesting back

948
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,399
to work

949
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,918
it's just like that's that's what it is

950
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:44,479
that's what a grown-up would do and it

951
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,399
just made

952
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,399
you know weirdly i said something about

953
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,239
isn't it amazing that the world's

954
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:51,678
richest person knows what a lagrangian

955
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,960
is he made a terrible

956
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,038
lagrange joke about potentials but

957
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,120
yeah i mean i do think that ultimately

958
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,000
elon may be one of the closest things we

959
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,518
have to an adult

960
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,759
and i can tell you that the internet

961
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,599
hyenas will immediately descend as to

962
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,200
what a fraudster he is for pumping his

963
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,319
stock price talking his book and all

964
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,120
this stuff

965
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,558
shut up just looking at the world

966
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:13,599
seriously and rigorously you're saying

967
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,000
that the

968
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,278
people who are running tech companies or

969
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,398
running

970
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:23,038
the mediums on which we can

971
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,319
exercise the idea of free speech are not

972
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,000
adults

973
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,480
i think not i think first of all a lot

974
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,278
of them are silicon valley

975
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,679
utopian businessmen where you talk a

976
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:36,798
utopian line and you use it

977
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,038
you've heard my my take which is that

978
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,038
the idealism of every era is the cover

979
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,960
story of its greatest thefts

980
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:44,480
and i believe that in many ways the

981
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,759
idealism of silicon valley about

982
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,759
connecting the world a world of

983
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,359
abundance et cetera et cetera et cetera

984
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,960
is really about the uh software eating

985
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,278
the world as mark andreessen likes to

986
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,038
say

987
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,480
through all these legacy properties and

988
00:32:55,038 --> 00:33:00,319
by simply being

989
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,240
a bad tech version of

990
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:04,639
something that previously existed like a

991
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,319
newspaper you could immediately

992
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,000
start to dwarf that by aggregating

993
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,240
newspapers in their digital versions

994
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,519
because digital is so much more powerful

995
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,960
as a result yes we have lots of

996
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,038
man-children wandering around what once

997
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,798
was the bay area and is now austin and

998
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:24,319
miami and other places

999
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:27,918
um maybe singapore that um

1000
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,038
all of these people that you know these

1001
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,600
are friends of ours and they're

1002
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:31,359
brilliant

1003
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,839
with respect to a certain amount of

1004
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,240
stuff but none of them can get off the

1005
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,918
drip

1006
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,240
it's amazing that none of them have fu

1007
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,679
money we've got billionaires who don't

1008
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,399
have fu money

1009
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,600
okay i think the argument used by jack

1010
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,918
dorsey was that

1011
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,959
there was an incitement of violence and

1012
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,000
not just that growth

1013
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,200
by everybody that was banning people

1014
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,079
and then this word violence was used as

1015
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,360
a kind of

1016
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:59,519
uh just like extremism and so on to uh

1017
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,558
without much reason behind it you think

1018
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,599
it's impossible

1019
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,599
for jack dorsey anybody else to be as

1020
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,439
you said an adult a grown grown-up

1021
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,960
and jack is pretty close to being the

1022
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,599
guardian he seems like he is yeah

1023
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,639
he's oh he's as he's under pressures as

1024
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,599
you've discussed

1025
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,280
he it seems that he's been on the verge

1026
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,359
of almost being

1027
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,119
quite serious and transparent and real i

1028
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,759
don't know where the jack dorsey that i

1029
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,000
met

1030
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,760
went and i worry that that must be

1031
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,039
something behind the scenes that i can't

1032
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,480
see from my perspective what i think

1033
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:38,719
is the stress the burden of that

1034
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:42,719
when people are screaming at you it's uh

1035
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:46,239
zen monk he really is yeah

1036
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:49,519
jack is an incredibly impressive person

1037
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:52,559
intellectually morally spiritually

1038
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:55,599
at least for a couple of meetings

1039
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:57,599
i don't know him very well but

1040
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,039
i'm very impressed by the person i'm at

1041
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,240
and i don't know where that person is

1042
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:04,000
and that terrifies me but

1043
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,439
do you think somebody could step up in

1044
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,159
that way no

1045
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,320
you so it does can does a human being

1046
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,039
have the capacity

1047
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,079
to be transparent about the reasoning

1048
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,599
behind the banning

1049
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:20,480
or do you think all banning eventually

1050
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,480
uh all banning of people from mediums of

1051
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,400
communication

1052
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,639
is eventually destructive or it's

1053
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,519
impossible for human beings to reason

1054
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,799
with ourselves about it well let's let's

1055
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,119
see what the problem is

1056
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,039
so my phone has been on airplane mode

1057
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,039
i'm going to unlock it

1058
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,400
i'm going to take a picture of lex

1059
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:41,679
ridden

1060
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,280
now if i can i'm going to tweet that

1061
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,279
picture out

1062
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,720
great but here's the weird part about it

1063
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,720
yeah um

1064
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:55,279
that picture sitting

1065
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:57,039
with lex today

1066
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,560
this this ladies and gentlemen is called

1067
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,838
the sausage is made

1068
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:04,880
okay in so doing yes

1069
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:07,920
i have just sent um

1070
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,640
a picture of you and a tiny piece of

1071
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,159
text

1072
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:15,279
all over the planet that has arrived

1073
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:19,118
at if statistics tell the truth just

1074
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,760
under half a million different accounts

1075
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,480
and then more from sharing and so on and

1076
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,920
we have well

1077
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,358
been some of those accounts are dead we

1078
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,280
don't really know how many places it

1079
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:30,000
went yeah

1080
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,519
but the key issue with that tweet is

1081
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,559
that

1082
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:37,920
that is a non-local phenomenon

1083
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:40,960
yes so i just

1084
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,920
broadcasted to an entire planet somebody

1085
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,119
in uganda

1086
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,920
is reading that at the same time as

1087
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,920
somebody in uruguay

1088
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:52,320
there is no known solution

1089
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,200
to have so many people with the ability

1090
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,480
to communicate

1091
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:58,399
non-locally because locality was part of

1092
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,400
the implicit nature of speech

1093
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,079
inside of the constitution friction

1094
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,400
locality there were all sorts of

1095
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,720
other aspects to speech so if you think

1096
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:12,720
about speech as a bundle

1097
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:15,679
i like this then it got unbundled

1098
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:18,239
and some of those aspects that we were

1099
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:22,000
naturally counting on to

1100
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:23,919
uh the impact of speech aren't present

1101
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,679
and we don't have the courage to say i

1102
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,800
wonder if the first amendment really

1103
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,960
applies

1104
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,560
in the modern era in the same way or we

1105
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,079
have to work through an abstraction

1106
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,000
either we probably have to amend the

1107
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,680
constitution or we have to abstract it

1108
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,039
properly

1109
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:41,199
and that issue is

1110
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,159
not something we're facing up to i watch

1111
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:46,159
us

1112
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:48,159
constantly look backwards

1113
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,879
we don't seem to try to come up with new

1114
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,399
ideas and new theories nobody really

1115
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,720
imagines that we're going to be able to

1116
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,320
wisely amend the constitution anymore in

1117
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,959
the inside of the united states many

1118
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
people

1119
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,159
abroad will say why are these guys

1120
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,880
talking about the u.s it's a u.s centric

1121
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,480
program

1122
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,880
well that's because nobody knows where

1123
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,240
this program lives

1124
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,680
the fact by the way that you and i

1125
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,719
happen to be in a physical place

1126
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,799
together

1127
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,399
is also bizarre could be anywhere it

1128
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,599
doesn't really matter that it happens to

1129
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,119
be here

1130
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,960
so the difference between logical

1131
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,640
between physical local non-local

1132
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,760
frictional non-fictional

1133
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:25,519
it's the same thing with firearms

1134
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,119
nobody imagined that the gatling gun

1135
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,000
was going to be present when you had to

1136
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,000
reload a musket

1137
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:33,759
and that's fascinating to think about i

1138
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,039
mean

1139
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,200
you you're exactly right that the nature

1140
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,239
of this particular freedom that seems so

1141
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:43,279
foundational to the

1142
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:45,358
to this nation to what made

1143
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,680
this nation great and perhaps much of

1144
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:50,078
the world that is great made a great

1145
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,598
is changing completely can we try to

1146
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,160
reason through how the idea of

1147
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,519
freedom of speech is to be changed i

1148
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,480
mean

1149
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,358
i guess i'm struggling it feels really

1150
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,960
wrong

1151
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:02,799
perhaps because i wasn't paying

1152
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,119
attention to it it feels really wrong to

1153
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,560
ban

1154
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,960
donald trump now from twitter

1155
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:09,838
to to ban not just the president that's

1156
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,880
really wrong

1157
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,078
to me but this particular human for

1158
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,280
being uh

1159
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,560
divisive but then when there is an

1160
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,920
incitement of violence

1161
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:29,440
that is an overused claim but

1162
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:31,838
perhaps there was uh actual uh brewing

1163
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,039
of local violence happening so one of

1164
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:34,078
the things i know what's happening on

1165
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:37,599
parlor

1166
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,760
is people were uh

1167
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,640
scheduling meetings together in physical

1168
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,240
space so

1169
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:47,679
you're now going going back from this

1170
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:49,358
dynamic social large scale people from

1171
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,399
uganda people from all over the world

1172
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:52,719
being able to

1173
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,440
communicate you're now mapping that into

1174
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,799
now back

1175
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,800
meeting in the physical space that is uh

1176
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,480
similar to what the founding but the

1177
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,920
violence were digital

1178
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,000
if ransomware suddenly was unleashed

1179
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,200
um true the key issue is the

1180
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,039
abstractions

1181
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:11,039
so what was freedom of speech as a

1182
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,358
bundle

1183
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,480
and now it's and then how do we abstract

1184
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,279
the bundle

1185
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,639
into the digital era do you think we

1186
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,519
just need to raise the question talk

1187
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:21,279
about it do you have

1188
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,880
do you have ideas because sure i have

1189
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,800
ideas but the key point is

1190
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,559
that i'm not even welcome in mainstream

1191
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,240
media

1192
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,000
i've never seen you on mainstream media

1193
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,838
do you do mainstream media so we

1194
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,159
we exist in part of an alternate

1195
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,960
universe because the mainstream media

1196
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,719
is trying to have a coherent story which

1197
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,358
i've called the gated institutional

1198
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,358
narrative

1199
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:42,400
and the institutions pretend that they

1200
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,838
plug their fingers

1201
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,000
uh in their ears and pretend that

1202
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:49,279
nothing exists outside

1203
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,559
of msnbc talking to cnn about what was

1204
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,359
in the new york times

1205
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,880
as covered by the washington post and so

1206
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:55,920
that's effectively like a professional

1207
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,400
wrestling promotion

1208
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,559
where they you know the undertaker faces

1209
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,760
off against hulk hogan and

1210
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:06,559
rowdy roddy piper okay well

1211
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,520
that's very different than mma you've uh

1212
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,078
recently been on

1213
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:10,559
glenn beck's program yeah and there was

1214
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,200
this

1215
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,480
kind of one of the things you've talked

1216
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,919
about

1217
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,679
is being able to have this conversation

1218
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,200
i don't know if you would put it as a

1219
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:22,719
type of conversation that was happening

1220
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:26,239
outside the mainstream media

1221
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:28,239
but a conversation that reaches across

1222
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:30,078
different world views you're right

1223
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:33,118
having a nuanced

1224
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,039
or just like a respectful conversation

1225
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,559
that's grounded and mutual

1226
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:39,039
but we can't have the reality because

1227
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:42,318
the main model is is

1228
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:44,079
um the center both left and right is in

1229
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,159
the process of stealing all the wealth

1230
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,720
that we built up

1231
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,799
and they've organized the extremes uh

1232
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:53,919
into two larping teams that i've called

1233
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,760
magistan and wikistan and

1234
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,079
then you have everybody who isn't part

1235
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,079
of that complex all seven of us

1236
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,079
the number of us who are able to earn a

1237
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,960
living looking at all of these mad

1238
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,000
people

1239
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,559
playing this game you know there's a

1240
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,440
phrase

1241
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,400
inside finance when the investment banks

1242
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,480
are

1243
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,599
trying to look at price action and

1244
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,719
somebody says this doesn't make any

1245
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,838
sense

1246
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,318
and somebody will say it's just the

1247
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:20,078
locals stealing from each other and

1248
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:23,039
that's really what we have we have we've

1249
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,519
got the leaders of magastan and wikistan

1250
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,279
uh you know championing these two teams

1251
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,880
is sponsored by the center because it's

1252
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,440
a distraction while they steal all the

1253
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,440
silver and

1254
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,720
cut the paintings out of the frames

1255
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,079
that's what we

1256
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,598
you and i are looking at so when you ask

1257
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,960
me like do you have any ideas about the

1258
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,280
abstraction for free speech

1259
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,119
i've never met mark zuckerberg i've

1260
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,920
never met sunder pichai

1261
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,440
i never met larry page i was once in a

1262
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,639
room with sergey brin

1263
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,039
i've never spoken to elon musk

1264
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,118
i hang out with peter thiel but we have

1265
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,079
a very deep relationship but i don't

1266
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,559
really speak to that many other people

1267
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,560
at you know sort of at this level

1268
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:04,078
we're not having any kind of smart

1269
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,639
conversation

1270
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,079
at a national level in fact it's almost

1271
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:11,199
as if

1272
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,440
we've destroyed every sandbox

1273
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,399
in which we could play together there's

1274
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,480
no place

1275
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,000
that we actually talk except long-form

1276
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,559
podcasting

1277
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,119
and by the way they've found you see

1278
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:26,239
what's going on with like alex stamos

1279
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,160
and the hoover institution we've you

1280
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,959
know that there's a loophole left

1281
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:31,519
long-form podcasting allows people to

1282
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,159
speak

1283
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:34,880
at levels above daytime cnn yeah it's

1284
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:36,078
like

1285
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,119
well why do you think they're not

1286
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,440
watching daytime cnn

1287
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,160
but you know that's that's just silly

1288
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,800
journalism

1289
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,239
they uh currently have no power to

1290
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,560
displace podcasting that's why it's so

1291
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:48,959
powerful rss feed i mean that's why the

1292
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,199
big

1293
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,639
challenge with joe rogan and spotify is

1294
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:54,480
like there's this dance that's

1295
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,838
fascinating to see

1296
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,719
is joe rogan is not part of the system

1297
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:01,838
and then he's also uncancelable and

1298
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:04,719
there's this

1299
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,279
tension that's happening well howard

1300
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,799
stern

1301
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,440
howard stern became much less relevant

1302
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,119
so if they can't control joe by bringing

1303
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,679
him in house

1304
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,358
the key question is is he going to

1305
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,679
continue

1306
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:20,838
like you know this joe says the thing

1307
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,519
about fu money

1308
00:44:20,838 --> 00:44:26,960
yeah joe's one of the only people with

1309
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:30,318
fu money who's actually said fu

1310
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:33,920
yeah yeah i don't understand this

1311
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:36,318
i don't have fu money what what exactly

1312
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,358
is can we break apart a few money

1313
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,679
because

1314
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,279
i always thought i've been fortunate

1315
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,559
enough

1316
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,880
to have always have fu money in the

1317
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,960
sense that my standards were so low

1318
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,160
that a basic salary in the united states

1319
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,000
this is the stoic point

1320
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,159
which is yeah you can live on rice and

1321
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,599
beans right you're uncancelable because

1322
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,920
you're always rich relative to your

1323
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,680
needs

1324
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,119
right isn't that fu fundamental if you

1325
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,519
mind why do you say that tech

1326
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,440
billionaires don't have fu money

1327
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,880
when you need to hire private security

1328
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,039
to protect your family

1329
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,960
how do you protect your two children i

1330
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:13,440
don't have those yet bingo

1331
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,358
yeah my point is is that fu money

1332
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,280
insulates everything that you care about

1333
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:18,960
it's not just about you

1334
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,800
so you're saying as the level of

1335
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,559
responsibility grows

1336
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,720
the amount of money required for fu

1337
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,559
we have a war going on the war is on

1338
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,559
academic freedom

1339
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,000
academic freedom used to be present in

1340
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,480
the system as a

1341
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,679
in terms of the idea we we trust our

1342
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,079
elite

1343
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,799
now we have an idea like you want to be

1344
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,560
the elite

1345
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,680
you know you want a lord above us that's

1346
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:43,759
like first of all there's like a

1347
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:46,318
populist anti-elitist thing

1348
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,040
then there's the idea that we're going

1349
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:48,880
to defer

1350
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,318
tenure for forever then we're going to

1351
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,838
tell people stay in your lane your

1352
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,480
tenure is only good for your own

1353
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:55,920
particular tiny micro subject

1354
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,679
then we're going to also control your

1355
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,200
grants and we'll be able to

1356
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:01,118
load up your teaching load if we don't

1357
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:04,159
like who you are will make your life

1358
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:07,838
absolutely impossible we lost

1359
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:10,559
academic freedom and we ushered in peer

1360
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:13,358
review which was a disaster

1361
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,000
and then we lost funding so that people

1362
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:15,838
were

1363
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,119
confident that they would have the

1364
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:20,880
ability to do research

1365
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,720
no matter what they said and as a result

1366
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,559
what you find is is a world in which

1367
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,159
there's no ability

1368
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,480
to get people to say no i'm not going to

1369
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,879
sign your diversity and inclusion

1370
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,000
forced loyalty oath i won't sign any

1371
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,200
loyalty oath

1372
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,199
get the hell out of my office

1373
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,960
you a few and you you're connecting

1374
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,639
money to that but

1375
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,800
well my point is is that academic

1376
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,679
freedom is

1377
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,119
the the whole idea behind it was that

1378
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:48,318
you will have the freedom of a

1379
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:53,039
billionaire

1380
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:55,599
on a much smaller salary right okay

1381
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,239
we've lost that yeah the only reason in

1382
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,359
part

1383
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:02,239
that i wanted to go into

1384
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,960
academic academics as a profession as

1385
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,439
opposed to

1386
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,199
wanting to do physical or mathematical

1387
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,318
research

1388
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,039
the great prize was freedom and ralph

1389
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:12,880
gomorry

1390
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,400
uh of the sloan foundation previously of

1391
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,680
ibm research pointed it

1392
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,400
out he says if you lose freedom you lose

1393
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:22,719
the only thing we had to offer top minds

1394
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,079
top minds value their intellectual

1395
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,279
freedom and their physical and

1396
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:29,119
economic security at a different level

1397
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,400
than other human beings

1398
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:34,160
and so people say you know

1399
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,000
i understand dude you have the ability

1400
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:38,239
to do x y and z what's the problem it's

1401
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,119
like well i value my ability to raise

1402
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:44,399
the middle finger as an american

1403
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,358
practically above everything else i want

1404
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,838
to talk to you about

1405
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,039
freedom here in the context of something

1406
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,318
you've mentioned

1407
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:55,679
which is one way to take away freedom

1408
00:47:52,318 --> 00:47:57,920
is to put a human being into a cage

1409
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,358
to create constraints the other one that

1410
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,760
worries me is something that i think

1411
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:05,119
you've spoken to to twitter a little bit

1412
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:08,240
on twitter is

1413
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:11,599
we bleed freedom by

1414
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:11,598
kind of slowly

1415
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:18,800
uh scaring you into not

1416
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:20,559
doing not expressing the full spectrum

1417
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,710
of opportunities you can as freedom so

1418
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,920
like when you ban donald trump

1419
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:27,358
[Music]

1420
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,599
when you uh ban uh parlor

1421
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:30,400
you give a little doubt in the minds of

1422
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,440
millions like

1423
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,000
me a person who's a tech person who's an

1424
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,760
entrepreneur entrepreneur there's a

1425
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,519
little that's what i'm afraid of when i

1426
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,559
look in the mirror is there now a little

1427
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:42,559
doubt in there

1428
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,680
sure that that limits the amount of

1429
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,800
options i will try

1430
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:49,919
how certain are you that the covid

1431
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,079
virus didn't come from the wuhan lab and

1432
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,559
his biosafety level four

1433
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,800
we both know that we're both supposed to

1434
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,040
robotically say

1435
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,359
the idea that the covet virus came from

1436
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,960
a lab is a discredited conspiracy theory

1437
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:03,679
there is no evidence that suggests that

1438
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,199
this is true

1439
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:07,039
the world health organization and the

1440
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,719
cdc have both opined this

1441
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,039
to say otherwise would be incredibly

1442
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:14,959
irresponsible and the threat of that

1443
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:17,119
is the thing that ultimately limits

1444
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,559
the the freedoms we feel i should be

1445
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:23,358
tweeting about jeff epstein all the time

1446
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,160
and you're afraid well it's awesome i

1447
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:26,799
mean i said it

1448
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,078
in the public yeah many times why is it

1449
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,519
we don't ask where the

1450
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,880
records are from villard house where

1451
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:32,800
where are the financial records where

1452
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,640
the sec filings

1453
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,800
yeah where are the questions on on the

1454
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:40,318
record to the intelligence

1455
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,240
uh agencies was he known to be part of

1456
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:44,960
the intelligence community

1457
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:48,000
so so we're we're not interested in

1458
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:51,199
asking questions like am i going to die

1459
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,719
as a result of asking the question was

1460
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:53,358
jeff epstein part of the intelligence

1461
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:55,598
community

1462
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:57,279
of any nation is there a reason we're

1463
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,559
not asking about the financial records

1464
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,640
of the supposed hedge fund that he

1465
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,599
didn't run

1466
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:05,598
just like the wuhan lab okay how do we

1467
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,160
get to the core of the jeffrey epstein

1468
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,720
the the truth behind jeffrey epstein in

1469
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:10,000
a sense

1470
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:11,919
i mean there's there's some things that

1471
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,519
are just like useless conspiracy

1472
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,639
theories around it even if they're true

1473
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:16,880
there's some things that get through i

1474
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:20,000
hate to say it you're not gonna like it

1475
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,680
look at the 1971 media pennsylvania

1476
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,079
break-in of the citizens committee to

1477
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:26,318
investigate the fbi

1478
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,800
those kids and by the way they weren't

1479
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:32,159
all kids

1480
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,400
did what had to be done they broke in

1481
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:36,879
they broke the law it was an incredible

1482
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,358
act of civil disobedience

1483
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,160
and god blessed judy feingold for taking

1484
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:42,480
to her

1485
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:44,239
she was going to take to her grave that

1486
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,199
she'd been part of this like the coolest

1487
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:47,598
thing of all time

1488
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:48,879
they didn't say anything for forever so

1489
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,200
civil disobedience

1490
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,519
i mean you have to we are founded on

1491
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:56,480
civil disobedience civil disobedience is

1492
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:56,480
incredibly

1493
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,440
you screw it up and you're just a vandal

1494
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,640
you screw it up you're a hooligan

1495
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:07,358
yeah those those cats were so

1496
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:08,159
disciplined it's an art form and it was

1497
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:09,920
an art form

1498
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,199
and they risked everything they were

1499
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,400
willing to pay

1500
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:16,719
with their freedom those

1501
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,800
are the sorts of people who earned the

1502
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:19,519
right by putting themselves at risk i

1503
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,559
would not

1504
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,920
do this i am not volunteering to break

1505
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,559
into

1506
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,000
anything i think it was uh william

1507
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,519
davidon

1508
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
who was a student of murray gelman and a

1509
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:35,199
physics professor at haverford

1510
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,800
who corralled these people and led this

1511
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:41,598
effort and right now what we need

1512
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,039
is somebody to blow the lid off of what

1513
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,318
is controlling everything

1514
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:47,920
we have i i'm happy

1515
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:49,279
to hear that it's a system of incentive

1516
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,880
structures that it's a system of

1517
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,079
selective pressures i'm happy to find

1518
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,440
out that it's emergent

1519
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,359
i'm happy to find that it's partially

1520
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,318
directed by our own intelligence

1521
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:59,119
community

1522
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,159
i'm happy to hear that uh in fact we've

1523
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,160
been penetrated

1524
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:05,358
by north korea iran china and russia but

1525
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:08,239
i need to know

1526
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:10,078
why people aren't like the firebombing

1527
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:12,479
of the courthouse in portland oregon has

1528
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,400
no explanation

1529
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,119
and somehow this is normal this is not

1530
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,200
normal to any human being

1531
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,960
we have video that people don't believe

1532
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:22,239
and you know i come back to the shaggy

1533
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,280
defense

1534
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:28,558
of it wasn't me you know so

1535
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,559
it's like um

1536
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,159
you remember that song shaggy yeah it

1537
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:35,199
wasn't me caught you

1538
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:37,519
uh banging the counter on the couch yeah

1539
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,039
exactly it wasn't me it wasn't me he

1540
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:40,880
says but

1541
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,639
his friend says well your strategy makes

1542
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,000
no sense at all

1543
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:47,838
this is what msnbc is doing

1544
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,679
you dropped him from the graphic it

1545
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:50,480
wasn't me it wasn't me you came up with

1546
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:54,078
another yang

1547
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:57,119
it wasn't me i will never see msnbc

1548
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:59,039
the same again so you've spoken about

1549
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,440
him before i think it'd be nice to

1550
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:02,239
maybe honor him to break it apart a

1551
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,280
little bit

1552
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:06,479
aaron schwartz yeah uh why was he a

1553
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,519
special human being

1554
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,838
in this ilk of what we're talking about

1555
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,318
now

1556
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:13,039
civil disobedience um how do we honor

1557
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,079
him

1558
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,558
now moving forward as human beings who

1559
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,200
are

1560
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,079
willing to take risks in this world well

1561
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,639
i don't know

1562
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:23,599
i mean are you inspired by aaron

1563
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,759
schwartz

1564
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,200
i am how do you feel about jstor let's

1565
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,119
talk about jstor first

1566
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,799
so let's let's let's say what jstor is

1567
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:36,000
all about

1568
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:38,480
we the taxpayer pay for research

1569
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,480
and then

1570
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,200
the people who do the research do all

1571
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:45,598
the work for a bunch of companies

1572
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:46,879
who then charge us thirty dollars an

1573
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,559
article

1574
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,200
to read what it is that we already paid

1575
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:55,119
for and if we don't cite these articles

1576
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:57,439
we're told that we're in violation okay

1577
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,880
i almost never call for civil

1578
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,599
disobedience because i don't really want

1579
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,358
to

1580
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:06,318
but jstor

1581
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:08,880
elsevier springer who the

1582
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:12,800
are these people yeah

1583
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:16,160
get the smart people

1584
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,240
need to take the greedy people behind

1585
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,519
the woodshed and explain to them what

1586
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:21,838
science is

1587
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,358
i have a very old-fashioned idea that's

1588
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:25,358
so out of favor

1589
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,519
that i will immediately be seen as

1590
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:29,199
knuckle dragger yeah

1591
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:30,800
i believe in the great woman theory of

1592
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,519
history and the great man theory of

1593
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,119
history

1594
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:35,119
emmy nerder is fantastic

1595
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,519
as an example and i believe in

1596
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,400
editors over peer reviewers and i

1597
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:44,000
believe that

1598
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,920
wrong things should be allowed into the

1599
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,039
literature and i believe that the

1600
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,318
gatekeeping

1601
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:52,480
should go towards zero because the costs

1602
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:54,558
associated with distribution are very

1603
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,519
very slight i believe that

1604
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:58,319
um we should be looking at the perverse

1605
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:01,358
incentives

1606
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:03,199
of sending your paper blindly into your

1607
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:04,400
competitors clutches particularly if

1608
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:07,439
you're a young person

1609
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,880
being reviewed by an older person uh are

1610
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,480
you familiar with the

1611
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,680
the duatta senor are you familiar with

1612
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,679
the legend of the magnaya

1613
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,119
now the magnaya is the miller's daughter

1614
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:21,519
and the largest

1615
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,798
food fight in the entire universe i

1616
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:25,838
believe

1617
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:27,519
is held i think in italy uh it's called

1618
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:31,358
the battle of the oranges

1619
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:34,480
and it celebrates the miller's daughter

1620
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:38,318
who had fallen in love with her beloved

1621
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:41,440
and when it came time for them to marry

1622
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:45,039
the virginal magnaya was in fact

1623
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,119
told that the lord of the land

1624
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:48,639
had the right to have the first night

1625
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,440
with the bride

1626
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:53,679
well the magnaya had a different idea so

1627
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,480
she seemed to consent to this

1628
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:56,798
uh perhaps mythical right also called

1629
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,000
the

1630
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:02,559
the primonote the first night and

1631
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,358
by by legend she concealed a dagger

1632
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,519
underneath her robes

1633
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:09,920
and when it came time for the the hated

1634
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:13,599
lord of the manor to extract

1635
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,318
uh this right she pulled the knife out

1636
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,240
and killed him

1637
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,079
and i think it also echoes a little bit

1638
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,399
of particularly wonderful scene from

1639
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:23,440
game of thrones

1640
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:27,519
but that inspired both men and women

1641
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:30,880
and the magnaya is the legendary hero

1642
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:33,199
right now what we need to do is we need

1643
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,798
to resist the primo note the right of

1644
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:37,919
first look

1645
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:39,199
right fu you don't have to write a first

1646
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,039
look i don't want to send something

1647
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:43,279
blindly to my competitors i don't want

1648
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:46,558
to subject myself to you naming what

1649
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,839
what work i've done why why are you in

1650
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,839
my story

1651
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:51,519
that's my question get out of my story

1652
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:53,039
if i do work

1653
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:55,358
and then you have an idea oh well it's

1654
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:57,759
the matthew principle to him

1655
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,519
who has much more will be given i've

1656
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,799
gone to the national academy of sciences

1657
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:02,480
and talked about these things

1658
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:04,318
and it's funny i've been laughed at by

1659
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,119
the older people who think

1660
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,599
well eric you know science proceeds

1661
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,119
funeral by funeral that's plonk

1662
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,720
you know the matthew principle you know

1663
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,559
the matilda principle the things done by

1664
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:16,399
women are attributed to men

1665
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,680
these are not new you're like and you

1666
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,400
guys just live like this

1667
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:22,078
yeah so the revolutionary act now is to

1668
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,838
resist all of these things that

1669
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,519
we need these things that are not new so

1670
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:27,039
you asked me about aaron schwartz aaron

1671
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:28,159
schwartz was the magniah

1672
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,719
one of the things you've done very

1673
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:34,239
beautifully is to communicate

1674
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:35,439
love and i think about you know some of

1675
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:37,279
our conversations

1676
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,440
you got me to talk a little bit about my

1677
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:43,200
own experiences and

1678
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,200
0 2 1 3 8 and 3 9.

1679
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,400
we are the product of our trauma

1680
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,720
and what people don't understand is that

1681
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,280
very often when you see people

1682
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,679
taking counter measures against what

1683
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,519
appear to be imaginary forces

1684
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:02,480
they're really actually replaying things

1685
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:04,239
that really happen to them

1686
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,880
and having been through this system and

1687
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:09,039
watching all of the ways in which it

1688
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,039
completely rewrites the lives of the

1689
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:12,798
people who i'm counting on to cure our

1690
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:15,679
diseases build our new industries keep

1691
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:18,159
us safe from our foes

1692
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,199
the amount of pressure the system is

1693
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:23,118
putting on the

1694
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:26,480
most hopeful minds is unimaginable

1695
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,798
and so my my goal is to empower somebody

1696
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,920
like

1697
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:31,679
aaron schwartz in memory and

1698
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,280
to talk about a jeffrey epstein

1699
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:33,838
situation did you know that the first

1700
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,280
person

1701
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:41,759
outside of me to get a look

1702
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,760
at geometric unity was jeffrey epstein

1703
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,920
how did he know i was working on this i

1704
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,559
don't know

1705
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,960
so your ideas that formed geometric

1706
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,760
community was something that uh his eyes

1707
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,039
have seen

1708
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:58,160
i was pushed to talk to jeffrey epstein

1709
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:58,960
as one of the only people who could help

1710
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,798
me

1711
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,079
no no listen to this how does this yeah

1712
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:05,280
how does this connect okay

1713
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:07,760
well first of all my old

1714
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:11,200
synagogue my old shule was the

1715
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:15,520
conservative minion at harvard hillel

1716
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:17,519
and i believe it's called rusofsky hall

1717
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,599
after henry rusofsky in the economics

1718
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:21,039
department who was a japan scholar if

1719
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:25,920
i'm correct

1720
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:27,599
and he became provost or dean of harvard

1721
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,240
i believe that that was built with

1722
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,720
jeffrey epstein's money

1723
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,679
and i wondered in part whether the

1724
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:35,919
jewish students

1725
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:38,078
at harvard all sort of passed through a

1726
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,440
bottleneck of harvard hilla

1727
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,160
so that was something i found very

1728
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,679
curious but i don't know much about it

1729
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:45,358
i also found that jeffrey epstein

1730
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,199
hanging around scientists i don't think

1731
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:50,480
that either you or joe exactly

1732
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:52,798
i mean got me correct uh in your

1733
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,400
last interchange uh for the record for

1734
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,880
people who haven't listened to joe rogan

1735
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,720
program

1736
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:00,000
joe has claimed that eric weinstein was

1737
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:02,879
the only person who has gotten laid paid

1738
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,639
oh paid and you said you also got paid

1739
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,519
as a young man

1740
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:08,239
right i believe the word was laid but uh

1741
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:10,400
allegedly

1742
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:13,199
my hearing isn't so good at age 55. yeah

1743
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:16,000
all right leaving that aside yes

1744
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:16,879
um what was jeffrey epstein doing

1745
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,960
hanging around

1746
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,000
all of these scientists i don't think

1747
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,240
that was the same program

1748
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,599
that was about compromising political

1749
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:27,679
leaders and business people

1750
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,200
and entertainment figures i think these

1751
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:31,679
are two different programs that were

1752
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:34,159
being run through one individual

1753
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:35,838
and joe seemed to think that i didn't

1754
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:37,759
think he was smooth i thought he was

1755
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:39,199
glib

1756
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,599
i think what joe is really trying to get

1757
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:44,798
out of is that i found his

1758
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,599
mysticism meretricious he had a ability

1759
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:49,039
to deflect

1760
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:50,559
every conversation that might go

1761
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:52,159
towards revealing that he didn't know

1762
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,839
what he was talking about every time you

1763
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:55,279
started to get close

1764
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:58,159
to something where the rubber hit the

1765
01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,680
road the rubber wouldn't hit the road

1766
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:04,879
and yet can you help me untangle the the

1767
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:08,399
fact that you thought

1768
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:12,240
deeply about the physics of the nature

1769
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:15,039
of our universe and jeffrey epstein

1770
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:18,239
was interested how did he know i wasn't

1771
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:20,719
really talking about this stuff until

1772
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:22,078
you know even my close friends didn't

1773
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:25,279
really know what i was up to

1774
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,440
and yet you're saying he he did not have

1775
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,880
sufficient brilliance to understand when

1776
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,000
the rubber hit the road so

1777
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:34,720
why why did he have sufficient

1778
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,400
interest and tell me what i thought i've

1779
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:36,959
been waiting to find out does my

1780
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,920
government

1781
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,798
even know i exist do you have an answer

1782
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,318
to that question

1783
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:46,480
i have a couple times the government has

1784
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:49,440
reached out to me

1785
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:52,159
in general there is zero interest in me

1786
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:55,119
like less than zero interest

1787
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:55,838
i find that fascinating as far as you

1788
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,880
know right

1789
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:59,440
i mean well that's what i'm trying to

1790
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,760
say the question about not being able to

1791
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,760
see through a half-silvered mirror

1792
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,440
you don't know what's going on behind

1793
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,640
the half-silvered mirror to you it's a

1794
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,358
it's all you see

1795
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,719
is uh is your reflection but your

1796
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,679
intuition still holds

1797
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:15,519
like this is where i mentioned that i uh

1798
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:17,759
this is where i'll say naive dumb

1799
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:19,519
things but i still hold on to this

1800
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,319
intuition that

1801
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:23,759
jeff not i'm not confident in this but i

1802
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:25,119
i'm

1803
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,280
leaning towards that direction that

1804
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,480
jeffrey epstein is the source of evil

1805
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,359
not something that's

1806
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:34,159
underlying him you have you have a bias

1807
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:36,000
it's different than mine arbazian priors

1808
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:37,598
are tutored by different life

1809
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,480
experiences

1810
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:42,720
if i was mostly concerned like sam

1811
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,358
harris was is concerned that people fill

1812
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:47,679
their heads with nonsense

1813
01:02:45,358 --> 01:02:49,279
i would have a very strong sense that

1814
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,519
people need order in the world

1815
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,519
that they take mysterious situations

1816
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:55,119
they build entire castles in the air and

1817
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,679
then they go move in if they

1818
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:59,680
really get crazy you know the old saying

1819
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:01,519
is that neurotics

1820
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:04,719
build castles in the air and psychotics

1821
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:06,480
move in coming from a progressive family

1822
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:07,759
we had a different experience it's

1823
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,199
really weird when the government is

1824
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,880
actually out to get you when they

1825
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:12,318
actually send a spy

1826
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,640
when they actually engage in

1827
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:15,440
disinformation campaigns when they smear

1828
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,000
you

1829
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,679
and if you've ever had that brought to

1830
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,480
bear on your family you have a howard

1831
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:22,399
zinn

1832
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,119
sort of understanding of the country

1833
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,039
which is different than having a

1834
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,680
wow do people believe crazy stuff

1835
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:31,760
because they watch too much tv

1836
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:33,519
and both of these things have some merit

1837
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,359
to them but it's a question of regulated

1838
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,960
expression when do you want to express

1839
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:39,519
more sam harris and when do you want to

1840
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,440
express more howard zinn

1841
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:43,119
and you can express both correct the one

1842
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,720
human being can just pass both sure but

1843
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,640
there's a trade-off between them

1844
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:48,078
in other words most of most people like

1845
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:49,838
the michael shermers of the world are

1846
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:51,359
going to tilt very strongly to

1847
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:52,558
extraordinary claims require

1848
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:54,159
extraordinary evidence you're going to

1849
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,440
have that kind of energy

1850
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:57,118
and then somebody else is going to say

1851
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,599
how many times do i have to get hit on

1852
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,039
uh

1853
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,400
you know how many times i have to hammer

1854
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,920
my own thumb before i realize that

1855
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,559
there's a problem

1856
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,039
so you know my feeling about this is yes

1857
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:07,280
people

1858
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,039
see patterns in clouds they see faces

1859
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,559
and scripture and all sorts of things

1860
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:12,720
and it's just random cloud patterns

1861
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,400
and it's also the case that there's

1862
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:16,159
tremendous pressure not to see

1863
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,599
conspiracies when conspiracies are

1864
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:19,440
relatively more common

1865
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,119
than the people who shout conspiracy

1866
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,639
theory will claim

1867
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,160
so both of these things are true and you

1868
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:24,639
have to ask when do you express your

1869
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:27,199
inner

1870
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:27,759
zen and when you're in harris and those

1871
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:29,838
are different

1872
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,280
one fundamental difference you and i

1873
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:33,358
biases aside

1874
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,640
is you've actually met jeffrey epstein

1875
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:38,480
and i'm

1876
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:42,159
uh listening to like reverberations

1877
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,519
years later of stories and narratives

1878
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:46,798
throughout the story luckily i only met

1879
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:49,119
him once and i i think i had

1880
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:51,199
one or perhaps two phone conversations

1881
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:54,000
with him other than the one meeting

1882
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,439
you can learn a lot in just a few words

1883
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,559
right from a human being well that's

1884
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,280
true but i think that

1885
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:01,119
the bigger issue was i saw something

1886
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,400
that i don't hear much remarked upon

1887
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,400
which is

1888
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,680
jeffrey epstein is all there that there

1889
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,519
is

1890
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:09,598
in other words there's the national

1891
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:11,199
science foundation national institute of

1892
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:14,480
health howard hughes

1893
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:16,159
there's all this stuff

1894
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,920
that kind of has the same feel to it a

1895
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:21,519
little bit of variation and difference

1896
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,079
department of energy if you fall outside

1897
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:24,079
of that

1898
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:25,359
there's just jeffrey epstein that's what

1899
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,760
you're told yes

1900
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:29,838
that's not quite true there's kavli

1901
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,160
maybe jim simons is now in the game

1902
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:33,440
peter thiel has done some stuff you had

1903
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,759
yuri milner and

1904
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,440
mark zuckerberg try so there is other

1905
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:41,200
money running around

1906
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,760
templeton but very strongly there was a

1907
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:43,118
belief

1908
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,200
that if you're doing something really

1909
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,318
innovative and the system can't fund it

1910
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:48,879
because it's

1911
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:49,838
we've become jeffrey epstein's

1912
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,760
your guy

1913
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:52,880
because this funnel that you're supposed

1914
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,640
to go through

1915
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:57,358
that's right and the idea is that you

1916
01:05:54,639 --> 01:06:01,519
get called to the great man's house

1917
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:04,639
and you know the sort of uh

1918
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:06,719
lubricious version of ralph lauren

1919
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:08,558
you know takes you in and asks you

1920
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,959
bizarre questions and maybe he has an

1921
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:14,720
island maybe he has a plane

1922
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:17,358
and you know when you're starved

1923
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:18,719
uh you know somebody showing you a feast

1924
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:20,798
or when you're

1925
01:06:18,719 --> 01:06:22,480
dehydrated in a death's door and

1926
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:25,519
somebody says oh

1927
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,519
you know i have a well

1928
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:30,000
you know that's what it is and so the

1929
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,239
thought is wow

1930
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,079
can you can somebody get some effing

1931
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:34,879
money into the science system so that we

1932
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,519
don't have

1933
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,280
super creeps uh trying to learn all of

1934
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:41,358
our secrets ahead of time

1935
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,920
wtf what is your problem with

1936
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:46,400
transparency and taxpayer dollars just

1937
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,880
all of you you wouldn't have a country

1938
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,798
you'd be speaking german

1939
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,318
so essentially you believe that human

1940
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,159
beings would not be able to

1941
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:56,480
in the when the money is lacking in the

1942
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:57,038
system like on research produce public

1943
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,119
goods

1944
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:00,160
you and i are meant to produce public

1945
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:02,559
goods

1946
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:05,920
now i sell athletic greens and i sell

1947
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:08,559
theragan and i sell unagi scooters

1948
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,599
and chili pad i can't be honest i love

1949
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:13,359
these products

1950
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:16,318
but i didn't get into this game

1951
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:17,519
for the purpose of selling i'm trying to

1952
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,558
figure out

1953
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:22,798
how do you have an fu lifestyle

1954
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,160
but you know something lex i don't know

1955
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:26,000
why you built this channel

1956
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:28,879
it's kind of a mystery wait i don't know

1957
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,400
why i'll tell you why i built my channel

1958
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:33,039
the face it's gonna be a lot harder to

1959
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:36,079
roll me this time in an alley

1960
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:37,920
yeah i got rolled multiple times and my

1961
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:40,000
point is

1962
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,680
i didn't want to become a celebrity i

1963
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,159
didn't want to become well known

1964
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:48,639
but it's a lot harder to roll somebody

1965
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:49,838
who's getting you know i think i'm i

1966
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:51,759
don't know if this is mistaken but i

1967
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:54,838
think i'm the math phd with the largest

1968
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:57,599
number of followers on twitter

1969
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:58,639
and there was nothing you could do

1970
01:07:57,599 --> 01:07:59,760
before

1971
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:01,598
i mean again to put a little

1972
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,240
responsibility on you so you've created

1973
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,119
something

1974
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:06,719
really special for the distribution of

1975
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:09,039
your own ideas i mean

1976
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:10,959
uh but because it's not necessarily

1977
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,839
currently scalable

1978
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:15,599
you also perhaps you and i have the

1979
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:17,920
responsibility

1980
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,279
of giving other people also a chance to

1981
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,640
spread their ideas

1982
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,799
i mean joe rogan did this very

1983
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,560
effectively for a bunch of people

1984
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:26,238
that that's why they're angry at him

1985
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,239
because he's a gatekeeper

1986
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:29,519
and he let all sorts of people through

1987
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:32,158
that gate

1988
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,719
from roger from roger penrose to alex

1989
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:36,000
jones

1990
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:38,719
to uh jordan peterson to

1991
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,679
i mean even first of all to you and to

1992
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:43,520
abby martin

1993
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:46,719
to abby martin to barry weiss yeah

1994
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,560
that's the problem well but you

1995
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,000
you have not successfully built up a

1996
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,520
thing that allows that to carry

1997
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,719
no no we are all

1998
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:59,440
vulnerable to reputational attack

1999
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:01,439
because what happens you see the problem

2000
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,678
lexus is that you are now an institution

2001
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:05,358
at some level

2002
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,359
you walk around with all this equipment

2003
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,600
in a duffel bag

2004
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:10,480
uh the last thing is the last suit

2005
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:15,039
you'll ever need

2006
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:17,119
and um you have the reach

2007
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:19,198
of something like cnn to people who

2008
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:21,599
matter

2009
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:23,358
okay so now the question is how do we

2010
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,560
control something

2011
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,480
that doesn't have a board doesn't have

2012
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,960
shareholders it doesn't have to make sec

2013
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:30,079
files

2014
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:33,520
fcc so the best

2015
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:36,479
answer they have is well

2016
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,920
we just have to destroy reputations all

2017
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:39,358
it takes is for us to take

2018
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,440
something that gets said or done or

2019
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:42,960
alleged

2020
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,759
and i think it's incredibly important

2021
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,480
one of the things people don't

2022
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,679
understand is

2023
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:49,678
that i'm i'm going to fight general

2024
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,520
reputational attacks

2025
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,520
not because some people don't deserve to

2026
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,840
have their reputations drawn

2027
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,159
dragged through the mud but because it's

2028
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:02,239
too powerful of a tool

2029
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:02,799
to hand it to cnn msnbc princeton

2030
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:05,599
harvard

2031
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,279
the state department yes but is some of

2032
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:11,440
it is also

2033
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:15,039
jp morgan muhammad ali style

2034
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:15,039
being good enough at

2035
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,199
doing everything you need to do without

2036
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,760
giving enough

2037
01:10:19,198 --> 01:10:24,479
meat for the reputational attacks not

2038
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:27,119
being afraid but not giving enough

2039
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:29,119
meat i don't see why the people who have

2040
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:30,079
good ideas have to lead lives that are

2041
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:32,238
that clean

2042
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:33,920
if you can do it you can be messy yeah

2043
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:34,799
you should be able to be messy that

2044
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,880
otherwise

2045
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,880
we're we're suppressing too many people

2046
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,520
too many two billion minds

2047
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,560
yeah can you believe elon musk smoke the

2048
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,520
blood

2049
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,960
i still people tell me this that okay i

2050
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,480
have discussions about elon

2051
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:53,679
and people uh the

2052
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:56,158
avi loeb the harvard scientist

2053
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:58,719
you know who's talking about omoamoa

2054
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:02,079
that it might be alien technology

2055
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:05,119
he told me his

2056
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:08,800
this outside the box thinker yeah

2057
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:12,000
when speaking to me about elon

2058
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:14,960
said called him the guy who smoked

2059
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,399
he smokes weed he's the blunt in a

2060
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,560
dismissive way

2061
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:20,000
like this guy is crazy because he smoked

2062
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,120
some weed

2063
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,238
i was looking at him i was like why

2064
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:27,840
wow wow i think you should be able to

2065
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:30,718
have

2066
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,319
consensual drug-filled orgies

2067
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,158
perfect lives

2068
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:35,840
yeah you should be allowed to be messy

2069
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:37,000
you're right i take back my statement

2070
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:40,159
i'm just saying

2071
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:43,198
respectability is the unique prison

2072
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:44,079
where all of the gates are open and the

2073
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:48,000
inmates

2074
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:50,000
beg to stay inside it's time to end

2075
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,158
their prison of respectability because

2076
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,640
it's too effective of a means of

2077
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:55,759
sidelining and silencing people

2078
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:58,800
including

2079
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:01,840
it is better that we have bad people

2080
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:04,400
in our system than this idea

2081
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,199
of no platforming people who are beyond

2082
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:08,238
the pale

2083
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:09,198
because it's such a simple technique so

2084
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:11,599
how do we uh

2085
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:13,599
what's the heroic action here on the

2086
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,120
well for example having ashley matthews

2087
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,640
on my program

2088
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:22,079
by the way she was absolutely um

2089
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:24,239
delightful as a guest she was

2090
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:25,920
she is polite in the extreme far more

2091
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:28,238
polite than i am

2092
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,000
and i had her right after roger penrose

2093
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:30,959
uh as a guest because i wanted to

2094
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,719
highlight this

2095
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,800
program can go anywhere we can talk to

2096
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:36,960
anyone what about social media you've

2097
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,960
started highlighting people being banned

2098
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,119
on social media

2099
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,480
how do we fight this like if you get

2100
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:44,399
banned from social media so you're

2101
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:45,919
saying nobody will stand up to me

2102
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:47,759
well just figure out what your incentive

2103
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,520
structure is before assume that they're

2104
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,119
assuming i get banned on social media

2105
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,640
because somebody wants to make sure that

2106
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:54,960
my message doesn't

2107
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:57,280
uh interfere with the dominant narrative

2108
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,279
okay

2109
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,920
what will happen by the way i'm very

2110
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:03,359
glad to be able to explain this on your

2111
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,600
show because

2112
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:07,039
that video will presumably be archived

2113
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,159
and they can't easily make

2114
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:11,519
you take it down okay so

2115
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:14,158
what's going to happen is that there'll

2116
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:17,840
be a whole bunch of very low quality

2117
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:19,119
bot like accounts that dog you every

2118
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,760
time you talk about me

2119
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:23,359
right dude it's getting old getting

2120
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,159
boring we already heard you

2121
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:26,960
dude that was like let it go not a good

2122
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:28,960
look

2123
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,719
not a good look it's one of my favorites

2124
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,399
but what about the high profile ones

2125
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,880
well then you'll get a few high-profile

2126
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:38,238
ones and some of the high-profile ones

2127
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:41,199
command armies right like at some point

2128
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:42,559
i had 10 000 people using exactly the

2129
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:44,479
same templated tweet

2130
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,920
uh tweeting at me it was just actually

2131
01:13:44,479 --> 01:13:47,279
it got to the point where it was funny

2132
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,719
because

2133
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:50,639
everybody said did you did you hear that

2134
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,079
in hipster coffee shop i was like

2135
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,560
why are you all suddenly talking about

2136
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:58,000
hipster coffee hilarious

2137
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,719
um those things will cause you to think

2138
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,399
better of it

2139
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:01,840
you'll start to see your follower can't

2140
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:04,319
go down because it's easy

2141
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,840
to give you a bunch of bot like follows

2142
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:09,439
and then just pull them

2143
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:10,719
so i think it's pretty well known how

2144
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:13,279
and then maybe your account will be

2145
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,640
suspended and it can't be revoked and

2146
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:16,158
you know et cetera et cetera and then

2147
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,199
three days later you'll be told it was

2148
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:19,439
an error

2149
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:20,319
so let me push back i just don't see not

2150
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:22,158
defending you

2151
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:23,679
like okay so what are the things you

2152
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:25,839
would do

2153
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:27,679
that given that i can actually talk to

2154
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:30,800
you yeah offline

2155
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:32,158
that that would uh make me not defend

2156
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:35,279
you

2157
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:37,920
uh well it's first of all i can't

2158
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:38,719
i mean no but i can imagine some but all

2159
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,800
of us have

2160
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:43,359
things if somebody says do you hear what

2161
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,840
your boy lex said about you

2162
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:48,158
what what did lex say about me oh he

2163
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:51,440
said you were flawed dude

2164
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:54,639
oh yeah you know

2165
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,799
they so distrust because none of us want

2166
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,239
to stand behind flawed people

2167
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,079
that's why you have everybody rushing to

2168
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:01,039
say i neither condemn nor condone i know

2169
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:03,039
i don't condemn narc

2170
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:04,800
you know why what is that we're all

2171
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,359
trying to say for the record

2172
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,640
i said that eric is smarter than me and

2173
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:11,198
a brilliant human being

2174
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,079
but flawed like all humans are my point

2175
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:14,238
is

2176
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:15,198
i've now come up with a new policy which

2177
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:17,839
is i don't care

2178
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:19,919
what my friends have done i am not

2179
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:21,679
disavowing my friends

2180
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,279
not because they didn't do the wrong

2181
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,679
thing maybe they did do the wrong thing

2182
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:26,479
i don't know what's the value of

2183
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,800
friendship if you

2184
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:30,718
if that's not that like for example

2185
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,560
we've had the situation with brian cowan

2186
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,880
brian cowan was featured recently in the

2187
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,280
los

2188
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,800
angeles times i know nothing about the

2189
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,559
allegations

2190
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,560
i can't i didn't even know brian at the

2191
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,840
time right i've known him for

2192
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,840
roughly the time i've been in los

2193
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,279
angeles maybe a year and a half

2194
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,840
during that period of time never seen

2195
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:49,519
anything wrong

2196
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,119
now i'm in a situation what do you think

2197
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,000
he did do you think he didn't like

2198
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:54,479
you know what i don't know but i do know

2199
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,719
this

2200
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:59,839
everyone's entitled to have friends

2201
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:02,000
because we can't afford isolated people

2202
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,679
and if your friends do the wrong thing

2203
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,520
they're still your friends

2204
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,520
yeah and if they do terrible terrible

2205
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,600
things you bring that up with

2206
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,000
them privately and it's not my

2207
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:15,039
responsibility to disavow in public

2208
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,760
you know we've had this situation that i

2209
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:17,760
don't like

2210
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:19,039
where you know particular people that

2211
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,039
i've been close to

2212
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:22,640
i'm put under tremendous pressure to

2213
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,920
disavow them what do you think now about

2214
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,360
your buddy

2215
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,960
i like dave rube and all that kind of

2216
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:28,960
stuff here's the thing

2217
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,640
just because my friends are my friends i

2218
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:34,158
don't disavow my friends

2219
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:36,239
we all need to make a statement

2220
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:38,879
that we will not be brought under

2221
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:43,039
pressure to disavow our friends

2222
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:46,319
our family members because

2223
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:49,119
mass murderers are dangerous

2224
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:50,158
the more isolated they become it is not

2225
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:53,279
a good idea

2226
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:54,960
to constantly push to isolate people yes

2227
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:57,599
and it's dangerous and so it sends a

2228
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:00,079
signal to everybody else to uh

2229
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,760
to fit in to be more extremely cynical

2230
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:04,238
about the human so my

2231
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,320
i find out you've been selling heroin to

2232
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:08,399
elementary school students

2233
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:10,319
you're still my friend and i will not be

2234
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:11,599
disavowing you and if i have a problem

2235
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:14,000
with you selling heroin

2236
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,520
to elementary school students during

2237
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,960
school hours

2238
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:21,440
i will bring it up with you privately

2239
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,279
because we don't need to hear my voice

2240
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:24,879
added to that condemnation are there

2241
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:27,279
things that you could do

2242
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,159
that would cause me to say actually f

2243
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:30,559
this guy yeah

2244
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:31,279
above and beyond that but simply doing

2245
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,520
the wrong

2246
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:34,639
thing i think we've gone down a terrible

2247
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,239
path

2248
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,920
i think isolated people are about the

2249
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:41,519
most dangerous thing we could have

2250
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,319
in a heavily armed society so i i deeply

2251
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:44,480
agree with you

2252
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:46,000
on brian cowell and on all these people

2253
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:48,959
that quote-unquote got canceled

2254
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,640
uh and i'm not saying that they i don't

2255
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,920
i don't know the truth value because we

2256
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,679
can't

2257
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,279
and even if i did know the truth value

2258
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,800
i'm not setting up an incentive

2259
01:17:55,279 --> 01:18:00,399
structure

2260
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,960
for the personal destruction as a means

2261
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:03,439
of letting

2262
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,119
institutions combat the fact that

2263
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:08,000
individuals are the last thing that can

2264
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:09,599
say none of you guys make any sense

2265
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:12,238
i don't treat these things like you know

2266
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,840
i had a conversation where kevin spacey

2267
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:15,439
was at the dinner table when i came down

2268
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,600
from a hotel room

2269
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:19,119
and i had a very long conversation with

2270
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,760
kevin spacey i will not

2271
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:23,439
detail because i don't do that as to

2272
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,440
what we discussed

2273
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:26,960
but we talked very specifically about

2274
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:29,279
him being cancelled

2275
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,600
and i don't think that the world has

2276
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:34,158
heard that story in part because

2277
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,600
there is a very strong sense that he has

2278
01:18:34,158 --> 01:18:38,839
to be outgrouped

2279
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:41,039
and as a result you know i mean do we

2280
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,800
want

2281
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:44,479
do we want to disavow the space program

2282
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,079
because it touched verner von braun do

2283
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:47,678
we want to disavow quantum mechanics

2284
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:49,198
because pascal jordan and werner

2285
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:51,199
heisenberg pass through it

2286
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:52,879
is erin fess theorem false because he

2287
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:55,678
murdered his child

2288
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,319
i mean at what point do we recognize

2289
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:59,840
that

2290
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:02,319
we are the problem humans are humans and

2291
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,000
there is no perfect there is no perfect

2292
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:06,079
group of people even all of the most

2293
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,840
oppressed people the supposed victims of

2294
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:08,880
the world who we now have fetishized

2295
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,640
into thinking that they're all

2296
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,920
oracles because their lived experience

2297
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,360
informs us

2298
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,079
and their pain is more salient than

2299
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:17,679
everyone else's pain

2300
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:19,679
those people aren't necessarily great

2301
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:22,560
people you know

2302
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:23,920
it's like none none of us we can't we

2303
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,840
can't do this

2304
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,520
in this fashion so when we sit down to

2305
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:29,760
have a conversation

2306
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,840
across the table from somebody you

2307
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,440
should be willing to

2308
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,199
like you should not have npr in your

2309
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:36,639
mind you should be willing to take the

2310
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:39,439
full risk

2311
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,760
and to see the good in the person

2312
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:43,279
without with limited information

2313
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,840
and to do your best to understand that

2314
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:48,238
person everybody is entitled to a

2315
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,239
hypocrisy budget

2316
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:51,359
i don't believe this is of institutions

2317
01:19:50,238 --> 01:19:53,359
yeah okay

2318
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:56,079
everybody is entitled to a certain

2319
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:58,559
amount of screwing up in life

2320
01:19:56,079 --> 01:20:01,679
you're entitled to a mendacity budget

2321
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:05,520
you're entitled to an aggression budget

2322
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:06,880
the idea of getting rid of everybody is

2323
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,560
you know people haven't even blown

2324
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,800
through their budgets and we're already

2325
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,920
yeah i i think about for example one

2326
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,840
person uh

2327
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,440
i'd be curious to get your thoughts

2328
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,800
about alex jones

2329
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:18,000
let's not talk about alex jones for a

2330
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,520
second let's talk about the national

2331
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,520
enquirer

2332
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,199
is everything the national enquirer says

2333
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,159
false

2334
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:28,399
uh no okay do you remember the john

2335
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:32,000
edwards story

2336
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:33,119
uh his wife sorry he had a child from an

2337
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,319
extramarital affair

2338
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:39,198
yes i believe that the national enquirer

2339
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:39,198
broke the story

2340
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,960
and then what does the new york times do

2341
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:44,319
the new york times i think is

2342
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,158
allowed to report that the national

2343
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:47,519
maguire is making a claim

2344
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:49,519
that way they don't have to substantiate

2345
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:52,000
the story so

2346
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,440
why is the new york times talking to

2347
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,760
mike cernovich

2348
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:57,599
or using the national enquirer as a

2349
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,960
source are they using alex jones as the

2350
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,960
source

2351
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,560
who here's the big problem that we're

2352
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,800
having

2353
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,679
why are certain people entitled to talk

2354
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,600
to everybody

2355
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,199
and other people are entitled to talk to

2356
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,120
no one i don't really understand

2357
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:13,279
this is an indulgence system this is how

2358
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,880
the catholic church used to do things

2359
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:16,639
it's hard to fight the system because

2360
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,480
the reason you don't talk to alex jones

2361
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:20,319
is because the platforms on which you do

2362
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:23,119
the communication will

2363
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:23,840
will de-platform but i'm not platformed

2364
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:26,800
i used to

2365
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,679
i used to do npr and i used to do the

2366
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,800
newshour

2367
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:32,960
and i used to provide stories to

2368
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,119
washington post new york times that has

2369
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,800
gone away they've circled the wagons

2370
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:38,880
closer and closer

2371
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,480
and more of us are unacceptable and

2372
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,039
right now i have no question that

2373
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:44,238
they're

2374
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:45,840
going through anybody who has a platform

2375
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:47,279
trying to say okay what do we have

2376
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,639
against that person in case we need to

2377
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:50,960
shut that down

2378
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:52,159
we have to make a different decision lex

2379
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:56,399
and the different decision

2380
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:59,119
is that it doesn't matter how many times

2381
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:00,000
joe said the n word yeah it doesn't

2382
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:03,198
matter

2383
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,760
that somebody else you know

2384
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:07,198
like with mathematical theorems if the

2385
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,520
worst person in the world proves a

2386
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:12,719
mathematical theorem like the unabomber

2387
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:15,600
we can't undo the theorem yeah you know

2388
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,600
and i point out charles manson's song

2389
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,400
look at your game girl is an amazing

2390
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,840
song

2391
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:21,920
it's a really good song i don't think

2392
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,600
it's one of the greatest songs ever

2393
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,199
but it happens that he wasn't a no

2394
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,840
talent

2395
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:29,119
and you know i don't know how hitler was

2396
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,560
as an artist

2397
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:33,599
it's actually not bad okay we've got to

2398
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,520
get past this

2399
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,280
we've got to get past this idea that

2400
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,880
we're going to purge ourselves of our

2401
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:41,359
badness and we're just gonna

2402
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,440
this is like i've likened it to teenage

2403
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:46,399
girls and cutting we're just

2404
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:47,678
all we're doing is destroying ourselves

2405
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:49,839
in search of perfection

2406
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:52,000
and the answer is no we're not perfect

2407
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,679
we're flawed we're screwed up

2408
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,279
and we've always been this way and we're

2409
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:57,600
not going to silence everyone

2410
01:22:55,279 --> 01:22:58,719
who you can point a laser beam at and

2411
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,960
say well that person

2412
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:02,079
look at how bad that person is if we do

2413
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,079
that

2414
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:07,279
kiss the whole thing goodbye we might as

2415
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:09,198
well just let's learn chinese

2416
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:10,399
but there is an art to having those

2417
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:13,119
messy conversations

2418
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:14,479
whether with with alex or anybody else

2419
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:16,639
okay let's talk about alex

2420
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:19,039
yeah there's particular stuff that alex

2421
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:20,159
does that's absolutely nauseating

2422
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:22,079
and there's other stuff that he's doing

2423
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:23,839
that's funny the methodology of

2424
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:25,359
of the way he carries and sometimes he's

2425
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,560
talking about the truth

2426
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:28,559
and sometimes he's talking about a

2427
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:30,320
conspiracy theory his variance is

2428
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,239
incredibly high

2429
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:34,319
the right way to approach alex jones or

2430
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:36,079
james o'keefe or the national enquirer

2431
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:39,519
anything you don't like

2432
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:43,039
is to say great go long short

2433
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,760
i mean well if you invest in a mutual

2434
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:45,600
fund

2435
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,800
all the stocks in the mutual fund are

2436
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,120
held long

2437
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:51,119
but if you invest in a hedge fund you do

2438
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:53,119
something called relative value trade

2439
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:54,158
it's like well you long tech or short

2440
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:57,198
tech

2441
01:23:54,158 --> 01:24:00,638
well actually i'm long microsoft and i'm

2442
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:02,319
short google why is that oh because i

2443
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:04,480
believe google got way

2444
01:24:02,319 --> 01:24:06,000
too much attention and that microsoft

2445
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:08,000
has been unfairly maligned

2446
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,359
and so this is really a play on legacy

2447
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:13,359
tech over

2448
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:15,039
more modern tech okay which part of alex

2449
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:16,399
jones are you long and which part are

2450
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:18,238
you short one of the things that should

2451
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:18,879
be a requirement for being a reporter is

2452
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:21,439
like what

2453
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,560
what did donald trump do that was good

2454
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:25,279
nothing

2455
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:28,239
okay then you're not a reporter what did

2456
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:28,238
hitler do that was good

2457
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:33,039
the rosenstrasse protest

2458
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:39,198
non-jewish women campaign for their

2459
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:43,280
jewish men to be returned home to them

2460
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:44,960
from certain death almost in death camps

2461
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:46,479
it should have been that not there were

2462
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,560
no death camps it should have been that

2463
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:51,599
everybody was returned home

2464
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,440
but you know what the fact that the the

2465
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:56,079
women of the rosen straw support

2466
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:57,359
i mean sorry i get very emotional about

2467
01:24:56,079 --> 01:25:00,559
you know some of the baddest ass

2468
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:03,839
chicks in the world got

2469
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:05,199
their husbands returned to them cola

2470
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:08,639
could vote

2471
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:09,519
and not i'm not celebrating hitler

2472
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:12,480
hitler's

2473
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:13,360
the worst of the worst but god damn it

2474
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:15,519
you know

2475
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:17,679
this idea that we can just say

2476
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:20,719
everything that person does is a lie

2477
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:23,359
everything that person does is evil

2478
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:26,319
this reflects a simplicity of mind that

2479
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:28,639
humanity cannot afford

2480
01:25:26,319 --> 01:25:30,559
or is is google evil because it will

2481
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:32,319
sell you mind conf

2482
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,480
is amazon evil because it will sell you

2483
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:35,759
mind conf if you find out that mineconf

2484
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:38,238
rests on somebody's bookshelf do you

2485
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,840
have any idea what it means

2486
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:41,279
if you find out that a scholar used the

2487
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:43,600
n-word

2488
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:44,800
should that person lose their job come

2489
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:48,079
on

2490
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:50,000
grow the hell up i guess our

2491
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:50,719
responsibility to lead by example on

2492
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,039
that

2493
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:54,000
because you have to acknowledge that the

2494
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:56,000
fact like the

2495
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:00,000
the current have somebody on your

2496
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
podcast who you're worried about

2497
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,159
and but but yeah but do it in a

2498
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,319
principled fashion i mean in other words

2499
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:10,479
i'm not here to whitewash

2500
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:12,158
yeah everything on the other hand

2501
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:14,319
if somebody makes you know some

2502
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:16,638
allegations

2503
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:19,119
i don't know that i'm obligated to treat

2504
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:20,880
every set of allegations as if

2505
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:23,198
now how do you defend yourself against

2506
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,480
no allegations are so cheap to make at

2507
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,960
this moment

2508
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,959
well my sort of my standard i don't know

2509
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,560
maybe you could speak to it is

2510
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:33,760
i don't care like in the case of alex

2511
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:35,280
jones for example i don't

2512
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,360
i'm willing to have a conversation with

2513
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:39,679
alex jones and people like him

2514
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:40,479
if i know he's not going to try to

2515
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,520
manipulate me

2516
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:43,759
assume that he is going to try to

2517
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,199
manipulate you i can't then then we're

2518
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,760
not going to be two humans

2519
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:49,759
okay but lex i want you to think well of

2520
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,000
me i put on a jacket i don't usually

2521
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,119
wear

2522
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,600
a jacket okay um thank you eric

2523
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:56,880
all right i'm trying to manipulate you

2524
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,280
there's an entire

2525
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,920
field no there's an entire field that

2526
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:02,000
says that

2527
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:03,440
speech may be best thought of as an

2528
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,399
attempt to manipulate

2529
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:08,479
each other this is too simplistic

2530
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:12,079
everything that we keep talking through

2531
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:12,959
yes you know better than this i disagree

2532
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:16,559
i i think

2533
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:18,880
i think there's ways there's

2534
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,400
of course it's a gray area but there is

2535
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,400
a threshold

2536
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:23,920
where your intent with which you come to

2537
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:27,759
a meeting to an

2538
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:30,960
interaction is one that is not

2539
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:32,880
one that's grounded in like a respect

2540
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,480
for a common humanity like a love for

2541
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,719
each other as deeply messy

2542
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:38,718
if somebody is doing really bad stuff i

2543
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,560
expect you to try to keep them from

2544
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:42,800
doing really bad stuff

2545
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,840
but you know just keep in mind that when

2546
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:47,000
i was a

2547
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:50,319
younger man i saw an amazing

2548
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,719
anti-pornography document documentary

2549
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:55,039
and it was called rate it x and i don't

2550
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:57,439
know where it went

2551
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:59,439
but the conceit of it was we're going to

2552
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:00,879
get some pornographers

2553
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:02,719
in front of a camera because they want

2554
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,560
to talk and we're going to ask them

2555
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:07,840
about what they do for a living

2556
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:10,880
and why it's okay

2557
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,880
no commentary

2558
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:18,239
okay you could potentially if you really

2559
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:20,238
think alex jones is the worst and

2560
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:21,599
again i'm not intimately familiar with

2561
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:25,759
him

2562
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,760
you could decide to

2563
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:31,600
um let him talk

2564
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,440
now i have decided not to do that with

2565
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:35,280
particular people

2566
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:36,879
you know i've spoken to stefan molyneux

2567
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:39,279
stefan molyneux makes many

2568
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:41,119
good points and makes many bad points

2569
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:42,238
and he makes many good points in bad

2570
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:44,399
ways

2571
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:46,718
and i worry about it and i don't feel

2572
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:47,279
that it's it's not my obligation to make

2573
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:49,279
sure that

2574
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:51,198
stefan molyneux has a voice on the

2575
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:54,319
portal

2576
01:28:51,198 --> 01:28:57,039
but i did stand up and say i didn't want

2577
01:28:54,319 --> 01:28:58,719
him banned from social media

2578
01:28:57,039 --> 01:29:00,479
and i do think that a lot of the people

2579
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:02,000
who are being banned from social media

2580
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:03,599
were worried that they're right rather

2581
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,158
than that they're wrong

2582
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,719
i certainly don't really think that i'm

2583
01:29:06,158 --> 01:29:10,000
worried

2584
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:11,119
in some sense that some of the really

2585
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,960
wrong people are wrong but you know if

2586
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:15,039
you look at for example curtis yarvin

2587
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:17,359
there's a tremendous amount of interest

2588
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:19,119
is eric gonna speak to curtis jarvin

2589
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:20,000
curtis yarman says many interesting

2590
01:29:19,119 --> 01:29:21,840
things

2591
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,600
and he says many horrible stupid things

2592
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:26,560
very provocative

2593
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:28,239
and i don't i haven't even i haven't

2594
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,080
invited him onto the portal

2595
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:31,839
but i haven't said i will never invite

2596
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:34,800
him on to the portal

2597
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:35,679
we are all in a difficult position

2598
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,679
that's what i'm saying

2599
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:39,199
you're making it kind of i think it's a

2600
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:41,920
much more difficult task

2601
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:43,678
that and burden will carry as people who

2602
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:46,399
have conversations because

2603
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,119
courtesy aaron is a good example how

2604
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:48,879
much

2605
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:50,960
work do i have to put in reading

2606
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,480
curtis's work to really

2607
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,560
understand about the problem of curtis

2608
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:56,638
jarvin yes because i think it's probably

2609
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,400
illustrative there's this big question

2610
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:00,880
is why does somebody who says such

2611
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:01,759
stupid ass things listened to by so many

2612
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,600
people

2613
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:05,199
very smart people people who are part of

2614
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,679
our daily lives discuss

2615
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:08,960
curtis yarvin in hush tones now let's

2616
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:11,520
see a question

2617
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,000
my belief is that curtis yarvin has made

2618
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,320
a

2619
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,679
number of very interesting provocative

2620
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:18,238
points

2621
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:20,399
and they associate curtis yarvin as the

2622
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:23,119
person who has made these points

2623
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:24,479
and they treat the completely asinine

2624
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:26,158
stuff that he says that's super

2625
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:29,359
dangerous

2626
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:31,599
as well that's curtis

2627
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:32,639
right right they give him the credit for

2628
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,400
he he's he's

2629
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,319
kind of like sorry to use the term first

2630
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:39,198
principles deep thinker about

2631
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:39,920
in some way in some space about the

2632
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:41,919
world

2633
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,199
yeah but as a result we don't actually

2634
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:46,960
know

2635
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:51,039
why curtis yarvin is knocking around

2636
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:52,960
so many silicon valley luminaries lives

2637
01:30:51,039 --> 01:30:54,960
what's see see you said that he said a

2638
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:56,800
lot of sni stupid stuff and that's the

2639
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,560
sense i got from a few things i've read

2640
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,920
not just about it this is not just like

2641
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:02,080
wikipedia stuff

2642
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,119
is he he's a little like i've said

2643
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:05,920
before

2644
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:06,399
he seems to be careless i don't think

2645
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,840
he's care

2646
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:12,319
no no it's like jim watson jim watson

2647
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:14,480
wants to say very provocative things in

2648
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:17,439
order to prove that he's free

2649
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:18,479
it's not question of careless he enjoys

2650
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:21,039
yeah the freedom

2651
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:22,879
to say these things yeah and the key

2652
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:25,279
point is is that there's i expect

2653
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:27,760
something more of curtis

2654
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:29,039
i expect that if somebody is insightful

2655
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:32,480
about all sorts of things

2656
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:34,238
up to that point that they're going to

2657
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:36,079
have enough care now i for example make

2658
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:37,119
this point repeatedly that vaccines are

2659
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:40,479
not 100

2660
01:31:37,119 --> 01:31:42,079
safe most people who have an idea that

2661
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:43,678
anybody is an anti-vaxxer should be

2662
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:46,079
silenced

2663
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:47,840
are in a position where they they they

2664
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:48,158
probably don't say vaccines are 100 say

2665
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,679
but

2666
01:31:48,158 --> 01:31:51,759
you keep finding that statement over and

2667
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:54,000
over again like believe all women

2668
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,600
vaccines are 100 safe climate science is

2669
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,439
settled science

2670
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:00,480
whatever this mountain bailey is where

2671
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:02,879
you make extraordinarily

2672
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:04,799
vapid blanket claims and then you

2673
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,920
retreat into something well defund the

2674
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,960
pull you know we don't want

2675
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:11,920
no more police actually just means we

2676
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:14,239
want the police to not take on mental

2677
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,760
health duties

2678
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:17,519
we've come up with an incredibly

2679
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:20,719
disingenuous society

2680
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:22,400
and what i'm claiming is is that i might

2681
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:25,198
talk to curtis yarvin

2682
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:26,319
but i have really very little interest

2683
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:28,719
to talk to a guy

2684
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:30,399
who seems to be kind of giddy about who

2685
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:31,198
makes good slaves and who makes bad

2686
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:32,960
slaves

2687
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:34,238
it's like why do i want to do that on

2688
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:37,039
the portal

2689
01:32:34,238 --> 01:32:37,759
one first of all because just as you

2690
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:40,158
said

2691
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,600
that's not curtis's main thing he has a

2692
01:32:40,158 --> 01:32:44,319
lot of ideas and

2693
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:46,000
uh what i've read of him which is not a

2694
01:32:44,319 --> 01:32:48,399
huge amount

2695
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,600
is there's he's very thoughtful about

2696
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:52,319
the way this world

2697
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:54,560
works and on top of that he's an

2698
01:32:52,319 --> 01:32:57,119
important historical figure

2699
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:58,080
in the birth and the development of the

2700
01:32:57,119 --> 01:32:59,519
alt-right or

2701
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:01,679
what would be called our right the new

2702
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:05,360
reaction yeah and there's

2703
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:07,440
so he's just an important intellectual

2704
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:08,799
and so it makes sense to talk to him the

2705
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:11,039
question is

2706
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,639
how much work do you put in well this is

2707
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:15,119
the issue of fugu

2708
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:15,840
i'm not a chef that necessarily can

2709
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:19,920
serve that

2710
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:22,000
fugu so you have you have a puffer fish

2711
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:24,239
you can eat the puffer fish you can you

2712
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,960
can get a kind of a tingly sensation on

2713
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:26,079
your tongue

2714
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:28,480
if you get a little bit of the poison

2715
01:33:26,079 --> 01:33:29,119
organ but my point is i don't know how

2716
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:31,919
to serve

2717
01:33:29,119 --> 01:33:32,800
curtis yarvin yeah so that in fact i'm

2718
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:35,359
not worried

2719
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,079
about what happens and i believe that if

2720
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,719
somebody else

2721
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:39,279
was a student of the new reactionary

2722
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:40,719
movement

2723
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:42,880
that person might be in a better

2724
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:44,719
position to host curtis yarwin

2725
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:47,279
so somebody that's a really good example

2726
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:49,359
somebody i think you've spoken with

2727
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:51,039
uh that's an intermediary that's a

2728
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:52,639
powerful one is michael malus and he's

2729
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:55,119
spoken with curtis jarvin

2730
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:56,960
and uh michael wrote a book about by the

2731
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:58,559
way michael somewhat changed my mind

2732
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:01,359
about michael malus

2733
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,760
i'm glad he did i think i i would call

2734
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:04,880
him

2735
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:06,639
a friend and i think he's a underneath

2736
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,960
it all

2737
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:10,960
a really kind human being and i think

2738
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:13,039
your skepticism about him was initially

2739
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,000
from a surface level of what did you

2740
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:16,840
call him hyenas

2741
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,600
the trolls and so on i'm not happy about

2742
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:21,600
his

2743
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,039
it's been so long since i've seen good

2744
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:26,320
trolls

2745
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:28,639
yes so he

2746
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:30,158
he needs a higher quality of trolling

2747
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:33,760
but he aspires to that

2748
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:37,198
i mean it you know disagree or not

2749
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:39,760
i really enjoy how much care

2750
01:34:37,198 --> 01:34:40,799
he puts into the work he does like on

2751
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,280
north korea and

2752
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,480
study of the world and how much

2753
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:47,279
privately

2754
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:47,759
but also in public love he has for

2755
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:50,158
people

2756
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:51,679
especially those who are powerless yeah

2757
01:34:50,158 --> 01:34:55,198
just like genuine

2758
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:58,319
admiration for them uh for but yeah

2759
01:34:55,198 --> 01:34:58,799
i think curtis actually does too i don't

2760
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:00,079
know

2761
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:02,320
i mean you have to appreciate the first

2762
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:02,800
time i met curtis he introduced to me

2763
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:04,319
says

2764
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:06,239
i'm the most right-wing person you've

2765
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:07,439
ever met i was just like

2766
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:10,399
well this is a conversation that's

2767
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:12,799
already over it's theatrical

2768
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:14,319
in a way that's not conducted to

2769
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,639
actually having a real well it just

2770
01:35:14,319 --> 01:35:17,118
actually

2771
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:18,000
turned me so it turned me off because it

2772
01:35:17,118 --> 01:35:19,359
was like

2773
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,118
you need to be the most right-wing

2774
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:22,158
person and so it's like i'm a troll i'm

2775
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:24,319
a troll

2776
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:25,839
yeah okay why are we doing this yeah but

2777
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:28,399
what i'm trying to get is different

2778
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:29,600
i'm trying to say that michael malus is

2779
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:31,359
a friend of yours if you found out

2780
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,960
something terrible

2781
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:34,399
you should be a friend you should still

2782
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,880
continue to be his friend

2783
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:38,000
and you know and michael's case is very

2784
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,600
likely that we'll find

2785
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,039
out something curtis is an acquaintance

2786
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,480
of mine because he hangs around with

2787
01:35:41,039 --> 01:35:44,960
some people that i know

2788
01:35:42,479 --> 01:35:48,638
i did not get it i've started to

2789
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:51,198
understand why the people in my life

2790
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:53,840
some of them are curtis yarvin fans many

2791
01:35:51,198 --> 01:35:57,118
of them disregard the stupid stuff

2792
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:59,279
but my feeling is is that too much

2793
01:35:57,118 --> 01:36:00,559
poison organ not enough fish

2794
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:02,880
i don't know how to serve that too

2795
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,639
intermingled i'm not your chef

2796
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,639
speaking for defending your friends

2797
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:10,000
staying with your friends

2798
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:12,880
and uh bringing the old band uh together

2799
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,560
again you uh coined the term idw

2800
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:17,520
intellectual dark web

2801
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,560
uh i like it it's it represents a

2802
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,920
certain group of

2803
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:25,199
people that are struggling with the

2804
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:28,000
that are almost like a challenge

2805
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:29,279
the norms of social and political

2806
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
discourse

2807
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:33,920
from all different angles right what do

2808
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,439
you think is the state of the idw what

2809
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:38,800
do you think is its future

2810
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:41,359
is it still a useful

2811
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:43,199
well it never exists is it a protocol is

2812
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:43,920
it a collection of people featured in an

2813
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:46,399
article

2814
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,158
what i learned very clearly is that

2815
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:48,638
there's a tremendous desire in the

2816
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:50,559
internet

2817
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:52,960
age to pin people down what do you say

2818
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:56,000
who's in it what are the criterion

2819
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,520
it's like i understand you want to play

2820
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,760
the demarcation game and you want to

2821
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:03,520
make everything that is demarcated

2822
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:06,079
instantly null and void no thank you so

2823
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:07,600
i resisted saying who was in it i

2824
01:37:06,079 --> 01:37:09,439
resisted saying what it was

2825
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:12,480
i resisted saying that barry weiss's

2826
01:37:09,439 --> 01:37:16,079
article was the definitive thing

2827
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:17,678
you know they chose a ridiculous concept

2828
01:37:16,079 --> 01:37:18,158
for the photographs that we couldn't get

2829
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:20,000
out of

2830
01:37:18,158 --> 01:37:21,679
i did not want those photographs taken

2831
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,359
and they decided that the pulitzer

2832
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:24,800
prize-winning photographer needed to

2833
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:27,439
take them all at twilight

2834
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,480
you know i don't know some such thing i

2835
01:37:27,439 --> 01:37:29,039
didn't even necessarily want to do the

2836
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:31,279
article

2837
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:32,079
um barry convinced me that it was the

2838
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:35,039
right thing to do

2839
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:36,079
undoubtedly barry was right i was wrong

2840
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:39,279
but

2841
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:40,399
the key point is nothing can grow in

2842
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:43,359
this environment

2843
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:44,399
there's a reason we're not building it

2844
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:47,839
does not appear

2845
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:49,839
that we found a way to grow anything

2846
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:52,079
organic and good and decent that we need

2847
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:54,639
right now and that's kind of the key

2848
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:56,800
issue who's the we do you mean us as a

2849
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:58,960
society those of us who wish to have

2850
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,800
a future for our great grandchildren

2851
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,399
let's let's let's take the subset of

2852
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:06,320
people who are worried

2853
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:06,319
about things long after their demise

2854
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:11,360
but do you think it's useful to have a

2855
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:17,600
term like the idw to capture some

2856
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:20,719
set of people some set of ideas

2857
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,679
or maybe principles that capture what i

2858
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:23,600
think the idw

2859
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:25,039
okay you can say it's not supposed to

2860
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,520
mean it doesn't exist it doesn't mean

2861
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:28,079
anything

2862
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,960
but to the public to me okay i'll just

2863
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:32,079
speak to me

2864
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:33,920
it represented something yeah i i it uh

2865
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:34,319
represented i think i just said this to

2866
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,359
you

2867
01:38:34,319 --> 01:38:39,759
it's my in my first attempt

2868
01:38:37,359 --> 01:38:40,559
to interview the great eric weinstein uh

2869
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,800
i said that

2870
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,239
uh i spoke this about you but iew in

2871
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,279
general is trying to point out the

2872
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:46,718
elephant in the room

2873
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:48,238
or that the emperor has no clothes the

2874
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:49,279
set of people that do that in their own

2875
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:50,799
way

2876
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:53,759
if there are multiple elephants in the

2877
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,960
room yes the point is is that the idw

2878
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,199
was more interested in seeing the

2879
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,000
totality of elephants and trying to

2880
01:38:57,198 --> 01:38:59,599
figure out

2881
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,960
how do we move forward as opposed to

2882
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,560
saying i can spot the other guy's

2883
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,279
elephant in the room but i can't see my

2884
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,679
own

2885
01:39:03,279 --> 01:39:07,679
right and you know in large measure we

2886
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:10,639
didn't represent

2887
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:11,279
an institutional base and therefore it

2888
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:12,880
wasn't

2889
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:14,719
maximally important that we look at our

2890
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:18,480
own hypocrisy because

2891
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:20,319
we weren't on the institutional spectrum

2892
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:22,158
this is where friendship comes into play

2893
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:25,279
with the different figures that

2894
01:39:22,158 --> 01:39:27,198
are loosely associated with idw is you

2895
01:39:25,279 --> 01:39:30,559
were somehow

2896
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:32,399
uh responsible for

2897
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:34,480
you know the the exactly thing that you

2898
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:36,960
said did you hear what

2899
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:38,479
i don't know i forgive you dame oh who

2900
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,600
what sam harris said about

2901
01:39:38,479 --> 01:39:45,599
idw yeah that that kind of thing is

2902
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:48,560
why chuckled lovingly or chuckled like

2903
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:50,560
or i was angry at some people who had

2904
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:51,600
said things that caused sam to say what

2905
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:54,000
sam said about

2906
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:55,679
turning his imaginary club membership

2907
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,960
into the idw

2908
01:39:55,679 --> 01:40:00,800
people said very silly things and

2909
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:02,639
you know i think that there is just this

2910
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:05,119
confusion that

2911
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:06,480
um integrity means calling out your

2912
01:40:05,118 --> 01:40:09,599
friends in

2913
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:12,238
in front of the world right and you know

2914
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,840
i've been pretty clear about this uh i

2915
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:16,158
try to choose my friends carefully

2916
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:17,679
and if you would like to recuse me

2917
01:40:16,158 --> 01:40:18,559
because i'm not a source of reliable

2918
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:22,000
information

2919
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:24,080
people that i know and love the most um

2920
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,600
maybe that's reasonable for you maybe

2921
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:26,639
you prefer somebody who was willing to

2922
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,000
throw a friend

2923
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:30,159
under the bus at the first sign of

2924
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
trouble by all means

2925
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:33,519
uh exit my feed you don't have to

2926
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,960
subscribe to me if that's

2927
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:38,880
if that's your concept of integrity

2928
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,560
you're barking up the wrong tree what i

2929
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:42,159
will say is that i knew these people

2930
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:44,480
well enough to know that they're all

2931
01:40:42,158 --> 01:40:47,198
flawed

2932
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:48,079
thank you for the call back and uh but

2933
01:40:47,198 --> 01:40:52,559
the issue is

2934
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:55,039
that um i love people who are flawed

2935
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,600
and i love people who have to earn a

2936
01:40:55,039 --> 01:40:57,118
living

2937
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,880
even if you call them a grifter and i

2938
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:01,839
love people who

2939
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:03,600
uh you know like the fact that donald

2940
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,000
trump didn't get us into new wars even

2941
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:08,320
if you call

2942
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:11,198
them alt-right i love the fact that

2943
01:41:08,319 --> 01:41:13,198
some people believe in structural

2944
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:15,118
oppression and want to fight it even if

2945
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:16,399
they're not woke because they don't

2946
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:18,880
believe that structural oppression is

2947
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:20,960
hiding everywhere

2948
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,239
i care and love different people in

2949
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,760
different ways and i just

2950
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:25,359
i think that you know the overarching

2951
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,000
thing lacks that we're not getting at is

2952
01:41:25,359 --> 01:41:28,880
that

2953
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:30,880
we were sold a bill of goods that you

2954
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:33,440
can go through life

2955
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,560
like an eliza program with

2956
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:38,000
pre-programmed

2957
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:41,119
responses well it's what about ism

2958
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,600
it's both scientism it's all right

2959
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:44,479
it's the looney left it's campus madness

2960
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:47,360
you know it's like

2961
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:48,559
okay why don't you just empty the entire

2962
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:52,599
goddamn

2963
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:57,520
magazine all of those

2964
01:41:52,600 --> 01:42:00,639
pre-recorded snips

2965
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:02,159
now that you've done all of that now we

2966
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:05,920
can have a conversation

2967
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:09,839
your son put it really well which is we

2968
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:13,199
should in all things resist labels

2969
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,880
but we can't deal without labels we have

2970
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:18,319
to generalize

2971
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:20,000
but we also have to keep in mind that

2972
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:21,198
just the way in science you deal with an

2973
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,439
effective theory that isn't a

2974
01:42:21,198 --> 01:42:25,359
fundamental one

2975
01:42:23,439 --> 01:42:27,198
in science most of our theories we

2976
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:30,719
consider to be effective theories

2977
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:33,919
if i generalize about about europe

2978
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:37,039
about women about

2979
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:40,000
you know christians those things

2980
01:42:37,039 --> 01:42:41,600
have to be understood to mean something

2981
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,760
and not to have their

2982
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:45,440
definitions extend so broadly that they

2983
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:49,280
mean

2984
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:51,118
nothing at all nor um

2985
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:54,880
that they're so rigid that their claims

2986
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:56,079
that clearly won't bear scrutiny

2987
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,920
lex what do you really want to talk

2988
01:42:56,079 --> 01:42:58,238
about that's my always my question to

2989
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,840
you

2990
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:01,919
that always gets me that's a good thing

2991
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,000
maybe you are the therapist

2992
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:05,679
but like you and i could talk about

2993
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,920
anything people love

2994
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:09,199
up until now at least people have loved

2995
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:10,639
listening to the two of us in

2996
01:43:09,198 --> 01:43:12,479
conversation

2997
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:16,159
and my feeling is is that we're not

2998
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:19,198
talking about neural nets

2999
01:43:16,158 --> 01:43:21,039
we're not talking about geometric unity

3000
01:43:19,198 --> 01:43:23,359
and we're not talking about where

3001
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:24,960
distributed computing might go

3002
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:28,000
and i don't think that we're really

3003
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:28,000
focused on

3004
01:43:28,079 --> 01:43:30,960
some of the most exciting things we

3005
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:32,158
could do to transform education we're

3006
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,800
still caught

3007
01:43:32,158 --> 01:43:35,839
in this world of other people that we

3008
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,840
don't belong

3009
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:39,760
i don't belong in the world as it's been

3010
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:43,199
created i'm trying to build a new world

3011
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:44,960
and i'm astounded

3012
01:43:43,198 --> 01:43:46,879
that the people with the independent

3013
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,639
means to help build that world are so

3014
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:50,840
demotivated

3015
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:52,079
that they don't want to build new

3016
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,760
structures

3017
01:43:52,079 --> 01:43:56,079
and the people who do want to build new

3018
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:57,920
structures seem to be wild-eyed

3019
01:43:56,079 --> 01:43:59,679
while i do what do you mean by wild eyed

3020
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:01,760
they're not they're not i guarantee you

3021
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:03,359
that i will get some message in my dms

3022
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:05,840
it says hey eric

3023
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:06,399
you know i'm a third year chemistry

3024
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:09,679
student

3025
01:44:06,399 --> 01:44:11,759
at uh you know south dakota state and

3026
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:13,199
i've got a great idea i just need

3027
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,800
funding i want to build

3028
01:44:13,198 --> 01:44:16,319
they don't have the means so the people

3029
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,239
who have the means

3030
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:20,158
or the sophistication you know it's like

3031
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:22,238
you're looking for somebody

3032
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:23,679
who's proven themselves a few times to

3033
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:26,479
say you know i've got four billion

3034
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:28,560
dollars behind me

3035
01:44:26,479 --> 01:44:30,718
that's soft circled i want to figure out

3036
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:32,400
what a new university would be

3037
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:34,239
and what it would take to protect

3038
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:34,638
academic freedom and who we would hire

3039
01:44:34,238 --> 01:44:36,238
and what

3040
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:37,520
what are the different characteristics

3041
01:44:36,238 --> 01:44:38,799
because i can clearly see that

3042
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,000
everything following the current model

3043
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:43,119
is falling apart

3044
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,439
nobody in my understanding is saying

3045
01:44:43,118 --> 01:44:46,479
that

3046
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:49,519
nobody is saying um

3047
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:50,959
let's take that which is functioning

3048
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,840
independently

3049
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:54,560
and make it less vulnerable let's boost

3050
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:57,840
those

3051
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:58,800
those signals and a critical component

3052
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,400
as money you think

3053
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,079
it's not only that but it's also a kind

3054
01:45:00,399 --> 01:45:04,559
of these people

3055
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:05,760
are mobbed up hands off let's imagine

3056
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,520
for the moment

3057
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:12,239
that sunder pichai jack dorsey and mark

3058
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,239
zuckerberg

3059
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:20,079
founded a university come

3060
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:21,600
social media entity

3061
01:45:20,079 --> 01:45:23,519
and they said this is the purpose of

3062
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:25,280
this is to make sure that academic

3063
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:26,880
freedom will not perish from this earth

3064
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:28,639
because it's necessary to keep us from

3065
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:31,679
all going crazy

3066
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:32,639
we are going to lock ourselves out we've

3067
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:35,440
come up with this

3068
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:37,359
governance system and the idea is is

3069
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:39,359
that these people will be

3070
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:41,279
assigned the difficult task of making

3071
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:42,960
sure that society doesn't go crazy in

3072
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:45,639
any particular direction that we have a

3073
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:48,960
fact-based reality-based

3074
01:45:45,639 --> 01:45:50,079
feasibility-based understanding we can

3075
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:53,039
try to figure out where our real

3076
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:53,039
opportunities are

3077
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:57,840
so it feels like everybody with a posi

3078
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,158
with the ability to do something like

3079
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,600
that

3080
01:45:58,158 --> 01:46:02,960
and with the with the brains and

3081
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:06,159
experience and the resources

3082
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:07,840
would rather sit in the current system

3083
01:46:06,158 --> 01:46:10,079
and hope to figure out where they can

3084
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:12,079
flee to if the whole thing comes apart

3085
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:13,920
well yeah and maybe to push back in a

3086
01:46:12,079 --> 01:46:16,639
little bit i i agree with you but

3087
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:19,199
you know it feels like there some people

3088
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:21,920
are trying that so for example google

3089
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:23,519
purchased deep mind uh deepmind is a

3090
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:25,440
company that kind of represents

3091
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:27,679
a lot of radical ideas they're they've

3092
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:30,238
become acceptable actually

3093
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:31,760
agi artificial general intelligence used

3094
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:35,039
to be

3095
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:38,000
really radical of a thing to talk about

3096
01:46:35,039 --> 01:46:41,359
and deepmind and openai are two places

3097
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,920
which has made it more acceptable i know

3098
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:44,799
you can now start to criticize well

3099
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:46,639
they're really

3100
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:48,159
now that it's become acceptable they're

3101
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:49,440
not taking the further step of being

3102
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:51,279
more radical but

3103
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:52,879
you know that was an attempt by google

3104
01:46:51,279 --> 01:46:57,519
to say

3105
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:59,600
uh that let's let's try some wild stuff

3106
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:01,360
sort of like boston dynamics sort of

3107
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,920
like boston dynamics

3108
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:04,960
boston dynamics is a really good example

3109
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:08,158
of uh

3110
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:10,239
trying radical ideas for

3111
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:11,759
perhaps no purpose whatsoever except to

3112
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:14,399
try to try

3113
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,440
out their ideas the idea is that

3114
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:18,319
innovation

3115
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:20,158
is like dessert you can have dessert

3116
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:21,759
after you solve

3117
01:47:20,158 --> 01:47:23,519
the problem of the main course and the

3118
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,639
main course is a bunch of insoluble

3119
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,040
problems

3120
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:28,159
so that is we can get into innovation

3121
01:47:27,039 --> 01:47:30,079
sure once we be

3122
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:31,439
once we perfect ourselves and you're

3123
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:32,319
you're saying that we need to make

3124
01:47:31,439 --> 01:47:34,479
innovation

3125
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:35,599
the the main meal well i'm saying that

3126
01:47:34,479 --> 01:47:38,638
there really is

3127
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,840
structural oppression i mean if you

3128
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:42,960
train

3129
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:45,520
uh a a

3130
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:47,439
deep learning system on exclusively

3131
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:50,480
white faces it's going to get confused

3132
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:52,000
yeah so let's not disagree that there

3133
01:47:50,479 --> 01:47:54,559
are real issues around this

3134
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,359
in fact that's an issue of innovation

3135
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:58,080
and data

3136
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:58,799
your data should be responsive on the

3137
01:47:58,079 --> 01:48:00,158
other hand

3138
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:02,719
there are things we can't do anything

3139
01:48:00,158 --> 01:48:06,479
about that are actually

3140
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:08,239
you know fundamental and um

3141
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:10,959
those things may have to do with the

3142
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:13,919
fact that uh you know some of us

3143
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:14,719
uh taste cilantro as soap and some of us

3144
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,319
don't

3145
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:18,079
like there are differences between

3146
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:19,198
people and some of them are in the

3147
01:48:18,079 --> 01:48:20,399
hardware some of them are in the

3148
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:21,118
firmware some of them are in the

3149
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:24,879
software

3150
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:27,519
that is the human mind and

3151
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:28,639
this completely simplistic idea that

3152
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:32,080
every failure

3153
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:35,118
of of an organization

3154
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:38,158
to promote each person who has

3155
01:48:35,118 --> 01:48:42,319
particular intersexual characteristics

3156
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:45,439
we cannot hold progress hostage to that

3157
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:46,799
and you've talked about perhaps we'll

3158
01:48:45,439 --> 01:48:48,000
save this for another time because it's

3159
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,960
such a fascinating conversation we

3160
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,639
talked about

3161
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:54,158
this with uh glenn beck is the whole

3162
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:56,079
stagnation of growth and all that kind

3163
01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:59,839
of stuff your idea is that

3164
01:48:56,079 --> 01:49:02,079
in as much as the current situation

3165
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:03,679
is a kind of ponzi scheme the current

3166
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:06,319
situation in the united states

3167
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:07,199
is a kind of ponzi scheme built on the

3168
01:49:06,319 --> 01:49:10,238
promise of

3169
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:14,879
constant unending innovation

3170
01:49:10,238 --> 01:49:18,238
we need uh we need to

3171
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:21,920
fund the true innovators and

3172
01:49:18,238 --> 01:49:23,759
uh encourage them and empower them

3173
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:25,039
and sort of culturally say that this is

3174
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,960
what this country is about

3175
01:49:25,039 --> 01:49:29,599
is let's put it this way the brilliant

3176
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:32,239
minds we're gonna kill each other

3177
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:34,560
if we don't grow growth is like an

3178
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:36,559
immune system

3179
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:38,000
and you always have pathogens present

3180
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:39,440
but if you don't have growth present you

3181
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,158
can't fight the pathogens in your

3182
01:49:39,439 --> 01:49:41,598
society

3183
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:43,598
and right now the pathogens are

3184
01:49:41,599 --> 01:49:45,279
spreading everywhere

3185
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:47,039
so if we don't get growth into our

3186
01:49:45,279 --> 01:49:50,639
system fairly quickly

3187
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:53,599
we are in really seriously bad shape

3188
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:55,520
so it's very important that if i had a

3189
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:57,279
horrible person who was capable of

3190
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:58,480
building something that would give us

3191
01:49:57,279 --> 01:49:59,519
all

3192
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:01,919
a certain amount of what i've called

3193
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,280
financial beta to some new technology

3194
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:04,960
where we all

3195
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:06,559
benefit let's say quantum computing

3196
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:08,399
comes in and everybody

3197
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:10,320
the dry cleaner has a quantum computing

3198
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:13,759
angle right yes

3199
01:50:10,319 --> 01:50:14,960
okay that's necessary to keep this

3200
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:17,440
system that we built

3201
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:19,599
going we can try to redesign the system

3202
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:20,238
but our system expects growth and we've

3203
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:21,920
started

3204
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:24,000
starved it for growth and the madness

3205
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:25,520
that we're seeing is the failure of

3206
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,960
our immune system to be able to handle

3207
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:28,320
the pathogens that have always been

3208
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:29,920
present

3209
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:31,920
so people you know can say well this was

3210
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:34,239
always there yes it was what's changed

3211
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:37,599
was your immune system

3212
01:50:34,238 --> 01:50:40,158
we have got to make sure that

3213
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:43,039
one we understand why diversity is

3214
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:45,039
potentially really important

3215
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:47,519
we have mined certain communities to

3216
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:49,760
death you and i are ashkenazi jews

3217
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:52,239
everyone knows that ashkenazi jews are

3218
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:53,840
good at technical stuff

3219
01:50:52,238 --> 01:50:55,839
we know that the chinese are good at

3220
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:57,440
technical stuff the indians have many

3221
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,920
people who are good at technical stuff

3222
01:50:57,439 --> 01:51:01,439
as

3223
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:03,840
the japanese i also believe

3224
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:05,039
that we have communities where if you

3225
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:07,119
think about the pareto

3226
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:09,599
idea of diminishing returns if you've

3227
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:10,639
never mined a community

3228
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:12,719
many of the people you're going to get

3229
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:15,039
at the beginning are going to be amazing

3230
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:17,039
because that community it's like did you

3231
01:51:15,039 --> 01:51:17,439
drill for more oil in texas texas is

3232
01:51:17,039 --> 01:51:19,599
pretty

3233
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:21,039
thoroughly picked over do you find some

3234
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:23,599
place that's you know

3235
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:26,319
completely insane maybe there's oil

3236
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:28,880
there who knows

3237
01:51:26,319 --> 01:51:29,840
in particular i would like to displace

3238
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,159
our reliance

3239
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,000
on our military competitors in asia in

3240
01:51:32,158 --> 01:51:37,118
our scientific laboratories

3241
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,920
with women with african americans with

3242
01:51:37,118 --> 01:51:40,399
latinos

3243
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:42,000
people who are in different categories

3244
01:51:40,399 --> 01:51:44,000
than we have traditionally sourced and i

3245
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,039
would like to get them the money

3246
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:50,000
that the market would normally give

3247
01:51:47,039 --> 01:51:51,118
these fields were we not using visas in

3248
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,319
place of payment

3249
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:57,279
right now

3250
01:51:54,319 --> 01:51:58,079
i particular i have crazy idea which is

3251
01:51:57,279 --> 01:52:00,399
that i play

3252
01:51:58,079 --> 01:52:02,559
you you and i both play music and i find

3253
01:52:00,399 --> 01:52:04,079
the analytic work that i do when i'm

3254
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,760
trying to figure out chord progressions

3255
01:52:04,079 --> 01:52:07,279
and symmetries and tritones all these

3256
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,719
sorts of things to be very similar to

3257
01:52:07,279 --> 01:52:10,719
the work that i do when i do physics or

3258
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:13,359
math

3259
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:14,000
i believe that one of the things that is

3260
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:16,238
true is

3261
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,439
that the analytic contributions of

3262
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:19,439
african americans

3263
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:21,839
to music are probably fungible to

3264
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:21,839
science

3265
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:25,118
i don't know that that's true it's true

3266
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,359
i haven't done

3267
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:29,039
controlled research but i believe it is

3268
01:52:27,359 --> 01:52:30,238
very important to let the people's

3269
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:32,719
republic of china

3270
01:52:30,238 --> 01:52:34,399
know that they are not staffing our

3271
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:35,920
laboratories anymore

3272
01:52:34,399 --> 01:52:37,920
and that we need to look to our own

3273
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:39,920
people and in particular

3274
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:42,560
we are going to get a huge benefit from

3275
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:45,760
making sure that women

3276
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:47,920
black americans latinos are in a

3277
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:49,360
position

3278
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,039
to take over some of these things

3279
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:51,439
because many of these communities have

3280
01:52:51,039 --> 01:52:53,679
been

3281
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:55,039
underutilized now i don't know if that's

3282
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:56,800
an insane idea

3283
01:52:55,039 --> 01:52:58,399
i want to hear somebody tell me why it's

3284
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:00,239
an insane idea

3285
01:52:58,399 --> 01:53:02,079
but i believe that part of what we need

3286
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:02,879
to do is we need to recognize that there

3287
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:04,800
is there are

3288
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:07,199
security issues there are geopolitical

3289
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:09,199
issues with the funding of science

3290
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:11,439
and that what we've done is we've

3291
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:12,000
starved our world for innovation and if

3292
01:53:11,439 --> 01:53:13,439
we don't get

3293
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,520
back to the business of innovation we

3294
01:53:13,439 --> 01:53:17,919
should be doing diversity and inclusion

3295
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:20,480
out of greed rather than guilt

3296
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:22,000
now part of the problem with this is

3297
01:53:20,479 --> 01:53:23,919
that a lot of the energy

3298
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,118
in behind diversity and inclusion is

3299
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:28,719
based on guilt

3300
01:53:25,118 --> 01:53:31,759
and accusation yeah and what i want

3301
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:33,359
is i want to kick ass and my hope is is

3302
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:35,119
that diminishing returns

3303
01:53:33,359 --> 01:53:37,519
favors mining the communities that have

3304
01:53:35,118 --> 01:53:40,719
not been traditionally mined

3305
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:42,159
in order to extract um

3306
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:43,679
output from those communities unless

3307
01:53:42,158 --> 01:53:45,359
there's a flaw in that plan if there's a

3308
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:46,639
flaw somebody needs to tell me if there

3309
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:49,519
isn't a flaw

3310
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:51,520
we need to get greedy about innovation

3311
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:54,080
rather than guilty about innovation

3312
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:55,920
that's really brilliantly put my biggest

3313
01:53:54,079 --> 01:53:57,920
problem with what i see is

3314
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:59,599
it exactly speaks to that and in the

3315
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:02,079
discussion is diversity

3316
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:02,719
it's used when it's grounded in guilt

3317
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:05,519
it's then

3318
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:07,198
used as a hammer to shame people that

3319
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:10,320
don't care about diversity enough

3320
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:12,879
that okay

3321
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:14,719
so my point is i'm excited about the

3322
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:15,679
idea of jimi hendrix doing quantum field

3323
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:18,719
theory

3324
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:20,639
i'm excited about the idea of of uh art

3325
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:23,679
tatum trying to figure out

3326
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:25,440
uh what the

3327
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:28,158
neural nets figured out about protein

3328
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:29,039
folding i have some idea of the level of

3329
01:54:28,158 --> 01:54:30,879
intellect

3330
01:54:29,039 --> 01:54:32,238
of people who have not found their way

3331
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:34,079
into stem subjects

3332
01:54:32,238 --> 01:54:36,000
in incredibly technically demanding

3333
01:54:34,079 --> 01:54:37,920
areas and

3334
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,920
if there's a flaw in that theory i want

3335
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:43,359
somebody to present the flaw

3336
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:46,480
but right now my belief is is that

3337
01:54:43,359 --> 01:54:48,479
these things are merit-based and if you

3338
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:50,319
really believe in structural oppression

3339
01:54:48,479 --> 01:54:52,158
you do not want an affirmative action

3340
01:54:50,319 --> 01:54:54,559
program you want to make sure that

3341
01:54:52,158 --> 01:54:56,479
people have huge amounts of resources to

3342
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:58,880
get themselves into position

3343
01:54:56,479 --> 01:55:00,799
i want to push out i just tried this on

3344
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:02,719
this clubhouse application

3345
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:04,480
i want to push out klein bottles as a

3346
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:07,520
secret sign

3347
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:09,279
inside of rap videos in hip-hop right i

3348
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:11,199
want people to have an idea that there's

3349
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:12,238
an amazing world and i want to get the

3350
01:55:11,198 --> 01:55:14,960
people

3351
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:16,479
who hopefully i'm trying to lure into

3352
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:18,880
science and engineering

3353
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:20,959
i want to get them paid i don't want

3354
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:23,199
them as the cheap substitutes for the

3355
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:26,158
fleeing

3356
01:55:23,198 --> 01:55:27,678
white males who have learned that they

3357
01:55:26,158 --> 01:55:28,479
can't make any money in science and

3358
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:31,599
engineering

3359
01:55:28,479 --> 01:55:34,158
yeah so the problem is is that we need

3360
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:36,000
we need to take over the ship lex

3361
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:38,000
and it doesn't need to be you and me

3362
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,198
because quite honestly i have no desire

3363
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,198
to administer i don't want to be the

3364
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:42,559
chief executive officer of anything what

3365
01:55:41,198 --> 01:55:44,799
i do want

3366
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:46,080
is i want the baby boomers who've made

3367
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:49,840
this mess and can't see

3368
01:55:46,079 --> 01:55:51,679
it to be gone they they had almost all

3369
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:55,920
of our universities

3370
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:59,520
and i want fresh blood fresh resources

3371
01:55:55,920 --> 01:56:02,158
i want academic freedom and i want greed

3372
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:04,080
for our country and for the future to

3373
01:56:02,158 --> 01:56:05,920
determine diversity inclusion as opposed

3374
01:56:04,079 --> 01:56:08,079
to shame and guilt which is destroying

3375
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:10,399
our fabric

3376
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:13,118
that's as good of a diversity statement

3377
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:16,479
as i've ever heard

3378
01:56:13,118 --> 01:56:20,000
this is a u-turn but somebody commented

3379
01:56:16,479 --> 01:56:21,759
on the tweet you sent that as one of the

3380
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
top comments that i definitely have to

3381
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:27,039
ask you about cryptocurrency

3382
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:29,118
so it's a u-turn but not really

3383
01:56:27,039 --> 01:56:30,880
okay since you're an economist since

3384
01:56:29,118 --> 01:56:32,960
you're deep not an economist

3385
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:35,359
you i mean i i pretend to be an

3386
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,679
economist hoping that the economists

3387
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:38,158
will

3388
01:56:35,679 --> 01:56:39,118
take issue that i'm not an economist so

3389
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:40,719
that i can advance

3390
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:43,679
gauge theoretic and field theoretic

3391
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:46,000
economics which the economics profession

3392
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:46,719
has failed to acknowledge was a major

3393
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,520
innovation

3394
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:50,960
that happened approximately 25 years ago

3395
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,639
i don't think that economists

3396
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:54,319
understand what a price index is that

3397
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:56,000
measures inflation nor do i think

3398
01:56:54,319 --> 01:57:00,799
economists understand

3399
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:04,000
what a growth index or a product

3400
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:06,079
a quantity index is that measures gdp

3401
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,599
i think that they don't even understand

3402
01:57:06,079 --> 01:57:10,479
the basics

3403
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:12,719
of price and quantity index construction

3404
01:57:10,479 --> 01:57:15,919
and therefore

3405
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:17,599
they can't possibly review

3406
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:19,599
field theoretic economics they can't

3407
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:21,599
review gauge theoretic economics

3408
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:23,360
they're intellectually not in a position

3409
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:25,039
to manage their own field

3410
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:26,559
you talked about there's a stagnation

3411
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:28,960
and growth currently

3412
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:31,679
i looked at from my microeconomics

3413
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:34,800
macroeconomics and college perspective

3414
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:36,158
gdp doesn't seem to capture the

3415
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:40,880
productivity

3416
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:44,000
the full the spectrum of what i think is

3417
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:46,639
as a functioning successful society what

3418
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,760
do you think is broken about gdp

3419
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:50,719
what does it need to include uh these

3420
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:52,239
indices

3421
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:55,439
like let me let me explain what they

3422
01:57:52,238 --> 01:57:58,638
don't understand to begin with sure

3423
01:57:55,439 --> 01:58:02,079
imagine that all prices

3424
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:04,319
and all quantities uh of output

3425
01:58:02,079 --> 01:58:06,800
are the same at the end of the year as

3426
01:58:04,319 --> 01:58:08,319
they are at the beginning

3427
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:11,039
and you ask what happened during that

3428
01:58:08,319 --> 01:58:12,479
year was there inflation

3429
01:58:11,039 --> 01:58:14,399
they meandered over the course of the

3430
01:58:12,479 --> 01:58:17,759
year but miraculously they all came

3431
01:58:14,399 --> 01:58:20,799
back to exactly their values the amount

3432
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:22,480
produced at the end of the year is the

3433
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:23,840
same as at the beginning in every single

3434
01:58:22,479 --> 01:58:25,359
quantity

3435
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,279
typically the claim would be that the

3436
01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:28,639
price index should be 1.0

3437
01:58:27,279 --> 01:58:30,399
and that the quantity index should be

3438
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:34,079
1.0 that's

3439
01:58:30,399 --> 01:58:37,118
clearly wrong why

3440
01:58:34,079 --> 01:58:39,920
well it's much easier to see

3441
01:58:37,118 --> 01:58:41,759
with it speaks to a fundamental

3442
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:43,599
confusion that economists have they

3443
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:46,639
don't understand that the economy is

3444
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:49,679
curved and not flat

3445
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:51,118
in a curved economy everything should be

3446
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:52,880
path dependence but they

3447
01:58:51,118 --> 01:58:54,399
view path dependence as a problem

3448
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,760
because they are effectively the flat

3449
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:58,479
earth society

3450
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:59,599
of market analysis they don't understand

3451
01:58:58,479 --> 01:59:00,718
that what they've called

3452
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:03,760
and they've actually called it the

3453
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:05,439
cycling problem is exactly what they

3454
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:06,400
need to understand to advance their

3455
01:59:05,439 --> 01:59:08,319
field

3456
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:10,799
so i'll give you a very simple example

3457
01:59:08,319 --> 01:59:11,599
okay let's imagine that we have bob and

3458
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:14,840
carol

3459
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:17,840
in one hedge fund and ted and alice in

3460
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:17,840
another

3461
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:24,239
in both cases the females that is

3462
01:59:21,439 --> 01:59:26,079
alice and carol are the chief investment

3463
01:59:24,238 --> 01:59:29,118
officers

3464
01:59:26,079 --> 01:59:30,079
and bob and ted are the chief marketing

3465
01:59:29,118 --> 01:59:31,598
officers in

3466
01:59:30,079 --> 01:59:33,920
charge of trying to get money into the

3467
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:37,119
fund and trying to get people not

3468
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:39,520
um to in fact

3469
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:41,439
remove their their money from the funds

3470
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:45,679
okay

3471
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:45,678
if you in fact had uh

3472
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:49,520
bob and caroline's head in alice and

3473
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:51,920
both hedge funds

3474
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:54,320
were invested in assets whose prices

3475
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:59,840
came back to the same levels and whose

3476
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:59,840
exposures were in the same quantities

3477
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,079
and you wanted to compensate these two

3478
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:06,079
hedge funds would you compensate them

3479
02:00:04,079 --> 02:00:09,198
the same necessarily

3480
02:00:06,079 --> 02:00:12,079
what if for example

3481
02:00:09,198 --> 02:00:14,559
carol was killing it in terms of

3482
02:00:12,079 --> 02:00:16,719
investments every time she bought

3483
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:19,360
some sort of security the price of that

3484
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:24,239
security went up

3485
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:26,559
okay but bob was the worst marketing

3486
02:00:24,238 --> 02:00:28,238
officer and as chief marketing officer

3487
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:30,800
there were tons of redemptions because

3488
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:34,079
bob was constantly drunk

3489
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:36,560
bob was making off-color comments now

3490
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:38,479
as a result at the end of the year the

3491
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:40,480
fund hasn't grown in size

3492
02:00:38,479 --> 02:00:43,039
because even though carol was crushing

3493
02:00:40,479 --> 02:00:45,198
it in terms of the investments

3494
02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:47,359
bob was screwing up everything be and

3495
02:00:45,198 --> 02:00:48,960
the redemptions were legendary

3496
02:00:47,359 --> 02:00:51,279
so people were making money and still

3497
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:54,319
pulling it out of the fund

3498
02:00:51,279 --> 02:00:54,319
in the other fund

3499
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:59,039
alice can't seem to buy a base hit every

3500
02:00:57,279 --> 02:01:00,639
time she gets into a security the thing

3501
02:00:59,039 --> 02:01:03,519
plummets

3502
02:01:00,639 --> 02:01:04,800
but ted's amazing marketing skills

3503
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:06,400
allowed

3504
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:08,400
the fund to get all sorts of new

3505
02:01:06,399 --> 02:01:09,039
subscriptions and halted the redemptions

3506
02:01:08,399 --> 02:01:10,799
as people

3507
02:01:09,039 --> 02:01:12,399
hoped that the fund would get its act

3508
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:16,320
together

3509
02:01:12,399 --> 02:01:20,079
okay price indices

3510
02:01:16,319 --> 02:01:23,840
should be how carol

3511
02:01:20,079 --> 02:01:23,840
and alice are compensated

3512
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:32,239
and quantity indices should be how

3513
02:01:28,158 --> 02:01:34,879
um bob and ted are compensated

3514
02:01:32,238 --> 02:01:37,198
so even though both funds had closed

3515
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:38,480
loops that come back to the original

3516
02:01:37,198 --> 02:01:40,319
states

3517
02:01:38,479 --> 02:01:41,598
what happened during the period that

3518
02:01:40,319 --> 02:01:43,279
they were active

3519
02:01:41,599 --> 02:01:46,000
tells you how people are supposed to be

3520
02:01:43,279 --> 02:01:46,000
compensated

3521
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:50,000
now we know that whatever the increase

3522
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:53,599
in the price indus

3523
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:56,800
index is is compensated by a decrease

3524
02:01:53,599 --> 02:01:58,400
in the quantity index or conversely

3525
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:00,000
because prices and quantities return to

3526
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:01,118
their original values

3527
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,639
you could have another fund where

3528
02:02:01,118 --> 02:02:04,960
nothing much happened there were no

3529
02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:07,118
redemptions no subscriptions

3530
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:10,399
prices the fund remained in cash the

3531
02:02:07,118 --> 02:02:12,158
whole time so in that third fund

3532
02:02:10,399 --> 02:02:14,000
you know let's call that tristan is

3533
02:02:12,158 --> 02:02:16,960
older right

3534
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,479
that fund should have no bonuses paid

3535
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,319
because nobody did anything but nobody

3536
02:02:18,479 --> 02:02:23,118
should be fired either

3537
02:02:20,319 --> 02:02:25,039
now the fact that the economists don't

3538
02:02:23,118 --> 02:02:26,479
even understand that this is what their

3539
02:02:25,039 --> 02:02:28,719
price and quantity indices

3540
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:30,559
were intended to do that they don't

3541
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:31,439
understand that you can actually give

3542
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:33,599
what would be called

3543
02:02:31,439 --> 02:02:35,118
ordinal agents the freedom to change

3544
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:38,560
their preferences

3545
02:02:35,118 --> 02:02:41,439
and still have something defined as a

3546
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:43,119
conus cost of living adjustment they

3547
02:02:41,439 --> 02:02:43,839
don't even understand the mathematics of

3548
02:02:43,118 --> 02:02:45,519
their field

3549
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:47,279
so the indices need to be able to

3550
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:49,760
capture some kind of dynamics

3551
02:02:47,279 --> 02:02:51,039
uh that we have had indices that capture

3552
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:52,800
these dynamics

3553
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:55,279
due to the work of francois division

3554
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:56,880
since 1925

3555
02:02:55,279 --> 02:02:59,118
but the economists have not even

3556
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:00,800
understood what divisius index truly

3557
02:02:59,118 --> 02:03:03,839
represented what do you miss with

3558
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:05,840
uh with uh such crude indices then

3559
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:07,679
well you miss the fact that you're

3560
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:09,039
supposed to have a field theoretic

3561
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:10,800
subject

3562
02:03:09,039 --> 02:03:12,639
the representative consumer should

3563
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:14,800
actually be a probability distribution

3564
02:03:12,639 --> 02:03:16,400
on the space of all possible consumers

3565
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:17,679
weighted by the probability of getting

3566
02:03:16,399 --> 02:03:19,519
any particular pull from the

3567
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:22,079
distribution

3568
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:23,199
we should not have a single gauge of

3569
02:03:22,079 --> 02:03:25,439
inflation like

3570
02:03:23,198 --> 02:03:28,238
what is that in 1973 dollars any more

3571
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:30,319
than you should be able to say

3572
02:03:28,238 --> 02:03:32,000
it was 59 degrees fahrenheit on earth

3573
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:34,799
yesterday

3574
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,920
so when we get to the cryptocurrency

3575
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:38,719
what i'm going to say

3576
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:41,118
is is that because we didn't found

3577
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:43,279
economic theory on the proper marginal

3578
02:03:41,118 --> 02:03:44,960
revolution because we missed the major

3579
02:03:43,279 --> 02:03:47,359
opportunity which is is that

3580
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:48,239
the differential calculus of markets is

3581
02:03:47,359 --> 02:03:51,439
gage theory

3582
02:03:48,238 --> 02:03:54,158
it's not ordinary uh

3583
02:03:51,439 --> 02:03:56,399
differential calculus we found that out

3584
02:03:54,158 --> 02:03:58,078
in in finance that it was stochastic

3585
02:03:56,399 --> 02:03:59,439
differential calculus

3586
02:03:58,078 --> 02:04:01,279
we have the wrong version of the

3587
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:04,238
differential calculus underneath

3588
02:04:01,279 --> 02:04:05,198
all of modern economic theory and part

3589
02:04:04,238 --> 02:04:06,559
of what i've been pushing for in

3590
02:04:05,198 --> 02:04:08,078
cryptocurrencies

3591
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:10,000
is the idea that we should be

3592
02:04:08,078 --> 02:04:12,639
understanding that gold

3593
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:14,319
is a gauge theory just as modern

3594
02:04:12,639 --> 02:04:15,520
economic theory is supposed to be a

3595
02:04:14,319 --> 02:04:17,118
gauge theory

3596
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:18,880
and that we should be looking to

3597
02:04:17,118 --> 02:04:20,399
liberate cryptocurrencies

3598
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:22,319
and more importantly distributed

3599
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:25,039
computing

3600
02:04:22,319 --> 02:04:27,039
from the problem of this unwanted global

3601
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:28,479
aspect which is the blockchain the thing

3602
02:04:27,039 --> 02:04:30,960
that is most celebrated

3603
02:04:28,479 --> 02:04:32,799
in some sense about bitcoin is in fact

3604
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:33,599
the reason that i'm least enthusiastic

3605
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:36,840
about it i'm

3606
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:39,360
hugely enthusiastic about what satoshi

3607
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:41,279
did but it's an intermediate step

3608
02:04:39,359 --> 02:04:42,238
towards trying to figure out what should

3609
02:04:41,279 --> 02:04:45,920
digital gold

3610
02:04:42,238 --> 02:04:49,359
actually be if physical gold

3611
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:50,960
is a collection of uh up quarks and down

3612
02:04:49,359 --> 02:04:52,399
quarks in the form of protons and

3613
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:55,359
neutrons

3614
02:04:52,399 --> 02:04:57,118
held together the quarks by gluons with

3615
02:04:55,359 --> 02:04:58,719
electrons orbiting it held together by

3616
02:04:57,118 --> 02:05:01,439
photons with the occasional

3617
02:04:58,719 --> 02:05:02,560
weak interaction beta decay all of those

3618
02:05:01,439 --> 02:05:05,279
are gauge theories

3619
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:06,079
so gold is actually coming from gage

3620
02:05:05,279 --> 02:05:08,238
theory

3621
02:05:06,078 --> 02:05:09,519
and markets are coming from gauge theory

3622
02:05:08,238 --> 02:05:12,238
and the opportunity

3623
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:13,840
to do locally enforced conservation laws

3624
02:05:12,238 --> 02:05:15,759
which effectively is what a bitcoin

3625
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:18,639
transaction is

3626
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:20,239
should theoretically be founded on a

3627
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:21,199
different principle that is not the

3628
02:05:20,238 --> 02:05:23,759
blockchain

3629
02:05:21,198 --> 02:05:24,238
it should be a gauge theoretic concept

3630
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,440
in which

3631
02:05:24,238 --> 02:05:30,399
effectively the tokens are excitations

3632
02:05:27,439 --> 02:05:32,799
on a network of computer nodes

3633
02:05:30,399 --> 02:05:33,759
and the fact that let's imagine that

3634
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:37,039
this is some

3635
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:39,440
token by moving it from

3636
02:05:37,039 --> 02:05:40,479
my custodianship to your custodianship

3637
02:05:39,439 --> 02:05:42,879
effectively i

3638
02:05:40,479 --> 02:05:45,118
pushed that glass as a gauge theory

3639
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:47,039
towards your region of the table

3640
02:05:45,118 --> 02:05:48,399
we should be recognizing that gage

3641
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:50,719
theory is the correct

3642
02:05:48,399 --> 02:05:52,000
differential calculus for the 21st

3643
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:53,198
century in fact it should have been

3644
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,399
there in the 20th century

3645
02:05:53,198 --> 02:05:57,919
you're saying it captures these

3646
02:05:54,399 --> 02:06:00,719
individual individual dynamics

3647
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:01,679
richer why should my giving you a token

3648
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:05,039
have to be

3649
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:06,880
why should we alert the global community

3650
02:06:05,039 --> 02:06:08,158
in this token that that occurred you can

3651
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:09,840
talk about side chains you can talk

3652
02:06:08,158 --> 02:06:11,598
about any means of doing this

3653
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,520
but effectively we have a problem which

3654
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:16,800
is if i think about this differently

3655
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:19,760
yeah i have a glass that is extant

3656
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:20,960
you have a glass that is abstinent we're

3657
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:23,920
supposed to call

3658
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:25,599
the constructor method on your glass at

3659
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:27,359
the same moment we call the destructor

3660
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:29,119
method on my glass in order to have a

3661
02:06:27,359 --> 02:06:30,880
conservation principle

3662
02:06:29,118 --> 02:06:33,039
it would be far more efficient to do

3663
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:35,039
this with the one

3664
02:06:33,039 --> 02:06:36,960
series system that is known never to

3665
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:38,560
throw an exception which is nature

3666
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:41,359
and nature has chosen gauge theory and

3667
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:44,159
geometry for her underlying language

3668
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:45,198
we now know due to work of pia milani at

3669
02:06:44,158 --> 02:06:48,399
harvard

3670
02:06:45,198 --> 02:06:50,719
in economics in the mid-1990s which i

3671
02:06:48,399 --> 02:06:54,000
was her co-author on

3672
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:57,279
but i i wish to promote her as as well

3673
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,279
as this being my idea

3674
02:06:57,359 --> 02:07:01,759
we know that modern economic theory is a

3675
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:03,599
naturally occurring gauge theory

3676
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:05,760
and the failure of that community to

3677
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:07,440
acknowledge that that work occurred

3678
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:10,639
and that it was put down for reasons

3679
02:07:07,439 --> 02:07:12,719
that make no analytic sense

3680
02:07:10,639 --> 02:07:14,880
is important in particular due to the

3681
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:15,760
relatively new innovation of distributed

3682
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:18,078
computing

3683
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:19,920
and satoshi's brainchild so you're

3684
02:07:18,078 --> 02:07:21,359
thinking we need to have the mathematics

3685
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:23,279
that captures

3686
02:07:21,359 --> 02:07:24,799
that enforces cryptocurrency as a

3687
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:26,880
distributed system as opposed to a

3688
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:29,520
centralized one where the blockchain

3689
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:31,840
says that crypto should be uh

3690
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:34,960
centralized the abundance economy

3691
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:36,560
much discussed in silicon valley or

3692
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:40,000
what's left of it

3693
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:42,079
is actually a huge threat to the planet

3694
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,000
because what it really is is that it is

3695
02:07:42,078 --> 02:07:45,439
what marc andreessen is called software

3696
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:47,039
eating the world

3697
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:48,559
and what that means is that you're going

3698
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:50,158
to push things from being private goods

3699
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:52,079
and services into public goods and

3700
02:07:50,158 --> 02:07:54,479
services and public goods and services

3701
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:55,679
cannot have price and value tied

3702
02:07:54,479 --> 02:07:57,678
together

3703
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:58,960
ergo people will produce things of

3704
02:07:57,679 --> 02:08:01,359
incredible value

3705
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:02,560
to to the world that they cannot command

3706
02:08:01,359 --> 02:08:03,118
a price and they will not be able to

3707
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:05,039
capture

3708
02:08:03,118 --> 02:08:06,960
the value that they have created or a

3709
02:08:05,039 --> 02:08:09,760
significant enough fraction of it

3710
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:10,239
the abundance economy is a disaster it

3711
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:13,360
will

3712
02:08:10,238 --> 02:08:15,118
lead to a reduction in human freedom the

3713
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:17,519
great innovation of satoshi

3714
02:08:15,118 --> 02:08:18,559
is locally enforced or semi-locally

3715
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:21,440
enforced

3716
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:23,280
conservation laws where the idea is just

3717
02:08:21,439 --> 02:08:23,678
as gold as heart you know why is gold

3718
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:25,359
hard

3719
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:27,359
to create or destroy it's because it's

3720
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:29,359
created not only in stars but in violent

3721
02:08:27,359 --> 02:08:31,598
events involving stars like supernova

3722
02:08:29,359 --> 02:08:35,279
collisions

3723
02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:38,239
when gold is created and we transact

3724
02:08:35,279 --> 02:08:40,078
we're using conservation laws the

3725
02:08:38,238 --> 02:08:42,158
physics determines

3726
02:08:40,078 --> 02:08:43,759
the custodianship whatever it is that i

3727
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:47,279
don't have you now have

3728
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:49,599
and conversely in such a situation

3729
02:08:47,279 --> 02:08:51,679
we should be looking for the abstraction

3730
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:53,119
that most closely matches the physical

3731
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:55,039
world because the physical world is

3732
02:08:53,118 --> 02:08:57,359
known not to throw an exception

3733
02:08:55,039 --> 02:08:59,760
the blockchain is a vulnerability the

3734
02:08:57,359 --> 02:09:00,559
idea that the 51 percent problem isn't

3735
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:02,960
solved

3736
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:04,960
that you could have crazy race

3737
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:06,800
conditions all of these things we know

3738
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:09,920
that they're solved

3739
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:12,000
inside of gage theory somehow

3740
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:13,199
so the important thing is to recognize

3741
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,520
that one of the greatest

3742
02:09:13,198 --> 02:09:16,960
intellectual feats ever in the history

3743
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:20,079
of economic theory

3744
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:21,840
took place already and was essentially

3745
02:09:20,078 --> 02:09:24,000
instantly buried

3746
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:26,400
and i will stand by those comments

3747
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:30,960
satoshi wherever you are

3748
02:09:26,399 --> 02:09:32,799
i probably know you are you satoshi no

3749
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:34,078
no no i don't have that kind of ability

3750
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:37,440
i really don't

3751
02:09:34,078 --> 02:09:39,679
i do other things speaking of satoshi

3752
02:09:37,439 --> 02:09:43,198
engaged theory

3753
02:09:39,679 --> 02:09:45,599
you've mentioned to brian keating

3754
02:09:43,198 --> 02:09:46,719
that you may be releasing a geometric

3755
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:48,800
community paper

3756
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:50,078
this year or some other form of

3757
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:53,199
additional material

3758
02:09:50,078 --> 02:09:54,078
in the topic uh what is your thinking

3759
02:09:53,198 --> 02:09:55,759
around this

3760
02:09:54,078 --> 02:09:57,679
what's the process you're going through

3761
02:09:55,760 --> 02:10:00,880
now well i was very

3762
02:09:57,679 --> 02:10:01,920
trying this i i used april 1st to try to

3763
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:06,078
start a tradition

3764
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:09,039
which i hope to use to liberate mankind

3765
02:10:06,078 --> 02:10:10,000
the tradition is that at least one day a

3766
02:10:09,039 --> 02:10:12,000
year

3767
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,039
you should be able to say heretical

3768
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,679
things

3769
02:10:13,039 --> 02:10:16,800
and not have jack dorsey boot you off or

3770
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:18,319
mark zuckerberg

3771
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:20,560
your provost shouldn't call you up and

3772
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:23,519
say what did you say

3773
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:24,239
we need at some level to have a jubilee

3774
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:27,280
from

3775
02:10:24,238 --> 02:10:29,118
centralized control and so my

3776
02:10:27,279 --> 02:10:30,880
my hope is that you know what a

3777
02:10:29,118 --> 02:10:34,399
tradition is in america

3778
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:34,400
something a baby boomer did twice

3779
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:44,159
impeachment that's very funny

3780
02:10:41,359 --> 02:10:46,479
anyway um so when i'm i'm not a baby

3781
02:10:44,158 --> 02:10:48,319
boomer but as an exer

3782
02:10:46,479 --> 02:10:50,399
i've thought about whether or not april

3783
02:10:48,319 --> 02:10:52,719
first would be a good date

3784
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:55,039
on which to release a printed version of

3785
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:56,800
what i already said in lecture form

3786
02:10:55,039 --> 02:10:59,118
because i think it's hysterically funny

3787
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:02,320
that the physics community claims

3788
02:10:59,118 --> 02:11:03,279
that it can't decode video a lecture

3789
02:11:02,319 --> 02:11:05,759
yeah i

3790
02:11:03,279 --> 02:11:07,439
it must be paper and you know what there

3791
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:08,480
will be a steady stream of new

3792
02:11:07,439 --> 02:11:10,238
complaints

3793
02:11:08,479 --> 02:11:12,959
up until the point that they fit it into

3794
02:11:10,238 --> 02:11:16,078
a narrative that they like

3795
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:19,118
um yeah i'm thinking about april 1st uh

3796
02:11:16,078 --> 02:11:21,039
as a date in which to release a document

3797
02:11:19,118 --> 02:11:22,880
and it won't be perfectly complete but

3798
02:11:21,039 --> 02:11:26,399
it'll be very complete

3799
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:26,719
and then they'll try to say it's wrong

3800
02:11:26,399 --> 02:11:29,279
or

3801
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:30,719
you already did it or no that was dumb

3802
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:31,519
but what we just did on top of it is

3803
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:34,719
brilliant

3804
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:35,920
or it doesn't match experiment or who

3805
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:38,639
knows what they'll go through all of

3806
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:41,440
their usual nonsense

3807
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:43,039
it's time to go is there still puzzles

3808
02:11:41,439 --> 02:11:44,799
in your own mind

3809
02:11:43,039 --> 02:11:46,560
that need to be figured out for you to

3810
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:48,320
try to put it on paper i mean

3811
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:50,079
those are different mediums right it was

3812
02:11:48,319 --> 02:11:52,078
a great question

3813
02:11:50,078 --> 02:11:54,559
i did not count on something that turns

3814
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:56,559
out to be important

3815
02:11:54,560 --> 02:11:58,639
when you work on your own outside of the

3816
02:11:56,560 --> 02:12:00,079
system for a long time

3817
02:11:58,639 --> 02:12:02,480
you probably don't think you're going to

3818
02:12:00,078 --> 02:12:06,000
be doing this as a 55 year old

3819
02:12:02,479 --> 02:12:07,439
man and i have been so long outside of

3820
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,880
math and physics departments and i've

3821
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:10,559
been occupied with so many other things

3822
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:14,480
as you can see

3823
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:17,199
that the old idea that i had was if i

3824
02:12:14,479 --> 02:12:18,879
always did it in little pieces

3825
02:12:17,198 --> 02:12:21,279
then i was always safe because it

3826
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:23,760
wouldn't be stealable

3827
02:12:21,279 --> 02:12:24,559
and so now those pieces never got

3828
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:27,760
assembled

3829
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:28,960
completely in essence i have all the

3830
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:32,400
pieces

3831
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:34,078
and i can fit them together

3832
02:12:32,399 --> 02:12:35,519
but there's probably a small amount of

3833
02:12:34,078 --> 02:12:37,118
glue code

3834
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:38,880
like there are a few algebraic things

3835
02:12:37,118 --> 02:12:40,479
i've forgotten how to do i may or may

3836
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:41,760
not figure them out between now and

3837
02:12:40,479 --> 02:12:43,839
april 1st

3838
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:45,760
but it's pretty complete but that's the

3839
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:48,319
puzzle you're kind of uh

3840
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:49,760
struggling to now figure out to get it

3841
02:12:48,319 --> 02:12:51,599
all on

3842
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:53,119
the glue together i can't tell you

3843
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:54,719
whether the theory is correct

3844
02:12:53,118 --> 02:12:56,319
or incorrect but like you know for

3845
02:12:54,719 --> 02:12:58,319
example there's what's the exact form of

3846
02:12:56,319 --> 02:13:00,319
the super symmetry algebra or

3847
02:12:58,319 --> 02:13:02,799
how what's the rule for passing a minus

3848
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:04,719
sign through a particular operator

3849
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:07,360
and all of that stuff got a lot more

3850
02:13:04,719 --> 02:13:10,078
difficult because i didn't

3851
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:11,759
i didn't do it ever look you know it's a

3852
02:13:10,078 --> 02:13:13,519
little bit like

3853
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:14,800
uh if you're you know if you're a

3854
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:15,440
violinist and you don't touch your

3855
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:18,239
violin

3856
02:13:15,439 --> 02:13:20,078
regularly for 15 years you come back to

3857
02:13:18,238 --> 02:13:21,279
it you pretty much know the pieces sort

3858
02:13:20,078 --> 02:13:22,960
of but there's lots of stuff that's

3859
02:13:21,279 --> 02:13:23,920
missing your tone is off and that kind

3860
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:26,000
of stuff

3861
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:27,440
i would say i've got i'll get the ship

3862
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,158
to the harbor and it'll

3863
02:13:27,439 --> 02:13:31,759
require a tugboat probably to get it in

3864
02:13:30,158 --> 02:13:32,879
and if the tugboat doesn't show up then

3865
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:34,560
i'll pilot the

3866
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:36,480
thing right into the dock myself but

3867
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:38,520
it's not a big deal i think that

3868
02:13:36,479 --> 02:13:39,759
it is essentially complete

3869
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:42,560
psychologically

3870
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:43,440
just as a human being this is uh i

3871
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:46,639
remember

3872
02:13:43,439 --> 02:13:48,479
perhaps by accident but maybe there's no

3873
02:13:46,639 --> 02:13:51,520
accidents in the universe

3874
02:13:48,479 --> 02:13:52,559
i was tuned in i don't remember where on

3875
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:57,040
april 1st

3876
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:59,840
yeah to you uh oh i think i need discord

3877
02:13:57,039 --> 02:14:01,519
yeah uh kind of thinking about thinking

3878
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:02,639
through this release i mean it wasn't

3879
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:04,400
like

3880
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:05,679
uh it wasn't obvious that you were going

3881
02:14:04,399 --> 02:14:07,279
to do it you were thinking through it

3882
02:14:05,679 --> 02:14:09,599
and i remember there was

3883
02:14:07,279 --> 02:14:10,639
intellectual personal psychological

3884
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:12,078
struggle with this

3885
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:13,760
yeah right well because i did i thought

3886
02:14:12,078 --> 02:14:15,439
it was dangerous if this

3887
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:18,000
turns out to be right i don't know what

3888
02:14:15,439 --> 02:14:22,000
it unlocks

3889
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:24,560
i'm if it's wrong i think i

3890
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,279
understand where we are if it's wrong

3891
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:29,920
it'll be the first

3892
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:32,719
fool's gold that really looks like a

3893
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:32,719
theory of everything

3894
02:14:33,198 --> 02:14:37,598
it'll be the iron pyrites of physics and

3895
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:39,520
we haven't even had fool's gold in my

3896
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:42,159
opinion yet

3897
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:43,440
got it so what is your intuition why

3898
02:14:42,158 --> 02:14:46,479
this

3899
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:46,879
looks right to you like why it feels

3900
02:14:46,479 --> 02:14:49,759
like

3901
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:50,960
it would be if if wrong i can say it

3902
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:53,840
very simply

3903
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:55,039
it's way smarter than i am can you break

3904
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:56,960
that apart a little more

3905
02:14:55,039 --> 02:14:58,719
like every time you poke at it it's

3906
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:59,118
giving you intuitions that follow with

3907
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:00,399
the

3908
02:14:59,118 --> 02:15:02,238
the currently known physics well let's

3909
02:15:00,399 --> 02:15:04,479
put it in computer science terms

3910
02:15:02,238 --> 02:15:06,718
yes please okay there's a concept of

3911
02:15:04,479 --> 02:15:09,118
technical debt that computer scientists

3912
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:11,039
struggle with as you commit crimes you

3913
02:15:09,118 --> 02:15:12,479
have to pay those crimes back at a later

3914
02:15:11,039 --> 02:15:14,319
date

3915
02:15:12,479 --> 02:15:16,319
in general most of the problem with

3916
02:15:14,319 --> 02:15:19,599
physical theories is that

3917
02:15:16,319 --> 02:15:22,000
as you try to do something that matches

3918
02:15:19,599 --> 02:15:22,960
reality you usually have to go into some

3919
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:25,679
structure

3920
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:26,719
that gets you farther away and your hope

3921
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:29,359
is is that you're going to be able to

3922
02:15:26,719 --> 02:15:31,118
pay back the technical debt and

3923
02:15:29,359 --> 02:15:32,960
in general these will wind up as check

3924
02:15:31,118 --> 02:15:34,479
hiding schemes

3925
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:36,639
or like you're funding a startup and

3926
02:15:34,479 --> 02:15:39,039
they're too many pivots

3927
02:15:36,639 --> 02:15:40,560
right so you keep adding epicycles in

3928
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:43,920
order to

3929
02:15:40,560 --> 02:15:47,280
to cover things that have gone wrong

3930
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:51,440
my belief is is that

3931
02:15:47,279 --> 02:15:52,000
this thing represents something like a

3932
02:15:51,439 --> 02:15:55,598
summit

3933
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:58,719
to me and i'm very proud of having found

3934
02:15:55,599 --> 02:16:01,599
a route up this summit

3935
02:15:58,719 --> 02:16:03,279
but the route is what's due to me the

3936
02:16:01,599 --> 02:16:06,560
summit can't possibly

3937
02:16:03,279 --> 02:16:10,880
be due to me you know

3938
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:13,360
like edmund hillary and tenzing norgay

3939
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:14,480
did not create mount everest they know

3940
02:16:13,359 --> 02:16:18,639
that they didn't create math

3941
02:16:14,479 --> 02:16:20,718
they figured out a way up

3942
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:21,840
you got to tell me what uh mon everest

3943
02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:23,840
is in this metaphor

3944
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:25,520
relative and also connected to the

3945
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:28,000
technical debt so technical debt is an

3946
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:30,480
is a negative thing that it's kind of

3947
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:33,359
you you'll eventually have to pay it

3948
02:16:30,479 --> 02:16:34,239
are you saying in the in the ascent that

3949
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:36,719
you're seeing

3950
02:16:34,239 --> 02:16:38,318
now the theory is you do not have much

3951
02:16:36,718 --> 02:16:42,079
technical debt well that's right i think

3952
02:16:38,318 --> 02:16:45,519
that what happens is that early on

3953
02:16:42,079 --> 02:16:49,120
what i would say is i believe now

3954
02:16:45,519 --> 02:16:52,318
that the physics community has said

3955
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:52,880
many things incorrectly about the

3956
02:16:52,318 --> 02:16:55,519
current

3957
02:16:52,879 --> 02:16:57,598
state of the universe they're not wildly

3958
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:59,359
off which is why

3959
02:16:57,599 --> 02:17:01,280
like for example the claim is that there

3960
02:16:59,359 --> 02:17:02,559
are three generations of matter

3961
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:03,920
i do not believe that there are three

3962
02:17:02,558 --> 02:17:05,438
generations matter i believe that there

3963
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:07,359
are two generations of matter and there

3964
02:17:05,439 --> 02:17:10,880
is a third

3965
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:11,679
collection that looks like a generation

3966
02:17:10,879 --> 02:17:15,279
of matter

3967
02:17:11,679 --> 02:17:18,239
as the first two only at low energy

3968
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:20,000
okay well that's not a frequent claim

3969
02:17:18,239 --> 02:17:21,439
people imagine that there are three or

3970
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,200
more generations of matter

3971
02:17:21,439 --> 02:17:25,439
i would claim that that's false people

3972
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:28,159
claim that the matter is chiral that is

3973
02:17:25,439 --> 02:17:30,159
it knows it's left from its right

3974
02:17:28,159 --> 02:17:33,920
i would claim that the chirality is not

3975
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:35,679
fundamental but it is emergent

3976
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:37,439
we could keep going at all these sorts

3977
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:39,439
of things people think that

3978
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:40,960
space time is the fundamental geomatic

3979
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:42,639
geometrical construct

3980
02:17:40,959 --> 02:17:45,358
i do not agree i think it's something

3981
02:17:42,638 --> 02:17:48,478
that i've termed the observers

3982
02:17:45,359 --> 02:17:51,719
all of these different things

3983
02:17:48,478 --> 02:17:53,199
represent a series of

3984
02:17:51,718 --> 02:17:57,678
over-interpretations

3985
02:17:53,200 --> 02:18:00,639
of the world that preclude progress

3986
02:17:57,679 --> 02:18:02,159
so you you gave i think you gave uh some

3987
02:18:00,638 --> 02:18:04,799
credit to string theory

3988
02:18:02,159 --> 02:18:06,799
as uh string theory i think quantum

3989
02:18:04,799 --> 02:18:10,000
gravity if i remember correctly

3990
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:12,478
as as like getting close to the

3991
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,200
fool's uh gold well i said that garrett

3992
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:16,478
lisey

3993
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:19,280
apparently phenomenologically gets

3994
02:18:16,478 --> 02:18:20,478
a lot of things right he gets he's got a

3995
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:23,760
reason for chirality

3996
02:18:20,478 --> 02:18:25,760
a reason for uniqueness using e8 in fact

3997
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:27,760
e8 uses something called vial fermions

3998
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:30,800
which are chiral

3999
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:35,120
he has a way of getting geometry

4000
02:18:30,799 --> 02:18:36,478
to get riemann's geometry underneath

4001
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:38,319
general relativity to play with

4002
02:18:36,478 --> 02:18:39,679
aerosman's geniometry which is

4003
02:18:38,318 --> 02:18:41,279
underneath the standard model using

4004
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:42,719
something called cartan connections that

4005
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:44,719
are out of favor

4006
02:18:42,718 --> 02:18:45,839
he's figured out something involving

4007
02:18:44,718 --> 02:18:47,759
super connections

4008
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:49,760
to make sure that the fermion the matter

4009
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:51,599
in the system isn't quantized

4010
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:53,679
the same way as the bosons were which is

4011
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:55,040
a problem in his old theory

4012
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:56,879
he's got something about three

4013
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:59,439
generations for triality he's got a lot

4014
02:18:56,879 --> 02:19:01,279
of phenomenological hits

4015
02:18:59,439 --> 02:19:02,880
i don't think garrett's theory works it

4016
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:04,719
also has a very simple lagranges

4017
02:19:02,879 --> 02:19:06,159
basically using the yang mills

4018
02:19:04,718 --> 02:19:08,718
norm squared the same thing you would

4019
02:19:06,159 --> 02:19:13,439
use as a as a cost function

4020
02:19:08,718 --> 02:19:13,438
uh if you were doing neural nets okay

4021
02:19:14,239 --> 02:19:17,439
the string theorists have a different

4022
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:19,519
selling point which is is that they may

4023
02:19:17,439 --> 02:19:20,079
have gotten a renormalizable theory of

4024
02:19:19,519 --> 02:19:21,599
gravity

4025
02:19:20,079 --> 02:19:23,359
if quantum gravity was what we were

4026
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:24,719
meant to do

4027
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:28,479
and they've done some stuff with black

4028
02:19:24,718 --> 02:19:30,000
holes that they can get some solutions

4029
02:19:28,478 --> 02:19:32,000
correct and then they have lots of

4030
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:33,280
agreements with where they show

4031
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,120
mathematical

4032
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:36,960
truths that mathematicians didn't even

4033
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:39,679
know

4034
02:19:36,959 --> 02:19:41,438
i'm very underwhelmed by string theory

4035
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:41,840
based on how many people have worked on

4036
02:19:41,439 --> 02:19:44,079
it

4037
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:46,478
and how little is supporting the claims

4038
02:19:44,079 --> 02:19:49,920
to it being a theory of everything

4039
02:19:46,478 --> 02:19:51,840
but those are the two that i take

4040
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:52,960
quite seriously i don't yet take

4041
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:56,000
wolfram's

4042
02:19:52,959 --> 02:19:57,039
quite seriously because if he really

4043
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,639
finds one of these

4044
02:19:57,040 --> 02:20:00,560
cellular automatons that are really

4045
02:19:58,639 --> 02:20:02,719
distinct and generative

4046
02:20:00,559 --> 02:20:04,398
it'll be amazing but he's looking for

4047
02:20:02,719 --> 02:20:07,119
such a thing i don't think he's

4048
02:20:04,398 --> 02:20:08,398
found anything tegmark i view as a

4049
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:10,560
philosopher

4050
02:20:08,398 --> 02:20:12,159
who is somehow taking credit for

4051
02:20:10,559 --> 02:20:13,920
platonism which

4052
02:20:12,159 --> 02:20:15,600
i don't see any reason for fighting with

4053
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:17,359
max because i like max but

4054
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:19,359
if it ever comes time i'm putting a

4055
02:20:17,359 --> 02:20:21,840
post-it note that i'm not positive the

4056
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:26,079
mathematical universe hypothesis

4057
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:29,120
is really anything new um and in general

4058
02:20:26,079 --> 02:20:30,879
uh loop quantum gravity really i think

4059
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:32,960
grew out of some hopes that the general

4060
02:20:30,879 --> 02:20:34,398
relativistic community had for

4061
02:20:32,959 --> 02:20:35,759
that they would be able to do particle

4062
02:20:34,398 --> 02:20:36,559
theory and i don't think that they've

4063
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:39,359
shown

4064
02:20:36,559 --> 02:20:41,039
any particle theoretic realism so

4065
02:20:39,359 --> 02:20:44,720
essentially

4066
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:46,800
here's what i really think lex

4067
02:20:44,719 --> 02:20:47,840
i think we didn't understand how big the

4068
02:20:46,799 --> 02:20:49,438
difference between

4069
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:51,439
an effective theory and a theory of

4070
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:53,359
everything is conceptually

4071
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:55,760
maybe it's not mathematically that

4072
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:57,520
different but conceptually

4073
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:59,200
trying to figure out what a theory of

4074
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:01,680
every how does the universe and i've

4075
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:04,479
compared it to escher's drawing hands

4076
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:05,120
how do two hands draw themselves into

4077
02:21:04,478 --> 02:21:08,559
existence

4078
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:10,800
that's the puzzle that i think has just

4079
02:21:08,559 --> 02:21:12,239
been wanting and i i'll be honest i'm

4080
02:21:10,799 --> 02:21:16,398
really surprised

4081
02:21:12,239 --> 02:21:16,398
that the theoretical physics community

4082
02:21:18,079 --> 02:21:22,000
didn't even get up on their high horse

4083
02:21:20,959 --> 02:21:25,119
and say this is

4084
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:27,200
the most stupid nonsense imaginable

4085
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:28,399
because clearly i'm i always say i'm not

4086
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:30,640
a physicist

4087
02:21:28,398 --> 02:21:33,760
so i'm just a i'm i'm i'm an amateur

4088
02:21:30,639 --> 02:21:36,159
with a heart as big as all outdoors

4089
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:36,880
so in your journey of releasing this and

4090
02:21:36,159 --> 02:21:40,239
i'm sure that

4091
02:21:36,879 --> 02:21:42,079
further maybe uh it will be another

4092
02:21:40,239 --> 02:21:46,318
american tradition on april 1st

4093
02:21:42,079 --> 02:21:50,079
that will continue for years uh

4094
02:21:46,318 --> 02:21:54,879
in my uh there's sort of

4095
02:21:50,079 --> 02:21:58,639
uh crumbs along the way that i'm hoping

4096
02:21:54,879 --> 02:22:02,239
to uh collect in my naive view of things

4097
02:21:58,639 --> 02:22:05,358
of the beauty that

4098
02:22:02,239 --> 02:22:08,959
in your geometric view of the universe

4099
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:13,120
so uh one question

4100
02:22:08,959 --> 02:22:13,119
i'd like to ask is um

4101
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:17,439
if you were to challenge me to visualize

4102
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:19,280
something beautiful

4103
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:21,359
something important about geometric

4104
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:23,840
community in my struggle to

4105
02:22:21,359 --> 02:22:25,600
appreciate some of its beauty from the

4106
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:28,960
outsider's perspective

4107
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:29,520
what would that be thing be interesting

4108
02:22:28,959 --> 02:22:31,759
question

4109
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:34,800
perhaps we can both have a journey

4110
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:34,800
towards april first

4111
02:22:34,959 --> 02:22:37,839
take a look at that

4112
02:22:38,478 --> 02:22:41,760
some kind of a scrunchie that i picked

4113
02:22:40,079 --> 02:22:45,600
up on melrose

4114
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:47,520
not melrose montana in santa monica

4115
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:48,640
now you'll notice that all of those

4116
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:53,600
discs

4117
02:22:48,639 --> 02:22:53,599
rotate independently yes

4118
02:22:54,239 --> 02:23:00,559
if you rotate groups of those in a way

4119
02:22:57,439 --> 02:23:01,920
that is continuous but not uniform

4120
02:23:00,559 --> 02:23:02,840
everywhere what you're doing is the

4121
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:06,639
so-called gauge

4122
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:07,200
transformation on the torus seen as a u1

4123
02:23:06,639 --> 02:23:10,799
bundle

4124
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:14,079
over a u1 space time so

4125
02:23:10,799 --> 02:23:15,840
the concept of space-time here in a very

4126
02:23:14,079 --> 02:23:17,120
simplified case isn't four-dimensional

4127
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:18,478
but it's one-dimensional it's just a

4128
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:21,040
circle

4129
02:23:18,478 --> 02:23:22,478
and there's a circle above every point

4130
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:24,720
in the circle represented by those

4131
02:23:22,478 --> 02:23:28,478
little discs

4132
02:23:24,719 --> 02:23:31,519
imagine if you will that

4133
02:23:28,478 --> 02:23:33,519
we took a rubber band

4134
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:35,600
and placed it around here and decided

4135
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:40,319
that that was a function

4136
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:42,399
from the circle into this circle that is

4137
02:23:40,318 --> 02:23:44,079
representing a y-axis that's wrapped

4138
02:23:42,398 --> 02:23:45,680
around itself

4139
02:23:44,079 --> 02:23:47,680
well you would have an idea of what it

4140
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:50,000
means for a function to be constant

4141
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:52,318
if it just went all around the outside

4142
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:54,318
but what happens if i

4143
02:23:52,318 --> 02:23:55,760
turn this a little bit then the function

4144
02:23:54,318 --> 02:23:56,959
would be mostly constant it would have a

4145
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:59,760
little place where it dipped

4146
02:23:56,959 --> 02:24:00,398
and it went back it turns out that you

4147
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:04,159
can

4148
02:24:00,398 --> 02:24:05,119
transform that function and transform

4149
02:24:04,159 --> 02:24:07,920
the derivative

4150
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:09,840
that says that function is equal to zero

4151
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:12,000
when i take its derivative

4152
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:15,760
at the same time that's what a gauge

4153
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:20,000
transformation is amazing to me

4154
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:23,120
that we don't have a simple video

4155
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:26,159
visualizing things that i've already

4156
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:27,200
had built and that i can clearly

4157
02:24:26,159 --> 02:24:30,239
demonstrate

4158
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:32,159
when you do that taurus who's the code

4159
02:24:30,239 --> 02:24:36,239
of the taurus is itself

4160
02:24:32,159 --> 02:24:37,439
generating yeah this is a u1 principle

4161
02:24:36,239 --> 02:24:39,199
bundle

4162
02:24:37,439 --> 02:24:41,359
and the world needs to know what a gauge

4163
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:42,720
theory is not by analogy

4164
02:24:41,359 --> 02:24:44,159
not with lawrence krauss saying it's

4165
02:24:42,719 --> 02:24:46,318
like a checkerboard if you change some

4166
02:24:44,159 --> 02:24:49,600
of the colors this way not saying

4167
02:24:46,318 --> 02:24:51,279
you know that it it's it's a

4168
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:53,200
local symmetry involving it's none of

4169
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:54,800
those things it's a theory of

4170
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:55,439
differential calculus where the

4171
02:24:54,799 --> 02:24:58,799
functions

4172
02:24:55,439 --> 02:25:00,559
and the derivatives are both subject to

4173
02:24:58,799 --> 02:25:02,318
a particular kind of change

4174
02:25:00,559 --> 02:25:03,600
so that if a function was constant under

4175
02:25:02,318 --> 02:25:06,398
one derivative

4176
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:07,600
then the new function is constant under

4177
02:25:06,398 --> 02:25:10,000
the new derivative

4178
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:11,600
transformed in the same fashion and

4179
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,439
would you put that under the category of

4180
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:15,520
just gauge transformations

4181
02:25:13,439 --> 02:25:16,800
yes that would be gauge transformations

4182
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:18,399
applied to sections

4183
02:25:16,799 --> 02:25:21,438
and connections where connections are

4184
02:25:18,398 --> 02:25:24,799
the derivatives in the theory

4185
02:25:21,439 --> 02:25:26,800
this is easily explained it is

4186
02:25:24,799 --> 02:25:28,239
pathological that the community of

4187
02:25:26,799 --> 02:25:29,358
people who understand what i'm saying

4188
02:25:28,239 --> 02:25:31,119
have never bothered

4189
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:33,439
to do this in a clear fashion for the

4190
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:34,319
general public you and i could visualize

4191
02:25:33,439 --> 02:25:38,559
this

4192
02:25:34,318 --> 02:25:41,600
overnight this is not hard

4193
02:25:38,559 --> 02:25:43,760
the public needs to know in some sense

4194
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:45,760
that let's say quantum electrodynamics

4195
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:48,000
the theory of photons and electrons more

4196
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:50,719
or less electrons are functions

4197
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:51,520
and photons are derivatives now there's

4198
02:25:50,719 --> 02:25:53,760
some

4199
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:55,200
you can object in some ways but

4200
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:59,280
basically a gauge theory

4201
02:25:55,200 --> 02:26:01,680
is the way in which you can translate uh

4202
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:02,960
a shift in the definition of the

4203
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:04,479
functions and the shift

4204
02:26:02,959 --> 02:26:06,159
of the definition of the derivatives so

4205
02:26:04,478 --> 02:26:07,358
that the underlying physics is not

4206
02:26:06,159 --> 02:26:09,760
harmed

4207
02:26:07,359 --> 02:26:10,479
or changed so you have to do both at the

4208
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:12,478
same time

4209
02:26:10,478 --> 02:26:14,000
now you and i can visualize that so if

4210
02:26:12,478 --> 02:26:15,920
what you wanted to do

4211
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:18,639
rather than going directly to geometric

4212
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:19,920
unity is that i could sit down with you

4213
02:26:18,639 --> 02:26:22,079
and i could say here are the various

4214
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:24,398
components of geometric unity

4215
02:26:22,079 --> 02:26:25,920
and if the public needs a visualization

4216
02:26:24,398 --> 02:26:27,760
in order to play along

4217
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:29,680
we've got a little over two months and

4218
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:31,680
i'd be happy to work with you

4219
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:33,680
i love that as a challenge and i'll take

4220
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:35,760
it on and i hope we do make it happen

4221
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:38,159
and david goggins

4222
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:39,200
if lex doesn't do some super macho thing

4223
02:26:38,159 --> 02:26:42,079
because he's got to work

4224
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:43,760
uh to get some of this stuff down done

4225
02:26:42,079 --> 02:26:45,039
you'll understand he'll be available to

4226
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:46,880
you after april

4227
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:48,479
thank you for the thank you for the

4228
02:26:46,879 --> 02:26:50,318
escape clause i really needed that

4229
02:26:48,478 --> 02:26:52,879
escape clause i'm glad that i'm worried

4230
02:26:50,318 --> 02:26:54,559
48 miles in 48 hours

4231
02:26:52,879 --> 02:26:56,478
by the way i just want to say how much i

4232
02:26:54,559 --> 02:26:58,398
admire

4233
02:26:56,478 --> 02:27:00,559
your willingness to keep this kind of

4234
02:26:58,398 --> 02:27:03,039
hardcore attitude

4235
02:27:00,559 --> 02:27:04,959
um i know that russians have it and

4236
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:05,920
russian jews have it in spades but it's

4237
02:27:04,959 --> 02:27:08,639
harder to do

4238
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:09,439
in a society that's sloppy and that's

4239
02:27:08,639 --> 02:27:11,840
weak

4240
02:27:09,439 --> 02:27:13,760
and that's lazy and the fact that you

4241
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:15,600
bring so much heart

4242
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:17,680
to saying i'm going to bring this to jiu

4243
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:18,880
jitsu i'm going to bring this to guitar

4244
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:21,040
i'm going to bring this to ai i'm going

4245
02:27:18,879 --> 02:27:22,799
to bring this to podcasting

4246
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:24,880
it comes through loud and clear i just

4247
02:27:22,799 --> 02:27:27,119
find it completely and utterly inspiring

4248
02:27:24,879 --> 02:27:28,959
that you keep this kind of hardcore

4249
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:30,800
aspect at the same time that you're the

4250
02:27:28,959 --> 02:27:32,318
guy who's extolling the virtue of love

4251
02:27:30,799 --> 02:27:33,039
in a modern society and doing it at

4252
02:27:32,318 --> 02:27:34,959
scale

4253
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:36,720
thank you that means a lot i don't know

4254
02:27:34,959 --> 02:27:37,679
why i'm doing it but i'm just following

4255
02:27:36,719 --> 02:27:41,119
my heart on it

4256
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:44,559
and just going with the gut it seems to

4257
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:46,160
make sense somehow i i personally think

4258
02:27:44,559 --> 02:27:48,239
we better get tougher or we're going to

4259
02:27:46,159 --> 02:27:50,159
get in a world of pain and i

4260
02:27:48,239 --> 02:27:53,039
i do think that when it comes time to

4261
02:27:50,159 --> 02:27:55,920
lead uh it's great to have people who

4262
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:57,359
you know don't crack under pressure do

4263
02:27:55,920 --> 02:28:00,000
you mind if we

4264
02:27:57,359 --> 02:28:01,200
talk about love and what it takes to be

4265
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,079
a father for a bit

4266
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:06,479
sure do you mind if zev joins us i'd be

4267
02:28:04,079 --> 02:28:06,478
an honor

4268
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:13,120
so eric i've talked to your son zev

4269
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:18,239
who's an incredible

4270
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:21,120
human being but let me uh

4271
02:28:18,239 --> 02:28:24,079
ask you this might be difficult because

4272
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:27,840
you're both sitting together

4273
02:28:24,079 --> 02:28:30,959
what advice do you have for him

4274
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:33,439
as he makes his way in this world

4275
02:28:30,959 --> 02:28:35,119
especially given that as we mentioned

4276
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:37,200
before on joe rogan

4277
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:39,680
you're flawed in that just like all

4278
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:42,960
humans you're mortal

4279
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:45,520
well at some level i guess one of

4280
02:28:42,959 --> 02:28:47,119
my issues is that i've got to stop

4281
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:50,399
giving quite so much advice

4282
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:52,720
uh early on i was very worried

4283
02:28:50,398 --> 02:28:54,239
that i could see zeb's abilities and i

4284
02:28:52,719 --> 02:28:56,398
could see his

4285
02:28:54,239 --> 02:28:57,680
challenges and i saw them in terms of

4286
02:28:56,398 --> 02:29:00,959
myself

4287
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:04,318
so a certain amount of zev rhymes with

4288
02:29:00,959 --> 02:29:06,239
whatever i went through as a kid and

4289
02:29:04,318 --> 02:29:07,760
i don't want to doom him to the same

4290
02:29:06,239 --> 02:29:09,760
outcomes that

4291
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:11,600
that sufficed for me i think that he's

4292
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:14,639
got a much better head on his shoulders

4293
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:18,399
at age 15 he's much better adjusted

4294
02:29:14,639 --> 02:29:20,719
and in part it's important for me to

4295
02:29:18,398 --> 02:29:22,959
recognize that because i think i did a

4296
02:29:20,719 --> 02:29:23,920
reasonably decent job early on i don't

4297
02:29:22,959 --> 02:29:27,519
need

4298
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:31,040
to get this part right and

4299
02:29:27,520 --> 02:29:33,200
you know i'm looking at at zev's

4300
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:36,000
trajectory and saying

4301
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:38,800
you're going to need to be incredibly

4302
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:40,559
even pathologically self-confident

4303
02:29:38,799 --> 02:29:41,759
the antidote for that is going to be

4304
02:29:40,559 --> 02:29:45,439
something you're going to need to carry

4305
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:46,398
on board which is radical humility

4306
02:29:45,439 --> 02:29:48,318
and you're going to have to have those

4307
02:29:46,398 --> 02:29:50,799
in a dialectical tension which is never

4308
02:29:48,318 --> 02:29:53,199
resolved which is a huge burden

4309
02:29:50,799 --> 02:29:55,279
you are going to have to forgive people

4310
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:57,359
who do not appreciate your gifts

4311
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:59,120
because your gifts are clearly evident

4312
02:29:57,359 --> 02:30:00,720
and many people will have to pretend not

4313
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:02,800
to see them because if they

4314
02:30:00,719 --> 02:30:04,559
see your gifts then they're gonna have

4315
02:30:02,799 --> 02:30:05,358
to question their entire approach to

4316
02:30:04,559 --> 02:30:08,639
education

4317
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:11,840
or employment or critical thinking

4318
02:30:08,639 --> 02:30:13,599
and what my hope is is that you can just

4319
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:15,280
forgive those who don't see them

4320
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:16,479
and who complicate and frustrate your

4321
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:18,159
life and realize that you're gonna have

4322
02:30:16,478 --> 02:30:19,920
to take care of them too

4323
02:30:18,159 --> 02:30:21,200
seth let me ask you the more challenging

4324
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:22,239
question because the guy is sitting

4325
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:24,880
right here

4326
02:30:22,239 --> 02:30:27,760
what advice do you have for your dad

4327
02:30:24,879 --> 02:30:31,039
since uh after talking to you i realize

4328
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:32,159
you're the uh the more brilliant aside

4329
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:34,399
from the

4330
02:30:32,159 --> 02:30:35,840
the better looking uh member of the

4331
02:30:34,398 --> 02:30:38,159
family

4332
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:38,159
um

4333
02:30:40,079 --> 02:30:44,559
odd question yeah um sorry i could say

4334
02:30:43,359 --> 02:30:47,840
anything you want is the last time we're

4335
02:30:44,559 --> 02:30:47,840
gonna be seeing left

4336
02:30:48,559 --> 02:30:51,680
awkward drive home

4337
02:30:49,500 --> 02:30:55,040
[Laughter]

4338
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:58,159
i think sort of a new perspective

4339
02:30:55,040 --> 02:31:02,319
i've taken on parenting is that it

4340
02:30:58,159 --> 02:31:04,959
is a task for which no human is really

4341
02:31:02,318 --> 02:31:06,559
supposed to be prepared you know there

4342
02:31:04,959 --> 02:31:08,159
are

4343
02:31:06,559 --> 02:31:09,680
in jewish tradition for example there

4344
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:12,239
are

4345
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:12,880
myriad analogies in the torah and the

4346
02:31:12,239 --> 02:31:16,079
talmud

4347
02:31:12,879 --> 02:31:19,599
that compare the role of a parent

4348
02:31:16,079 --> 02:31:22,318
to the role of a god right no human

4349
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:23,120
is prepared to play god and create and

4350
02:31:22,318 --> 02:31:26,079
guide

4351
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:26,560
a life but somehow we're forced into it

4352
02:31:26,079 --> 02:31:29,920
as

4353
02:31:26,559 --> 02:31:31,119
as people um and i think sometimes it's

4354
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:34,159
hard for

4355
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:34,479
uh children to understand that however

4356
02:31:34,159 --> 02:31:38,318
their

4357
02:31:34,478 --> 02:31:38,318
their parents are failing um

4358
02:31:40,478 --> 02:31:44,879
is is something for for which we must

4359
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:47,760
budget because our parents

4360
02:31:44,879 --> 02:31:48,398
play a role in our lives uh of which

4361
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:50,239
they're

4362
02:31:48,398 --> 02:31:51,439
they're not worthy and they devote

4363
02:31:50,239 --> 02:31:53,760
themselves to

4364
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:58,000
uh regardless because that becomes who

4365
02:31:53,760 --> 02:31:58,000
they are in a certain sense so

4366
02:31:58,719 --> 02:32:02,639
i hope to um

4367
02:32:02,959 --> 02:32:06,478
i hope to have realistic realistic

4368
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:10,319
expectations

4369
02:32:06,478 --> 02:32:13,199
of you as a human because i think

4370
02:32:10,318 --> 02:32:15,519
too often it's easy to have godly

4371
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:19,359
expectations of people who are

4372
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:22,159
far from such a role and i think

4373
02:32:19,359 --> 02:32:24,479
i'm really happy that you've been as

4374
02:32:22,159 --> 02:32:27,600
open as you have with me about

4375
02:32:24,478 --> 02:32:27,599
the fact that um

4376
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:30,960
you know you really you don't pretend to

4377
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:34,319
be a god in my life

4378
02:32:30,959 --> 02:32:38,398
you you are

4379
02:32:34,318 --> 02:32:39,920
a guide who allows me to see myself

4380
02:32:38,398 --> 02:32:41,920
and that's been very important

4381
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:45,600
considering the fact that

4382
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:48,000
by your self-teaching paradigm

4383
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:48,640
i will have to i will have to guide

4384
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:51,439
myself

4385
02:32:48,639 --> 02:32:53,439
and being able to see it and see myself

4386
02:32:51,439 --> 02:32:54,639
accurately has been one of the greatest

4387
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:57,680
gifts that you've

4388
02:32:54,639 --> 02:33:01,599
you've given me so i'm very appreciative

4389
02:32:57,680 --> 02:33:04,398
and uh i want you to know that

4390
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:04,800
i don't buy into the the role that

4391
02:33:04,398 --> 02:33:08,639
you're

4392
02:33:04,799 --> 02:33:08,639
you're supposed to um

4393
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:18,719
sort of fake your way through uh in my

4394
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:18,720
in my life but i

4395
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:25,760
i'm unbelievably happy with

4396
02:33:22,478 --> 02:33:26,559
uh a more realistic connection that

4397
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:29,120
we've been

4398
02:33:26,559 --> 02:33:30,398
able to build in lieu of it so i think

4399
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:33,200
it's been easier on you

4400
02:33:30,398 --> 02:33:35,439
actually as you come to realize what i

4401
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:37,120
don't know what i can't do

4402
02:33:35,439 --> 02:33:38,720
and that there's been a period of time i

4403
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:42,000
guess that's fascinating to me

4404
02:33:38,719 --> 02:33:44,639
where you're sort of surprised that i

4405
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:48,478
don't know the answer to a certain

4406
02:33:44,639 --> 02:33:50,159
thing as well as you do and that

4407
02:33:48,478 --> 02:33:52,239
i remember going through this with a

4408
02:33:50,159 --> 02:33:53,840
particular mathematician who i held and

4409
02:33:52,239 --> 02:33:56,799
i still hold in awe

4410
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:57,600
named david kajdan and you know he

4411
02:33:56,799 --> 02:33:59,438
famously

4412
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:03,120
said to him and weirdly our family knew

4413
02:33:59,439 --> 02:34:05,600
his family in the soviet union but

4414
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:07,359
he said you know eric i always

4415
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:09,680
appreciate you coming to my office

4416
02:34:07,359 --> 02:34:10,960
because i always find what you have to

4417
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:12,239
say interesting but you have to realize

4418
02:34:10,959 --> 02:34:14,000
that in the areas that you're talking

4419
02:34:12,239 --> 02:34:16,559
about you are no longer the student you

4420
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:17,439
are actually my teacher and i wasn't

4421
02:34:16,559 --> 02:34:19,680
prepared

4422
02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:21,280
to hear that and there are many ways in

4423
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:22,720
which as i was just saying with the

4424
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:25,840
mozart

4425
02:34:22,719 --> 02:34:27,760
i am learning at an incredible rate from

4426
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:29,040
you

4427
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:30,559
i used to learn from you because i

4428
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:30,960
didn't understand what was possible you

4429
02:34:30,559 --> 02:34:32,398
were

4430
02:34:30,959 --> 02:34:34,559
you were very much i mean this is the

4431
02:34:32,398 --> 02:34:36,398
weird thing there used to be this thing

4432
02:34:34,559 --> 02:34:36,719
called harvey the invisible rabbit this

4433
02:34:36,398 --> 02:34:38,239
guy

4434
02:34:36,719 --> 02:34:39,920
could had a rabbit that was like six

4435
02:34:38,239 --> 02:34:40,318
feet tall that only he could see maybe

4436
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:42,879
he was

4437
02:34:40,318 --> 02:34:43,359
talking and that was like you at age

4438
02:34:42,879 --> 02:34:47,039
four

4439
02:34:43,359 --> 02:34:47,760
as you were saying batshit crazy things

4440
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:49,680
that were all

4441
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:51,680
totally sensible and nobody else could

4442
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:54,079
put them together and so

4443
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:55,120
what's wonderful is that the world

4444
02:34:54,079 --> 02:34:57,600
hasn't caught on

4445
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:58,479
but enormous numbers of people are

4446
02:34:57,600 --> 02:35:02,079
starting to

4447
02:34:58,478 --> 02:35:04,639
and i really do hope that

4448
02:35:02,079 --> 02:35:05,760
that genuineness of spirit and that

4449
02:35:04,639 --> 02:35:09,439
outside the box

4450
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:13,040
intellectual commitment serves you well

4451
02:35:09,439 --> 02:35:15,600
as the world starts to appreciate

4452
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:17,280
that i think you're a very trustworthy

4453
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:19,439
voice you don't get everything right

4454
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:20,880
but the idea that we have somebody at

4455
02:35:19,439 --> 02:35:22,159
your age who's embedded in your

4456
02:35:20,879 --> 02:35:23,920
generation who can tell

4457
02:35:22,159 --> 02:35:25,600
us something about what's happening is

4458
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:26,639
really valuable to me and i do hope that

4459
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:29,520
you'll

4460
02:35:26,639 --> 02:35:31,680
consider boosting that voice more than

4461
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:35,120
just at the dinner table

4462
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:36,479
i apologize for saying this four-letter

4463
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:39,920
word

4464
02:35:36,478 --> 02:35:39,920
but do you love

4465
02:35:40,799 --> 02:35:44,079
i was really worried it was going to be

4466
02:35:42,079 --> 02:35:46,559
another four-letter word

4467
02:35:44,079 --> 02:35:47,760
there's so many easy choices it doesn't

4468
02:35:46,559 --> 02:35:51,359
even rise

4469
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:53,920
to the level of a question i mean i just

4470
02:35:51,359 --> 02:35:54,880
there are a tiny number of people with

4471
02:35:53,920 --> 02:35:58,398
whom

4472
02:35:54,879 --> 02:36:00,000
you share so much life that

4473
02:35:58,398 --> 02:36:01,599
you can't even think of yourself in

4474
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:04,398
their absence and

4475
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:05,680
and i don't know if that would find that

4476
02:36:04,398 --> 02:36:08,959
but

4477
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:12,000
it's you can have a kid and

4478
02:36:08,959 --> 02:36:13,839
never make this level of connection

4479
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,439
i think i think even right down to the

4480
02:36:13,840 --> 02:36:20,398
fact that you know when

4481
02:36:15,439 --> 02:36:22,720
when zev chooses boogie woogie piano

4482
02:36:20,398 --> 02:36:24,159
for his own set of reasons why i would

4483
02:36:22,719 --> 02:36:26,000
choose boogie woogie piano if i could

4484
02:36:24,159 --> 02:36:28,879
play in any style

4485
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:30,559
um it's a it's a question about a

4486
02:36:28,879 --> 02:36:33,279
decrease in loneliness

4487
02:36:30,559 --> 02:36:34,000
you know like my grandfather played the

4488
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:36,319
mandolin

4489
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:37,760
and i had to learn some mandolin because

4490
02:36:36,318 --> 02:36:39,760
otherwise that instrument would go

4491
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:41,840
silent

4492
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:43,439
you don't expect that you get this much

4493
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:44,318
of a chance to leave this much of

4494
02:36:43,439 --> 02:36:47,760
yourself

4495
02:36:44,318 --> 02:36:51,039
in another person who

4496
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:52,559
is choosing it and recreating it rather

4497
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:57,200
than it being

4498
02:36:52,559 --> 02:37:00,000
directly instilled and my proudest

4499
02:36:57,200 --> 02:37:01,280
achievement is in a certain sense having

4500
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:04,318
not

4501
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:05,200
taught him and and have having shared

4502
02:37:04,318 --> 02:37:08,000
this much so

4503
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:09,600
you know it's not even love it's like

4504
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:12,799
well beyond

4505
02:37:09,600 --> 02:37:16,399
so you mentioned love

4506
02:37:12,799 --> 02:37:19,920
for you making a less lonely world

4507
02:37:16,398 --> 02:37:20,879
i think i speak for i would argue

4508
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:22,960
probably

4509
02:37:20,879 --> 02:37:24,799
