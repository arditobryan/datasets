00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,039
sean kelly a philosopher at harvard

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,120
specializing in existentialism and the

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,519
philosophy of mind

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,678
this is the lex friedman podcast to

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,120
support it please check out our sponsors

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,399
in the description

8
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,000
and now here's my conversation with sean

9
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:22,640
kelly

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,160
your interests are in post-content

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,880
european philosophy especially

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,198
phenomenology and existentialism so let

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,920
me ask what to you

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,559
is existentialism

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,480
so it's a hard question i'm teaching a

16
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:40,640
course on existentialism right now you

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:43,599
are i am yeah existentialism in

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,079
literature and film which is fun

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,520
uh i mean the traditional thing to say

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,320
about

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,039
what existentialism is is that it's a

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,558
movement in mid 20th century

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,558
mostly french some german philosophy

24
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,358
and some of the major figures associated

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,119
with it are people like jean-paul sartre

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,040
and camus

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,959
um simone de beauvoir

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,360
maybe martin heidegger

29
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,280
but that's a weird thing to say about it

30
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,000
because most of those people denied that

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,879
they were existentialists and um

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,680
and in fact i i think of it as a

33
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,719
movement that has a much longer history

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,200
so when i try to describe what the core

35
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,039
idea of existentialism is

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,478
it's an idea that you find expressed in

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,960
different ways in a bunch of these

38
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,400
people one of the ways that it's

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,839
expressed

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
is that

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,240
sartre will say

42
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,679
that existentialism is the view that

43
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,839
there is no god and at least his form of

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,320
existentialism he calls it atheistic

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,719
existentialism there is no god

46
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,438
and since there's no god there must be

47
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,399
some other being around

48
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:56,000
who does something like what god does

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,960
otherwise there wouldn't be any

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,799
possibility for significance in life

51
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,919
and that being is us

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,719
and the feature of us according to sart

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,640
and

54
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,118
the other existentialists

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
that puts us in the position to be able

56
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,159
to play that role is that we're the

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,360
beings for whom

58
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:17,359
assart says it existence precedes

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,280
essence

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,879
that's that's the catchphrase for

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,280
existentialism and then you have to try

62
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,039
to figure out what it means

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
what is existence what is presence and

64
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,959
what does proceeds mean yeah exactly

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
what is existence what is essence and

66
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,000
what is proceeds and in fact precedes a

67
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
start way of talking about it and other

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,439
people will talk about it differently

69
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,120
but here's a way of here's the way start

70
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,479
thinks about it this is not i think the

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,159
most interesting way to think about it

72
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,840
but get you started

73
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,680
sartre says

74
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,598
there's nothing

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,519
true about what it is to be you

76
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,839
until you start

77
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,879
existing and still use until you start

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,120
living and for sartre the core feature

79
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,840
of what it is to be existing the way we

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,239
do

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,519
is to be making decisions to be making

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,599
choices in your life to be

83
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,200
sort of taking a stand on what it is to

84
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:15,039
be you by deciding to do this or that

85
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,959
and the key feature of how to do that

86
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,878
right for sartre

87
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,519
is to do it in the full recognition of

88
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:24,479
the fact that when you make that choice

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,439
nobody is responsible for it other than

90
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,679
you

91
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,680
so you don't make the choice because god

92
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
tells you to you don't make the choice

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,920
because some

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,080
utilitarian calculus about what what

95
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,158
it's right to do tells you to do you

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,640
don't make the choice because some other

97
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,878
philosophical theory tells you to do it

98
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,798
there's literally nothing on the basis

99
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,000
of which you make the choice

100
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,159
other than the fact that in that moment

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,158
you're you're the one making it

102
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:55,039
you are a conscious

103
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:57,120
thinking being that made a decision so

104
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,000
all the questions about physics and free

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,719
will

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,598
are out the window yeah that's right if

107
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,359
you were a determinist about the mind if

108
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,959
you were a physicalist about the mind if

109
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,159
you thought there was nothing to your

110
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,360
choices

111
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,759
other than the activity of the brain

112
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,079
that's governed by physical laws

113
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,199
then there's some sense in which it

114
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,199
would seem at any rate like um you're

115
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,800
not the ground of that choice the ground

116
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,478
of that choice was the physical universe

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,240
and the laws that govern it

118
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,399
and then you'd have no responsibility

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,478
and so sart's view is that the thing

120
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,159
that's special about us used to be

121
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,039
special about god

122
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,040
is that we're responsible for

123
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,639
becoming the being that makes the

124
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,840
choices that we do

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,560
and sart thinks that that simultaneously

126
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,159
empowering i mean it practically puts us

127
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,000
in the place of god

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,800
and also terrifying

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,839
because what responsibility how can you

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,240
possibly

131
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,839
take on that responsibility and he

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,960
thinks it's worse than that he thinks

133
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,039
that

134
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,279
it's always happening

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,960
everything that you do

136
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,719
uh is the result of some choice that

137
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,799
you've made the posture that you sit in

138
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,400
the way you hold someone's gaze when

139
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,759
you're having a conversation with them

140
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,719
or not

141
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,560
the choice to make a note

142
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,400
when someone says something

143
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,439
or not make a note

144
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:23,038
everything that you do presents you as a

145
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,279
being who makes decisions and you're

146
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,680
responsible for all of them so it's

147
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:31,519
constantly happening and furthermore

148
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,519
there's no fact about you

149
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,680
independent of the choices and actions

150
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,359
you've performed so you don't get to say

151
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,519
search example i really am a great

152
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,960
writer i just haven't written my great

153
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,079
book yet

154
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,758
if you haven't written your great book

155
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,079
you're not a great writer

156
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,919
and so it's it's terrifying it puts a

157
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,879
huge burden on us

158
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,198
and um and that's why sart says

159
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,719
on his view of existentialism

160
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,038
human beings are the beings that are

161
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,120
condemned to be free

162
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,519
our freedom consists in our ability and

163
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,199
our responsibility to to make these

164
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,680
choices and to become someone through

165
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,280
making them and we can't get we can't

166
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,918
get away from that but to him it's

167
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,918
terrifying not liberating

168
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,000
in the positive meaning of the word

169
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,000
liberating well so he he thinks it

170
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,240
should be liberating but he thinks that

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,079
it takes a very courageous individual to

172
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,319
be liberated by it

173
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,079
um nietzsche i think thought something

174
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,240
similar i think's artists

175
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,680
really coming out of a nietzschean sort

176
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,478
of tradition

177
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,160
but what's liberating about it if it is

178
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:38,159
is also terrifying because it means in a

179
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,800
certain way you're the ground of your

180
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,600
own being you become

181
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,520
what you do through through existing so

182
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,520
that's one form of existentialism that's

183
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:51,198
a stark atheistic version of it there's

184
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:53,439
lots of other versions but it's somehow

185
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,120
organized around the idea that it's

186
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,079
through living your life that you become

187
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,759
who you are it's not facts that are

188
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,598
sort of true about you independent of

189
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,080
your living your life

190
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:07,360
but then

191
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,560
if there's no god in that view

192
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,160
does any of the decisions matter so how

193
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,959
does existentialism differ from nihilism

194
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
good okay great question

195
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,239
there's two different ways that you're

196
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,400
you're asking it

197
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,280
um let me leave nihilism to the side for

198
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,079
just a second and think about mattering

199
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,359
or

200
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,279
is there any

201
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,439
way that you can criticize someone for

202
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,959
me for doing for living the way they do

203
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,598
if you're in existence including

204
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:39,279
yourself including yourself yeah start

205
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:41,598
addresses that and he says um

206
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,318
yes he says there is a criticism that

207
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,319
you can make of yourself or of others

208
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,720
and it's the criticism of living in such

209
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,520
a way as to fail to take responsibility

210
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,599
for your choices he gives these two sort

211
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,560
of amazing examples

212
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,240
one

213
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,199
doesn't i don't know if it reads as well

214
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,840
as for us as it uh as it did in sort of

215
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,080
mid 20th century paris

216
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,318
but it's about a waiter

217
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,959
he gives this in in his big book being

218
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,360
in nothingness and he says um so waiters

219
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,478
play played still do i think in a

220
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,639
certain way in paris a big role in in

221
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,199
parisian society to be a waiter involved

222
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,960
having a certain kind of identity being

223
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,680
a certain way

224
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,918
uh taking control of in charge of the

225
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,319
experience of the people that you're

226
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,639
you're waiting on but also you know

227
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,320
really being the authority like knowing

228
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,440
that this is the the way it's supposed

229
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,719
to go

230
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,039
and so sartre imagines a waiter who does

231
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,760
everything that a waiter is supposed to

232
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,879
do

233
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:45,759
the perfect form of the waiter

234
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:47,759
except that you can somehow see in the

235
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,480
way he's doing it

236
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,399
that he's doing it because he believes

237
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,759
that's the way a waiter should

238
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,639
act

239
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,399
not

240
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,720
so there's some sense in which he's

241
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,159
passing off the responsibility for his

242
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,240
actions

243
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,639
onto some idea of what those actions

244
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,440
should be he's not taking responsibility

245
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,759
for it he's sort of playing a role

246
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,640
and the contours of the role are

247
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:15,439
predetermined by someone other than him

248
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,199
so he starts as acting in bad faith

249
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,839
and that's

250
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,480
criticizable because it's acting in such

251
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,399
a way as to fail to take responsibility

252
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,278
for the kind of being sart thinks you

253
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,799
are

254
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,519
so you're not taking response so that's

255
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,879
one example and i think you know i think

256
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,959
any teenager

257
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,879
if you've ever met a teenager you've

258
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:38,639
known someone who who does that

259
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:41,360
teenagers try on roles they think if i

260
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,919
dressed like this i would be cool so

261
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,080
i'll dress like this or if i spoke like

262
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,079
this or acted like this

263
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,240
and it's natural for a teenager who's

264
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,680
trying to figure out what their you know

265
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,440
what their identity is to go through a

266
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,278
phase like that but if you continue to

267
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,120
do that then you're you're really

268
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,799
passing it so that's one example the

269
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,560
other example he gives

270
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:05,519
is an example uh not of passing off

271
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,838
responsibility by

272
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,799
pretending that someone else

273
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,959
is the ground of your choice but passing

274
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,319
off responsibility by pretending that

275
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,719
you might be able to get away with not

276
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,800
making a choice at all

277
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,360
so he says you're always everything you

278
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:24,559
do is a result of your choices and so he

279
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,639
gives this other example there you are

280
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,838
on the first date

281
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,919
first date

282
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,760
and the date the evening reaches moment

283
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:37,360
when

284
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,958
might be appropriate for one person

285
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,639
to

286
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,319
hold the hand of the other

287
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:46,480
that's the moment in the date where you

288
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,079
are and so you make a choice you decide

289
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,000
i think it's think it's that time and

290
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,278
you hold the hand

291
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,120
and what should happen is that the other

292
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,919
person also makes a choice on sart's

293
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,078
view

294
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,000
either they reject the hand

295
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,679
not that time and i'm taking

296
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,480
responsibility for that

297
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:04,799
or they grasp the hands back

298
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,879
that's a choice but there's a thing that

299
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,240
sometimes happens which is that the

300
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,159
other person

301
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,039
leaves the hand there cold dead and

302
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,879
clammy neither rejecting it nor

303
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:18,480
embracing it

304
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:21,039
and start says that's also bad faith

305
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,959
that's also acting as if we're a kind of

306
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,838
being that we're not

307
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,439
because it pretends that it's possible

308
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,800
not to make a choice

309
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,040
and we're the beings who are always

310
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,278
making choices that was a choice

311
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,319
and you're pretending as if it's the

312
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,000
kind of thing that you don't have to

313
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,320
take responsibility for

314
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,399
so both of the examples you've given

315
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,800
there's some sense in which the social

316
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,120
interactions between humans

317
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,799
is the kind of moving away from the full

318
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,200
responsibility

319
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,519
that you as a human

320
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,399
in the view of existentialism should

321
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,320
take on so like isn't all isn't the

322
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,159
basic conversation a delegation or

323
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
responsibility just

324
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,838
holding a hand there you're putting the

325
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,000
response some of the responsibility into

326
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,560
the court of the other person

327
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,240
and for the waiter if you exist in a

328
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:12,319
society

329
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,600
you are generally trying on a roll

330
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,360
i mean like

331
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,399
all of us are trying on a roll me

332
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,560
wearing clothes yeah it's me trying on a

333
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,159
roll that i was told to try uh as

334
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,799
opposed to walking around naked all the

335
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,679
time like there's there's like standards

336
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:31,120
of how you operate and that's not

337
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:32,799
that's a decision that's not my own

338
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,639
that's me seeing what everyone else is

339
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,719
doing and copying them

340
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,680
yeah exactly so

341
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,720
sart thinks that

342
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:45,439
in the ideal you should try to resist

343
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,879
that other existentialists think

344
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,000
that

345
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:53,600
that's actually a clue to how you should

346
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,078
live well yeah so sarge says somewhere

347
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,839
else hell is other people

348
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,919
why is hell other people for start well

349
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,040
because other people are making choices

350
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,919
also

351
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,039
and when other people make choices

352
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,159
they

353
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,078
put some pressure on me

354
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,519
to think that the choice they made is

355
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:15,278
one that i should

356
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,959
uh copy or one that i should

357
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,120
sort of promote

358
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,599
but if i do it because they did it then

359
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,720
i'm in bad faith for sorry

360
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,200
so it's it is as if sart's view is like

361
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,519
we would be better if we were all alone

362
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,278
i mean this this is this is really

363
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,839
simplifying starts position and this is

364
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,480
really just mostly start in a certain

365
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,440
period of his of his formation

366
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,199
but anyhow we can imagine that view and

367
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,279
i think there's something to the idea

368
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,679
that's art is attracted to it at least

369
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,799
in the mid 40s can you dig into hell as

370
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,879
other people is there some obviously

371
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,599
it's kind of a almost like a literary

372
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,679
like you push the point strongly to

373
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,079
really explore that point

374
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,439
but is there some sense in that other

375
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,759
people

376
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,279
ruin the experience of what it means to

377
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,360
be human

378
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:08,320
i think for start the phenomenon is this

379
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,600
like it's not just that you wear clothes

380
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,079
because people wear clothes in our

381
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,480
society like you have a particular style

382
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:17,359
you wear a particular kind of clothes

383
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,639
right and for sartre like to have that

384
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,159
style authentically in good faith rather

385
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,320
than in bad faith

386
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,679
it has to come from you you have to make

387
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,920
the choice

388
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,559
but other people are making choices also

389
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,879
and like you're looking at their choices

390
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:36,559
and you're thinking that guy looks good

391
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:38,399
maybe i could try that one on and

392
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,399
if you try it on because you were

393
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,320
influenced by the fact that you thought

394
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,679
that guy was doing it well

395
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,519
then there's some important sense in

396
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,679
which although that's a resource for a

397
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,879
choice for you it's also acting in bad

398
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,838
faith

399
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,799
so

400
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,800
so god and god wouldn't do that right

401
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:57,519
god wouldn't be influenced by others

402
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,039
decisions and if that's the model

403
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,399
then that's i think that's the sense in

404
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,879
which he thinks hell is other people

405
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,559
what do you think parenting is then it's

406
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,519
like what because god doesn't have a

407
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,759
parent yeah so aren't we significantly

408
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,839
influenced first of all in the first few

409
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,919
years of

410
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,880
life um and in the even even the

411
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,399
teenager is resisting again learning

412
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:21,120
through resistance

413
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,720
so absolutely i mean i think what you're

414
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,600
pushing on

415
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,120
is the intuition

416
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,240
that the ideal that starts aiming at is

417
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,120
a kind of

418
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,799
inhuman ideal i mean we're we're there's

419
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,519
many ways in which we're not like the

420
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,198
traditional view of what god was

421
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,039
one is that

422
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:43,198
we're not self-generating we have

423
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,759
parents we

424
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:49,439
we're raised into

425
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,079
traditions and social norms and we're

426
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,360
raised into an understanding of what's

427
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:58,159
appropriate and inappropriate to do

428
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,120
and i think that's a deep intuition i

429
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,879
think that's exactly right

430
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,639
martin heidegger who's the who's the

431
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,519
philosopher that's art thinks he's sort

432
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,000
of taking this from but i think starts a

433
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,720
kind of brilliant french

434
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,720
misinterpretation of eideker's german

435
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,639
phenomenological view

436
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,440
heidegger says

437
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,159
a crucial aspect of what it is to be us

438
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,639
is our throneness we're thrown into a

439
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,399
situation we're thrown into history

440
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,198
we're thrown into

441
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,120
our parental lineage we're and we don't

442
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,120
choose it that's stuff that we don't

443
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,198
choose we couldn't choose

444
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,639
if we were god and we existed outside of

445
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,278
time maybe

446
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,919
but we're not we're finite in the sense

447
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:45,120
that we have a beginning that we never

448
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,958
chose we have an end that we're con you

449
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,278
know often trying to

450
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:51,039
resist or put off for something

451
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,120
and in between there's a whole bunch of

452
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,159
stuff that organizes us without our ever

453
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,159
having

454
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,159
made the choice and without our being

455
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,480
the kind of being that could make the

456
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,639
choice to allow it to organize us

457
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,439
we have a complicated relationship to

458
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,720
that stuff and i i think we should talk

459
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,439
about that at a certain point but the

460
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,240
the first move is to say zara's just got

461
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,798
a

462
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,240
sort of descriptive problem he's missed

463
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:19,918
this basic fact that um there's an awful

464
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,038
there has to be an awful lot about us

465
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,640
that's

466
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,240
settled

467
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,199
without our having made the choice to

468
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,440
settle it that way right the throneness

469
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,200
of life yeah you have that's a

470
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,679
fundamental part of life you can't just

471
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,919
escape it exactly you can't escape it

472
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,440
all together all together yeah exactly

473
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,759
you can't escape it all together but

474
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,000
nevertheless you are riding a wave

475
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,599
and you make a decision of the in the

476
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,679
writing of the way you can't control the

477
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:46,480
wave but you should be uh

478
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,720
like

479
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,160
as you ride it you should be making

480
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,000
certain kinds of decisions and take

481
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,080
responsibility

482
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,679
for it so

483
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,079
why does this

484
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,280
matter at all the the chain of decisions

485
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,960
you make

486
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,519
good well because they constitute you

487
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,160
they make you the person that you are so

488
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,798
you here's what's the opposite view

489
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,759
what's what's this view against uh this

490
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:14,400
view is against most of philosophy from

491
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,640
plato forward plato

492
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,360
plato says in the republic it's a kind

493
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,720
of myth but you know he he says people

494
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,519
will understand

495
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,759
their their condition well if they if we

496
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:28,319
tell them this myth he says look when

497
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,000
you're born there's just a fact about

498
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:33,038
you your soul

499
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,319
is either gold silver or bronze that's

500
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,720
those are the three kinds of people

501
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,879
there are and you're born that way and

502
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,200
if your soul is gold then we should

503
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,679
identify that and make you a philosopher

504
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,880
king yeah and if your soul is silver

505
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,559
well you're not going to be a

506
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,320
philosopher king you're not capable of

507
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,918
it but you could be a good warrior and

508
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,759
we should make you that and if your soul

509
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,440
is bronze then you should be a farmer

510
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,119
laborer or something like that and

511
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,558
that's a fact about you

512
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,678
that

513
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:02,480
identifies you forever and for always

514
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,280
independent of anything you do about it

515
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,519
and so that's the alternative view and

516
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,279
you you could have modern versions of it

517
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,798
you could say the thing that identifies

518
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,319
you is your iq

519
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:16,000
or your genetic makeup or

520
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:18,720
the percentage of fast twitch muscle

521
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,279
fibers you've got or whatever it could

522
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,519
be something it's totally independent of

523
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,879
any choice that you've made independent

524
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,480
of the kind of thing about which you

525
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,600
could make a choice

526
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,079
and it

527
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,439
and it categorizes you it makes you the

528
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:32,319
person that you are that's the that's

529
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,558
the thing that started and the

530
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,279
existentialists are against

531
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:36,079
uh

532
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,720
so

533
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:41,359
this idea that something about you is

534
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,839
forever limiting the space of possible

535
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:46,879
decisions you can make sarcha says

536
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,119
no the space is unlimited start is the

537
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,559
the philosopher of radical freedom

538
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,519
radical freedom yeah radical freedom and

539
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,319
then you could have other

540
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,480
existentialists who say look we are free

541
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,240
but we gotta we gotta understand what

542
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,480
the way in which our freedom is limited

543
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,798
by certain aspects of the kind of being

544
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,558
that we are if we were radically free we

545
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:08,960
really would be like god in the

546
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,519
traditional medieval sense

547
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,240
and and not sort of these folks start

548
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,158
with the idea that look whatever we are

549
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,839
that's a kind of limit point that we're

550
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,640
not going to reach

551
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,319
so

552
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,000
what what are the ways in which we're

553
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,399
constrained that

554
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,440
that that being the way the medievals

555
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,919
understood him wasn't constrained so can

556
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,480
you maybe comment on what is nihilism

557
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,559
and is it at all a useful

558
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,319
other sort of group of ideas that you

559
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,720
resist against in defining

560
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,240
existentialism yes good excellent so

561
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,200
nihilism

562
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,359
the the philosopher who made the term

563
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,720
popular although it was used before him

564
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,639
is nietzsche nietzsche's writing in the

565
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,159
end of the 19th century

566
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,559
in

567
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,840
various places where he he published

568
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,798
things but largely in his unpublished

569
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,639
works

570
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,279
he

571
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,280
identifies the condition of the modern

572
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,038
world as nihilistic

573
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,678
and that's

574
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,480
a descriptive claim he's looking around

575
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,798
him

576
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,120
trying to figure out what it's like to

577
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,079
be us now

578
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,479
and

579
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,158
he says it's a lot different from what

580
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,519
it was like to be

581
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,960
human in 1300 or in the fifth century

582
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,279
bce

583
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,200
in 1300

584
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,960
like what people

585
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,798
believed what they the the way they

586
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,880
lived their lives

587
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,759
was in the

588
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,159
understanding that to be human was to be

589
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,279
created in the image and likeness of god

590
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,320
that's the way they understood

591
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,279
themselves

592
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,439
and also to be created sinful

593
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,678
because of you know adam and eve's

594
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,558
transgression in the garden of eden

595
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,440
and to have the project of trying to

596
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:55,599
understand how as a sinful being you

597
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,759
could nevertheless live a life a

598
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,678
virtuous life how could you do that and

599
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,839
it had to do with for them getting in

600
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,798
the right relation to god he just says

601
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,720
we we

602
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,720
that doesn't make sense to us anymore in

603
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,759
the end of the 19th century

604
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,519
god is dead says nietzsche famously

605
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:12,720
and what does that mean well it means

606
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,359
something like

607
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,240
the role that god used to play in our

608
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,599
understanding of ourselves as a culture

609
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,440
isn't a role that

610
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:23,839
that god can play anymore

611
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,919
and so nietzsche says

612
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,319
the role that god used to play was the

613
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,080
role of grounding our existence he was

614
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,359
what it is in virtue of which we are who

615
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,000
we are

616
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:36,079
and nietzsche says

617
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,079
the idea that there is a being that

618
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,158
makes us what we are doesn't make sense

619
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,759
anymore that's like atheism so artists

620
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,679
taking that from nature and so the

621
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,480
question is

622
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,038
what does ground our existence and the

623
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,960
answer is knee hill nothing

624
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:53,359
and so nihilism is the idea that there's

625
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,798
nothing outside of us that grounds our

626
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,759
existence

627
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:59,119
and then nietzsche asks the question

628
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,000
well what are we supposed to do about

629
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,759
that how do we live

630
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,519
and i i you know

631
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:07,119
i think nietzsche has a different story

632
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,038
than start about that

633
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,879
nietzsche doesn't say

634
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,200
doesn't emphasize

635
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,039
this notion of radical freedom nietzsche

636
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,319
emphasizes something else

637
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,720
he says

638
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:23,599
we're artists of life

639
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,038
and artists are interesting because

640
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:26,879
the natural way of thinking about

641
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,158
artists is that they're responding to

642
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,159
something

643
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,760
they find themselves in a situation and

644
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,200
they say this is what's going to make

645
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,519
sense of the situation this is what i

646
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,279
have to write this is the way i have to

647
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,798
dance this is the way i've got to play

648
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,798
the music

649
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:43,200
and nietzsche says we should live like

650
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,240
that there are constraints but like

651
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,038
understanding what they are is

652
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,480
complicated

653
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:54,079
aspect of of living itself and there's a

654
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,038
great story i think uh from music that

655
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,439
maybe

656
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,599
helps to understand this i i think

657
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,200
nietzsche of course jazz didn't exist

658
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,038
when nietzsche was writing

659
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,798
but i think nietzsche really think is

660
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,200
thinking of something like jazz

661
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,798
improvisation i mean he he he talks

662
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,798
about improvisation there's classical

663
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,200
improvisation nietzsche was by the way a

664
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:16,240
musician i mean he was a composer and a

665
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,798
pianist not a great one really

666
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,919
to be fair but but he loved music

667
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,400
and

668
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,159
herbie hancock who's a pianist a jazz

669
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,240
pianist

670
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,840
who played with miles davis for quite a

671
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,359
while in the 60s

672
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:34,079
tells this kind of incredible story

673
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,199
that i think exemplifies nietzsche's

674
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:36,399
view

675
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,319
about

676
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,120
the way in which

677
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:43,038
we bear some responsibility for being

678
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,959
creative

679
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:47,038
and that gives us a certain kind of

680
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,480
freedom

681
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:50,319
but we don't have the the radical

682
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,240
response the radical freedom that's art

683
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,519
thinks so what's the story herbie

684
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,880
hancock says

685
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,038
they're they're they i think they were

686
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,880
in stuttgart he says

687
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,720
playing it playing a

688
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,200
show and

689
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,159
things were great he says i'm pl he's a

690
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,759
young pianist and miles davis is the

691
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,480
master

692
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,278
and he says i'm i'm playing the i'm back

693
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,400
in the

694
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,839
solo and i'm playing these chords and he

695
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,320
says

696
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,119
i played this chord

697
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,730
and

698
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,558
it was the wrong chord

699
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,480
[Laughter]

700
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,038
he's like it just like that's what you

701
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,599
got to say it didn't work right there

702
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,278
and i thought holy mackerel i screwed up

703
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,439
you know i screwed up we were tight

704
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:36,880
everything was working and i blew it for

705
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,240
miles who's doing his solo and he said

706
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,360
miles

707
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:45,440
uh paused for a moment

708
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:47,038
and then all of a sudden he went on

709
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,750
in a way that

710
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,679
made my cord right

711
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,240
[Laughter]

712
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,000
and i think that idea that like you

713
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,000
could be an artist who responds to

714
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,720
what's thrown at you

715
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,880
in such a way as to

716
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,120
make it right

717
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,799
by what measure

718
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,918
everyone could hear it is all you can

719
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:11,119
say right everyone knew wow that really

720
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,600
works

721
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:15,119
and i think that's not like there are

722
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,359
constraints not anything would have

723
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,798
worked there he couldn't have just

724
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,959
played anything

725
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,200
most of what anyone would have played

726
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,278
would have sounded terrible

727
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,679
but the constraints aren't like

728
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,919
pre-existing they're sort of

729
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,480
what's happening now in the moment for

730
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,000
these listeners and these performers and

731
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,759
i think that's what nietzsche thinks the

732
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,038
right response to nihilism is we're

733
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,960
involved

734
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,879
but we're not radically free to make any

735
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,079
choice and just stand behind it the way

736
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,000
sart thinks

737
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,439
our choices have to be responsive to our

738
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,839
situation

739
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,759
and they have to make the situation work

740
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,199
they have to make it right

741
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,919
and there's there's something about

742
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,960
music too so you basically have to make

743
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,919
music

744
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,319
of all the moments of life and there is

745
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,520
something about music why is music so

746
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,200
compelling

747
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,519
and when you listen to it something

748
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,519
about certain kinds of music it connects

749
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,000
with you it doesn't make any sense but

750
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:12,000
in that same way for nietzsche

751
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,720
you should be a creative force

752
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,798
that creates a musical masterpiece

753
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,480
exactly and i think what's interesting

754
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,558
is the question what does it mean to be

755
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,440
a creative force there there's a

756
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:25,918
traditional notion of creation

757
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,480
that we associate with with god

758
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,600
god creates ex nihilo out of nothing

759
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,200
and

760
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,599
you might think that nihilism thinks

761
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,679
that we should do that create ex nihilo

762
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,199
because it's about how there's nothing

763
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,159
at our ground but i think the right way

764
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,159
to read nietzsche is to recognize that

765
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,799
we don't create out of nothing miles

766
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,520
davis wasn't nothing that situation

767
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,918
pre-existed him it was given to him

768
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,480
maybe by accident maybe it was a mistake

769
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,440
whatever but he was responding to that

770
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,519
situation in a way that made it right he

771
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,960
wasn't just creating out of nothing he

772
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,038
was creating out of what was already

773
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,038
there so that makes that first date with

774
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,158
the climbing hand even more complicated

775
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,079
because

776
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,840
you're giving a climbing hand you're

777
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,359
gonna have to make art and music out of

778
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,759
that exactly and that's the

779
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,599
responsibility for both for both of them

780
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,000
wow that's a lot of responsibility for a

781
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,639
first date because you have to

782
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,558
create it's just the emphasis isn't just

783
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,480
on making decisions

784
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:28,158
it's on um

785
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,880
creating and but also on listening right

786
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,880
i mean miles davis was listening he

787
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,799
heard that he knew it was wrong and the

788
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,200
question was what do i play that makes

789
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,200
it right

790
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,000
so let me ask about nietzsche

791
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,760
[Music]

792
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,599
is god dead

793
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,240
what did he mean by that statement yeah

794
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,278
what's in your sons the truth behind the

795
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,000
question

796
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,319
and the possible set of answers that our

797
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,519
world today provides

798
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:57,678
good so i i mean i i think that

799
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,240
there's something super perceptive about

800
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,240
nietzsche's diagnosis of the condition

801
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,798
at the end of the 19th century

802
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,839
so not so far from the condition that i

803
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,679
think we're currently in

804
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:11,038
and i think there's an interesting

805
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,399
question what we're supposed to respond

806
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,079
what we're supposed to do in response

807
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:15,439
but what what is the condition that

808
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,879
we're currently in when nietzsche says

809
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,519
god is dead

810
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,399
i think like i was saying before he he

811
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,798
means something like the role that god

812
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:27,199
used to play in grounding our existence

813
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,798
is not a role that works for us anymore

814
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,679
as a culture

815
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,759
and when people talk about a view like

816
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,679
that nowadays they use a different

817
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,519
terminology but i think it's roughly

818
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,399
what nietzsche was aiming at

819
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,319
they say we live in a secular age

820
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,719
our age is a secular age and so what

821
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,000
what do people mean when they say that

822
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,519
i think

823
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,720
first of all it's a descriptive claim it

824
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,000
could be wrong

825
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,159
the question is does this really

826
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,640
describe the way we experience ourselves

827
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,120
as a culture or as a culture in the west

828
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,640
or wherever it is that we are

829
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,639
so what does it mean to say that we live

830
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,399
in a secular age an age in which god is

831
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,080
dead well it first thing is it doesn't

832
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,678
mean there are no religious believers

833
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:07,119
because there are plenty there are lots

834
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,679
of people who

835
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:12,239
go to church or synagogue or mosque you

836
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,159
know every week or more and there are

837
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,599
people who

838
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,200
really find that to be an important

839
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,000
aspect of the way they live their lives

840
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,519
but

841
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,558
it does mean

842
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,720
that for those people

843
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,319
the role of their religion the role that

844
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,399
the religious their religious belief

845
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,720
plays in their life isn't the same as it

846
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:33,918
used to be in previous ages so what's

847
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,600
that role

848
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,320
we'll go back to the high middle ages

849
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:40,319
that was clearly not a secular age

850
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,678
that was a religious age

851
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:46,240
and so there we are in 1300 dante is

852
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,960
writing the divine comedy or something

853
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,759
and what did it what did it mean then to

854
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,519
live in a sacred age well it meant

855
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,000
not just that

856
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,398
the default was that you were were a

857
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,960
christian in the west

858
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,479
but that your christianity your

859
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,000
religious belief your religious

860
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,640
affiliation

861
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,720
justified certain

862
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,799
assumptions about people who didn't

863
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,480
share that religious belief

864
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:16,480
so you're a christian

865
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,640
in the west in 1300 and you meet someone

866
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,558
who's a muslim

867
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,080
and the fact that they don't share your

868
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,558
religious belief

869
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:27,119
justifies the conclusion

870
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,278
that they're less than human

871
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,959
and that's that was the ground of the

872
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:34,798
you know the crusades that was the

873
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,399
religious wars of the high middle ages

874
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,200
we live in it to say that we live in a

875
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,398
secular age is to say that

876
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,840
not that we don't have there aren't a

877
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,000
lot of people who have religious belief

878
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:47,038
there are but it's to say that their

879
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,798
religious belief ju doesn't justify that

880
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,000
conclusion

881
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:52,480
if

882
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,960
you're a religious believer

883
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,798
and you meet me and suppose i'm not a

884
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,600
religious believer

885
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,599
learning that about me doesn't justify

886
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:04,240
your concluding that i'm less than human

887
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:06,240
right and that's the kind of liberalism

888
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,640
of the of the modern age most of the

889
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,640
time we think that's a good thing we let

890
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,799
a thousand flowers bloom there are lots

891
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,038
of ways to live a good life

892
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:17,119
and there's some way in which that that

893
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,079
is a nice progressive kind of liberal

894
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,439
thought

895
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,079
but it's also true that it's an

896
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,120
undermining thought because

897
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,639
it means

898
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:29,839
if you're a religious believer now

899
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,759
your belief can't ground your

900
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,599
understanding of what you ought to be

901
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,679
aiming at in the life

902
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,959
in the way it used to be able to you

903
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,960
can't say

904
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,679
as a religious believer i know it's

905
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,960
right to do this because you also know

906
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,559
that if you meet someone who doesn't

907
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,159
share that religious belief and so

908
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:48,158
doesn't think it's right to do that

909
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,200
necessarily or does but for different

910
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,440
reasons

911
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,640
you you can't conclude that they've got

912
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,399
it wrong

913
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,679
so there's this sort of unsettling

914
00:32:54,398 --> 00:33:00,639
aspect to it well isn't it true that uh

915
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,679
you you can't conclude as a as a public

916
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,038
statement to others but within your own

917
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,759
mind

918
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:11,679
it's almost like an existentialist

919
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:14,798
version of uh belief which is like it's

920
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,480
you create the world and

921
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,720
around you like it doesn't matter what

922
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,000
others believe you don't

923
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,960
there's not it's actually almost like um

924
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
empowering thought so as opposed to the

925
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,319
more

926
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,278
traditional view of religion

927
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:33,439
where it's like a tribal idea like where

928
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:34,798
you share that idea together here you

929
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,038
have the full

930
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,798
back disartry a full responsibility of

931
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,359
your beliefs as well

932
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:44,319
good good but what you're describing

933
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:46,398
is not a religious believer right you're

934
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:48,398
describing someone who's

935
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:49,918
found in themselves the ground of their

936
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,000
existence rather than in something

937
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,720
outside of themselves so the religious

938
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,759
belief i mean if you go full sartrean

939
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,399
then

940
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,398
uh well you're not in a position to

941
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,000
criticize others for the choices that

942
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,398
they make

943
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,558
but you are in a position to criticize

944
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,319
them for the way in which they make them

945
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,719
either taking responsibility or not

946
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,039
taking responsibility but the but the

947
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,199
religious believer used to be able to

948
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:17,440
say look the choices that i make are

949
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,799
right because god demands that i make

950
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,878
them

951
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,079
and nowadays

952
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,159
like

953
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,440
and so it would be wrong to make any

954
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,960
others

955
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,639
and nowadays

956
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,559
are kind of

957
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,639
to say that we live in a secular age say

958
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,078
well you you can't quite can't quite do

959
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,878
that and be a religious believer your

960
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,280
religious belief can't can't justify

961
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,039
that move and so it can't ground

962
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,040
your life in the way it does so it's

963
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,440
sort of unsettling i think that's one of

964
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,039
the interpretations of what nietzsche

965
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,119
might have meant when he said god is

966
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,279
dead god can't play the role for

967
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,639
religious believers in our world that he

968
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,119
used to

969
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,639
but we nevertheless find meaning i mean

970
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,960
you don't see

971
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,440
nihilism as a prevalent set of ideas

972
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,159
that are overtaken modern culture so a

973
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,920
secular world is still full of meaning

974
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,838
good well i think that's the interesting

975
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,159
question i i think i think it's

976
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,920
certainly possible for a secular world

977
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,559
to be a world in which we live

978
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,720
meaningful lives worthwhile lives lives

979
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:20,880
that uh are

980
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:23,759
sort of um worthy of respect and that we

981
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,160
can be proud of of aiming to live

982
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,920
but but i think it is a hard question

983
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,838
what we're doing when we do that and

984
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,000
that's the that is the question of

985
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:34,960
existence sort of what does it mean

986
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,719
to exist in a way that brings us out at

987
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,720
our best as the beings that we are

988
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,719
that's the question for existentialism

989
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,920
so besides sartre who do you is the

990
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,838
most important existentialist to

991
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,000
understand for others what ideas in

992
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:52,880
particular of theirs do you like

993
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,280
maybe

994
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,400
other existential it's not just one yeah

995
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,720
so sartre is the grounding strong

996
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,680
atheistic existentialism statement who

997
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,078
else is

998
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,480
uh there so in i'm teaching an

999
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,320
existentialism course now and i think

1000
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,920
the tradition goes back at least to the

1001
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,838
17th century

1002
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,838
um and i'll just tell you some of the

1003
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,039
figures that that i'm teaching there we

1004
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,159
could talk about any of them that you

1005
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,800
like

1006
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,159
the the figure i start with is pascal

1007
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,039
pascal

1008
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,480
french

1009
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,039
mathematician

1010
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,519
uh from the 17th century he died i'm

1011
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,599
terrible with dates but i think 1661 or

1012
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:32,639
something like that middle of the 17th

1013
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,720
century brilliant polymath sort of we

1014
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,639
have computer languages named after him

1015
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,519
he built the first mechanical

1016
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,400
calculating machine he's but he he was

1017
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,199
also

1018
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,760
deeply invested in his understanding of

1019
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:48,399
what christianity was

1020
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,640
and he thought that

1021
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,559
everyone before him

1022
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:56,000
had really misunderstood what

1023
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:58,719
christianity was that they'd really um

1024
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,639
attempted to think about it not as a way

1025
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,559
of living a life

1026
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,000
but as a set of beliefs

1027
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,400
that you can have

1028
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,880
and which you can justify

1029
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,200
and i think that's the first

1030
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,559
move that's kind that's really pretty

1031
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,799
interesting and then figures like

1032
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:17,440
kierkegaard and dostoyevsky

1033
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,880
um developed that move and and they're

1034
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,639
all of those are

1035
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,000
take themselves to be defending an

1036
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,679
interpretation of a certain kind of

1037
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,599
christianity

1038
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:27,118
an existential interpretation of

1039
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,800
christianity

1040
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,519
and then i think there are other figures

1041
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,280
other theistic figures uh figures like

1042
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:38,559
um camus and uh fanon who

1043
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,400
mid 20th century figures and then i'll

1044
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:42,799
just mention the figure who i think is

1045
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,519
the most interesting is martin heidegger

1046
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,440
he's a complicated figure uh because by

1047
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:50,159
the way when you said uh sorry to

1048
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,639
interrupt that when you said camus

1049
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,480
you meant atheistic i think that camus

1050
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,879
is an atheistic existentialist yeah i'm

1051
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,199
happy to talk about that so okay so we

1052
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,519
got it's like sports cards yeah yeah the

1053
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,759
different exercises so maybe let's go to

1054
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,838
uh

1055
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,320
you know what let's go to dusty yes all

1056
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:11,199
right okay let's do it so my favorite

1057
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,079
novel of his is uh the idiot first of

1058
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,279
all

1059
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:19,359
i see myself as the idiot and an idiot

1060
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,000
and i love the optimism and the love the

1061
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:24,078
main character has for the world

1062
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,119
so that just deeply connects with me as

1063
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,079
a novel

1064
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,960
uh notes from underground as well but

1065
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,160
what

1066
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,559
ideas of this yes do you think are

1067
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,319
existentialists what ideas are formative

1068
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,078
to the whole existentialist movement

1069
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,680
excellent so

1070
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,200
let me talk about the brothers karamazov

1071
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:42,960
yes partly because

1072
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,559
that's the last novel that dostoevsky

1073
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,800
wrote i think it's certainly one of the

1074
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:49,119
greatest novels of the 19th century

1075
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,119
uh maybe the best and i'm about to teach

1076
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,160
it in a few weeks so i'm super excited

1077
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,838
about it

1078
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,159
but what's what is the brothers

1079
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,920
karamazov about i mean without

1080
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:00,719
you know without spoiling the ending for

1081
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,519
anyone spoiler alert yeah i mean look

1082
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:06,078
it's it's a murder mystery right i mean

1083
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:08,159
the father gets murdered

1084
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,240
and the question is who did it who's

1085
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,719
responsible for it so there's a notion

1086
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,439
of responsibility here like consort but

1087
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,118
it's responsibility for a murder that's

1088
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,838
what we're talking about

1089
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,680
and there's a bunch of brothers

1090
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:22,719
each of whom

1091
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,279
has

1092
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:28,000
pretty good motivation for having

1093
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,960
murdered the father the father's a jerk

1094
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,119
i mean he's you know if anybody is

1095
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,400
worthy of being murdered he's the guy

1096
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,599
he's he's he's a force of chaos and he's

1097
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,079
nasty in all sorts of ways

1098
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,519
but still it's not not good to murder

1099
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,599
people

1100
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,519
so so what's the what's the view of

1101
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,039
dostoevsky i mean it's this intense

1102
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,159
exploration

1103
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:54,079
of what it means to be involved in

1104
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,759
various ways

1105
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,760
with an activity

1106
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:03,119
that everyone can recognize is atrocious

1107
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,200
and what the right way is to take

1108
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,200
responsibility for that

1109
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:10,159
what the right way is to

1110
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:13,919
relate to others in the face of it and

1111
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:16,480
how even through this kind of action

1112
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,200
you can achieve some kind of salvation

1113
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,199
that's dostoyevsky's word for it you can

1114
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,679
le and but salvation

1115
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:26,078
here and now not like you live some

1116
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,679
afterlife where you're you know paradise

1117
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,519
for eternity

1118
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:30,960
who cares about that says one of the

1119
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,440
characters

1120
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,199
that doesn't make my life now any good

1121
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,200
and it doesn't justify any of the bad

1122
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:40,159
things that happen in my life now what

1123
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:42,318
matters is can we live well

1124
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:43,920
in the face of these things that we do

1125
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:46,559
and have to take responsibility for so

1126
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,599
it's this intense exploration

1127
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,838
of

1128
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,200
notions and gradations of guilt and

1129
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:54,078
responsibility and the possibility of

1130
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:56,480
love

1131
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,960
and salvation in the face of those it is

1132
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,199
incredibly human work

1133
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,960
and hit but i think dostoevsky is the

1134
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:04,879
opposite of sartre

1135
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,559
and let me just i think it's so

1136
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,119
fascinating i don't know anybody else

1137
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,880
who notices this but sart in sard

1138
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,720
actually quotes a passage from

1139
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,079
dostoevsky when he's developing his view

1140
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,559
it's close to a passage it doesn't

1141
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,440
appear quite in this way but the passage

1142
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:22,880
that sartre quotes is is this

1143
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,559
it's it's in the form of an argument

1144
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,680
sorry puts it in the form of an argument

1145
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,599
he says

1146
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,598
um look there's a a conditional

1147
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,280
statement is true

1148
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,440
if there is no god then everything is

1149
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,079
permitted

1150
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,519
and then there's a second premise

1151
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,359
there is no god

1152
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,199
that's sart's view i mean he's an

1153
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:42,799
atheist there is no god

1154
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,799
conclusion

1155
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,519
everything is permitted

1156
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,599
and that starts radical freedom

1157
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,440
and if you think about the structure of

1158
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,680
the brothers karamazov i think

1159
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,079
dostoevsky though he never says it this

1160
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:58,480
way would run the argument differently

1161
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,039
it's a modus tollens instead of a modus

1162
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,920
ponens the argument for dostoevsky would

1163
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,519
go like this yeah conditional statement

1164
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,880
if there is no god then everything is

1165
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,199
permitted

1166
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,680
but look at your life

1167
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:14,318
not everything is permitted

1168
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,199
you do horrible atrocious things

1169
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,440
like

1170
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,919
be involved in the death of your father

1171
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,000
and there is a price to pay that's not a

1172
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,599
livable moment

1173
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,039
you to take to have to take

1174
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,079
responsibility

1175
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:31,519
to have to recognize that you're at

1176
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,280
fault or you're somehow guilty for

1177
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,119
having been involved in whatever way you

1178
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,800
were and letting that happen or bringing

1179
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,480
it about that it does happen

1180
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,119
is to pay a price

1181
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,559
so we're not beings that are constituted

1182
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,400
in such a way

1183
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,799
that everything is permitted

1184
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,440
look at the facts of your existence

1185
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,720
so not everything is permitted

1186
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,519
therefore

1187
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:53,519
there is a god

1188
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,240
and and and the and the presence of a

1189
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:00,959
god for dostoevsky i think it's just

1190
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,879
found in this fact that when we do bad

1191
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,199
things we feel guilty for them with that

1192
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,358
we find ourselves to be responsible for

1193
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,960
things even when we didn't intend to do

1194
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,880
them but we just allowed ourselves to be

1195
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,159
involved in them and the nature of god

1196
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,160
for just the yeski is i mean unclear

1197
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:17,838
i mean it's a very complex exploration

1198
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:19,838
in itself and he

1199
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:22,400
basically god speaks through several of

1200
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:26,000
his characters in in complicated ways

1201
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,000
yeah so it's not like a trivial

1202
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:31,358
it's totally not trivial and it's not a

1203
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:32,880
a being that exists outside of time and

1204
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,039
none of that is sort of relevant for

1205
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,119
dostoevsky for him it's a question about

1206
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:39,119
how we live our lives do we live our

1207
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,640
lives in the mood that christianity says

1208
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,640
it makes available to us which is the

1209
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,719
mood of joy

1210
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,279
is there um maybe this is a bit of a

1211
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:50,559
tangent but so i'm a russian speaker

1212
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,560
and one of the

1213
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,799
i kind of listen to my heart and what my

1214
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:56,480
heart says is i need to take on this

1215
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,880
project so

1216
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,318
there's a couple of famous translators

1217
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,318
of dostoyevsky and tolstoy

1218
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,240
that live in paris currently so i'm

1219
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,559
going to take the journey

1220
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:12,239
we agreed to have a full conversation

1221
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:14,559
about dostoevsky about tolstoy and like

1222
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,000
a series of conversations

1223
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:17,599
and the reason i fell in love with this

1224
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,920
idea

1225
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,160
is i just realized in translating from

1226
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,599
russian to english

1227
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,399
how

1228
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,960
deep philosophical how much deep

1229
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,119
philosophical thinking is required

1230
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,800
just to get like single sentences they

1231
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:36,880
spent like weeks

1232
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,039
debating single sentences so uh and all

1233
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,200
of that is part of a journey into russia

1234
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,400
for several reasons but i just i want to

1235
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,159
explore

1236
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,079
uh something in me

1237
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,318
that uh

1238
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,599
longs to understand and to connect with

1239
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,400
the roots where i come from

1240
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,240
so

1241
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,318
maybe can you comment whether it's on

1242
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,639
the russian side or the niche of the

1243
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,920
german side

1244
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:01,598
or other

1245
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,599
french side

1246
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,240
is there something in your own

1247
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,720
explorations of these philosophies

1248
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,598
that you find that you miss because you

1249
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,318
don't

1250
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,680
deeply know the language or like how

1251
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:16,400
important is it to understand the

1252
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:18,480
language good i think it's super

1253
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,000
important and i'm always embarrassed

1254
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,000
that i don't know more languages and

1255
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,599
don't know the languages i know as as

1256
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,400
well as i would like to

1257
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:29,359
but there's um but there's a way in so i

1258
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,720
i do think different languages allow you

1259
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,440
to think in different ways and that

1260
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:37,039
there's a sort of a mode of exist a way

1261
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,039
of being that's captured by a language

1262
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:41,440
that it makes certain ways of thinking

1263
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:44,239
about yourself or others more natural

1264
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:48,318
and it closes off other ways of thinking

1265
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:50,959
about yourself and others and so i think

1266
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:53,199
languages are fascinating in that way

1267
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,199
the heidegger who who is this

1268
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:57,199
philosopher that i'm i'm interested in

1269
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,719
says at one point language is the house

1270
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:01,279
of being

1271
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,159
and i think that means something like

1272
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,440
um

1273
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,920
it's by

1274
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,318
living in a language

1275
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,159
that you come to understand or that

1276
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:13,358
possibilities for understanding what it

1277
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:15,440
is to be you and others and anything are

1278
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:16,960
opened up and different languages open

1279
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,039
up different possibilities and we had

1280
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,000
that discussion offline about james

1281
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:23,599
joyce how i took a course in james joyce

1282
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and how i don't think i understood

1283
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,119
anything besides the dead and the short

1284
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,280
stories and you suggested that

1285
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,200
it might be helpful to actually visit

1286
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,359
ireland visit dublin

1287
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,279
to truly to help you understand maybe

1288
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:38,960
fall in love with the words

1289
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,560
and so that

1290
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,400
presumably is not

1291
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,559
purely about the understanding of the

1292
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,280
actual words of the language it's

1293
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:50,078
understanding something much deeper

1294
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,240
the music of the language or something

1295
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,160
music of the ideas

1296
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:56,479
absolutely something like that it's very

1297
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,559
hard to say exactly what that is but

1298
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,599
when you hear an irish person who really

1299
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:03,279
understands joyce read some sentences

1300
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,119
they have a different cadence they have

1301
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,760
a different tonality they have different

1302
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,480
music to use your word and all of a

1303
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,280
sudden you think about them differently

1304
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,639
and the sentences sort of draw different

1305
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,640
thoughts out of you when they're read in

1306
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:20,639
certain ways that's what great actors

1307
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:24,400
can can do but i i think language is is

1308
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:26,480
rich like that and and the idea which

1309
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,119
philosophers tend to have

1310
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,280
that we're really studying the crucial

1311
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,880
aspects of language when we think about

1312
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,200
its logical form

1313
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,200
when we think about the sort of claims

1314
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:39,358
of philosophical logic that you can make

1315
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,679
or how do you translate this proposition

1316
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:43,279
into some symbolic form

1317
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:45,679
i think that's part of what goes on in

1318
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,519
language but i think that when language

1319
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,838
affects us

1320
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:52,800
in the deep way that it can

1321
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:54,159
when great poets or great writers or

1322
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,720
great thinkers

1323
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,639
use it to great effect

1324
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:59,919
it's way more than that and and that's

1325
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:01,519
the interesting form of language that

1326
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,159
i'm interested in it's kind of a

1327
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:07,280
challenge i'm hoping to take on is i

1328
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:09,199
feel like some of the ideas

1329
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,280
that are conveyed to language are

1330
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,239
actually can be put outside of language

1331
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,839
so one of the challenges i have to do is

1332
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:17,358
to have a conversation with people in

1333
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:19,679
russian

1334
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:21,920
but for an english audience

1335
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,519
and not rely purely on translators there

1336
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,639
would of course be translators there

1337
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:25,599
that help

1338
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:27,920
me

1339
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,559
dance through this mess

1340
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,200
of language but also

1341
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,760
like my goal my hope is to dance from

1342
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,598
russian to english back and forth

1343
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,839
for an english-speaking audience and for

1344
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,838
a russian speaking audience so not this

1345
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:44,000
pure this is russian it's going to be

1346
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,838
translated to english or this is english

1347
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,880
it's going to be translated to russian

1348
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:51,199
but dance back and forth and try to

1349
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,559
share with people who don't speak one of

1350
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,318
the languages

1351
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,640
the music that they're missing and sort

1352
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,880
of almost hear that music as if you're

1353
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,960
sitting in another room and you hear the

1354
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,680
music through the wall like get a sense

1355
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,838
of it i think that would be a waste if i

1356
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:08,318
don't try to pursue this

1357
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:09,599
being a bilingual human being and i

1358
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:11,679
wonder

1359
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,160
whether it's possible to capture some of

1360
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,318
the magic of the ideas

1361
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,799
in a way that can be conveyed to people

1362
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,199
who don't speak that particular language

1363
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,599
i think it's a super exciting project i

1364
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:25,759
look forward to following it i'll tell

1365
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,680
you one thing that does happen so we

1366
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,359
read dostoevsky in translation

1367
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,519
occasionally i do have russian speakers

1368
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:34,078
in the room which is super helpful

1369
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:34,960
but i also encourage my students

1370
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,800
um

1371
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,000
to you know to

1372
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,839
some some of them will have different

1373
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,318
translations than others and that can be

1374
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:44,400
really helpful for the non-native

1375
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,800
speaker because

1376
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,680
by paying attention to

1377
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,240
the

1378
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:52,159
places where translators diverge in

1379
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,919
their translations of a given word or a

1380
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,639
phrase or something like that you can

1381
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,800
start to get the idea that somehow the

1382
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:00,799
words that we have in english

1383
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,960
they don't have the same contours as the

1384
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,640
word in russian that's being translated

1385
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,119
and then you can start to ask about what

1386
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:09,759
those differences are

1387
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,599
and i i think it's i think it's there's

1388
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,440
a kind of magic to it i mean it's

1389
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:17,039
astonishing how rich and affecting

1390
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,119
these languages can be for people who

1391
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,719
really who grew up in them especially

1392
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,240
who speak them as leaders and that's a

1393
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:24,239
really powerful thing that actually

1394
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:25,039
doesn't exist enough of

1395
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:27,838
is

1396
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:30,079
uh for example for this dayofsky most

1397
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:33,759
novels have been translated by

1398
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:35,519
uh two or three famous translators and

1399
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,920
uh there's a lot of discussions about

1400
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,519
who did it better and so on but

1401
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,760
i would love to this i'm a computer

1402
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:42,559
science person i would love to do a diff

1403
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,280
where

1404
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,680
you

1405
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,760
automatically detect all the differences

1406
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:50,399
in the translation just as you're saying

1407
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,839
and use that like somebody needs to

1408
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,318
publish literally just

1409
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:58,318
books describing the differences in fact

1410
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:00,000
i'll probably do a little bit of this i

1411
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:02,079
heard the individual translators and

1412
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,960
interviews and in blog posts and

1413
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,318
articles discuss particular phrases that

1414
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,079
they differ on

1415
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:10,400
but like to do that for an entire book

1416
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,800
that's a fascinating exploration

1417
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,519
as an english speaker just read the

1418
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,720
differences in the translations yeah you

1419
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:23,199
probably can get some deep understanding

1420
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:25,118
of ideas in those books by seeing the

1421
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:27,279
struggle of the translators to capture

1422
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,519
that idea that's a really interesting

1423
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,440
idea yeah absolutely and and you you can

1424
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:34,159
do that in for other projects in other

1425
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,559
languages too i mean one of the

1426
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:38,239
i don't know i have this weird huge

1427
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,720
range of interests and some some days

1428
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:43,919
i'll find myself reading about something

1429
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:47,199
at one point i was interested in um 14th

1430
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,400
century german mysticism okay turns out

1431
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:50,799
there's somebody who's written like

1432
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,280
volumes and volumes about this he's

1433
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,400
fantastic and i was i was interested in

1434
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,559
reading uh meister eckhart i i wanted to

1435
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,920
know what was interesting about him and

1436
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,000
the and the

1437
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,838
the the sort of move that this guy

1438
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,800
bernard mcginn who's the great scholar

1439
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:09,838
of this period made was to say what what

1440
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,920
eckhart did and everybody knows this

1441
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:14,558
he translated christianity into the

1442
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,880
vernacular he started giving sermons in

1443
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,160
german to the people used to be in latin

1444
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,519
and nobody could speak latin can you

1445
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,239
imagine sitting there for a two-hour

1446
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:25,759
sermon in a language that you don't know

1447
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:27,519
so he translated it into into german but

1448
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,559
in doing it the resources of the german

1449
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,239
language are different from the

1450
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,119
resources of the latin language and

1451
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,318
there's a word in middle high german

1452
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,760
grunt

1453
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:40,558
which is like we translate it as ground

1454
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,960
and it's got this earthy

1455
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,599
feel to it it sort of invokes the notion

1456
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:48,000
of soil and what you stand on and what

1457
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,838
things grow out of and

1458
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,079
uh sort of what you could run your

1459
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:54,159
fingers through that would have a kind

1460
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,119
of honesty to it

1461
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:57,598
and

1462
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,480
there's no latin word for that but in

1463
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,559
eckart's interpretation of christianity

1464
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,079
that's like the fundamental thing you

1465
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,519
don't understand god until you

1466
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,960
understand the way in which he is our

1467
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:10,000
ground

1468
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,480
and all of a sudden this mysticism gets

1469
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,960
a kind of german can't

1470
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,240
that makes sense to the people who speak

1471
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,400
german

1472
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:19,598
and that reveals something totally

1473
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,079
different

1474
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,400
about what you could think that form of

1475
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,680
existence was that was covered over by

1476
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,519
the fact that it always been done in

1477
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,358
latin

1478
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:32,880
yeah that's fascinating

1479
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:35,039
so so okay we talked about dostoevsky

1480
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,760
and uh the use of murder to explore

1481
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:39,838
human nature let's go to camus

1482
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,480
who is maybe less concerned with murder

1483
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:45,440
and more concerned with suicide as a way

1484
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,519
to explore human nature so he is uh

1485
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,599
probably my favorite existentialist

1486
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:52,318
probably one of the more

1487
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,559
accessible existentialists

1488
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,639
and like you said

1489
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,200
one of the people who didn't like to

1490
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:01,279
call himself an existentialist so what

1491
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:02,719
are your thoughts about camus what role

1492
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,599
does he play in the story of

1493
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:07,598
existentialism so i find kamu totally

1494
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,800
fascinating i really i really do and for

1495
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,480
years

1496
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,880
i didn't teach camus

1497
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,400
because the famous

1498
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,800
thing that you're referring to the myth

1499
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,639
of sisyphus which is a sort of essay

1500
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,119
it's published as a book

1501
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:24,000
super accessible really fascinating he's

1502
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,480
a great writer really engaging the

1503
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,599
opening line is something like

1504
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,920
there is but one truly significant

1505
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:34,160
philosophical question yes and that is

1506
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,838
the question of suicide yeah and i

1507
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:38,558
thought i can't teach my

1508
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:41,358
18 year olds you know like

1509
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:44,559
yeah i i just thought that's terrible

1510
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:46,078
like how can i i mean it's not wrong

1511
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,240
like that's a but do i want to bring

1512
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,760
that into the classroom and and so i

1513
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:53,279
read it i read the the essay i avoided

1514
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,640
it for a long time because just because

1515
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,839
of that line

1516
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:57,759
and i thought i'm not going to be able

1517
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,599
to make sense of this in a way that will

1518
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,680
be helpful for anyone

1519
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,760
but finally one year maybe seven or

1520
00:55:01,679 --> 00:55:06,000
eight years ago i sat down to read it i

1521
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,799
thought i've i've gotta really confront

1522
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,760
it

1523
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:11,920
and i read it and it's incredibly

1524
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,359
engaging i mean it's really really

1525
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,200
beautiful and and

1526
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:17,358
kamu is against suicide which just turns

1527
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:20,719
out to be good you know

1528
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:23,679
i was happy about that but he he has a

1529
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:26,078
bit of a bleak understanding of what

1530
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:27,358
human existence amounts to

1531
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,318
and so

1532
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:32,239
uh in the end he thinks that human

1533
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:34,318
existence is absurd

1534
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:36,479
and it's being absurd as a kind of

1535
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:39,119
technical term for him

1536
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:42,480
and it means that

1537
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:44,559
the episodes in your life

1538
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:47,280
and your life as a whole

1539
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,880
presents itself to you as if it's got a

1540
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,119
meaning

1541
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,680
but really it doesn't

1542
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,960
so there's this tension between the way

1543
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:56,239
things

1544
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,400
seem to be

1545
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:01,679
on their surface

1546
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:04,240
and what really turns out to be true

1547
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:06,399
about them and and he gives these great

1548
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:08,798
examples like you probably remember

1549
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,920
these he says um there you are you're

1550
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:13,280
walking uh along the street and you

1551
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,440
there's a plate glass window in a

1552
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,440
building and through the window

1553
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,000
uh you you see somebody talking on a

1554
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,358
telephone i mean i imagined it as a cell

1555
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,798
phone but camus

1556
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:24,719
for didn't

1557
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:26,798
uh but you see somebody talking on a

1558
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:30,480
cell phone and and he's animated he's

1559
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:31,599
talking a lot as if things really meant

1560
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,909
something

1561
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,400
and yet camus says it's a dumb show

1562
00:56:34,909 --> 00:56:38,000
[Laughter]

1563
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,760
and it's not dumb in the scent just in

1564
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,679
the sense that it's stupid it's dumb in

1565
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,000
the sense that it's silent

1566
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,000
it presents itself as if it's got some

1567
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,838
significance and yet its significance is

1568
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,599
withheld from you and he says that's

1569
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:51,279
what our lives are like

1570
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,200
everything in our lives presents

1571
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,760
themselves to us as if it's got a

1572
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:58,399
significance but it doesn't it's absurd

1573
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,000
uh and and then he says really what our

1574
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,680
lives are like are like they're like the

1575
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,480
lives of sisyphus

1576
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:04,399
just

1577
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,039
day after day

1578
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,798
you do the same thing

1579
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:11,119
you know you wake up at a certain time

1580
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:13,440
you get on the bus you go to work you

1581
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:15,358
take your lunch break you get off

1582
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,318
my i have a colleague who once said to

1583
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:20,480
me something like this it was about

1584
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,798
october or so in the fall semester i

1585
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,960
said how's how's it going dick he said

1586
00:57:22,798 --> 00:57:26,559
well you know how it is i got on the

1587
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,519
conveyor belt at the beginning of the

1588
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:32,079
semester and i'm just going through

1589
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:34,079
and that's that's the way my life is and

1590
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:37,359
camus thinks that that

1591
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:40,079
experience which you can sometimes have

1592
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:42,639
reveals something true about what human

1593
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,880
lives are like our lives really just are

1594
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:47,199
like the life of sisyphus who rolls this

1595
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,000
boulder up the hill from morning till

1596
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:52,798
night and then at night he gets to the

1597
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,559
top and it rolls back down to the bottom

1598
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:56,480
over the course of the night he walks

1599
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,359
back down and then he starts it all over

1600
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,760
again

1601
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:02,078
and he says sisyphus is condemned to

1602
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,440
this life like we're condemned to our

1603
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,318
lives

1604
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,400
but we do have one bit of freedom

1605
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:10,079
and it's the only thing that we can hang

1606
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,318
on to

1607
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,720
it's the freedom

1608
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:16,719
to stick it to the gods who put us in

1609
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:19,759
this position

1610
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:21,919
by embracing this existence rather than

1611
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:26,480
giving up and committing suicide and i

1612
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:29,519
thought well it's kind of a happy ending

1613
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,159
but but but i also thought it it's a dim

1614
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,039
view of what our our existence amounts

1615
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:35,199
to

1616
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:37,279
so i i think there's something

1617
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:38,558
fascinating about that

1618
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,798
but what i

1619
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,480
came to believe and i tried to write

1620
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:44,960
about this once i know you read the

1621
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,440
thing about aliveness that i published

1622
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,280
once that's secretly a criticism of

1623
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,760
camus i don't think i mentioned camu in

1624
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,440
there but i think camus has got the

1625
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,680
phenomenon wrong

1626
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,318
or he's missed some important aspect of

1627
00:58:55,679 --> 00:59:00,798
it because in camus view

1628
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:02,960
when you experience your day as sort of

1629
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:04,639
going on in this deadening way and

1630
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,280
you're just doing the things that you

1631
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:10,000
always do the way you always do them

1632
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,680
for camus that reveals the truth about

1633
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,599
what our lives are

1634
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:16,239
but i think there's some aspect at least

1635
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:18,798
for me and maybe maybe he just didn't

1636
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:21,118
feel this or didn't have access to it

1637
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:24,159
maybe others don't but for me there's an

1638
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:27,358
extra part to it which is somehow

1639
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:30,239
that yes that's the way things are

1640
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:32,880
and it's inadequate

1641
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:35,439
and there's something that's missing

1642
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:37,760
from that aspect of our existence

1643
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,079
that could be there

1644
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,480
and it feels like our lives are not

1645
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:45,440
about just putting up with that and

1646
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:48,719
sticking it to the gods by embracing it

1647
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,920
but seeking that absence part of it the

1648
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,480
part that's

1649
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,480
recognizable in its absence

1650
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,880
in your experience of that

1651
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,798
and that's that's what i think

1652
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,920
i think we do have the experience of the

1653
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:04,159
presence of that in moments when

1654
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,519
you feel truly alive

1655
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,759
and that's what you mean by the word

1656
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:10,239
aliveness which is a fascinating and a

1657
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,520
powerful word yeah that's what i mean by

1658
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:13,679
it i mean i think

1659
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,358
most people can recognize moments in

1660
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:17,919
their lives

1661
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:20,239
when they really felt alive and it could

1662
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,480
happen in a moment when

1663
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:24,000
you know i don't know maybe miles davis

1664
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,719
felt it in that moment when he was

1665
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,760
responding to herbie hancock's cord or

1666
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:29,519
maybe

1667
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,599
you feel it in that moment where you

1668
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:34,000
grab for the hand on the first date and

1669
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:37,519
the gesture is reciprocated

1670
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,960
or maybe you feel it in some moment when

1671
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:41,440
you are

1672
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,599
doing a kind of peak athletic thing or

1673
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,960
watching somebody else do a peak

1674
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,039
athletic thing

1675
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:51,039
um but i think there are moments when we

1676
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:54,000
when it feels like it's not like the way

1677
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:56,558
camus is describing things

1678
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,679
and it's better because of that so i

1679
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:02,960
think one really powerful way

1680
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:05,199
to uh for me to understand aliveness

1681
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,280
is to think about to go into a darker

1682
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:09,358
territory is to think about suicide and

1683
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,400
i've known people in my life who suffer

1684
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:13,679
from clinical depression yeah

1685
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,440
and

1686
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:17,838
you know whatever the chemistry is in

1687
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,798
our brain

1688
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:20,318
there is

1689
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:22,960
a certain kind of

1690
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:25,440
feeling that is to be depressed

1691
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,440
where you look in the mirror

1692
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,920
and ask do i

1693
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:33,519
want to kill myself today

1694
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:35,358
this is the question that camus asks

1695
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:36,400
this question this philosophical

1696
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,679
question

1697
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,760
and

1698
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:40,639
there is people

1699
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,040
who

1700
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:44,879
when they're depressed say

1701
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,798
not only do they say i want to kill

1702
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,960
myself or i don't they say it doesn't

1703
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:51,599
matter

1704
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:54,480
and that's chemistry that's whatever

1705
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:57,200
that is that's chemistry in our mind

1706
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,119
and then on the flip side of that for me

1707
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:01,038
i've had some low points but i've very

1708
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,838
been very fortunate to

1709
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:06,480
not suffer from that kind of depression

1710
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:09,119
i am the opposite which is

1711
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,199
not only moments of peak performance in

1712
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:14,480
athletics or

1713
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:17,118
great music or any of that i'm just

1714
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,760
deeply joyful often by

1715
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,760
mundane things like as you were saying

1716
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,599
it i was drinking this thing and it's

1717
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,440
cold and for some reason the coldness of

1718
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:28,079
that was uh

1719
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,318
like oh great like refrigeration i don't

1720
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,240
know there was a joy in that like i

1721
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:34,318
can't put it into words but i just felt

1722
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:36,159
great and then just so many things you

1723
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:39,199
look out in nature

1724
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:41,358
there's a nice breeze and just like

1725
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,759
it's amazing so that

1726
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:46,719
that doesn't feel

1727
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:49,039
like i'm embracing the absurd that seems

1728
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:50,078
like i'm getting some nice like dopamine

1729
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,559
hits

1730
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,798
in whatever the chemistry is from just

1731
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,798
the basics of life and that is the

1732
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:57,838
source of aliveness however my brain is

1733
01:02:56,798 --> 01:02:59,199
built

1734
01:02:57,838 --> 01:03:00,798
it's gotten

1735
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:03,439
a natural

1736
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:05,119
sort of mechanism for

1737
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,838
for aliveness

1738
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:11,039
and and so the one nice way to see the

1739
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:14,000
absence of aliveness is to look at the

1740
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:16,640
chemical the clinical depression

1741
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,719
and so that camus doesn't seem to

1742
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:20,719
contend with that at all in asking the

1743
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:22,798
question of suicide because when you

1744
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:25,199
look in the mirror and ask like if i ask

1745
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:26,960
myself do i want to kill myself today i

1746
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,279
ask that question in a different way

1747
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,838
more like a stoic way often like

1748
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,480
basically every day is you know what if

1749
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:37,038
i die today it's more like contemplating

1750
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:40,639
your mortality every single day

1751
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:43,839
you know uh that excites me

1752
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:45,920
the possibility that this is my last day

1753
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:47,759
that you know it just reminds me how

1754
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,519
amazing life is and that's that's

1755
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,359
chemistry i don't know what that is but

1756
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:56,239
that's not that's certainly not

1757
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:59,759
some kind of philosophical decision i

1758
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:01,759
made i am a little bit riding a wave of

1759
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,960
the chemistry of the genetics i've been

1760
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,359
given

1761
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,119
of the dopamine so that that question of

1762
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:09,838
suicide um

1763
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:14,079
by the way do you find that formulation

1764
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:14,078
of the question of existentialism

1765
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,760
i know you didn't want to teach it

1766
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,440
because obviously suicide is a very

1767
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,760
difficult word especially for young

1768
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,280
minds but do you think that's a useful

1769
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,119
formulation of the question of

1770
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,039
existentialism

1771
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:29,920
like him saying this is the most

1772
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:31,839
important question of suicide i think i

1773
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,559
think there is something to it if you

1774
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:37,038
read the question as the question

1775
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,000
what is it in virtue of which it ought

1776
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,480
to be

1777
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,039
desirable to conti to live the lives

1778
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,039
that we're capable of of living that's

1779
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,520
that's a deep question yeah that's a

1780
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:49,599
question that gets focused

1781
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:52,239
when someone asks themselves whether

1782
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,960
they ought to continue to live that life

1783
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:56,000
who

1784
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,519
would the famous line nothing focuses

1785
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,920
the mind more than one's impending

1786
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:01,599
execution

1787
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,798
i mean i think that's i think there's

1788
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,760
something

1789
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:08,880
important about that that recognizing

1790
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,359
the riskiness and the vulnerability of

1791
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,000
one's existence is

1792
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:16,078
super important and the idea and i think

1793
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,599
that if we didn't have that

1794
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,640
our lives

1795
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:23,119
wouldn't be capable of being meaningful

1796
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,960
if they weren't risky and vulnerable

1797
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,480
there would be nothing to lose

1798
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,760
and it's only because they're things to

1799
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,519
lose that they can come to have the

1800
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,240
significance that they do so yeah i

1801
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:32,318
think

1802
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:35,199
not against the idea that that's

1803
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:38,159
a deep way of approaching the questions

1804
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:40,318
at the core of of existentialism but as

1805
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:42,960
you say i was worried for a while about

1806
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:44,159
how i was gonna how i was gonna teach it

1807
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:47,599
well i think there's a difference

1808
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:50,879
between suicide and not living i

1809
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:54,000
because suicide is an action yeah so it

1810
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,000
feels like to me

1811
01:05:54,239 --> 01:06:00,399
like suicide doesn't make sense because

1812
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:03,199
you know imagine you're in like a hotel

1813
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,440
and you're saying the room i'm in sucks

1814
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:07,838
but like there's other rooms so

1815
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,240
like maybe explore those other rooms

1816
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:12,558
maybe you'll find

1817
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:13,919
meaning in those other rooms like

1818
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:15,760
basically

1819
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,960
embracing the fact that you don't know

1820
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,280
everything

1821
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,280
and there's uh you need time to explore

1822
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,359
everything it's like

1823
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:25,680
once you've explored everything then

1824
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:27,440
maybe you can make a full decision but

1825
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:29,038
it's um

1826
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,400
unfair to make

1827
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,799
a decision

1828
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,720
it's i would say unethical

1829
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:37,519
to make a decision until you've explored

1830
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:39,199
all the rooms in the hotel yeah and this

1831
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:42,159
gets focused in in the brothers

1832
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:42,960
karamazov of course there's one brother

1833
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:45,279
who

1834
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:47,519
uh is really asking that question is

1835
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,519
asking the question of suicide he's

1836
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:51,599
asking the question whether

1837
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:54,318
the world that we live in is a world

1838
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:57,440
that's worth living in

1839
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:59,920
and i think that characters as you say

1840
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,358
very ill i mean that and and it's

1841
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,639
possible

1842
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:06,159
um

1843
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:08,719
and often because as you say of you know

1844
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:12,000
brain chemistry physiologies there's

1845
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:15,199
certainly a physical ground to that to

1846
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,760
that situation to that condition

1847
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:20,399
but i think it is it is possible for

1848
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,079
someone to be in that situation

1849
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,160
i think that

1850
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,798
ivan karamazov who's the who's the

1851
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:28,960
character who's asking this question

1852
01:07:26,798 --> 01:07:30,719
is can you know maybe let's say

1853
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,358
chemically depressed or something like

1854
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:35,838
that but i think there's more to it too

1855
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:37,038
and i think that dostoevsky's real view

1856
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:39,358
is that

1857
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:41,920
the brain chemistry doesn't exist on its

1858
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:44,880
own like the way we interact with one

1859
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:48,079
another the way we care about or isolate

1860
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,039
ourselves from others the way we

1861
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:52,400
um

1862
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:55,039
uh care for the lives that we lead

1863
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,280
affects the chemistry of our brain which

1864
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:59,760
goes on and changes the mood that we're

1865
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,680
in so i think dostoevsky

1866
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,559
does think that

1867
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,879
um

1868
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:06,640
ivan's salvation if he's capable of

1869
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,160
being saved

1870
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:11,519
is going to come through the love of his

1871
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:13,838
brother alyosha let me spring uh maybe a

1872
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:15,519
bit of a tangent on you do you ever one

1873
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:16,640
of my other favorite authors is herman

1874
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:19,278
hesse

1875
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,400
uh does do you ever include him

1876
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,839
in our

1877
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:23,519
deck of uh

1878
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:26,238
sport cards that represent

1879
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,759
existentialism i haven't maybe i should

1880
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:29,838
what should i read what should i think

1881
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,719
about including oh no there's some kind

1882
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:33,039
of

1883
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:34,719
uh embrace of

1884
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:36,399
absurdism

1885
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:38,158
like there's a

1886
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:40,079
existentialist

1887
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:42,158
kind of ideal

1888
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:44,399
pervading most of his work

1889
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:46,079
uh but there's more of uh like with

1890
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:49,439
siddhartha

1891
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:52,479
there's more almost like a buddhist yeah

1892
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:55,358
sort of like watch the river and like

1893
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:58,238
become the river like this kind of

1894
01:08:55,359 --> 01:09:00,560
idea that uh what it means to truly

1895
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:02,718
experience the moment so there is an

1896
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,039
experiential part of existentialism

1897
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,319
where you want to not it's not just

1898
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:08,560
about we've been talking about kind of

1899
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:10,640
decisions and actions but also what he

1900
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:12,960
means to listen like you said from

1901
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,719
nietzsche like what it means to really

1902
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,039
take in the world

1903
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,798
and experience the moment so he's very

1904
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:21,119
good at writing about what it means to

1905
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:24,158
experience the moment and experience the

1906
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:26,960
full absurdity of the moment and for him

1907
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:27,759
uh i'm starting to forget steppenwolf i

1908
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,158
think

1909
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:33,279
is uh humor

1910
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:35,599
it's part of the absurdity which i think

1911
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:37,520
modern day internet explores very well

1912
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,640
with memes and so on

1913
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:43,759
humor is a fundamental part

1914
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:46,319
of the existentialist ethic that's able

1915
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:49,279
to deal with absurdity you gotta like

1916
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,719
laugh at it i think there's something

1917
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:52,400
let me just say something about humor

1918
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,679
because i think you're absolutely right

1919
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:57,599
kierkegaard who is danish and you know

1920
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,960
most people think deeply depressed and

1921
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,920
then

1922
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:04,000
is actually an incredibly funny writer

1923
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,960
and someone who was a classmate of mine

1924
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,679
in graduate school who left philosophy

1925
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,520
to become a hollywood comedy writer

1926
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:12,640
a very successful guy and then he came

1927
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,480
back

1928
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,039
25 years later and wrote finished his

1929
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:18,879
dissertation and i was the the reader on

1930
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,359
the dissertation but it may be a

1931
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:23,920
conflict of interest i'm not quite sure

1932
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,000
but but uh his dissertation was about

1933
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,119
he called it kierkegaard and the funny

1934
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,520
which is a

1935
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:31,599
kind of a funny title yeah but but

1936
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:34,880
kierkegaard according to eric kaplan's

1937
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,400
reading um kierkegaard has um

1938
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,719
does have this idea that there's

1939
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:40,399
something

1940
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:41,840
destabilizing about humor

1941
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:43,039
that's

1942
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,400
crucial

1943
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:49,198
to the sort of the important

1944
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:51,119
possibilities for us and and so he

1945
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:54,158
there's the idea that like there's a

1946
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:56,719
moment when a joke is being set up

1947
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:58,879
when you're sort of proceeding as if

1948
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:01,439
you're on stable ground

1949
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,840
and then the punch line comes

1950
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:06,000
and the rug is pulled out from under you

1951
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,840
and for a moment it's like you're

1952
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,719
falling you don't

1953
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:13,920
you you there's nothing supporting you

1954
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:17,039
until you're captured by your totally

1955
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:20,560
new understanding of what was going on

1956
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:23,840
and that humor necessarily has that kind

1957
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,000
of destabilizing feature to it and

1958
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,600
that's like the riskiness that's like

1959
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,600
the riskiness that you were you're

1960
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,320
pointing to if if there aren't risks in

1961
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,840
your life if your life is totally safe

1962
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:36,479
then there's no possibility of

1963
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:39,279
significance and so i think on eric's

1964
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:40,399
reading kierkegaard sort of wants to

1965
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:42,399
line up

1966
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:44,238
the importance of the riskiness and

1967
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:45,439
vulnerability in your life to its having

1968
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:48,799
meaning

1969
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:52,319
with the experience of destabilization

1970
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:54,239
that you get in jokes and comedy

1971
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,639
which then becomes significant right

1972
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:58,479
that when you when you remember having

1973
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,400
heard a joke for the first time it's got

1974
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:02,000
a kind of salience for you

1975
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:04,238
speaking of jokes

1976
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,840
and speaking of uh you mentioned film

1977
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:08,879
and literature

1978
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,800
so existentialism in film and literature

1979
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:14,640
i think for uh

1980
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:17,440
a lot of uh people especially nihilism

1981
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:19,520
was experienced in the great work of art

1982
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:21,279
modern work of art called big lebowski i

1983
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,800
don't know if you've ever seen that film

1984
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:26,719
but there's uh a group of nihilists in

1985
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,320
that that film they're just like they

1986
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,679
don't care about anything i think they

1987
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:31,198
happen to be german at least they have

1988
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:33,679
german accents

1989
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:35,359
so maybe can you talk about

1990
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:38,399
notable

1991
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:41,198
appearances of existentialism in film

1992
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:45,039
and if if you at all ever bring out big

1993
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:46,319
lebowski uh if that ever comes into play

1994
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:48,640
so i know that people think about the

1995
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:51,198
big lebowski in this in this context i

1996
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,960
and i did actually re-watch it not so

1997
01:12:51,198 --> 01:12:55,439
long ago we have kids and i thought

1998
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:58,319
maybe it's time it wasn't really time

1999
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:00,399
for for the 11 year old

2000
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,238
so somewhat inappropriate but i but i

2001
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:03,759
have never taught that film so i'd have

2002
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:05,759
to think more we could talk about it i'd

2003
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,400
be happy to try to think on the fly

2004
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,159
about it okay so i would love to because

2005
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:12,479
there is a feels like there's a

2006
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:14,238
philosophical depth to that film so

2007
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:16,839
there's uh

2008
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:18,879
there's a person that just uh the main

2009
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:21,119
character the jeff bridges character

2010
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,440
jeff bridges character yeah he he kind

2011
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:25,519
of um he drinks like these white

2012
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:28,000
russians and he just kind of walks

2013
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:29,199
around in a very relaxed way

2014
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,359
and uh

2015
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:32,399
irradiates

2016
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:35,198
both

2017
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:38,238
a love for life but also just an

2018
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:39,359
acceptance of like it is what it is

2019
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:40,959
uh

2020
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:42,880
kind of philosophy

2021
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,399
and then there's a bunch of characters

2022
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,039
that have

2023
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:50,319
are have very busy lives

2024
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:52,880
uh trying to do some big projects

2025
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:54,880
that are dramatic in some way make some

2026
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,400
huge amounts of money so it kind of

2027
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,000
actually reminds me of the idiot but

2028
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:00,879
that's the esky in a certain kind of

2029
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,520
sense and then there's these players i

2030
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:06,079
mean they're phrased as nihilists but

2031
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,159
they kind of don't care

2032
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:09,840
to enjoy life they want to mess with

2033
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:10,960
life in some kind of way and of course

2034
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,279
there's

2035
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:15,119
interesting personalities

2036
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:18,559
uh what is it uh

2037
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:20,719
jesus the bo the uh the bowler and then

2038
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:23,120
there's like donny

2039
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:25,920
who is a bit clueless

2040
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:25,920
and then there's the

2041
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
john goodman character

2042
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,320
is talking about vietnam and just takes

2043
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,719
life way too seriously too intensely and

2044
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,559
so on so it just paints a full sort of

2045
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:39,119
spectrum of characters that are

2046
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,719
operating in this world and perhaps most

2047
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:44,079
importantly for existentialism are

2048
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:46,719
thrown into absurdity yeah and

2049
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:48,800
hence the humor okay all right good well

2050
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:50,880
that's helpful thank you for reminding

2051
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,000
me of all that and i i think so one

2052
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,079
thing to say

2053
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,119
is that the nihilist the group of

2054
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:59,399
nihilists who call themselves nihilists

2055
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:01,359
i think they've got a bad

2056
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:02,879
misinterpretation of what nihilism is

2057
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:04,799
supposed to be

2058
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,679
uh and they're you know this this

2059
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:09,199
happened actually in the 20s there was a

2060
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:12,000
famous case

2061
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:14,879
um of a couple of german students

2062
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,079
leopold and loeb who'd read a lot of

2063
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,000
nietzsche

2064
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:21,920
nietzsche you know

2065
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,920
was a kind of hero for the nazis even

2066
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,079
i think based on a pretty bad

2067
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,640
misunderstanding of what he was up to

2068
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,719
but leopold and loeb had the the bad

2069
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,400
understanding first and they were

2070
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,399
students they'd read a lot of nietzsche

2071
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:36,238
and they thought okay nothing means

2072
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:39,039
anything the only way

2073
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:41,599
that um there's any significance in life

2074
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:43,920
is through our will to sort of

2075
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:47,360
powerfully bring something about

2076
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:49,840
and um if we're gonna do that in a way

2077
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:51,920
that reflects the fact that nothing

2078
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,520
means anything then what we should do is

2079
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,000
take these things

2080
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:58,080
these actions that people always thought

2081
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,238
were bad

2082
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,319
and do them and show that there's

2083
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:04,479
nothing wrong with doing them

2084
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:05,519
and so they decided they would murder

2085
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:07,519
someone

2086
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,040
not because they were angry at them just

2087
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:10,239
someone they'd never met it was

2088
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:13,198
important that it was someone they'd

2089
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:16,479
never met it was totally unmotivated act

2090
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:19,678
and they thought we'll embrace nihilism

2091
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:22,079
by showing that we can act in such a way

2092
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:24,480
as to do something that you know

2093
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:26,479
morality thinks is bad

2094
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:28,718
uh and through our will

2095
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:31,039
bring it about that we desire to do it

2096
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,158
for no reason that has anything to do

2097
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:35,279
with it's potentially being

2098
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:37,599
interpretable as good and

2099
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:39,840
i think that's a terrible misreading of

2100
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,239
what nietzsche thinks the response to

2101
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,560
nihilism is i mean i think read that

2102
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:46,238
against the miles davis thing miles

2103
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,159
davis aim

2104
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:51,039
is to creatively bring it about that

2105
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:53,198
something works well in a situation

2106
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:55,119
where he is kind of constrained so they

2107
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:56,960
thought two things one there are no

2108
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:58,559
constraints at all

2109
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:01,039
not even the constraints of the

2110
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,640
situation that we find ourselves in and

2111
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:04,800
two we only

2112
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:07,119
become the beings that we really are

2113
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,480
when we act in what you know what you

2114
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:10,800
might against what you might have

2115
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,718
thought the constraints were and i just

2116
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,159
think that's a bad misreading of what

2117
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:15,840
that kind of nihilism is up to and i

2118
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:17,119
think maybe that group in the big

2119
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:19,199
lebowski

2120
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:21,198
has got that kind of that kind of bad

2121
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:22,719
misreading but then the the major

2122
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:24,479
characters are or maybe are much more

2123
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:27,198
interesting go ahead and say something

2124
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:29,119
so there's some kind of apathy to that

2125
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:31,279
their particular nihilism could you

2126
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:33,359
comment on

2127
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:35,679
whether you see sort of

2128
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:36,880
apathy as a philosophy part of that

2129
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:38,560
nihilism

2130
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:41,520
so like um

2131
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:45,280
from an existentialist perspective

2132
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:48,159
how important is it to care about stuff

2133
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:50,960
like really take on life

2134
01:17:48,158 --> 01:17:53,599
what what does existentialism have to

2135
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,560
say about just sitting back

2136
01:17:53,600 --> 01:18:00,320
uh and just not caring

2137
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:03,039
excellent so apathy is like a really

2138
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:05,039
important word the greek word is apathe

2139
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:08,079
it means without passions

2140
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:09,279
and the stoics who you mentioned earlier

2141
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:10,960
really thought that

2142
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:13,198
you know passions are what get in the

2143
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:15,920
way of your living

2144
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:17,678
well because to live well you have to

2145
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,840
think clearly about what you should do

2146
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:21,520
and you shouldn't let your resentments

2147
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,039
and your angers and your petty

2148
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,360
animosities

2149
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:28,399
direct your behavior you should release

2150
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:30,079
yourself from those kinds of passions

2151
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:32,000
so stoicism

2152
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:34,079
you know again huge caricature but you

2153
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,880
know it's it's an aim

2154
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:39,039
not to care because caring is bad

2155
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,679
and there's certain

2156
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:44,479
forms of existentialism certainly in

2157
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:46,560
pascal and kierkegaard and dostoyevsky

2158
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,879
and heidegger

2159
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,960
and sartre in his own way

2160
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:53,600
uh so it's not just a theistic or

2161
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:57,279
atheistic thing where what's what's

2162
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,640
crucial about us is that we do care

2163
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,198
heidegger says

2164
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:04,000
care is the being of dozen dozen is his

2165
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:06,559
name for us that what it is to be us

2166
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,198
is to be the being that already cares

2167
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,600
and you can't not do that you can

2168
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:13,198
pretend you're not doing it uh but

2169
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,280
you're just carrying in a different way

2170
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:18,719
it's like start saying you can pretend

2171
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:20,479
you're not taking responsibility you you

2172
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:22,158
you could pretend that you don't have to

2173
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:23,279
make a decision that is making a

2174
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:25,359
decision

2175
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:27,759
not caring as a way of caring

2176
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:30,880
and so i think the existentialists that

2177
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,960
i'm interested in think that we do care

2178
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,640
that's that's constitutive of what it is

2179
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,079
to be us

2180
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,640
and so they'll they'll think that the

2181
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:39,519
stoics got it wrong but that that leaves

2182
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:43,039
open

2183
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:46,239
a huge range of moves about

2184
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:49,359
how we inhabit that

2185
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:49,359
existence well

2186
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,719
let me ask about

2187
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:55,679
ein rand

2188
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:56,960
okay so it just so happens that i've

2189
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:59,440
gotten

2190
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:02,560
she's entered a few conversations in

2191
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:04,879
this podcast and just looking at

2192
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:08,000
academic philosophy or just philosophers

2193
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:10,000
in general they seem to ignore ayn rand

2194
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,840
do you have a sense of why that is does

2195
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,279
she ever come into play

2196
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,639
her ideas of

2197
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:18,158
objectivism

2198
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:20,319
come into play of discussions of

2199
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:23,759
a good life

2200
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:26,238
from the perspective of existentialism

2201
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,600
in how you teach it how you think about

2202
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:30,718
it is she

2203
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,840
somebody who you find it all interesting

2204
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:34,079
so no i don't think she is

2205
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,440
[Laughter]

2206
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,519
but it's been a long time since i've

2207
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:39,039
read her stuff i read it in high school

2208
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:41,360
i read the fountainhead in high school

2209
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:42,960
and atlas shrugged but that's at this

2210
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:44,479
point a very long time ago i think i

2211
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,719
read something about objective

2212
01:20:44,479 --> 01:20:49,359
epistemology or something too

2213
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:51,920
so you know my my view about her could

2214
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:53,599
be based on a total misunderstanding of

2215
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:56,639
of what she's up to

2216
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:58,800
but sort of my my caricature of her and

2217
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:01,840
tell me if i've got it wrong

2218
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,039
is that she's

2219
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,880
sort of

2220
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:07,760
motivated by

2221
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:10,560
a kind of i think it's maybe sometimes

2222
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:12,320
you call it libertarianism but

2223
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:15,199
maybe let's in the context of our

2224
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:17,519
discussion um tie it back to sartre a

2225
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:19,599
kind of view according to which we're

2226
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,440
the being who has to contend with the

2227
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,280
fact that we're radically free to do

2228
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:26,079
stuff and we're just not being

2229
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:28,960
courageous or brave enough when we don't

2230
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:31,198
do that and the people to admire

2231
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,399
are the people who make stuff out of

2232
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:34,799
nothing

2233
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:37,439
um so maybe that's a bad caricature no

2234
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:39,360
no but i i think uh no i think that's

2235
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:42,399
pretty accurate i'm not again very

2236
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:46,559
knowledgeable about the full depth of

2237
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:46,559
her philosophy but i think she takes

2238
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,239
a view of the world that's similar to

2239
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,840
saturate in

2240
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,799
in the conclusions

2241
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,480
but

2242
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,239
makes stronger statements about

2243
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:59,279
epistemology

2244
01:21:56,238 --> 01:22:00,959
that first of all everything is knowable

2245
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:02,960
and there's some you should always

2246
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:06,239
operate through reason

2247
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,679
like reason is very important like uh

2248
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:09,599
it's like uh

2249
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:11,920
you start with a few axioms and you

2250
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:15,199
build on top of that and

2251
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:17,039
the axioms that everybody should operate

2252
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:20,079
on are the same

2253
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:21,359
again reality is objective it's not

2254
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:24,158
subjective

2255
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:26,479
and so from that you can derive the

2256
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:28,238
entirety of how humans should behave at

2257
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:30,479
the individual level

2258
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:32,158
and at the societal level and there's a

2259
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:33,439
few conclusions

2260
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:34,638
she would talk about virtue of

2261
01:22:33,439 --> 01:22:36,319
selfishness

2262
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,159
and sort of a lot of people use that to

2263
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:39,599
dismiss her look she's very selfish and

2264
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:41,759
so on she

2265
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,520
actually meant something very different

2266
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:46,480
is like it's it's more like the sartre

2267
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,920
thing take responsibility for yourself

2268
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:51,119
understand

2269
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,880
what uh forces you're operating under

2270
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:55,039
and make the best of this life and

2271
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:57,440
that's how you can be the best member of

2272
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:59,920
societies by making the best

2273
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:01,839
life you can and just focus on yourself

2274
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,800
like fix your own problems first and

2275
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,800
then

2276
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,440
and that that will make you the best

2277
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:11,199
member of society of your family of

2278
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:13,678
loved ones of friends and so on i think

2279
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:15,198
the reason she's disliked

2280
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:17,119
obviously on the philosophy side she's

2281
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:21,198
disliked because a little bit like

2282
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:23,679
nietzsche she's like she's literary

2283
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:24,879
uh i think and the reason she's publicly

2284
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:28,158
disliked

2285
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:30,960
uh in sort of public conversations is

2286
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:32,879
because of how sure she is of herself so

2287
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,800
that which is some of the philosophers

2288
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,639
have been known to do like make very

2289
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,960
strong statements like hell is other

2290
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:41,760
people but she was making very strong

2291
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,639
statements about basically everything

2292
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:46,719
and

2293
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:49,679
but it is the reason i bring her up is

2294
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:50,880
you know she is an influential

2295
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,359
thinker

2296
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:55,359
that is not for some reason often

2297
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:57,439
brought up as such it's not acknowledged

2298
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:59,519
how influential she is

2299
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:01,119
you know i was recently looking at like

2300
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,480
a list of

2301
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,279
the most

2302
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:08,799
important women of the 20th century in

2303
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:09,759
terms of thought not science or but like

2304
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,760
thought

2305
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,679
and she wasn't in that list

2306
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,560
and i just i see this time and time

2307
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,560
again

2308
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,320
and it doesn't make sense to me why

2309
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,120
she's so

2310
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:24,000
kind of dismissed because clearly she's

2311
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:25,439
an author of some of the most read books

2312
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,238
like ever

2313
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:29,759
and

2314
01:24:26,238 --> 01:24:33,519
she clearly had very strong ideas that

2315
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:35,280
should be contended with you know um

2316
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,360
and that that's why it kind of didn't

2317
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:39,198
make sense to me

2318
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:41,039
because she's also a creature of her

2319
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:43,198
time and an important one

2320
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:45,439
she's a creation of the soviet union

2321
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:47,839
somebody who left because of that and so

2322
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:48,960
some of her the strength of her ideas

2323
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,719
has to do

2324
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,239
with how much she dislikes that

2325
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:56,079
particular uh

2326
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:58,959
philosophy and uh way of life

2327
01:24:56,079 --> 01:25:01,279
but also she's a creature of like sartre

2328
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,279
and like death whole like nietzsche

2329
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:05,519
and so on now one of the other

2330
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:08,399
criticisms is she doesn't integrate

2331
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:10,840
herself into this history she keeps

2332
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:14,079
basically kind of implying that

2333
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:15,520
she's purely original in all her

2334
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:16,559
thoughts even though she's kind of

2335
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,960
citing

2336
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:21,120
a lot of other people but again many

2337
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,600
philosophers do this kind of thing as if

2338
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:25,599
as if they've uh they are truly original

2339
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:27,679
and they're not it is interesting and

2340
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:30,400
also what's interesting about her is she

2341
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:31,520
is a woman she is a strong feminist

2342
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:34,079
and

2343
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:36,400
it feels like with simone de beauvoir

2344
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:38,479
you know like she seems like she's a

2345
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:41,039
very important

2346
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:43,039
person in this moment of history that

2347
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:45,600
shouldn't be fully forgotten

2348
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:47,279
interesting yeah well so i i mean i

2349
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,159
don't have a lot to add i i will just

2350
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:49,679
say

2351
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:51,279
um

2352
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:53,600
this i mean the way

2353
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,519
she and beauvoir seem to me from your

2354
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,320
description of her and remembering what

2355
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:00,719
i remember from 35 years ago

2356
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:01,759
they seem pretty opposite from one

2357
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:03,279
another

2358
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,920
like one of the things i find

2359
01:26:03,279 --> 01:26:07,599
interesting about beauvoir is that she

2360
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,719
takes seriously

2361
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,760
the thing that

2362
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:15,760
sartre didn't which is our throneness

2363
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:17,840
which is our um the sense in which

2364
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:21,199
we're born into a situation that's

2365
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:22,719
already got a significance for her

2366
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:24,799
i think it was easier for her to to

2367
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:26,000
recognize that than sartre because she

2368
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:29,119
was a woman

2369
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,560
and sartre seems to act as if

2370
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:32,719
you know there are no constraints or at

2371
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,760
least there shouldn't be we're pretty

2372
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,079
close

2373
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,679
as you know privileged white males yeah

2374
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:40,000
exactly if we could just get rid of the

2375
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:42,000
last bits of them we would be god like

2376
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,800
we're supposed to be yeah uh and i think

2377
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,119
beauvoir sort of sees things differently

2378
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:50,480
i think she reckons one does not one's

2379
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:52,158
not born but becomes a woman she says so

2380
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:53,839
how does that happen well you're thrown

2381
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:55,759
into your culture and your culture

2382
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,920
starts treating you in a certain way

2383
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,760
because of your gender and that starts

2384
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,840
to form your understanding and your

2385
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,400
experience of things and by the time

2386
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:07,520
you're grown up well you're you're

2387
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:09,519
pretty well formed by that

2388
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,800
that seems a fact

2389
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,159
it's a fact about

2390
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,279
too though it was harder for him to

2391
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:17,279
notice it because uh he was formed into

2392
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:19,119
the into his privilege

2393
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:20,319
but the world reminds us of our

2394
01:27:19,119 --> 01:27:23,039
throneness

2395
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:26,238
for some more than others yes absolutely

2396
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:29,679
and and for people who have to contend

2397
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:32,879
on a daily basis with the fact that

2398
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:34,960
the social position they're thrown into

2399
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:38,000
is one that um

2400
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:40,239
negates them or one that oppresses them

2401
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,639
or one that sort of pushes them to the

2402
01:27:40,238 --> 01:27:44,718
side in some way or another i mean the

2403
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:47,520
black experience is is interesting in

2404
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:50,158
this respect too franz fanon who's a

2405
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:52,320
contemporary of sarton both wars

2406
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:53,839
writes about it and it's very familiar

2407
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:56,880
the things that he's saying now but you

2408
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:59,360
know he he writes back in the 50s about

2409
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:02,000
being a black man in paris and getting

2410
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:04,960
on getting on an elevator with a woman

2411
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:08,238
alone and how like you know

2412
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:10,960
her reaction to him not knowing him not

2413
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:13,439
having any views about any reason to

2414
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:15,359
have any views about him sort of puts

2415
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:16,799
him in a particular social position with

2416
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:18,238
respect to her

2417
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,400
and

2418
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:22,079
that that's um if you if you don't have

2419
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:23,439
that experience it's much harder to

2420
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:25,679
recognize

2421
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:27,279
the um the way in which what we're

2422
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,119
thrown into something we might not have

2423
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:31,359
chosen

2424
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:33,840
so the idea that that

2425
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:37,439
that that's not an aspect of our

2426
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:39,840
existence um which as you'd describe in

2427
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:43,039
rand's views it's she sounds more like

2428
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:44,880
sorry she sounds more like it either

2429
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:46,880
it's not an aspect of our existence or

2430
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,960
at least we ought to sort of aim at its

2431
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,760
not being and yeah almost act as if it's

2432
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:53,359
not yeah exactly if it's not and so i i

2433
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,159
think from my point of view i don't i

2434
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:58,158
don't pretend that i'm explaining the

2435
01:28:56,158 --> 01:29:00,399
public reception of her i'm just sort of

2436
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:01,599
trying to trying to say how i understand

2437
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:04,399
her in this

2438
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:06,880
um intellectual context from my point of

2439
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:09,599
view that's not something big big to

2440
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,960
miss and the ambition to think that

2441
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,520
really what's happening is that we're

2442
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:15,198
all the same we're all rational beings

2443
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,080
we're all beings who if we just got the

2444
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:20,559
axioms of our existence right and made

2445
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:23,359
good judgments and reasoned in an

2446
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:25,199
appropriate way would

2447
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:27,599
optimize ourselves

2448
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:30,000
that feels to me like

2449
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:32,079
a kind of natural

2450
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,560
end point of

2451
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:36,399
the philosophical tradition i mean plato

2452
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,480
starts off with a view that helps us in

2453
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:40,799
that direction and the enlightenment

2454
01:29:38,479 --> 01:29:44,000
moves us further in that direction

2455
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,840
but from my point of view that movement

2456
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,760
has led us astray

2457
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:50,639
because it's missed something really

2458
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:52,639
important that's crucial to the kind of

2459
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:54,319
being that that we are

2460
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:56,400
yeah and this is

2461
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:57,759
the music exactly

2462
01:29:56,399 --> 01:30:00,000
that's just abuse

2463
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,360
let's talk about throneness and i think

2464
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,319
you mentioned that in the context of

2465
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:07,839
heidegger yeah so can we talk about

2466
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:09,599
heidegger okay who is this philosopher

2467
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,520
what are some

2468
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,600
fascinating ideas that he brought to the

2469
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:16,400
world okay so martin heidegger was a

2470
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:18,480
german philosopher he he i do know when

2471
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:20,319
he was born in 1889

2472
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:21,599
but i don't know that only by accident

2473
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:23,519
it's because it's the same year that

2474
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:25,600
wittgenstein an austrian philosopher was

2475
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,920
born and the same year that hitler was

2476
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,360
born so if i've remembered my dates

2477
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:32,000
right and someone will call in and

2478
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:34,960
correct me otherwise uh but that's the

2479
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,560
way it it sort of sits in my memory bank

2480
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,198
and it's interesting that the three of

2481
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,120
them were born at the same time uh

2482
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:42,799
wittgenstein and heidegger share some

2483
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:44,399
similarities

2484
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:46,719
but then it's also interesting that

2485
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:48,319
heidegger was

2486
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:50,319
was a nazi i mean this is a very

2487
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:52,158
disturbing fact about his personal

2488
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:54,799
political background

2489
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:56,719
um and so it's something that anyone who

2490
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:59,440
thinks that things that he said might be

2491
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:01,600
interesting has got to contend with

2492
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:04,000
heidegger was born in germany

2493
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,600
hitler and austria that's right

2494
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,079
wittgenstein is

2495
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,840
austria also but so you have to when

2496
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:11,600
when you call heidegger nazi you have to

2497
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:14,000
remember

2498
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,800
i mean there's millions of nazis too so

2499
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,639
like there are parts of their that's the

2500
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:21,360
history of the world

2501
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:24,000
you know there's a lot of communists

2502
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:27,279
marxists and uh

2503
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,600
nazis in that part of history absolutely

2504
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:31,759
and you know one of the discussion

2505
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:33,340
points is well was he just a kind of

2506
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,800
social nazi you know

2507
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:36,239
[Laughter]

2508
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,239
i mean you know he went to parties with

2509
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:40,319
them and stuff or was he like did he

2510
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:42,959
really believe in the ideology and

2511
01:31:40,319 --> 01:31:44,319
that's a choice point and and

2512
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:46,560
you know we could talk about it if you

2513
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:49,759
want he he held a political position

2514
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:52,080
that's one of the relevant parts in 1933

2515
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,760
he was made rector of the university of

2516
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:55,198
freiburg that's like the president of

2517
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:57,440
the university

2518
01:31:55,198 --> 01:32:00,000
um and that was in germany all the

2519
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:02,399
universities are um are state

2520
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,158
universities and so that's a political

2521
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:06,079
appointment can we just pause on this

2522
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:09,039
point yeah

2523
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:13,439
from an existentialist perspective

2524
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:14,560
what's the role for standing up to evil

2525
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:17,039
so

2526
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,639
i mean i think camus probably has

2527
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:20,719
something to say about these things

2528
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:23,679
because he was a bit of a political

2529
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:26,960
figure like do you have a responsibility

2530
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:30,239
not just for your decisions but you know

2531
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:32,079
if the world you see around you

2532
01:32:30,238 --> 01:32:34,638
is um

2533
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:36,079
going against what you believe somewhere

2534
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:37,279
deep inside

2535
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:38,559
is

2536
01:32:37,279 --> 01:32:39,679
ethical

2537
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,840
do you have

2538
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:44,639
to stand up to that even if it costs you

2539
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:46,880
your life or your well-being

2540
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:48,800
you ask from an existential perspective

2541
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,319
and there's lots of different

2542
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,079
positions that you could have so let me

2543
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:54,238
tell you something in the area of what i

2544
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:55,679
think i might believe which comes out of

2545
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:57,039
this tradition

2546
01:32:55,679 --> 01:33:00,158
um

2547
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:01,600
and it's this uh if you live in a

2548
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:02,879
community

2549
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:05,760
where

2550
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:08,159
people are being dragged down by the

2551
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:10,159
norms of the community rather than

2552
01:33:08,158 --> 01:33:12,319
elevated

2553
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:13,599
then there's two things that you have to

2554
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:16,158
recognize

2555
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,199
one is that you bear some responsibility

2556
01:33:16,158 --> 01:33:19,759
for that

2557
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:21,599
not necessarily because you chose it

2558
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,880
maybe you reviled it maybe you were

2559
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:28,079
against it but there's some way in which

2560
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:30,800
we all act in accordance with the norms

2561
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:33,279
of our culture we all give in to them in

2562
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,639
some way or another and if those norms

2563
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:36,479
are broken

2564
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:38,880
then there's some way in which we've

2565
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:40,799
allowed ourselves to be responsible for

2566
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,480
for broken norms

2567
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,079
we've become responsible for broken

2568
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:45,359
norms and i i do think you have to face

2569
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:48,158
up to that

2570
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:50,960
i think that um let's just take gender

2571
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:53,279
norms maybe the gender norms are broken

2572
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:55,439
maybe the way men and women treat one

2573
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:57,759
another the way men treat women

2574
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:59,119
is broken you know maybe there's maybe

2575
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,119
it is maybe there's

2576
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:02,399
i'm not making a substantive claim i'm

2577
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:03,519
just saying you know lots of people say

2578
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:05,279
it is

2579
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,520
and if

2580
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:11,198
uh you're in a culture where

2581
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:13,440
uh those norms take root

2582
01:34:11,198 --> 01:34:15,119
you you don't get to just isolate

2583
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:16,479
yourself and pull yourself out of the

2584
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:18,000
culture and think i don't have any

2585
01:34:16,479 --> 01:34:20,638
responsibility

2586
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,238
um that's you're already a part of the

2587
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:24,400
culture even

2588
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:27,839
if you're isolating yourself from it

2589
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:29,679
that's a way of rejecting the

2590
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,360
sort of part you play in the culture but

2591
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:34,079
it's not a way of getting

2592
01:34:31,359 --> 01:34:36,719
behind it you now you're playing that

2593
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:38,158
role differently you're saying i i don't

2594
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,679
i don't i don't want to take

2595
01:34:38,158 --> 01:34:40,960
responsibility for what's going on

2596
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,719
around me

2597
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,198
and that's a way of

2598
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:47,520
taking responsibility by refusing to do

2599
01:34:45,198 --> 01:34:50,319
it so i i think we're implicated in

2600
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:52,400
whatever whatever's going on around us

2601
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:56,319
and if we're going to do anything in our

2602
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:59,679
lives we ought to recognize that

2603
01:34:56,319 --> 01:35:02,559
recognize that even in situations where

2604
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:04,239
you maybe didn't decide to do it you you

2605
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,360
could be part of bringing other people

2606
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:06,319
down

2607
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:08,319
and then

2608
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:10,319
devote yourself to trying to figure out

2609
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:12,079
how to act differently so that the norms

2610
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:13,759
update themselves

2611
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:16,719
and i and i think this is not a a

2612
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:19,039
criticism of people and the alyosha who

2613
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:21,198
we mentioned in the brothers karamazov

2614
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:22,319
he's a character he's a kind of saintly

2615
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:25,118
character

2616
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:28,479
um in the brothers karamazov but that

2617
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:29,519
one crucial moment in his in in that

2618
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:32,638
story

2619
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:35,040
when he realizes how awful he's been

2620
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,800
being to someone without ever even

2621
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:38,639
intending to do that

2622
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,400
it's grushanka who's this sort of

2623
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:43,520
fascinating woman

2624
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:47,279
and she's a very erotic woman she's sort

2625
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:50,159
of sexual and and and alyosha

2626
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:51,359
in my reading of it is kind of attracted

2627
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:54,960
to her

2628
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:56,479
but he's a young kid he's 20 or whatever

2629
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,239
and he's kind of embarrassed about it

2630
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:00,000
and he lives in the monastery and he's

2631
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:01,519
thinking maybe he wants to be a priest

2632
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
and he's kind of embarrassed by it so

2633
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:05,840
what does he do every time they run

2634
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,639
across one another in the street he

2635
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:10,400
averts his gaze

2636
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:12,400
and why is he doing that because he's

2637
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:14,158
kind of embarrassed you know

2638
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:16,319
but how does grishanka experience it

2639
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:18,399
well she knows she's a fallen woman and

2640
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:22,079
she knows that alyosha has this other

2641
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:24,719
position in society so her read on it is

2642
01:36:22,079 --> 01:36:26,479
he's passing judgment on me he can see

2643
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:28,960
that he doesn't want to be associated

2644
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:30,959
with me he can see that i'm a fallen

2645
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:33,198
woman he knows that in order to maintain

2646
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:34,480
his purity he's got to res he's got to

2647
01:36:33,198 --> 01:36:36,479
avoid me

2648
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:37,359
that that's not what alliosh intended to

2649
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:39,439
do

2650
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:41,039
but that's the way it's experienced and

2651
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:43,678
so there's this way he comes to

2652
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:46,079
recognize oh my god like what i'm

2653
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:48,158
supposed to do is love people in

2654
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:50,319
dostoevsky's view of things

2655
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:52,638
and what i'm doing instead is dragging

2656
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:54,479
this poor woman down i'm making her life

2657
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:56,639
worse i'm making her feel terrible about

2658
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:58,399
herself and if i actually came to know

2659
01:36:56,639 --> 01:36:59,600
her i'd recognize her condition is

2660
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:01,599
difficult

2661
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:04,400
she's living a difficult life she's

2662
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:06,560
making hard choices and why don't i you

2663
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:08,319
know why don't i see that in her face

2664
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,239
instead of this other thing that's

2665
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:11,920
making me want to avoid her and that's a

2666
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:14,000
huge moment so but the idea is that

2667
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,359
we're implicated in bringing other

2668
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,279
people down

2669
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:19,519
whether we want to be or not

2670
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:22,079
and that's our condition so

2671
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:25,280
the requirement to understand that is to

2672
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:28,079
be almost to a radical degree be

2673
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:30,479
empathetic and to listen

2674
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:32,399
uh to the world

2675
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:35,678
and i mean you you brought up sort of

2676
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:38,158
gender roles it's not so simple all of

2677
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:39,440
this is messy for example this is me

2678
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:40,399
talking

2679
01:37:39,439 --> 01:37:42,319
it's

2680
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:44,238
clear to me that for example the woke

2681
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:47,759
culture

2682
01:37:44,238 --> 01:37:50,158
has bullying built into it has some

2683
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:52,800
elements of the same kind of evil built

2684
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:54,960
into it and when you're part of the wave

2685
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,079
of wokeness standing up for social

2686
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,880
rights

2687
01:37:56,079 --> 01:38:00,639
you also have to listen and think are we

2688
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,960
going too far

2689
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,079
are we hurting people are we doing the

2690
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:06,639
same

2691
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:08,479
things that others

2692
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:10,480
that we're fighting against that others

2693
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:11,839
were doing in the past so it's not

2694
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:13,919
simple

2695
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:16,800
uh once you see

2696
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:21,118
that there's evil being done

2697
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:24,239
that is easy to fix no in

2698
01:38:21,118 --> 01:38:24,238
in our society

2699
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,719
it's uh there's something about our

2700
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:31,118
human nature that just

2701
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:33,600
too easily stops listening to the world

2702
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:35,679
to empathizing with the world

2703
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:38,480
and we label things as evil this is

2704
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:40,960
through human history this is evil you

2705
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:42,959
mentioned tribes this religious belief

2706
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:45,279
is evil and so we have to fight it and

2707
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:48,000
we become certain and dogmatic about it

2708
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:50,479
and then in so doing commit evil onto

2709
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:53,520
the world it seems like

2710
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:54,238
a life that accepts

2711
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,560
and

2712
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:58,959
responsibility for the norms we're in

2713
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:00,960
has to constantly be

2714
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:04,000
sort of questioning yourself and

2715
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:08,000
questioning like listening to the world

2716
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:10,238
fully and richly without being

2717
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,920
weighed down by

2718
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:15,439
any one sort of uh realization you just

2719
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:17,359
always constantly have to be thinking

2720
01:39:15,439 --> 01:39:20,079
about the world am i wrong am i wrong in

2721
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:21,679
seeing the world this way i mean

2722
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:23,198
the very last thing you said you've

2723
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:24,719
constantly got to be thinking about the

2724
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:26,238
world you've constantly got to be

2725
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:28,480
listening you've constantly got to be

2726
01:39:26,238 --> 01:39:30,319
attending and it's not simple

2727
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:32,399
all that sounds exactly right to me and

2728
01:39:30,319 --> 01:39:33,920
the the phrase that rings through my

2729
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:37,118
head is another one from the brothers

2730
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:39,359
karamazov dimitri this passionate sort

2731
01:39:37,118 --> 01:39:42,719
of sometimes violent brother

2732
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:45,279
who um who is also

2733
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:47,920
sort of deep deeply cares i mean he's

2734
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:49,519
because he's passionate he's sort of got

2735
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:53,199
care through and through but it's

2736
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:56,320
breaking him apart he says at one point

2737
01:39:53,198 --> 01:40:00,000
um god and the devil are fighting and

2738
01:39:56,319 --> 01:40:02,479
the battlefield is the heart of man

2739
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
and i just think yeah it's not simple

2740
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:06,718
and the idea that there might be a

2741
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,198
purely good way of doing things is just

2742
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:11,359
not our condition that where everything

2743
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:13,359
we do is going to be sort of undermined

2744
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:16,799
by some aspect of it there's not going

2745
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:20,319
to be a kind of pure good in in human

2746
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:23,199
existence and so it's it's sort of

2747
01:40:20,319 --> 01:40:25,439
required that we're going to have to be

2748
01:40:23,198 --> 01:40:26,879
um empathetic that we're going to have

2749
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:27,759
to recognize

2750
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,639
that

2751
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:32,000
others are dealing with that just as we

2752
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:33,840
are

2753
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,158
so i apologize for distracting us we

2754
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:37,440
were talking about heidegger okay that

2755
01:40:36,158 --> 01:40:39,359
uh

2756
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:42,479
and the reason we were distracted is he

2757
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:44,238
happened to also be a nazi but

2758
01:40:42,479 --> 01:40:46,559
he nevertheless has a lot of powerful

2759
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:49,118
ideas what are the ideas he's brought to

2760
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:50,400
the world okay so that's a big huge

2761
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:52,559
question so

2762
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:54,158
let me see how much of it i can get on

2763
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:56,719
the table

2764
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:59,198
i mean the the big picture is that

2765
01:40:56,719 --> 01:41:01,039
heidegger thinks and he's not really

2766
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:04,238
wrong to think this

2767
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:07,039
that the whole history of philosophy

2768
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:09,439
from plato forward maybe even from the

2769
01:41:07,039 --> 01:41:11,439
pre-socratics forward from like the 6th

2770
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:13,359
century bc

2771
01:41:11,439 --> 01:41:14,479
to now

2772
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:16,639
has

2773
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:17,919
been motivated by a certain kind or has

2774
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:19,440
been grounded on a certain kind of

2775
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:21,920
assumption

2776
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:24,559
that it didn't have the right to make

2777
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:27,760
and that it's led us astray

2778
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:29,760
and that until we understand

2779
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:31,119
the way in which it's led us astray

2780
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,960
we're not going to be able to get to

2781
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:35,439
grips with the condition we now find

2782
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,960
ourselves in so let me start with what

2783
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:38,799
he thinks the condition we now find

2784
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,760
ourselves in is

2785
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:43,440
lots of periods to heidegger's fuse i'm

2786
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:45,760
not i'm just going to sort of mush it

2787
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:47,678
all together for the purposes of today

2788
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,800
uh heidegger thinks that one of the

2789
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:51,359
crucial

2790
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:53,119
things that we need to contend with

2791
01:41:51,359 --> 01:41:56,158
when we think about

2792
01:41:53,118 --> 01:41:58,799
uh what it is to be us now

2793
01:41:56,158 --> 01:42:00,719
is that the right name for our age is a

2794
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,800
technological age

2795
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:04,560
and what does it mean for our age to be

2796
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,719
a technological age

2797
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:08,159
well it means that we have an

2798
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:11,679
understanding

2799
01:42:08,158 --> 01:42:13,839
of what it is for anything at all to be

2800
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:14,719
at all

2801
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,560
that

2802
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:18,560
we never really chose

2803
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,480
that's sort of animating the way we live

2804
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,760
our lives that's animating our

2805
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:23,359
understanding of ourselves and

2806
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,480
everything else

2807
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:26,158
that

2808
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:29,678
is quite limited

2809
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:32,399
and it's organized around the idea

2810
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:34,000
that to be something

2811
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:35,920
is to be

2812
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:39,118
what's sitting there

2813
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:41,039
as an infinitely flexible

2814
01:42:39,118 --> 01:42:45,039
reserve

2815
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:48,880
to be optimized and made efficient

2816
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:50,000
and heidegger thinks that uh that's

2817
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:52,719
that's

2818
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,639
not just the way we think of

2819
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:56,960
silicon circuits

2820
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:59,279
or you know the

2821
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:01,679
the river when we put a hydroelectric

2822
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:03,359
power plant on it we're optimizing the

2823
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:05,279
flow of the river so that it makes

2824
01:43:03,359 --> 01:43:07,759
energy which is infinitely flexible and

2825
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:10,960
we can use in any way at all it's the

2826
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:14,639
way we understand ourselves too

2827
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:16,480
we think of ourselves as this reserve

2828
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:18,560
of potential

2829
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:21,599
that needs to be made efficient and

2830
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:23,920
optimized and when i when i talk with my

2831
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,119
students about it i ask them you know

2832
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,840
like

2833
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:29,839
what's your calendar look like you know

2834
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:32,159
what's the goal of your day

2835
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:35,360
is it to get as many things into it as

2836
01:43:32,158 --> 01:43:39,118
possible is it to feel like i've i've

2837
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:41,679
failed unless i've uh i've made my life

2838
01:43:39,118 --> 01:43:43,679
so efficient that i'm doing this and

2839
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:45,600
this and this and this and this that i

2840
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:46,800
can't let things go by

2841
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,400
the feeling

2842
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,360
uh that i think we all

2843
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:52,559
have

2844
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:55,039
that there's some pressure to do that to

2845
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:57,520
relate to ourselves that way

2846
01:43:55,039 --> 01:44:00,000
is a clue to what heidegger thinks the

2847
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:02,159
technological age is about

2848
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,800
and he thinks that's different from

2849
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:06,638
every other age in history

2850
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,639
we used to think of ourselves in the

2851
01:44:06,639 --> 01:44:11,359
17th century at the beginning of the eli

2852
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:12,400
of the enlightenment as subjects

2853
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:16,000
who

2854
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:19,198
represent objects descartes thought that

2855
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,479
a subject is something some mental sort

2856
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:22,879
of realm

2857
01:44:20,479 --> 01:44:25,439
that represents the world in a certain

2858
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:27,760
way and we are closed in on ourselves in

2859
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:30,238
the sense that um we have a special

2860
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:32,079
relation to our representations

2861
01:44:30,238 --> 01:44:34,079
uh and that's that's what the realm of

2862
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:35,920
the subject but others you know in the

2863
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:37,600
middle ages we were created in the image

2864
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:41,118
and likeness of god in in in the

2865
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:43,920
pre-socratic age to be was to be what

2866
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:47,279
whooshes up and lingers for a while and

2867
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:50,000
fades away the paradigm of of what is

2868
01:44:47,279 --> 01:44:52,880
where thunderstorms and

2869
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:55,840
the anger of the gods achilles battle

2870
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:58,719
fury and it overtakes everything and

2871
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,800
stays for a while and then leaves the

2872
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:03,359
the flowers blooming in spring and

2873
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:05,679
that's very different from the way we

2874
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:07,920
experience ourselves and so the so the

2875
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:10,239
question is um what are we supposed to

2876
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,520
do in the face of that and heidegger

2877
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:12,319
thinks that

2878
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,560
the

2879
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:16,079
the presupposition that's motivated

2880
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:18,960
everything

2881
01:45:16,079 --> 01:45:21,439
from the pre-socratics forward

2882
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:23,039
is that

2883
01:45:21,439 --> 01:45:26,238
there is

2884
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:28,319
some entity that's the ground

2885
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:29,279
of the way we understand everything to

2886
01:45:28,319 --> 01:45:31,519
be

2887
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:33,439
for the middle ages it was god that was

2888
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:35,119
the entity that made things be the

2889
01:45:33,439 --> 01:45:37,919
things that they are

2890
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:40,399
for the enlightenment it was us

2891
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:42,239
maybe first heart it's us

2892
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:44,479
and heidegger thinks

2893
01:45:42,238 --> 01:45:46,799
um whatever it is that stands at the

2894
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:49,599
ground of what we are is not another

2895
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:51,920
thing it's not another entity and we're

2896
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:53,600
relating to it in the wrong way if we

2897
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,279
think of it like that

2898
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:57,760
there's some way and he this is partly

2899
01:45:55,279 --> 01:46:00,000
why i was interested in meister eckhart

2900
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,600
he says what there is is there's giving

2901
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,039
going on

2902
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,199
in the world

2903
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:07,920
and we're

2904
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:09,678
the grateful recipient of it

2905
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:11,359
and the giving is like

2906
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:13,600
whatever it is it's the social norms

2907
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:15,279
that were thrown into we didn't choose

2908
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:17,440
them they were given to us and that's

2909
01:46:15,279 --> 01:46:19,279
the ground that is what makes it

2910
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:21,279
possible for anything to be intelligible

2911
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:23,679
at all if we lived outside of

2912
01:46:21,279 --> 01:46:26,158
communities if we lived in a world where

2913
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:27,840
there were no social norms at all

2914
01:46:26,158 --> 01:46:29,519
nothing would mean anything

2915
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,840
nothing would have any significance

2916
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:34,080
nothing would be regular in the way that

2917
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:36,560
things need to be regular in order for

2918
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:40,719
there to be departures or manifestations

2919
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:42,880
of that regularity uh so so community

2920
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:45,600
norms are crucial

2921
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:48,719
but they're also always updating

2922
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:49,840
we place um we have some responsibility

2923
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:51,359
for

2924
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:53,679
what they are and the way in which

2925
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:55,759
they're updating themselves

2926
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:57,039
and yet we didn't ever choose it to be

2927
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:59,199
that way

2928
01:46:57,039 --> 01:47:00,399
so those norms are somehow

2929
01:46:59,198 --> 01:47:02,319
giving

2930
01:47:00,399 --> 01:47:05,679
significance to us

2931
01:47:02,319 --> 01:47:08,719
in a way that that we're implicated in

2932
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:10,639
we have some relation to and all that

2933
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:13,118
gets covered over if you think of us as

2934
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:16,319
efficient resources to be optimized is

2935
01:47:13,118 --> 01:47:18,880
that a conflicting view that we are

2936
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:20,079
resources to be optimized is that is

2937
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:21,920
that somehow

2938
01:47:20,079 --> 01:47:23,840
deeply conflicting with the fact that

2939
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:26,239
there's a ground that we stand on

2940
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:28,400
absolutely so what heidegger thinks is

2941
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:31,198
that this is this he calls this the

2942
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:33,519
supreme danger of the technological age

2943
01:47:31,198 --> 01:47:35,839
is that without ever having chosen it

2944
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:37,520
without ever having decided it this is

2945
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:38,880
the way we understand what it is to be

2946
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:42,960
us

2947
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:45,359
but he thinks that um it's also he says

2948
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:47,760
quoting holderly in this 18th century

2949
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:50,158
german poet he says in

2950
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:52,880
in the supreme danger lies the saving

2951
01:47:50,158 --> 01:47:55,439
possibility so what does that mean it

2952
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:56,880
means that we this is the this is the

2953
01:47:55,439 --> 01:47:58,799
understanding that we've been thrown

2954
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:01,118
into that we've been given it's the gift

2955
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:03,440
that was given to us it's supremely

2956
01:48:01,118 --> 01:48:06,238
dangerous if we let ourselves live that

2957
01:48:03,439 --> 01:48:08,638
way we'll destroy ourselves

2958
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:09,519
but it's also the saving possibility

2959
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:14,159
because

2960
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:15,119
if we recognize that we never chose that

2961
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:17,198
that

2962
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:19,279
it was given to us

2963
01:48:17,198 --> 01:48:21,198
but also we were implicated in its being

2964
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:24,238
given and we could find a way to

2965
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:27,118
supersede it that it's the ground but

2966
01:48:24,238 --> 01:48:29,919
it's also updatable it calls the ground

2967
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:32,000
the groundless ground

2968
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:34,158
it's it's not like an entity which is

2969
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,760
there solid stable

2970
01:48:34,158 --> 01:48:38,638
like god who's

2971
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:40,239
eternal and non-changing is always

2972
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:43,039
updating itself and we're always

2973
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:45,519
involved in it's being updated but we're

2974
01:48:43,039 --> 01:48:46,719
only involved in it in the right way if

2975
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:49,199
we listen

2976
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:51,198
like miles davis

2977
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:53,039
so optimization

2978
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:55,279
is not a good

2979
01:48:53,039 --> 01:48:58,079
way to live life

2980
01:48:55,279 --> 01:49:00,399
if you thought that it was obviously

2981
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:02,960
clear that that was

2982
01:49:00,399 --> 01:49:04,238
the relevant value so obviously clear

2983
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:06,960
that it never even occurred to you to

2984
01:49:04,238 --> 01:49:09,839
ask whether it was right to think that

2985
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:12,560
then you would be in danger yeah got it

2986
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:14,800
so yeah there is some in this modern

2987
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:17,280
technological age in in the full meaning

2988
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:20,000
of the word technology that's updated to

2989
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:22,639
actual modern age with

2990
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,960
a lot more technology going on

2991
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:26,840
it uh it does feel like

2992
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:29,439
like colleagues of mine in tech space

2993
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:30,800
actually are somehow drawn to that

2994
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:33,039
optimization

2995
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:35,039
as if that's going to save us

2996
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:35,920
as if the thing that truly weighs us

2997
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:37,198
down

2998
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:40,480
is um

2999
01:49:37,198 --> 01:49:42,879
the inefficiencies exactly and i think

3000
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:44,799
if you think about other other contexts

3001
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:47,359
like what what are the moments when

3002
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:49,840
i mean we're unique in this respect this

3003
01:49:47,359 --> 01:49:52,238
this period in history is unlike any

3004
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:54,480
previous no nobody ever felt that way

3005
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:56,479
right but think about but it's also true

3006
01:49:54,479 --> 01:49:58,319
that nobody no previous period in

3007
01:49:56,479 --> 01:50:00,638
history was nihilistic

3008
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:03,439
so our condition is tied up that sort of

3009
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:05,440
thing is meant to be a response to the

3010
01:50:03,439 --> 01:50:06,638
felt lack of a ground

3011
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:10,479
and

3012
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:13,039
so no no previous epoch in history felt

3013
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:15,598
that way they didn't have our problem

3014
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:19,279
but think so so they it was much more

3015
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:21,199
natural to them to experience

3016
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:23,198
moments in ways that feel

3017
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:25,839
um unachievable for us what we were

3018
01:50:23,198 --> 01:50:27,678
calling moments of aliveness before

3019
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:29,920
think about where the context in which

3020
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:32,399
they felt them they weren't efficient

3021
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:33,599
optimized contexts think about the the

3022
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:36,079
greeks

3023
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:38,159
if you ever read homer it is a bizarre

3024
01:50:36,079 --> 01:50:39,840
world back there but one of the things

3025
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:43,359
that's bizarre

3026
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:45,679
is that they're so unmotivated by

3027
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:46,719
efficiency and optimizing

3028
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:50,079
that

3029
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:52,079
the only thing that seems to run through

3030
01:50:50,079 --> 01:50:53,359
all of the different greek cultures it's

3031
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:56,559
the idea

3032
01:50:53,359 --> 01:50:58,319
that if some stranger comes by

3033
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,560
you better

3034
01:50:58,319 --> 01:51:02,719
take care of them

3035
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:04,719
because zeus is the is the god of

3036
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:06,239
strangers and zeus will be angry that's

3037
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:08,079
what they say right but what is it but

3038
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:09,759
how does it manifest itself

3039
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:11,920
odysseus he's trying to get home and he

3040
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:14,639
gets shipwrecked on an island

3041
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:16,719
and you know he's trying to figure out

3042
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:19,840
he's been at sea for 10 days he's

3043
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:22,480
starving he's bedraggled and he sees uh

3044
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:24,719
now sissa the the princess who's

3045
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:26,479
beautiful and he's like boy i better you

3046
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:28,639
know i don't know guess to get get some

3047
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:30,799
clothes or something like i don't want

3048
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:33,118
them to beat me up and kill me

3049
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:34,400
and so they so she takes him to the

3050
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:36,880
palace

3051
01:51:34,399 --> 01:51:40,799
they have three days of banquets and

3052
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:43,118
festivals before they even ask his name

3053
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:46,239
it's like here's a stranger

3054
01:51:43,118 --> 01:51:47,759
our job is to celebrate the presence of

3055
01:51:46,238 --> 01:51:49,678
a stranger because this is where

3056
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:51,920
significance lies

3057
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:53,520
now we don't have to feel that way but

3058
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:55,520
but the idea that that's one of the

3059
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:58,000
places where significance could lie is

3060
01:51:55,520 --> 01:52:00,080
pretty strongly at odds with the idea

3061
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,319
that our salvation is going to come from

3062
01:52:00,079 --> 01:52:04,000
optimization and efficiency now maybe

3063
01:52:02,319 --> 01:52:07,039
something about the way we live our

3064
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:10,399
lives will have that integrated into it

3065
01:52:07,039 --> 01:52:11,920
um but it's but it's at odds with other

3066
01:52:10,399 --> 01:52:13,839
other moments

3067
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:16,560
let me ask you a question about uh

3068
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:17,760
hubert bert dreyfus

3069
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,719
he is a

3070
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:21,119
friend

3071
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:23,920
a colleague a mentor of yours

3072
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:26,960
unfortunately no longer with us

3073
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:29,679
you wrote with him the book titled all

3074
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:32,079
things shining reading the western

3075
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:33,599
classics to find meaning in a secular

3076
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:35,039
age

3077
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:37,360
first

3078
01:52:35,039 --> 01:52:39,679
can you maybe speak about who that man

3079
01:52:37,359 --> 01:52:41,920
was what you learned from him

3080
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:44,800
and then we could maybe ask

3081
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:48,399
how do we find through the classics

3082
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:52,400
meaning in a secular age okay

3083
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:54,960
so bert dreyfuss was a

3084
01:52:52,399 --> 01:52:56,158
very important philosopher

3085
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,960
of the

3086
01:52:56,158 --> 01:53:01,598
late 20th early 21st century he he died

3087
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:02,719
in um 2017 about a little over four

3088
01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:06,000
years ago

3089
01:53:02,719 --> 01:53:08,319
uh he was my teacher i met him in 1989

3090
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,639
when i went away to graduate school

3091
01:53:08,319 --> 01:53:11,759
in berkeley that's where he taught

3092
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:12,719
he

3093
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,239
plays an

3094
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:16,239
interesting and important role in the

3095
01:53:14,238 --> 01:53:17,519
history of philosophy in america

3096
01:53:16,238 --> 01:53:20,000
because

3097
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:23,119
uh in a period when

3098
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,679
most philosophers in america

3099
01:53:23,118 --> 01:53:28,238
and in the english-speaking world

3100
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:30,639
were not taking seriously 20th century

3101
01:53:28,238 --> 01:53:32,799
french and german philosophy he was

3102
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:34,639
and he was really

3103
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:36,480
probably the most important

3104
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:38,319
english-speaking interpreter of

3105
01:53:36,479 --> 01:53:39,839
heidegger the the german philosopher

3106
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:41,118
that we're talking about we've been

3107
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:42,960
talking about

3108
01:53:41,118 --> 01:53:44,880
he

3109
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:47,198
was an incredible teacher a lot of his

3110
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:48,159
influence came through his teaching

3111
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:51,118
and

3112
01:53:48,158 --> 01:53:52,559
one of the amazing things about him as a

3113
01:53:51,118 --> 01:53:55,519
teacher

3114
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,480
was his um

3115
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,679
sort of

3116
01:53:56,479 --> 01:53:59,039
mix

3117
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:01,199
of

3118
01:53:59,039 --> 01:54:02,479
intellectual humility

3119
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:06,079
with sort of

3120
01:54:02,479 --> 01:54:09,039
deep insightful authority and he would

3121
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:11,279
stand up in front of a class of 300

3122
01:54:09,039 --> 01:54:13,439
students he taught huge classes because

3123
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:16,000
people love to go see him and i taught

3124
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:18,000
for him for many years

3125
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,079
and say you know

3126
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,079
i've been reading this text for 40 years

3127
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:25,039
but the question you asked is one i've

3128
01:54:22,079 --> 01:54:27,760
never asked and it would be true

3129
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:29,599
like he would he would he would find in

3130
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:31,360
what people said

3131
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:34,400
things that were surprising and new to

3132
01:54:31,359 --> 01:54:37,279
him and that's humility actually that is

3133
01:54:34,399 --> 01:54:39,839
listening to the world absolutely

3134
01:54:37,279 --> 01:54:41,198
absolutely he was always ready to be

3135
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,000
surprised

3136
01:54:41,198 --> 01:54:44,559
by

3137
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,479
something that someone said yeah and

3138
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:49,440
there's something astonishing about that

3139
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:51,198
so his influence was you know for people

3140
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:53,198
who didn't know him through his

3141
01:54:51,198 --> 01:54:55,198
interpretations of these texts he wrote

3142
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:56,879
about a huge range of stuff but for

3143
01:54:55,198 --> 01:54:58,719
people who did know him it was through

3144
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:01,760
his presence it was through the way he

3145
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:04,719
carried himself in in his life

3146
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:07,520
and uh so in any case that that's who he

3147
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:10,079
was we i graduated

3148
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:11,920
after many years as a graduate student i

3149
01:55:10,079 --> 01:55:13,439
i didn't start in philosophy i started

3150
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:15,359
in math math and computer science

3151
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:17,279
actually and then i did a lot of work in

3152
01:55:15,359 --> 01:55:19,759
computational neuroscience for a few

3153
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:22,158
years it's a fascinating journey we'll

3154
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:23,520
we'll get to it through our friendly

3155
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:25,839
conversation about artificial

3156
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:27,840
intelligence okay i'm sure

3157
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:29,679
because you're you're basically

3158
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:32,159
fascinated with the

3159
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:35,840
philosophy of mind of the human mind but

3160
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:37,839
rooted in a curiosity of mind through

3161
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:40,000
the it's artificial

3162
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:42,480
through the engineering of mind yeah

3163
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:44,158
yeah that's right so bur so bert i mean

3164
01:55:42,479 --> 01:55:47,118
the reason i was attracted to him

3165
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:49,679
actually is is because of his uh to

3166
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:51,679
begin with was because of his criticisms

3167
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:54,319
of what was called traditional symbolic

3168
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:56,239
ai in the 70s and 80s

3169
01:55:54,319 --> 01:55:58,319
so i came to berkeley as a graduate

3170
01:55:56,238 --> 01:55:59,519
student who'd done a lot of math and a

3171
01:55:58,319 --> 01:56:01,679
lot of computer science a lot of

3172
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:04,560
computational neuroscience i

3173
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:06,158
i noticed that you had you

3174
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:09,440
interview a lot of a lot of people in

3175
01:56:06,158 --> 01:56:12,559
this world and i had a teacher at brown

3176
01:56:09,439 --> 01:56:14,559
as an undergraduate uh jim anderson who

3177
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:17,440
wrote with jeff hinton a big book on

3178
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:19,119
neural networks um so so i had i was

3179
01:56:17,439 --> 01:56:22,238
interested in that

3180
01:56:19,118 --> 01:56:24,479
not so interested in traditional ai like

3181
01:56:22,238 --> 01:56:26,079
sort of lisp programmings things that

3182
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:27,519
went on in the 80s

3183
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:28,800
because it felt

3184
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,560
sort of

3185
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,480
you know when you made a system do

3186
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:34,800
something all of a sudden it was an un

3187
01:56:32,479 --> 01:56:36,559
interesting thing to have done

3188
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:37,760
the fact that you'd solved the problem

3189
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,520
then made it clear that the problem

3190
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,480
wasn't an interesting one to solve

3191
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:42,560
that's right

3192
01:56:40,479 --> 01:56:46,479
and i had that experience and and bert

3193
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:49,679
had criticisms of of um symbolic ai what

3194
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:52,000
he called good old-fashioned ai gofi

3195
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:54,000
and um and i was attracted to those

3196
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,158
criticisms because

3197
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:59,279
it felt to me that there was something

3198
01:56:56,158 --> 01:57:01,519
lacking in in in that project and i

3199
01:56:59,279 --> 01:57:02,960
didn't know what it was i i just felt

3200
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:04,159
its absence

3201
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:08,480
and uh

3202
01:57:04,158 --> 01:57:09,759
then i learned that all his arguments

3203
01:57:08,479 --> 01:57:11,359
came from his reading of this

3204
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:13,760
phenomenological and existential

3205
01:57:11,359 --> 01:57:15,198
tradition and so i had to try to figure

3206
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:17,840
out what those folks were saying and it

3207
01:57:15,198 --> 01:57:19,759
was a long road let me tell you

3208
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:21,199
it took me a long time but but it was

3209
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:23,199
because of birth that i was able to do

3210
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:25,118
that so i own that that huge debt of

3211
01:57:23,198 --> 01:57:26,879
gratitude and eventually we went on to

3212
01:57:25,118 --> 01:57:28,158
write a book together which was a great

3213
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:30,159
experience

3214
01:57:28,158 --> 01:57:33,039
and yes we published all things shining

3215
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:35,439
in 2011. and that was that's a book that

3216
01:57:33,039 --> 01:57:38,079
i definitely would not have had the hood

3217
01:57:35,439 --> 01:57:40,799
spa to try to write if it weren't for

3218
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:43,039
bert because it was really about

3219
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:46,000
you know great literature in the history

3220
01:57:43,039 --> 01:57:48,399
of the west from homer and virgil to and

3221
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,439
dante to melville there's a huge chapter

3222
01:57:48,399 --> 01:57:53,359
on melville a big chapter on um david

3223
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:56,000
foster wallace who burt didn't care

3224
01:57:53,359 --> 01:57:56,880
about it all but i was fascinated by it

3225
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,198
and so

3226
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:00,880
learning to think that way while writing

3227
01:57:59,198 --> 01:58:04,158
that book with him

3228
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:06,400
uh was an amazing experience

3229
01:58:04,158 --> 01:58:08,638
so i have to admit

3230
01:58:06,399 --> 01:58:10,559
it's one of my failings in life one of

3231
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:12,560
many failings is i've never gotten

3232
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:13,440
through moby dick

3233
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:16,000
or

3234
01:58:13,439 --> 01:58:17,839
or any of melville's works so

3235
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:20,399
maybe can you comment on before we talk

3236
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:22,079
about dave or david foster wallace who i

3237
01:58:20,399 --> 01:58:23,598
have gotten through

3238
01:58:22,079 --> 01:58:25,439
um

3239
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:27,279
what are some

3240
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:29,598
of the sources of meaning in these

3241
01:58:27,279 --> 01:58:31,679
classics good so

3242
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:33,679
moby dick i think is the other great

3243
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:36,158
novel of the 19th century

3244
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:38,000
so the brothers karamazov and moby dick

3245
01:58:36,158 --> 01:58:39,679
and and they're diametrically opposed

3246
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,279
which is one of the really interesting

3247
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:44,319
things so

3248
01:58:41,279 --> 01:58:45,519
the brothers karamazov is a kind of in

3249
01:58:44,319 --> 01:58:47,198
it's a kind of existential

3250
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:48,400
interpretation of russian orthodox

3251
01:58:47,198 --> 01:58:50,559
christianity

3252
01:58:48,399 --> 01:58:52,079
how do you live that way and find joy in

3253
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:54,400
your existence

3254
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:56,319
moby dick is not at all about

3255
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:59,198
christianity it's about

3256
01:58:56,319 --> 01:59:00,639
it sort of starts with the observation

3257
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:03,839
that that

3258
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:07,840
that the form of christianity that uh

3259
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:09,279
that ishmael is is familiar with is is

3260
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:11,599
broken it's not gonna it's not gonna

3261
01:59:09,279 --> 01:59:14,238
work in his living his life he has to

3262
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:17,520
leave it he has to go to sea

3263
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:20,158
in order to find what needs to happen

3264
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:23,520
and and and ishmael is the the boating

3265
01:59:20,158 --> 01:59:25,839
captain the the the whaling boat captain

3266
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:27,520
so now he's not the captain that's ahab

3267
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:29,840
ahab is the captain yeah right let me

3268
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:31,920
back up the famous opening line to the

3269
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:34,079
book is call me ishmael

3270
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:36,960
and that's ishmael is the is the main

3271
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:39,359
character in the book he's a nobody he's

3272
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:42,158
you and me he's the everyday guy he's

3273
01:59:39,359 --> 01:59:43,920
like a nobody on the ship he he's like

3274
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:45,839
you know not the lowest but certainly

3275
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:47,118
not the highest he's right in the middle

3276
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:49,119
he and

3277
01:59:47,118 --> 01:59:50,960
and he's named ishmael which is

3278
01:59:49,118 --> 01:59:54,479
interesting because ishmael is the

3279
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:56,639
illegitimate son of abraham in the old

3280
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:58,959
testament he is the

3281
01:59:56,639 --> 02:00:01,118
the i think if i have it right again

3282
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:03,679
someone will correct me

3283
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:07,598
i think he's the he's the one he's the

3284
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:08,399
one that islam traces its its um genesis

3285
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:10,480
to

3286
02:00:08,399 --> 02:00:13,359
and so islam is

3287
02:00:10,479 --> 02:00:15,439
is an abrahamic religion like judaism

3288
02:00:13,359 --> 02:00:17,839
and christianity but judaism and

3289
02:00:15,439 --> 02:00:20,399
christianity trace their lineage through

3290
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:23,119
isaac the the quote-unquote legitimate

3291
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:26,079
son of abraham and ishmael is the other

3292
02:00:23,118 --> 02:00:27,359
son of abraham who he had with a with a

3293
02:00:26,079 --> 02:00:29,118
girlfriend

3294
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:30,960
uh and so

3295
02:00:29,118 --> 02:00:33,439
so he's he's clearly outside of

3296
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:36,560
christianity in some way he's named

3297
02:00:33,439 --> 02:00:37,919
after the non-christian sort of son of

3298
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:41,199
of abraham

3299
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:42,158
um and and he's the the book starts out

3300
02:00:41,198 --> 02:00:44,799
with

3301
02:00:42,158 --> 02:00:45,598
this what does he call it something like

3302
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:49,679
a

3303
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:49,679
dark and misty november mood

3304
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:54,400
he's walking along the street and he's

3305
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:56,719
overcome by his i can't remember what

3306
02:00:54,399 --> 02:01:00,319
the word is but his hypos that's what he

3307
02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:02,800
calls them he's in a mood he's depressed

3308
02:01:00,319 --> 02:01:04,639
he's down things are not going well and

3309
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:08,480
that's where he starts

3310
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:11,520
and he he signs up to go on this whaling

3311
02:01:08,479 --> 02:01:12,399
voyage with this captain ahab

3312
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:15,360
who

3313
02:01:12,399 --> 02:01:17,759
is this incredibly charismatic

3314
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:19,039
deeply disturbing

3315
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:21,840
character

3316
02:01:19,039 --> 02:01:24,560
who is a captain who's got lots of

3317
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:26,560
history and wants to go whaling wants to

3318
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:28,400
get whales that's what they do they

3319
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:30,400
harpoon these whales and bring them back

3320
02:01:28,399 --> 02:01:33,839
and sell the blubber and the oil and so

3321
02:01:30,399 --> 02:01:36,000
on um so he's he's kind of rich and he's

3322
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:39,000
and he's famous and he's powerful he's

3323
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:41,840
an authority figure and he is

3324
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:43,840
megalomaniacally obsessed with getting

3325
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:46,239
one particular whale which is called

3326
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:48,880
moby dick and moby dick is like the

3327
02:01:46,238 --> 02:01:51,678
largest the whitest the sort of most

3328
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:53,679
terrifying of all the whales and ahab

3329
02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:55,520
wants to get him because because a

3330
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:57,760
number of years earlier

3331
02:01:55,520 --> 02:02:00,320
he had an encounter with moby dick where

3332
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:02,480
moby dick bit off his leg

3333
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:05,599
and he survived

3334
02:02:02,479 --> 02:02:08,079
but he had this deeply religious

3335
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:10,239
experience in the wake of it

3336
02:02:08,079 --> 02:02:12,559
and he needed to find out what the

3337
02:02:10,238 --> 02:02:15,519
meaning of that was like what is the

3338
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:18,320
meaning of my suffering who am i such

3339
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:20,480
that the world and moby dick this

3340
02:02:18,319 --> 02:02:22,479
leviathan at the center of it should

3341
02:02:20,479 --> 02:02:24,638
treat me this way

3342
02:02:22,479 --> 02:02:26,959
and so his task is not just to go

3343
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:28,960
whaling is to figure out the meaning of

3344
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:31,198
the universe

3345
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:34,239
through going wailing and having a

3346
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:36,000
confrontation with his tormentor this

3347
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:37,759
whale moby dick

3348
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:40,639
and the confrontation is so weird

3349
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:43,840
because melville points out that whales

3350
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:46,480
their faces are so huge

3351
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:49,199
their foreheads are so huge

3352
02:02:46,479 --> 02:02:50,879
and their eyes are on the side of them

3353
02:02:49,198 --> 02:02:52,238
that you can never actually look them in

3354
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:54,960
the eye

3355
02:02:52,238 --> 02:02:57,439
and it's kind of a metaphor for god like

3356
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:59,198
you can't ever look god in the face

3357
02:02:57,439 --> 02:03:01,198
that's the sort of traditional thing to

3358
02:02:59,198 --> 02:03:02,960
say about god you can't find the

3359
02:03:01,198 --> 02:03:05,359
ultimate meaning of the universe by

3360
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:08,319
looking god in the face

3361
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:11,439
and but ahab wants to he says he's got a

3362
02:03:08,319 --> 02:03:13,439
pasteboard mask of a face but i'll

3363
02:03:11,439 --> 02:03:15,039
strike through the mask and find out

3364
02:03:13,439 --> 02:03:17,678
what's behind

3365
02:03:15,039 --> 02:03:19,599
and so ishmael is sort of caught up in

3366
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:21,760
this thing and he's like going wailing

3367
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:23,760
because he's in a bad mood

3368
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:26,000
and maybe this will make things better

3369
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:27,760
and he makes friends with this

3370
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:30,319
guy queequeg

3371
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:32,960
and queequeg is a pagan

3372
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:34,399
he's from an island in the south pacific

3373
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:38,158
and he's got

3374
02:03:34,399 --> 02:03:41,198
tattoos all over his body head to toe

3375
02:03:38,158 --> 02:03:44,399
he's a party colored like every

3376
02:03:41,198 --> 02:03:46,879
different color says says ishmael is

3377
02:03:44,399 --> 02:03:50,319
these tattoos and they they are

3378
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:52,159
the the writing on his body

3379
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:54,719
he says of

3380
02:03:52,158 --> 02:03:58,000
the immutable mysteries of the universe

3381
02:03:54,719 --> 02:04:01,118
as understood through his culture

3382
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:03,599
and so somehow queequeg

3383
02:04:01,118 --> 02:04:05,359
is this character who is like not

3384
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:08,000
christian at all

3385
02:04:05,359 --> 02:04:10,000
um and he's powerful in a very different

3386
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,920
way than ahab is he's supposed to be the

3387
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,840
king he's the son of the king and

3388
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:16,000
probably his father's died by now and if

3389
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:18,000
he went home he'd be the king but he's

3390
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,840
off on a voyage too trying to understand

3391
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,920
who he is before he goes back and leads

3392
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:26,159
his people and he's a harpooner the

3393
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:28,000
bravest of the people on the ship and um

3394
02:04:26,158 --> 02:04:30,799
he's got the mystery of the universe

3395
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,158
tattooed on his body but nobody can

3396
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:33,840
understand it

3397
02:04:32,158 --> 02:04:36,000
and

3398
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:38,560
it's through his relation with queequeg

3399
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:40,560
that ishmael comes to get a different

3400
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:42,560
understanding of what we might be about

3401
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:44,320
so that's that's moby dick

3402
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:47,360
in a nutshell

3403
02:04:44,319 --> 02:04:48,719
and and uh connected to a book i have

3404
02:04:47,359 --> 02:04:50,399
read which is

3405
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:53,118
funny there's probably echoes that

3406
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:56,638
represent the 20th century now

3407
02:04:53,118 --> 02:04:57,679
in old man in the sea by hemingway

3408
02:04:56,639 --> 02:04:59,599
that

3409
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:01,679
also has

3410
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:03,760
similar i guess themes

3411
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:05,279
but more

3412
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:07,199
more personal

3413
02:05:05,279 --> 02:05:09,679
more focused on the

3414
02:05:07,198 --> 02:05:11,198
i mean i guess it's less about god is

3415
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:12,719
almost more like the existentialist

3416
02:05:11,198 --> 02:05:15,118
version of moby dick

3417
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:16,880
yeah yeah and hence shorter and a lot

3418
02:05:15,118 --> 02:05:19,039
shorter yeah well hemingway was

3419
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:21,279
brilliant that way yeah

3420
02:05:19,039 --> 02:05:23,679
but do you see echoes and uh do you do

3421
02:05:21,279 --> 02:05:25,920
you find old man in the sea interesting

3422
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:27,039
it's been since ninth grade that i've

3423
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:29,679
been in

3424
02:05:27,039 --> 02:05:31,519
even longer ago than the fountain had uh

3425
02:05:29,679 --> 02:05:33,599
so i didn't know we were gonna go there

3426
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:36,639
i mean i find hemingway interesting but

3427
02:05:33,599 --> 02:05:40,719
hemingway my general sort of picture of

3428
02:05:36,639 --> 02:05:42,960
him is that you know he's he's uh we

3429
02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:45,039
have to confront the the dangers and the

3430
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:46,719
difficulties of our life we have to

3431
02:05:45,039 --> 02:05:48,800
develop in ourselves a certain kind of

3432
02:05:46,719 --> 02:05:50,399
courage and manliness and i think

3433
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:52,639
there's something interesting about that

3434
02:05:50,399 --> 02:05:54,799
he's for risk

3435
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:58,639
in a certain way and i think that's

3436
02:05:54,800 --> 02:06:00,400
important uh but i but i do i don't now

3437
02:05:58,639 --> 02:06:02,400
i i don't have any right to say this

3438
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:06,000
since it's been so long since i read it

3439
02:06:02,399 --> 02:06:08,238
i do feel like there's there's

3440
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,479
i don't remember

3441
02:06:08,238 --> 02:06:13,039
a sense for the for the quite the

3442
02:06:10,479 --> 02:06:15,279
tragedy of it maybe there is is it a

3443
02:06:13,039 --> 02:06:17,039
melancholy novel i don't even remember

3444
02:06:15,279 --> 02:06:18,960
no it's uh

3445
02:06:17,039 --> 02:06:20,399
i mean it has a sense like the stranger

3446
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:24,000
by camus

3447
02:06:20,399 --> 02:06:24,879
it has a sense of like this is how life

3448
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,920
is

3449
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:29,279
and it like it has more about old age

3450
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:31,920
and

3451
02:06:29,279 --> 02:06:35,039
that uh you're not quite the man you

3452
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:36,480
used to be feeling of like this is how

3453
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:39,118
time passes

3454
02:06:36,479 --> 02:06:41,598
and then the the passing of time and how

3455
02:06:39,118 --> 02:06:43,759
you get old you get older

3456
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:46,480
and this is one last fish

3457
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:49,760
it's less about this is the fish it's

3458
02:06:46,479 --> 02:06:51,198
more like this is one last fish like and

3459
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:53,360
asking

3460
02:06:51,198 --> 02:06:55,678
who was i

3461
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:58,399
who was i as a man as a human being in

3462
02:06:55,679 --> 02:07:01,520
this world and this one fish helps you

3463
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:04,399
ask that question fully wonderful but

3464
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:06,800
it's one fish which is just sort of all

3465
02:07:04,399 --> 02:07:08,879
the other fish too right and and that is

3466
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:09,760
a big difference because

3467
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:11,199
for

3468
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:13,360
for ahab

3469
02:07:11,198 --> 02:07:15,279
no other fish will do than moby dick

3470
02:07:13,359 --> 02:07:18,399
it's got to be the biggest the most

3471
02:07:15,279 --> 02:07:20,238
powerful the most tormenting it's got to

3472
02:07:18,399 --> 02:07:22,319
be the one that you've got history with

3473
02:07:20,238 --> 02:07:24,399
that has defiled you

3474
02:07:22,319 --> 02:07:27,920
and it is

3475
02:07:24,399 --> 02:07:30,799
it's a raucous ride moby dick

3476
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:33,118
what about david foster wallace so why

3477
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:37,119
is he important to you in the search of

3478
02:07:33,118 --> 02:07:38,000
meaning uh in a secular age good so so

3479
02:07:37,118 --> 02:07:39,759
i'll just

3480
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,920
just to finish the moby dick thing i

3481
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:43,360
think what's interesting about melville

3482
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:45,440
is that he thinks

3483
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:47,359
our salvation comes not if we get in the

3484
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:48,799
right relation to monotheism or

3485
02:07:47,359 --> 02:07:51,920
christianity but if we get in the right

3486
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:54,639
relation to polytheism to the idea that

3487
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:56,800
there's not a unity to our existence

3488
02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:58,639
but there are lots of little meanings

3489
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:00,800
and they don't cohere

3490
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:02,400
sometimes you know

3491
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:05,279
uh like in

3492
02:08:02,399 --> 02:08:07,679
like in homer sometimes you're in love

3493
02:08:05,279 --> 02:08:09,759
helen's in love with paris

3494
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:12,319
and they do crazy things they go off and

3495
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:14,400
run away and the trojan war begins and

3496
02:08:12,319 --> 02:08:16,799
sometimes you're in a battle fury that

3497
02:08:14,399 --> 02:08:18,960
for the love is aphrodite's realm and

3498
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:20,480
the battle fury that's ares realm and

3499
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:22,639
that's a totally different world and

3500
02:08:20,479 --> 02:08:24,638
they're not even i mean they're related

3501
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:28,078
there's a kind of family resemblance but

3502
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:30,800
not much mostly you're just in different

3503
02:08:28,078 --> 02:08:33,118
sort of local meaningful worlds and

3504
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:34,880
melville seems to think that that's

3505
02:08:33,118 --> 02:08:37,679
that's a thing that we could aim to

3506
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:41,440
bring back he says we have to

3507
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:42,639
lure back the merry mayday gods of old

3508
02:08:41,439 --> 02:08:44,479
and and

3509
02:08:42,639 --> 02:08:47,760
lovingly enthroned them in the now

3510
02:08:44,479 --> 02:08:49,439
egotistical sky the now unhaunted hill

3511
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:50,960
that's what we live in this world where

3512
02:08:49,439 --> 02:08:53,198
hills aren't aren't haunted with

3513
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:55,279
significance anymore and the sky is just

3514
02:08:53,198 --> 02:08:58,319
a bunch of stuff that we're studying

3515
02:08:55,279 --> 02:09:00,359
with physics and astrophysics and stuff

3516
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:02,880
but but they used to be

3517
02:09:00,359 --> 02:09:05,039
awe-inspiring and we have to figure out

3518
02:09:02,880 --> 02:09:06,880
how to get in that relation to them but

3519
02:09:05,039 --> 02:09:08,319
not by trying to give a unity to our

3520
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:10,400
existence through

3521
02:09:08,319 --> 02:09:12,078
developing habits and practices that get

3522
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:14,920
written on our body

3523
02:09:12,078 --> 02:09:17,840
and so his is about the end of

3524
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:21,440
judeo-christianity and the sort of roman

3525
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:22,639
appropriation of it in wallace i what

3526
02:09:21,439 --> 02:09:24,238
one of the things i think is so

3527
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:27,279
interesting about him

3528
02:09:24,238 --> 02:09:30,000
is that i think he's a great observer of

3529
02:09:27,279 --> 02:09:33,439
the contemporary world and he's a very

3530
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,639
funny writer he's really funny but he's

3531
02:09:33,439 --> 02:09:36,960
a great observer of the of the

3532
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:39,359
contemporary world and what he thought

3533
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:42,319
uh was at the core of the contemporary

3534
02:09:39,359 --> 02:09:44,719
world was this constant temptation to

3535
02:09:42,319 --> 02:09:46,238
diversion through entertainment

3536
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:48,239
that's a different story than

3537
02:09:46,238 --> 02:09:50,879
heidegger's story about efficiency and

3538
02:09:48,238 --> 02:09:52,718
optimization but it's the other side of

3539
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:55,599
it what like what is this tension

3540
02:09:52,719 --> 02:09:58,319
temptation sort of diverting us from

3541
02:09:55,599 --> 02:10:01,119
the ability to be more efficient

3542
02:09:58,319 --> 02:10:03,279
so you know you're tempted to go

3543
02:10:01,118 --> 02:10:05,598
you know watch some stupid film

3544
02:10:03,279 --> 02:10:08,319
or television show or something that's

3545
02:10:05,599 --> 02:10:10,800
dumb and not really very interesting but

3546
02:10:08,319 --> 02:10:12,639
you read that temptation as a temptation

3547
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:14,639
precisely in virtue of it's taking you

3548
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:16,719
away from your optimizing your your

3549
02:10:14,639 --> 02:10:18,480
existence and so i think they're two

3550
02:10:16,719 --> 02:10:20,639
sides of the same coin i think he's

3551
02:10:18,479 --> 02:10:22,879
brilliant at describing it i think he

3552
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:25,840
thought it was a desperate position to

3553
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:27,520
be in that it was it was something that

3554
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:29,840
we needed to confront

3555
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:32,719
and find a way out of

3556
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:34,800
and his characters are trying to do that

3557
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:36,719
and i think there's two different david

3558
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:37,840
foster wallaces

3559
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:39,359
one

3560
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:40,560
i mean david foster wallace committed

3561
02:10:39,359 --> 02:10:42,960
suicide

3562
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:44,239
and when i and it's very sad and he

3563
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:45,679
clearly

3564
02:10:44,238 --> 02:10:47,198
did have

3565
02:10:45,679 --> 02:10:49,760
you know sort of there was a

3566
02:10:47,198 --> 02:10:52,078
physiological basis to his condition he

3567
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:54,159
knew it he was treating it from decades

3568
02:10:52,078 --> 02:10:56,078
with medication he had

3569
02:10:54,158 --> 02:10:59,920
uh electroshock therapy a number of

3570
02:10:56,078 --> 02:11:01,279
times it is just very very sad story

3571
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:03,599
when i decided that we were going to

3572
02:11:01,279 --> 02:11:05,679
write about david foster wallace

3573
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:08,078
the first thing i was worried about is

3574
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:10,399
what can you can you

3575
02:11:08,078 --> 02:11:12,719
like obviously

3576
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:14,799
a motivating factor maybe the motivating

3577
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:16,800
factor in his committing suicide was his

3578
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:19,039
physiological condition

3579
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:20,960
um but there was there's there's this

3580
02:11:19,039 --> 02:11:23,039
there was a question

3581
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:25,520
could you think i mean he's obsessed

3582
02:11:23,039 --> 02:11:27,920
with the condition with what we need to

3583
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:30,560
do to achieve our salvation

3584
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:31,760
to live well to make our lives worth

3585
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:33,760
living

3586
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:37,039
and he clearly

3587
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:38,960
in the end felt like he couldn't do that

3588
02:11:37,039 --> 02:11:41,439
so in addition to the physiological

3589
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:43,520
thing which probably most of it the

3590
02:11:41,439 --> 02:11:45,359
question for me was could you find in

3591
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:46,719
his writing

3592
02:11:45,359 --> 02:11:48,799
what his

3593
02:11:46,719 --> 02:11:51,439
what he was identifying

3594
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:53,279
as the thing we needed to be doing

3595
02:11:51,439 --> 02:11:54,479
that he nevertheless felt we couldn't be

3596
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:57,039
doing

3597
02:11:54,479 --> 02:11:59,198
and he and he talks as if that's that's

3598
02:11:57,039 --> 02:12:01,599
the difficulty for him

3599
02:11:59,198 --> 02:12:03,839
uh so so that that's one side of him and

3600
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:05,360
i i did want to find that

3601
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:06,400
i think there's another side of him

3602
02:12:05,359 --> 02:12:08,960
that's very different but you were going

3603
02:12:06,399 --> 02:12:11,039
to ask no please what's the other side i

3604
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:13,359
mean what i write about in the

3605
02:12:11,039 --> 02:12:15,920
in the chapter mostly

3606
02:12:13,359 --> 02:12:17,759
um is what i think

3607
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:20,880
he's got as our

3608
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:23,119
as as our saving possibility

3609
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:24,960
he thinks our saving possibility he says

3610
02:12:23,118 --> 02:12:27,279
this in a graduation speech that he gave

3611
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:29,279
to kenyon

3612
02:12:27,279 --> 02:12:31,039
is that

3613
02:12:29,279 --> 02:12:33,359
we have the freedom to interpret

3614
02:12:31,039 --> 02:12:36,319
situations however we like

3615
02:12:33,359 --> 02:12:38,799
so what's the problem case for him

3616
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:41,118
he says look you know the problem case

3617
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:43,520
we have it all the time you get pissed

3618
02:12:41,118 --> 02:12:46,479
off into the world you know

3619
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:47,520
some some big suv cuts you off on the

3620
02:12:46,479 --> 02:12:49,598
highway

3621
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:51,760
and you're pissed off and you might

3622
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:54,639
express your anger

3623
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:57,360
with one finger or another

3624
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:58,719
directed at that person and he says but

3625
02:12:57,359 --> 02:13:00,399
actually

3626
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:02,800
you know

3627
02:13:00,399 --> 02:13:04,960
you're being pissed off as the result of

3628
02:13:02,800 --> 02:13:06,639
your having made an assumption

3629
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:08,399
and the assumption is that that action

3630
02:13:06,639 --> 02:13:10,560
was directed at you

3631
02:13:08,399 --> 02:13:12,479
like the assumption is that you're the

3632
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:15,039
center of the universe

3633
02:13:12,479 --> 02:13:18,559
and you shouldn't assume that and the

3634
02:13:15,039 --> 02:13:21,760
way to talk yourself out of it he says

3635
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:24,079
is to recognize the possibility that

3636
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:24,960
maybe that wasn't an action directed at

3637
02:13:24,078 --> 02:13:26,799
you

3638
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:30,000
like maybe that guy

3639
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:32,320
is racing to the hospital you know to

3640
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,599
take care of his dying

3641
02:13:32,319 --> 02:13:36,078
spouse

3642
02:13:33,599 --> 02:13:38,239
who's been there suffering you know from

3643
02:13:36,078 --> 02:13:40,559
cancer or maybe

3644
02:13:38,238 --> 02:13:43,919
he's you know on the way to pick up a

3645
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:46,480
sick child or maybe he's and it's not an

3646
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:48,000
action director that was your assumption

3647
02:13:46,479 --> 02:13:49,118
not something that was inherent in the

3648
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,800
situation

3649
02:13:49,118 --> 02:13:52,479
and i think there's something

3650
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:54,800
interesting about that i think there's

3651
02:13:52,479 --> 02:13:56,559
something right about that

3652
02:13:54,800 --> 02:14:00,800
at the same time

3653
02:13:56,560 --> 02:14:04,000
i don't think he speaks as if

3654
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:05,520
we can just spin out these stories and

3655
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,800
whether they're true or not doesn't

3656
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:09,199
matter

3657
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:11,760
what matters is that they free us from

3658
02:14:09,198 --> 02:14:13,359
this assumption yes and i think they

3659
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:15,360
only free us from this assumption if

3660
02:14:13,359 --> 02:14:17,759
they're true

3661
02:14:15,359 --> 02:14:19,198
like sometimes the guy really did direct

3662
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,039
it at you and that's part of the

3663
02:14:19,198 --> 02:14:23,198
situation and like you can't pretend

3664
02:14:21,039 --> 02:14:24,319
that it's not part of the situation you

3665
02:14:23,198 --> 02:14:25,759
have to find the right way of dealing

3666
02:14:24,319 --> 02:14:26,719
with that situation so you have to

3667
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:29,039
listen

3668
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:30,880
to what's actually happening

3669
02:14:29,039 --> 02:14:33,599
and then you have to figure out how to

3670
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:35,520
make it right and i think he's he thinks

3671
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:37,039
that we have too much freedom he thinks

3672
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:38,320
that you don't have to listen to the

3673
02:14:37,039 --> 02:14:39,519
situation you can just tell whatever

3674
02:14:38,319 --> 02:14:40,719
story you like

3675
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:43,679
about it

3676
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:45,520
and i think that's actually too tough

3677
02:14:43,679 --> 02:14:46,560
i don't think we have that kind of

3678
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:48,560
freedom

3679
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:51,119
and he and he writes these sort of

3680
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:52,639
incredibly moving letters when he's

3681
02:14:51,118 --> 02:14:55,198
trying to write the pale king which is

3682
02:14:52,639 --> 02:14:56,000
the end of which is the unfinished novel

3683
02:14:55,198 --> 02:14:58,238
that

3684
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,479
really sort of drove him to distraction

3685
02:14:58,238 --> 02:15:01,919
at the center of the novel is this

3686
02:15:00,479 --> 02:15:02,718
character

3687
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:04,000
who

3688
02:15:02,719 --> 02:15:05,439
one of the characters at the center of

3689
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:09,439
the novel is a guy

3690
02:15:05,439 --> 02:15:12,879
who's doing the most boring thing you

3691
02:15:09,439 --> 02:15:14,000
could possibly imagine he is an irs tax

3692
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:16,239
examiner

3693
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,520
he's going over other people's tax

3694
02:15:16,238 --> 02:15:19,359
returns

3695
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:21,360
trying to figure out whether they follow

3696
02:15:19,359 --> 02:15:23,118
the rules or not

3697
02:15:21,359 --> 02:15:26,799
and like just the idea of doing that for

3698
02:15:23,118 --> 02:15:29,198
eight hours a day is just terrifying

3699
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:32,719
and and he puts this guy

3700
02:15:29,198 --> 02:15:35,359
in a enormous warehouse that extends for

3701
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:38,639
miles where person after person after

3702
02:15:35,359 --> 02:15:40,960
person is in rows of desks

3703
02:15:38,639 --> 02:15:42,319
sort of nameless each of them doing this

3704
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:45,679
task

3705
02:15:42,319 --> 02:15:48,000
so he's in nowhere doing nothing

3706
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:50,239
and it's got to be intensely boring and

3707
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:53,198
now the main character's trying to

3708
02:15:50,238 --> 02:15:54,799
trying to teach himself to do that

3709
02:15:53,198 --> 02:15:56,319
and the question is how do you put up

3710
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:59,199
with the boredom

3711
02:15:56,319 --> 02:16:00,880
how do you put up with this onslaught of

3712
02:15:59,198 --> 02:16:02,960
meaninglessness

3713
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:05,760
and the main character

3714
02:16:02,960 --> 02:16:07,439
is able to confront that

3715
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:08,960
condition

3716
02:16:07,439 --> 02:16:10,719
with such

3717
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:13,198
bliss

3718
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:15,359
that he literally levitates from

3719
02:16:13,198 --> 02:16:18,238
happiness while he's going over other

3720
02:16:15,359 --> 02:16:20,158
people's tax returns and i i that's

3721
02:16:18,238 --> 02:16:21,919
that's my metaphor for what i think

3722
02:16:20,158 --> 02:16:24,078
wallace must have imagined we have to

3723
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:26,078
try to aspire to

3724
02:16:24,078 --> 02:16:28,000
and i think that's unlivable i think

3725
02:16:26,078 --> 02:16:29,599
that's not i think that's not an

3726
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,599
ambition that we could achieve i think

3727
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:33,599
there's something else we could achieve

3728
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:35,280
and the other thing that that we can

3729
02:16:33,599 --> 02:16:38,159
achieve that i think is

3730
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:40,719
is a is something that he also is on to

3731
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:41,920
but doesn't write about as often

3732
02:16:40,718 --> 02:16:45,518
is

3733
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:48,159
something more like achieving

3734
02:16:45,519 --> 02:16:50,639
peak moments of significance in a

3735
02:16:48,159 --> 02:16:52,799
situation when something great happens

3736
02:16:50,638 --> 02:16:55,598
and he writes about this in an article

3737
02:16:52,799 --> 02:16:58,318
about roger federer he he loved tennis

3738
02:16:55,599 --> 02:17:00,000
are you a tennis lover i'm not a lover

3739
02:16:58,318 --> 02:17:03,840
of tennis but i played tennis for 15

3740
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:05,920
years and so on i don't love it the way

3741
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:08,398
people love baseball for example i see

3742
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:10,478
the beauty in it the artistry i just

3743
02:17:08,398 --> 02:17:12,799
liked it as a sport good okay well i

3744
02:17:10,478 --> 02:17:14,398
didn't play much tennis but i hit a ball

3745
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:16,159
around every once in a while as a kid

3746
02:17:14,398 --> 02:17:17,358
and i always thought it was boring to

3747
02:17:16,159 --> 02:17:19,760
watch

3748
02:17:17,359 --> 02:17:21,439
but reading reading david foster wallace

3749
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:23,200
on roger federer you're like wow i've

3750
02:17:21,439 --> 02:17:24,639
been missing

3751
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:26,559
and the article which appeared in the

3752
02:17:24,638 --> 02:17:29,438
new york times magazine was called roger

3753
02:17:26,558 --> 02:17:30,718
federer as religious experience oh wow

3754
02:17:29,439 --> 02:17:32,639
there you go

3755
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:34,879
and he says look there's something

3756
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:37,039
astonishing about

3757
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:37,759
watching someone who's got a body like

3758
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:40,399
us

3759
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:44,159
and having a body is a limitation

3760
02:17:40,398 --> 02:17:47,519
it's like the sight of sores and pains

3761
02:17:44,159 --> 02:17:50,478
and agony and exhaustion and it's this

3762
02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:52,639
it's the thing that dies in the end

3763
02:17:50,478 --> 02:17:53,760
uh and so it's it's what we have to

3764
02:17:52,638 --> 02:17:55,679
confront

3765
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:57,280
i mean there's also joys that go along

3766
02:17:55,679 --> 02:17:58,799
with having a body like if you didn't

3767
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:00,800
have a body there'd be no sex if you

3768
02:17:58,799 --> 02:18:01,920
didn't have a body there'd be no sort of

3769
02:18:00,799 --> 02:18:04,959
physical

3770
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:07,040
excitement and so on but uh but somehow

3771
02:18:04,959 --> 02:18:09,039
having a body is essentially a

3772
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:11,359
limitation

3773
02:18:09,040 --> 02:18:13,679
that when you watch someone who's got

3774
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:14,719
one and is extraordinary at the way they

3775
02:18:13,679 --> 02:18:17,280
use it

3776
02:18:14,718 --> 02:18:20,239
you can recognize how that limitation

3777
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:22,239
can be to some degree transcended

3778
02:18:20,239 --> 02:18:24,879
and that that's what we can get when we

3779
02:18:22,239 --> 02:18:27,359
watch federer or some other great

3780
02:18:24,879 --> 02:18:29,598
athlete sort of doing these things that

3781
02:18:27,359 --> 02:18:30,800
transcend the limitations of their

3782
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:33,200
bodies

3783
02:18:30,799 --> 02:18:36,239
and that that's the kind of peak

3784
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:38,159
experience that we're capable of that

3785
02:18:36,239 --> 02:18:39,920
could be a kind of salvation that's a

3786
02:18:38,159 --> 02:18:42,638
very different story

3787
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:43,519
and i think that's a livable story and i

3788
02:18:42,638 --> 02:18:45,279
and i

3789
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:47,439
don't know if it would have saved him

3790
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:50,239
but i feel like i wish

3791
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:52,000
he developed that that side of the story

3792
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:53,760
more can we talk about and first of all

3793
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,959
let me just comment that i deeply

3794
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,398
appreciate

3795
02:18:54,959 --> 02:18:59,039
that you said

3796
02:18:56,398 --> 02:19:00,799
uh you were going to say something that

3797
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:02,319
the fact that you're listening to me is

3798
02:19:00,799 --> 02:19:05,119
is amazing like that you care about

3799
02:19:02,318 --> 02:19:07,119
other humans i i really appreciate that

3800
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:09,040
um we should be in this way listening to

3801
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:11,439
the world so um

3802
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:13,120
there's there's that's a meta comment

3803
02:19:11,439 --> 02:19:15,280
about many of the things we're talking

3804
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:18,160
about but you mentioned something about

3805
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:19,439
levitating and a task that is infinitely

3806
02:19:18,159 --> 02:19:22,318
boring

3807
02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:25,359
and contrasting that with

3808
02:19:22,318 --> 02:19:28,959
essentially levitating on a task that is

3809
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:29,840
great like uh the highest achievement of

3810
02:19:28,959 --> 02:19:32,318
uh

3811
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:35,120
this physical limiting body in playing

3812
02:19:32,318 --> 02:19:37,760
tennis now i often say this i don't know

3813
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:40,240
where i heard david foster wallace say

3814
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:41,920
this but he said that the key to life is

3815
02:19:40,239 --> 02:19:43,840
to be unborable

3816
02:19:41,920 --> 02:19:46,398
that is the embodiment of this

3817
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:49,359
philosophy and i when

3818
02:19:46,398 --> 02:19:51,039
people ask me for advice like

3819
02:19:49,359 --> 02:19:52,079
young students you know i don't find

3820
02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:53,840
this interesting i don't find this

3821
02:19:52,079 --> 02:19:55,120
interesting how do i find the thing i'm

3822
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:56,880
passionate for

3823
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:59,120
uh this would be very interesting to

3824
02:19:56,879 --> 02:20:02,000
explore because you kind of say that

3825
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:04,319
that may not be a realizable

3826
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:07,280
thing to do which is to be unborable but

3827
02:20:04,318 --> 02:20:08,478
my advice usually is life is amazing

3828
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:10,800
like

3829
02:20:08,478 --> 02:20:13,279
you should be able to you should strive

3830
02:20:10,799 --> 02:20:17,199
to discover the joy

3831
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:20,159
the levitation in everything

3832
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:22,159
and uh the thing you get stuck on for a

3833
02:20:20,159 --> 02:20:24,799
longer period of time that might be the

3834
02:20:22,159 --> 02:20:27,200
thing you should stick to but everything

3835
02:20:24,799 --> 02:20:29,279
should be full of joy so that kind of

3836
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:30,800
cynicism of saying

3837
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:31,920
life is uh

3838
02:20:30,799 --> 02:20:33,840
boring

3839
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:35,600
is a thing that will prevent you from

3840
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:38,159
discovering the thing

3841
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:40,159
that will give you deep meaning and joy

3842
02:20:38,159 --> 02:20:42,079
but you're saying

3843
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:44,398
being unborable

3844
02:20:42,079 --> 02:20:47,280
is not actionable

3845
02:20:44,398 --> 02:20:50,000
for a human being so okay excellent

3846
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:52,319
question deep question and and

3847
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:55,040
the um you might think

3848
02:20:52,318 --> 02:20:57,439
because of the title of that of the book

3849
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:59,070
that bert and i wrote all things shining

3850
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:01,200
that i think all things are shining

3851
02:20:59,069 --> 02:21:03,520
[Laughter]

3852
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:06,880
and but actually

3853
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:09,280
i think it's an unachievable goal to be

3854
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:10,239
unborable i i do believe that you're

3855
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:13,280
right

3856
02:21:10,239 --> 02:21:14,719
that a lot of times when people are

3857
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:16,399
bored with something it's because they

3858
02:21:14,719 --> 02:21:19,279
haven't tried hard enough

3859
02:21:16,398 --> 02:21:21,358
and i do think quite a lot of what

3860
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:22,720
makes people bored with something is

3861
02:21:21,359 --> 02:21:23,760
that they haven't paid attention well

3862
02:21:22,719 --> 02:21:25,920
enough

3863
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:27,040
and that they haven't listened as as you

3864
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:29,840
were saying

3865
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:32,240
um so i i do think there's something to

3866
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:33,600
that i think that's a deep insight

3867
02:21:32,239 --> 02:21:34,478
on the other hand

3868
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:37,280
the

3869
02:21:34,478 --> 02:21:38,799
perfection of that insight is that

3870
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:42,159
nothing

3871
02:21:38,799 --> 02:21:45,599
is ever anything less than joyful

3872
02:21:42,159 --> 02:21:48,959
and i actually think that dostoevsky and

3873
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:50,720
melville both agree but in very

3874
02:21:48,959 --> 02:21:52,159
different ways

3875
02:21:50,719 --> 02:21:54,799
that

3876
02:21:52,159 --> 02:21:56,719
life involves a wide range

3877
02:21:54,799 --> 02:21:59,519
of moods

3878
02:21:56,719 --> 02:22:02,318
and that all of them are important

3879
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:04,239
it involves grief like i think

3880
02:22:02,318 --> 02:22:05,279
when someone dies it's appropriate to

3881
02:22:04,239 --> 02:22:06,318
grieve

3882
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:09,520
and

3883
02:22:06,318 --> 02:22:12,639
it's not in the first instance joyful

3884
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:15,200
it's related to joy because it makes the

3885
02:22:12,639 --> 02:22:17,119
joys you feel when you feel them

3886
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:20,159
more intense

3887
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:21,439
but it makes them more intense by

3888
02:22:20,159 --> 02:22:23,760
putting you in the position of

3889
02:22:21,439 --> 02:22:26,000
experiencing the opposite

3890
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:28,398
and it's only because

3891
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:31,600
we're capable of a wide range of

3892
02:22:28,398 --> 02:22:34,159
passionate responses to situations

3893
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:37,600
that i think the significances can be as

3894
02:22:34,159 --> 02:22:40,000
meaningful as they are so melville again

3895
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:40,800
has this has this sort of interest i

3896
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,680
mean

3897
02:22:40,799 --> 02:22:45,920
let's just say the guilt and the grief

3898
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:49,120
in in the brothers karamazov alyosha

3899
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:51,439
loses his mentor father zasima he's

3900
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:52,399
grieving it's super important that he's

3901
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:54,479
grieving

3902
02:22:52,398 --> 02:22:57,279
he has a religious conversion on the

3903
02:22:54,478 --> 02:22:59,760
basis of grieving where he sees the sort

3904
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:02,239
of deep sort of beauty of everything

3905
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:04,880
that is but it comes through the grief

3906
02:23:02,239 --> 02:23:07,359
not by avoiding the grief uh and and

3907
02:23:04,879 --> 02:23:09,438
melville says something like ishmael

3908
02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:11,920
says something like he says i'm like a

3909
02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:15,200
catskill mountain eagle the catskills

3910
02:23:11,920 --> 02:23:18,318
mountains nearby he says who's sort of

3911
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:20,560
flying high above the earth going over

3912
02:23:18,318 --> 02:23:22,879
the peaks and down into the valleys i

3913
02:23:20,559 --> 02:23:25,600
have these ups and these downs

3914
02:23:22,879 --> 02:23:27,679
but they're all invested with a kind of

3915
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:30,079
significance they all happen at an

3916
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:31,680
enormously high height because it's

3917
02:23:30,079 --> 02:23:33,600
through the mountains that i'm flying

3918
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:34,880
and even when i'm down it's a way of

3919
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:37,200
being up

3920
02:23:34,879 --> 02:23:38,559
but it's really down

3921
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:40,720
it's just that it's a way of being up

3922
02:23:38,559 --> 02:23:43,039
because it makes the ups even upper

3923
02:23:40,719 --> 02:23:46,559
well i guess then the perfectionism of

3924
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:49,520
that can be destructive

3925
02:23:46,559 --> 02:23:52,159
i mean i i tend to uh see for example

3926
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:55,920
grief a loss

3927
02:23:52,159 --> 02:23:58,639
of love as part of love in that it's a

3928
02:23:55,920 --> 02:24:02,159
celebration of the richness of feelings

3929
02:23:58,639 --> 02:24:03,599
you had when you had the love so it's

3930
02:24:02,159 --> 02:24:05,680
like it's all part of the same

3931
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:07,920
experience but if you turn it into an

3932
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:10,318
optimization problem where everything

3933
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:13,359
can be unboreable then that can in

3934
02:24:10,318 --> 02:24:15,680
itself be destructive yeah yeah

3935
02:24:13,359 --> 02:24:18,640
i heard this interview with david foster

3936
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:20,318
wallace on the internet

3937
02:24:18,639 --> 02:24:22,318
where it's uh it's a video of him and

3938
02:24:20,318 --> 02:24:24,318
there is like a a foreign sounding

3939
02:24:22,318 --> 02:24:25,439
reporter asking him questions i think

3940
02:24:24,318 --> 02:24:26,879
she's

3941
02:24:25,439 --> 02:24:28,720
uh there's an accent of some sort of

3942
02:24:26,879 --> 02:24:31,039
german i think something like that

3943
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:33,358
and i don't know it just i painted a

3944
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:34,800
picture such a human person we were

3945
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:37,200
talking about listening

3946
02:24:34,799 --> 02:24:39,759
the interviewer if i may say

3947
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:41,200
uh wasn't a very good one in the

3948
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:42,478
beginning

3949
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:44,079
so she

3950
02:24:42,478 --> 02:24:45,760
kind of walked in doing the usual

3951
02:24:44,079 --> 02:24:47,520
journalistic things of just kind of

3952
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:49,040
generic questions and

3953
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:51,040
and just kind of

3954
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:53,600
asking very basic questions but he

3955
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:56,240
brought out something in her over time

3956
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:58,159
and he was so sensitive and so sensitive

3957
02:24:56,239 --> 02:25:00,000
to her and also

3958
02:24:58,159 --> 02:25:01,920
sensitive to being

3959
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,600
a thinking and acting human in this

3960
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:05,600
world that's just painted such a

3961
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:06,960
beautiful picture that people should go

3962
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:08,640
definitely check out

3963
02:25:06,959 --> 02:25:10,719
they made me really sad that we don't

3964
02:25:08,639 --> 02:25:13,680
get this kind of picture

3965
02:25:10,719 --> 02:25:15,519
um of of other thinkers

3966
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:18,720
all of the ones we've been talking about

3967
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:20,640
just that almost this little accidental

3968
02:25:18,719 --> 02:25:22,639
view of this human being

3969
02:25:20,639 --> 02:25:24,639
i don't know it was a beautiful one and

3970
02:25:22,639 --> 02:25:28,478
i guess there's not many like that even

3971
02:25:24,639 --> 02:25:29,519
of uh him yeah yeah no i think he was

3972
02:25:28,478 --> 02:25:31,438
more

3973
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:33,840
than his

3974
02:25:31,439 --> 02:25:35,520
writing ability which was extraordinary

3975
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:37,359
he had developed a style that was i

3976
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:38,720
think unlike you know anyone else's

3977
02:25:37,359 --> 02:25:40,960
style and

3978
02:25:38,719 --> 02:25:42,559
it was his

3979
02:25:40,959 --> 02:25:45,039
sensitivity

3980
02:25:42,559 --> 02:25:48,079
to other people and to

3981
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:50,399
sort of what he was there to pay

3982
02:25:48,079 --> 02:25:53,120
attention to

3983
02:25:50,398 --> 02:25:55,760
he wants in one of his um

3984
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:58,000
essays i think it's the one called an

3985
02:25:55,760 --> 02:26:00,559
incredibly fun thing i'll never do again

3986
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:02,559
do you know that one about cruise ships

3987
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:05,119
i think he describes himself as this

3988
02:26:02,559 --> 02:26:06,719
sort of roving eyeball that just sort of

3989
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:08,399
walks around the

3990
02:26:06,719 --> 02:26:10,000
walks around the ship

3991
02:26:08,398 --> 02:26:12,959
noticing things

3992
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:16,079
and he's incredibly good at that

3993
02:26:12,959 --> 02:26:18,318
but i also do but i also worry

3994
02:26:16,079 --> 02:26:19,920
that that reflects something that you

3995
02:26:18,318 --> 02:26:21,279
find in ivan in in the brothers

3996
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:22,799
karamazov

3997
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:23,680
ivan i don't know if you remember this

3998
02:26:22,799 --> 02:26:26,159
part

3999
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:28,880
when he's away at school as a young

4000
02:26:26,159 --> 02:26:30,000
ecologist as a young boy he makes money

4001
02:26:28,879 --> 02:26:32,799
by

4002
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:34,959
going around town

4003
02:26:32,799 --> 02:26:36,879
to where tragic events have occurred

4004
02:26:34,959 --> 02:26:38,398
someone just got run over by a carriage

4005
02:26:36,879 --> 02:26:39,438
or someone you know something just

4006
02:26:38,398 --> 02:26:40,639
happened

4007
02:26:39,439 --> 02:26:42,398
and

4008
02:26:40,639 --> 02:26:44,398
being the first one there

4009
02:26:42,398 --> 02:26:46,239
he always knows somehow where these

4010
02:26:44,398 --> 02:26:47,439
things are going to happen and writing

4011
02:26:46,239 --> 02:26:49,680
about it

4012
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:52,880
giving this really good description

4013
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:53,920
and then signing it eyewitness

4014
02:26:52,879 --> 02:26:56,318
and

4015
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:59,200
it's as if

4016
02:26:56,318 --> 02:27:01,359
ivan's understanding of his life is that

4017
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:03,600
he was supposed to be a witness

4018
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:05,680
to it he was supposed to see others but

4019
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:07,840
not get involved

4020
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:09,600
he never is interested in trying to keep

4021
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:11,359
the bad things from happening he just

4022
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:12,239
wants to report on them when he sees

4023
02:27:11,359 --> 02:27:14,318
them

4024
02:27:12,239 --> 02:27:17,439
and i think that he's an incredibly

4025
02:27:14,318 --> 02:27:19,199
isolated person character and it's his

4026
02:27:17,439 --> 02:27:20,159
isolation

4027
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:23,200
from

4028
02:27:20,159 --> 02:27:25,520
others from the love of others and his

4029
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:28,159
inability his desire not

4030
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:29,439
to love others because that attaches him

4031
02:27:28,159 --> 02:27:31,760
to someone

4032
02:27:29,439 --> 02:27:32,800
that i think is really at the ground of

4033
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:34,079
his

4034
02:27:32,799 --> 02:27:37,279
condition

4035
02:27:34,079 --> 02:27:39,280
and and i think that aim to be isolated

4036
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:40,720
which many people have nowadays i mean

4037
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:43,120
you see it in the underground man too

4038
02:27:40,719 --> 02:27:45,599
just sort of taking yourself out of the

4039
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:47,280
world because

4040
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:49,520
you don't want to have to take

4041
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:50,640
responsibility for being involved with

4042
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:53,280
others

4043
02:27:50,639 --> 02:27:55,760
i think that's a bad move and and i and

4044
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:57,280
i do worry that maybe i mean i never

4045
02:27:55,760 --> 02:28:00,559
knew david foster wallace i have no

4046
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:04,239
right to to comment you know on on his

4047
02:28:00,559 --> 02:28:05,039
life but he portrays um himself in that

4048
02:28:04,239 --> 02:28:07,520
one

4049
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:09,359
episode as a person who who does that

4050
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:10,720
and i think that's dangerous yeah

4051
02:28:09,359 --> 02:28:12,239
there's some sense in which being

4052
02:28:10,719 --> 02:28:14,478
sensitive to the world like i find

4053
02:28:12,239 --> 02:28:16,559
myself the the source of joy for me is

4054
02:28:14,478 --> 02:28:18,959
just being really sensitive to the world

4055
02:28:16,559 --> 02:28:21,279
to to experience

4056
02:28:18,959 --> 02:28:23,199
there's some way it's quite brilliant

4057
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:25,840
where you're saying that

4058
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:27,920
that could be isolating it's like darwin

4059
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:28,639
studying

4060
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:30,960
uh

4061
02:28:28,639 --> 02:28:32,639
a new kind of species on an island you

4062
02:28:30,959 --> 02:28:34,079
don't want to interfere with it you find

4063
02:28:32,639 --> 02:28:36,719
it so beautiful that you don't want to

4064
02:28:34,079 --> 02:28:38,559
interfere with this beauty

4065
02:28:36,719 --> 02:28:40,478
so

4066
02:28:38,559 --> 02:28:42,879
there is some sense in which that

4067
02:28:40,478 --> 02:28:44,478
isolates you and then you find yourself

4068
02:28:42,879 --> 02:28:47,039
deeply alone

4069
02:28:44,478 --> 02:28:49,039
yeah uh away from the experiences that

4070
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:51,120
bring you joy yeah

4071
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:52,319
and that could be destructive it's it's

4072
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:54,319
um

4073
02:28:52,318 --> 02:28:56,000
that's fascinating how that uh that

4074
02:28:54,318 --> 02:28:58,799
works and in his case

4075
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:01,439
of course some of it is um

4076
02:28:58,799 --> 02:29:03,358
just chemical chemicals in his brain but

4077
02:29:01,439 --> 02:29:04,880
some of it is the

4078
02:29:03,359 --> 02:29:08,880
the the path

4079
02:29:04,879 --> 02:29:10,959
his uh philosophy of life let him down

4080
02:29:08,879 --> 02:29:13,839
and that's the danger we need you too

4081
02:29:10,959 --> 02:29:15,919
and gazing into the abyss

4082
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:18,318
that you can um

4083
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:20,159
your job is a difficult one because uh

4084
02:29:18,318 --> 02:29:22,719
doing philosophy

4085
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:23,520
changes you yeah

4086
02:29:22,719 --> 02:29:26,639
and

4087
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:28,720
you may not uh know how it changes you

4088
02:29:26,639 --> 02:29:31,119
until you you're changed and you look in

4089
02:29:28,719 --> 02:29:31,119
the mirror

4090
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:36,879
you wrote a piece

4091
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:39,200
in mit tech review saying that ai can't

4092
02:29:36,879 --> 02:29:42,879
be an artist

4093
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:44,319
creativity is and always will be a human

4094
02:29:42,879 --> 02:29:46,159
endeavor

4095
02:29:44,318 --> 02:29:48,719
you mentioned burt and criticism of

4096
02:29:46,159 --> 02:29:50,478
symbolic ai

4097
02:29:48,719 --> 02:29:53,679
can you explain your view

4098
02:29:50,478 --> 02:29:57,519
of criticizing the possible the capacity

4099
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:59,200
for artistry and creativity in uh our

4100
02:29:57,520 --> 02:30:02,640
robot friends

4101
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:02,640
uh yeah i can try

4102
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:06,559
so

4103
02:30:04,398 --> 02:30:09,920
to make the argument

4104
02:30:06,559 --> 02:30:12,478
you have to have in mind

4105
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:15,439
what counts as

4106
02:30:12,478 --> 02:30:17,039
art what counts as a creative artistic

4107
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:19,040
act

4108
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:21,439
i take it that

4109
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:23,359
just doing something new

4110
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:26,639
isn't sufficient

4111
02:30:23,359 --> 02:30:28,640
i mean we say that good art is original

4112
02:30:26,639 --> 02:30:31,199
but not everything that's never been

4113
02:30:28,639 --> 02:30:33,439
done before is good art

4114
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:34,479
so there has to be more than just doing

4115
02:30:33,439 --> 02:30:35,840
something

4116
02:30:34,478 --> 02:30:37,279
new

4117
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:39,920
it has to be

4118
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:42,319
somehow doing something new in a way

4119
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:45,280
that speaks to

4120
02:30:42,318 --> 02:30:47,760
the audience or speaks to

4121
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:50,079
some portion of the audience at least it

4122
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:52,000
has to be doing something new

4123
02:30:50,079 --> 02:30:52,799
in such a way

4124
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:56,559
that

4125
02:30:52,799 --> 02:30:58,639
some people who see or interact with it

4126
02:30:56,559 --> 02:31:02,398
can see themselves anew

4127
02:30:58,639 --> 02:31:05,119
in it so i think that art is inherently

4128
02:31:02,398 --> 02:31:08,639
a creative act it it i'm sorry

4129
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:11,200
a kind of um communicative act

4130
02:31:08,639 --> 02:31:12,079
that it it involves a relation with

4131
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:13,359
other

4132
02:31:12,079 --> 02:31:15,039
people

4133
02:31:13,359 --> 02:31:17,359
so

4134
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:18,640
think about the conditions for that

4135
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:21,280
working

4136
02:31:18,639 --> 02:31:22,879
someone i talk in that article

4137
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:24,079
i can't remember something about new

4138
02:31:22,879 --> 02:31:26,879
music i think i don't talk about

4139
02:31:24,079 --> 02:31:29,520
stravinsky but let's say stravinsky

4140
02:31:26,879 --> 02:31:31,759
um stravinsky

4141
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:34,640
you know performs the right of spring

4142
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:35,680
and there's riots

4143
02:31:34,639 --> 02:31:37,760
it is

4144
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:39,439
new

4145
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:42,398
and people hate it

4146
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:45,200
people can't sounds like a cacophony it

4147
02:31:42,398 --> 02:31:47,119
sounds awful it's it's written according

4148
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:48,640
to principles that are not like the

4149
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:50,800
principles of music composition that

4150
02:31:48,639 --> 02:31:52,478
people are familiar with

4151
02:31:50,799 --> 02:31:54,799
so in some ways it's a failed

4152
02:31:52,478 --> 02:31:57,438
communicative act

4153
02:31:54,799 --> 02:32:00,639
but as as nietzsche says about his own

4154
02:31:57,439 --> 02:32:02,239
stuff i mean we now can recognize that

4155
02:32:00,639 --> 02:32:05,199
it wasn't it wasn't a failed

4156
02:32:02,239 --> 02:32:08,398
communicative act it just it just hadn't

4157
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:10,479
reached its time yet

4158
02:32:08,398 --> 02:32:12,879
and and now

4159
02:32:10,478 --> 02:32:16,079
that way of composing music is like you

4160
02:32:12,879 --> 02:32:19,199
know it's in disney movies you know it's

4161
02:32:16,079 --> 02:32:21,280
so part of our musical palette

4162
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:24,319
that we don't we don't have that

4163
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:26,079
response it changed us it changed the

4164
02:32:24,318 --> 02:32:27,359
way we understand what counts as good

4165
02:32:26,079 --> 02:32:29,760
music

4166
02:32:27,359 --> 02:32:33,280
so that's a deep communicative act it

4167
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:35,920
didn't perform its communication

4168
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:39,439
in that opening moment

4169
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:41,280
but it did ultimately establish a new

4170
02:32:39,439 --> 02:32:42,960
understanding for all of us of what

4171
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:43,760
counts as good art and that's the kind

4172
02:32:42,959 --> 02:32:46,318
of

4173
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:48,079
deep communication that i think good art

4174
02:32:46,318 --> 02:32:49,920
can can do it can change our

4175
02:32:48,079 --> 02:32:50,840
understanding

4176
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:53,600
of

4177
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:55,760
ourselves and of what a good

4178
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:57,439
manifestation of something of ourselves

4179
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:59,200
in a certain domain is

4180
02:32:57,439 --> 02:33:01,439
and he used the term

4181
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:04,319
socially embedded that art is

4182
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:07,359
fundamentally socially embedded yeah and

4183
02:33:04,318 --> 02:33:09,279
i really like that term because um

4184
02:33:07,359 --> 02:33:11,280
i see like my love for artificial

4185
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:13,600
intelligence and the kind of system that

4186
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:16,399
we can bring to the world that could

4187
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:18,880
uh make for an interesting and more

4188
02:33:16,398 --> 02:33:21,840
lively world and one that enriches human

4189
02:33:18,879 --> 02:33:25,279
beings is one where the ai systems are

4190
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:27,600
deeply socially embedded good yeah so so

4191
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:29,040
that and that actually is in contrast to

4192
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:30,640
the way

4193
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:32,319
artificial intelligence have been talked

4194
02:33:30,639 --> 02:33:34,239
about throughout its history and

4195
02:33:32,318 --> 02:33:35,920
certainly now both on the robotic side

4196
02:33:34,239 --> 02:33:38,079
and the ai side

4197
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:39,760
it's especially on the uh the tech

4198
02:33:38,079 --> 02:33:42,318
sector with

4199
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:44,639
the businesses around ai they kind of

4200
02:33:42,318 --> 02:33:48,318
want to create um

4201
02:33:44,639 --> 02:33:50,879
systems that are like servants to humans

4202
02:33:48,318 --> 02:33:53,519
and then humans do all the beautiful

4203
02:33:50,879 --> 02:33:55,358
human messiness of

4204
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:57,120
where art would be part

4205
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:59,200
i i think that

4206
02:33:57,120 --> 02:34:01,439
there is no reason why you can't

4207
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:03,760
integrate ai systems

4208
02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:06,079
in the way you integrate new humans to

4209
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:08,639
the picture they're just the full

4210
02:34:06,079 --> 02:34:10,879
diversity and the flaws all of that

4211
02:34:08,639 --> 02:34:14,079
adds to the thing yeah

4212
02:34:10,879 --> 02:34:17,119
like you know some people might say

4213
02:34:14,079 --> 02:34:20,639
that alpha zero is this uh system from

4214
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:21,840
deep mind that was able to achieve

4215
02:34:20,639 --> 02:34:23,439
uh

4216
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:25,680
you know solve the game it beat the best

4217
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:27,840
people in the world at the game of go

4218
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:29,760
with no supervision from humans

4219
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:32,559
but more interestingly to me on the side

4220
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:34,239
of creativity it was able to surprise a

4221
02:34:32,559 --> 02:34:36,398
lot of grand masters

4222
02:34:34,239 --> 02:34:39,039
with the kind of moves they came up with

4223
02:34:36,398 --> 02:34:41,680
now to me that's not

4224
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:43,520
the creativity the magic that's socially

4225
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:46,000
embedded that we're talking about that

4226
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:49,200
is merely um

4227
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,639
revealing the limitations of humans to

4228
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:53,359
discover

4229
02:34:50,639 --> 02:34:55,840
it's it's like uh to solve a particular

4230
02:34:53,359 --> 02:34:59,280
aspect of a math problem

4231
02:34:55,840 --> 02:35:01,520
i think creativity is

4232
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:03,680
not just um

4233
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:05,840
not just even socially embedded it's the

4234
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:08,800
way you're saying is it's part of the

4235
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:11,359
communicative act it's the interactive

4236
02:35:08,799 --> 02:35:15,119
it's the dance with the culture and so

4237
02:35:11,359 --> 02:35:18,079
it has to be like for alpha zero

4238
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:20,319
to be creative truly creative it would

4239
02:35:18,079 --> 02:35:22,159
have to be integrated in a way where it

4240
02:35:20,318 --> 02:35:25,199
has a twitter account

4241
02:35:22,159 --> 02:35:27,119
and it becomes aware

4242
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:30,000
of the impact it has on the other grand

4243
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:31,120
masters with the moves that's coming up

4244
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,318
and

4245
02:35:31,120 --> 02:35:34,319
one of the fascinating things about

4246
02:35:32,318 --> 02:35:36,959
alpha zero

4247
02:35:34,318 --> 02:35:38,318
which i just love so much

4248
02:35:36,959 --> 02:35:41,839
is uh i don't know if you're familiar

4249
02:35:38,318 --> 02:35:44,079
with chess i am yeah okay so the

4250
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:46,079
it does certain things that most chess

4251
02:35:44,079 --> 02:35:48,719
players even at the highest level

4252
02:35:46,079 --> 02:35:51,120
uh don't do which is it sacrifices

4253
02:35:48,719 --> 02:35:52,719
pieces it gives pieces away and then

4254
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:55,680
waits like

4255
02:35:52,719 --> 02:35:58,879
10 moves before it pays you back so it

4256
02:35:55,680 --> 02:36:01,200
does to me that's beautiful that that's

4257
02:35:58,879 --> 02:36:03,839
crazy that's art if only alpha 0

4258
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:04,720
understood the artistry of that which is

4259
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:06,000
uh

4260
02:36:04,719 --> 02:36:08,559
i'm going to mess with you

4261
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,840
psychologically because i'm going to do

4262
02:36:08,559 --> 02:36:11,359
two things

4263
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:13,520
one make you

4264
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:16,239
feel overconfident that you're doing

4265
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:18,159
well but actually also once you realize

4266
02:36:16,239 --> 02:36:20,398
you are playing alpha zero that is much

4267
02:36:18,159 --> 02:36:22,639
better than you you're going to feel

4268
02:36:20,398 --> 02:36:24,639
really nervous about what's on the like

4269
02:36:22,639 --> 02:36:25,439
is this is the calm before the storm and

4270
02:36:24,639 --> 02:36:28,000
that's

4271
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:30,398
that creates a beautiful psychological

4272
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:31,840
masterpiece of this chess game if only

4273
02:36:30,398 --> 02:36:32,799
alpha zero is

4274
02:36:31,840 --> 02:36:34,880
then

4275
02:36:32,799 --> 02:36:37,199
messing with you additionally to that

4276
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:39,759
like and be was cognizant of this doing

4277
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:42,720
that then it becomes art and then it's

4278
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:44,318
integrated into society in that way

4279
02:36:42,719 --> 02:36:45,679
and i believe it doesn't have to

4280
02:36:44,318 --> 02:36:47,439
actually have

4281
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:51,120
an understanding

4282
02:36:47,439 --> 02:36:52,800
of uh the world in the way that humans

4283
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:55,920
have it can have a different one it can

4284
02:36:52,799 --> 02:36:58,398
be like a child is as clueless about so

4285
02:36:55,920 --> 02:37:00,799
many aspects of the world and it's okay

4286
02:36:58,398 --> 02:37:03,119
and that's part of the magic of it just

4287
02:37:00,799 --> 02:37:04,719
being flawed being

4288
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:07,280
lacking understanding all interesting

4289
02:37:04,719 --> 02:37:09,760
kinds of ways but interacting and so to

4290
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:11,359
me it's it's possible to create art for

4291
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:13,840
ai but

4292
02:37:11,359 --> 02:37:16,239
exactly as you're saying in a

4293
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:18,799
deeply socially embedded way

4294
02:37:16,239 --> 02:37:21,039
good well i think i i think we agree but

4295
02:37:18,799 --> 02:37:23,679
let me just highlight the thing that

4296
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:26,720
makes me think that we agree yeah which

4297
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:28,318
is that i think for people

4298
02:37:26,719 --> 02:37:30,799
for community

4299
02:37:28,318 --> 02:37:31,680
to allow themselves

4300
02:37:30,799 --> 02:37:33,759
to

4301
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:36,398
recognize in

4302
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:38,079
a certain kind of creative act let's i'm

4303
02:37:36,398 --> 02:37:40,159
thinking of stravinsky here but we could

4304
02:37:38,079 --> 02:37:41,760
think of a chess thing

4305
02:37:40,159 --> 02:37:43,200
to recognize in a certain kind of

4306
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:46,880
creative act

4307
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:48,479
a new and admirable worthy way of

4308
02:37:46,879 --> 02:37:50,000
thinking about what's significant in the

4309
02:37:48,478 --> 02:37:52,478
situation

4310
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,159
you have to believe

4311
02:37:52,478 --> 02:37:57,199
that it wasn't random

4312
02:37:54,159 --> 02:37:58,840
you have to believe that stravinsky

4313
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:02,399
wrote that way

4314
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:04,559
because he was receptive to what needed

4315
02:38:02,398 --> 02:38:07,920
to be said now

4316
02:38:04,559 --> 02:38:09,519
and so you you said if only

4317
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:11,520
alpha zero

4318
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:14,319
could do all this

4319
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:16,399
by virtue of recognizing that this was

4320
02:38:14,318 --> 02:38:18,398
the thing that needed to be done

4321
02:38:16,398 --> 02:38:20,959
then it would be socially embedded in

4322
02:38:18,398 --> 02:38:22,799
the right way and i think i agree with

4323
02:38:20,959 --> 02:38:24,879
that first of all

4324
02:38:22,799 --> 02:38:26,000
it's possible to do in a constrained

4325
02:38:24,879 --> 02:38:28,959
domain

4326
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:30,879
a game-playing domain go or chess

4327
02:38:28,959 --> 02:38:33,279
goes more complicated than chess but but

4328
02:38:30,879 --> 02:38:35,920
either one of them because there really

4329
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:38,159
are only a finite range of possibilities

4330
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:40,000
if you you know make the game end at a

4331
02:38:38,159 --> 02:38:41,280
certain point there's

4332
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:43,439
there um

4333
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:46,000
it's a combinatorial problem in the end

4334
02:38:43,439 --> 02:38:48,639
now obviously

4335
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:51,280
alpha zero doesn't solve the problem in

4336
02:38:48,639 --> 02:38:53,119
a combinatorial way that would be

4337
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:55,439
sort of take too much energy you

4338
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:58,319
couldn't do it it's too too

4339
02:38:55,439 --> 02:39:00,000
it sort of uh explodes the problem

4340
02:38:58,318 --> 02:39:01,199
um so it does it in this other way

4341
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,520
that's interesting this pattern

4342
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:06,319
recognition way roughly

4343
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:07,520
and and in that context it may well be

4344
02:39:06,318 --> 02:39:10,000
that it

4345
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:12,000
that it can see

4346
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:14,478
having had lots and lots of experience

4347
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:17,120
on in the training stuff against itself

4348
02:39:14,478 --> 02:39:18,879
or against another version of itself it

4349
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:22,000
can see that the sacrifice here is going

4350
02:39:18,879 --> 02:39:25,039
to pay dividends down the road

4351
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:28,318
see i put that in in quotation marks

4352
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:30,800
that's to say uh it's got you know a

4353
02:39:28,318 --> 02:39:32,959
high weight to this move here

4354
02:39:30,799 --> 02:39:34,639
as a result of experience in the past

4355
02:39:32,959 --> 02:39:36,959
where that move

4356
02:39:34,639 --> 02:39:38,959
down the line led to this this

4357
02:39:36,959 --> 02:39:41,519
improvement so

4358
02:39:38,959 --> 02:39:44,000
so in that in that finite context i

4359
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:46,560
think you know the game players can

4360
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:48,639
trust it and they talk that way that

4361
02:39:46,559 --> 02:39:51,279
it's got a kind of authority

4362
02:39:48,639 --> 02:39:52,478
um they say i've read some people who

4363
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:54,399
said about

4364
02:39:52,478 --> 02:39:56,719
alpha zero when i played go

4365
02:39:54,398 --> 02:39:58,318
uh it's like it's playing from the

4366
02:39:56,719 --> 02:40:01,039
future

4367
02:39:58,318 --> 02:40:02,000
it's making these moves that are just

4368
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:03,359
out

4369
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:06,000
landish

4370
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:07,840
and there's a kind of brilliance to them

4371
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:10,079
that we can't really understand we'll be

4372
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:13,439
catching up to it forever i think in

4373
02:40:10,079 --> 02:40:15,200
that context like it's mapped the domain

4374
02:40:13,439 --> 02:40:18,000
and the domain is mappable because it's

4375
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:22,240
a combinatorial problem roughly

4376
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:23,439
but in something like music or art of a

4377
02:40:22,239 --> 02:40:26,318
of a

4378
02:40:23,439 --> 02:40:29,120
non-finite form

4379
02:40:26,318 --> 02:40:31,119
it feels to me like

4380
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:33,439
i i it's a little harder for me to

4381
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:35,920
understand what the analog

4382
02:40:33,439 --> 02:40:38,639
of our trusting that stravinsky has

4383
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:41,359
recognized something about us

4384
02:40:38,639 --> 02:40:43,439
that demands that he write this way that

4385
02:40:41,359 --> 02:40:45,600
doesn't seem like a finite

4386
02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:47,920
thing in quite the same way now now we

4387
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:50,399
could ask we could ask the system why

4388
02:40:47,920 --> 02:40:54,000
did you do it we could ask stravinsky

4389
02:40:50,398 --> 02:40:55,199
why did you do it and maybe it will have

4390
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,799
answers

4391
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:58,960
but then it's involved in a kind of

4392
02:40:56,799 --> 02:41:02,159
communicative act

4393
02:40:58,959 --> 02:41:04,799
and i think lots of times artists will

4394
02:41:02,159 --> 02:41:06,318
often say look i i can't communicate

4395
02:41:04,799 --> 02:41:08,559
better than what i've done in the piece

4396
02:41:06,318 --> 02:41:10,799
of work and that that is the statement

4397
02:41:08,559 --> 02:41:13,199
yeah yeah so the yeah we humans aren't

4398
02:41:10,799 --> 02:41:17,039
able to answer the why either yeah

4399
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:20,000
but i do think the the question here is

4400
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:22,640
uh well first of all language is finite

4401
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:25,439
uh certainly when expressed to a tweet

4402
02:41:22,639 --> 02:41:27,278
uh so it is also a combinatorial problem

4403
02:41:25,439 --> 02:41:29,200
the question is how much more difficult

4404
02:41:27,279 --> 02:41:30,960
it is than chess

4405
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:33,200
and

4406
02:41:30,959 --> 02:41:36,000
i think

4407
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:37,600
i think all the same ways that we see

4408
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:39,439
the solutions to chess is deeply

4409
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:43,439
surprising when it was first

4410
02:41:39,439 --> 02:41:46,559
addressed with ibm d blue and then with

4411
02:41:43,439 --> 02:41:49,359
alpha go and alpha go zero alpha zero

4412
02:41:46,559 --> 02:41:52,239
i think in that same way language

4413
02:41:49,359 --> 02:41:54,800
can be addressed and communication can

4414
02:41:52,239 --> 02:41:56,639
be addressed i don't see having done

4415
02:41:54,799 --> 02:41:59,599
this podcast

4416
02:41:56,639 --> 02:42:01,358
many reasons why everything i'm doing

4417
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:02,640
especially as a digital being on the

4418
02:42:01,359 --> 02:42:06,079
internet

4419
02:42:02,639 --> 02:42:09,599
can't be done by an ai system eventually

4420
02:42:06,079 --> 02:42:11,359
so like i think we're being very

4421
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:12,960
uh human-centric and thinking we're

4422
02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:16,079
special i think one of the hardest

4423
02:42:12,959 --> 02:42:18,559
things is the physical space

4424
02:42:16,079 --> 02:42:21,120
actually operating like touch and the

4425
02:42:18,559 --> 02:42:23,199
magic of body language and the music of

4426
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:25,040
all of that because it's so deeply

4427
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:27,120
integrated through the

4428
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:29,279
long evolutionary process of what it's

4429
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:30,399
like to be on earth

4430
02:42:29,279 --> 02:42:34,399
what is

4431
02:42:30,398 --> 02:42:37,840
fundamentally different and ai has

4432
02:42:34,398 --> 02:42:41,358
can catch up on is the way we apply our

4433
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:43,040
evolutionary history on the way we act

4434
02:42:41,359 --> 02:42:45,200
on the internet and the way we act

4435
02:42:43,040 --> 02:42:47,520
online and as more and more of the world

4436
02:42:45,200 --> 02:42:50,319
becomes digital you're now operating in

4437
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:53,200
a space where ai

4438
02:42:50,318 --> 02:42:55,920
is is behind much less so

4439
02:42:53,200 --> 02:42:57,840
like we're both starting at zero

4440
02:42:55,920 --> 02:43:00,000
i think that's super interesting do you

4441
02:42:57,840 --> 02:43:01,920
do you know this do you know this author

4442
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:03,920
brian christian is that someone you've

4443
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:05,520
ever heard of that sounds familiar he

4444
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:08,000
he's a guy

4445
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:10,079
who competed in the what is it called

4446
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:12,159
the loebner competition

4447
02:43:10,079 --> 02:43:12,959
yeah the turing test thing

4448
02:43:12,159 --> 02:43:14,478
so

4449
02:43:12,959 --> 02:43:16,639
and i'll just tell you the story but i

4450
02:43:14,478 --> 02:43:18,398
think it's directly related to the last

4451
02:43:16,639 --> 02:43:20,239
thing you said about where we're we're

4452
02:43:18,398 --> 02:43:22,639
starting in the same place

4453
02:43:20,239 --> 02:43:24,879
uh he competed

4454
02:43:22,639 --> 02:43:27,358
in this in this competition but not he

4455
02:43:24,879 --> 02:43:29,438
didn't enter uh a program that was

4456
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:30,559
supposed to try to uh pass the turing

4457
02:43:29,439 --> 02:43:32,079
test

4458
02:43:30,559 --> 02:43:33,519
the turing test you know there's three

4459
02:43:32,079 --> 02:43:35,920
people there's the judge there's the

4460
02:43:33,520 --> 02:43:38,239
program and then there's there's a

4461
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:40,000
someone who's a human the way they do it

4462
02:43:38,239 --> 02:43:41,760
and the judge has got to figure out by

4463
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:44,239
asking questions which is the computer

4464
02:43:41,760 --> 02:43:46,159
and which is the human so little known

4465
02:43:44,239 --> 02:43:48,239
fact there's two prizes in that

4466
02:43:46,159 --> 02:43:49,680
competition there's the most human

4467
02:43:48,239 --> 02:43:51,680
computer prize

4468
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:53,600
that's the computer that wins the most

4469
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:54,639
and then there's the most human human

4470
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:56,720
rights

4471
02:43:54,639 --> 02:43:57,680
and he competed for the most human human

4472
02:43:56,719 --> 02:44:00,000
props

4473
02:43:57,680 --> 02:44:02,880
and he wanted he kept one winning it and

4474
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:05,279
and so he he tried to think about

4475
02:44:02,879 --> 02:44:07,759
what it is that um

4476
02:44:05,279 --> 02:44:09,359
you have to be able to do in order to

4477
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:10,800
convince judges that you're human

4478
02:44:09,359 --> 02:44:12,880
instead of a computer

4479
02:44:10,799 --> 02:44:13,679
and that's an interesting question i

4480
02:44:12,879 --> 02:44:17,358
think

4481
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:19,600
um and when he came to this my takeaway

4482
02:44:17,359 --> 02:44:22,079
from his version of this story

4483
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:24,559
is that it is true

4484
02:44:22,079 --> 02:44:27,120
that computers are winning these

4485
02:44:24,559 --> 02:44:29,760
contests more and more

4486
02:44:27,120 --> 02:44:31,439
you know as technology progresses but

4487
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:32,478
there's two possible explanations for

4488
02:44:31,439 --> 02:44:34,079
that

4489
02:44:32,478 --> 02:44:36,478
one is that the computers are becoming

4490
02:44:34,079 --> 02:44:38,159
more human

4491
02:44:36,478 --> 02:44:41,278
and the other is that the humans are

4492
02:44:38,159 --> 02:44:43,439
becoming more like computers

4493
02:44:41,279 --> 02:44:44,720
and he says actually

4494
02:44:43,439 --> 02:44:48,079
the more

4495
02:44:44,719 --> 02:44:50,478
we live our lives in this world where in

4496
02:44:48,079 --> 02:44:51,600
this sort of technological world

4497
02:44:50,478 --> 02:44:55,199
where

4498
02:44:51,600 --> 02:44:56,640
we have to moderate our behavior so that

4499
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:57,520
it's readable

4500
02:44:56,639 --> 02:45:00,559
by

4501
02:44:57,520 --> 02:45:01,920
something that's effectively you know a

4502
02:45:00,559 --> 02:45:05,039
computer

4503
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:07,120
the more we become like that and he says

4504
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:09,279
it happens even when you're

4505
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:11,040
uh not interacting with a computer he

4506
02:45:09,279 --> 02:45:12,800
says have you ever been to the you know

4507
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:14,479
on the phone with the call

4508
02:45:12,799 --> 02:45:16,239
you know center

4509
02:45:14,478 --> 02:45:17,840
and they're going through their script

4510
02:45:16,239 --> 02:45:19,520
and that's what they've got to do

4511
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:21,439
they've got to go through their script

4512
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:22,880
because that's how they keep their job

4513
02:45:21,439 --> 02:45:24,079
and they ask you this question you've

4514
02:45:22,879 --> 02:45:26,079
got to answer it

4515
02:45:24,079 --> 02:45:27,359
and it and it's as if you're no longer

4516
02:45:26,079 --> 02:45:28,959
interacting with a person even though

4517
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:31,279
it's a person

4518
02:45:28,959 --> 02:45:33,679
because they've so given up everything

4519
02:45:31,279 --> 02:45:34,399
that's involved normally with being able

4520
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:36,398
to

4521
02:45:34,398 --> 02:45:38,799
make judgments and decisions and act in

4522
02:45:36,398 --> 02:45:41,680
situations and take responsibility and

4523
02:45:38,799 --> 02:45:45,519
so i think that's that's the other side

4524
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:48,800
of it it it it is true that technology

4525
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:49,840
is amazing and can solve huge ranges of

4526
02:45:48,799 --> 02:45:52,719
problems

4527
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:54,159
and and do fantastic things but it's

4528
02:45:52,719 --> 02:45:56,079
also true

4529
02:45:54,159 --> 02:45:58,639
that we're changing ourselves in

4530
02:45:56,079 --> 02:46:00,719
response to it and the one thing i'm

4531
02:45:58,639 --> 02:46:04,239
worried about is that we're changing

4532
02:46:00,719 --> 02:46:06,799
ourselves in such a way that the

4533
02:46:04,239 --> 02:46:08,398
norms for what we're aiming at are being

4534
02:46:06,799 --> 02:46:10,639
changed

4535
02:46:08,398 --> 02:46:12,879
to move in the direction of this sort of

4536
02:46:10,639 --> 02:46:14,398
efficiently and up in an optimized way

4537
02:46:12,879 --> 02:46:16,559
solving a problem

4538
02:46:14,398 --> 02:46:18,959
and move away from this other kind of

4539
02:46:16,559 --> 02:46:21,519
thing that we were calling alive and

4540
02:46:18,959 --> 02:46:24,000
aliveness or or significance

4541
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:25,760
and and so that's the that's the other

4542
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:28,799
side of the story and that's the worry

4543
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:31,520
but it's very possible that there is uh

4544
02:46:28,799 --> 02:46:33,920
for you and i the ancient dinosaurs we

4545
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:35,680
may not see the aliveness

4546
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:38,639
in tiktok

4547
02:46:35,680 --> 02:46:41,200
the aliveness in the digital space

4548
02:46:38,639 --> 02:46:43,599
that you see it as us being dragged into

4549
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:45,279
this over optimized world

4550
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:47,120
but that may be

4551
02:46:45,279 --> 02:46:48,560
uh this is

4552
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:50,479
in fact

4553
02:46:48,559 --> 02:46:54,719
it is a world that opens up

4554
02:46:50,478 --> 02:46:56,799
opportunities to truly experience life

4555
02:46:54,719 --> 02:46:58,879
and there's interesting to think about

4556
02:46:56,799 --> 02:47:01,039
all the people growing up now

4557
02:46:58,879 --> 02:47:03,759
who their early

4558
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:05,920
experience of life is always mediated

4559
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:07,439
through a digital device not always but

4560
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:10,639
more and more often mediated through

4561
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:12,239
that device and how we're both evolving

4562
02:47:10,639 --> 02:47:14,719
the technology is evolving and the

4563
02:47:12,239 --> 02:47:17,199
humans are evolving to them maybe open a

4564
02:47:14,719 --> 02:47:20,478
door to a whole world where the humans

4565
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:22,640
and the technology or ai systems are

4566
02:47:20,478 --> 02:47:24,079
interacting as equals

4567
02:47:22,639 --> 02:47:25,599
so now i'm going to agree with you you

4568
02:47:24,079 --> 02:47:27,439
might be surprised that i'm going to

4569
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:29,359
agree with you but i think that's

4570
02:47:27,439 --> 02:47:33,120
exactly right i i don't want to be the

4571
02:47:29,359 --> 02:47:34,960
person who's saying our job is to resist

4572
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:37,600
all of this stuff that i don't want to

4573
02:47:34,959 --> 02:47:38,879
be a luddite that's not my goal the goal

4574
02:47:37,600 --> 02:47:40,318
is to

4575
02:47:38,879 --> 02:47:41,519
point out

4576
02:47:40,318 --> 02:47:43,840
that

4577
02:47:41,520 --> 02:47:46,560
in the supreme danger lies the saving

4578
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:48,079
power yes

4579
02:47:46,559 --> 02:47:50,318
the point is to get in the right

4580
02:47:48,079 --> 02:47:51,439
relation to that understanding of what

4581
02:47:50,318 --> 02:47:54,318
we are

4582
02:47:51,439 --> 02:47:56,398
uh that allows us to find the joy in it

4583
02:47:54,318 --> 02:47:57,920
and that's i think that's a hard thing

4584
02:47:56,398 --> 02:48:00,079
to do it's hard to understand even what

4585
02:47:57,920 --> 02:48:02,799
we're supposed to be doing when we do it

4586
02:48:00,079 --> 02:48:05,359
i'm maybe high more than you i'm not of

4587
02:48:02,799 --> 02:48:07,039
the right generation to be able to to do

4588
02:48:05,359 --> 02:48:09,279
that but i do think that's got to be the

4589
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:12,880
move the move is not to resist it it's

4590
02:48:09,279 --> 02:48:15,680
not a nostalgic move it's an attempt to

4591
02:48:12,879 --> 02:48:17,519
push people to get in the relation to it

4592
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:19,680
that's not the relation of it

4593
02:48:17,520 --> 02:48:22,239
controlling you and depriving you of

4594
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:24,479
stuff but if you're recognizing some

4595
02:48:22,239 --> 02:48:27,439
great joy that can be found in it

4596
02:48:24,478 --> 02:48:29,358
when i interact with league of robots

4597
02:48:27,439 --> 02:48:31,760
i see there's magic there

4598
02:48:29,359 --> 02:48:34,079
and i just feel like the person who

4599
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:36,079
hears the music when others don't and i

4600
02:48:34,079 --> 02:48:38,000
don't know what that is and i'd love to

4601
02:48:36,079 --> 02:48:40,239
explore that yeah

4602
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:42,799
and because it seems to it's almost like

4603
02:48:40,239 --> 02:48:45,039
a the future talking

4604
02:48:42,799 --> 02:48:47,119
and i'm trying to hear what it's saying

4605
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:49,040
is this a dangerous world or is this a

4606
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:50,479
beautiful world hmm

4607
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:52,240
well i can certainly understand your

4608
02:48:50,478 --> 02:48:53,639
enthusiasm for that those used to be

4609
02:48:52,239 --> 02:48:56,079
things that i found

4610
02:48:53,639 --> 02:48:59,599
overwhelmingly exciting

4611
02:48:56,079 --> 02:49:01,279
and i'm not sort of closed off from that

4612
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:03,760
anymore

4613
02:49:01,279 --> 02:49:06,000
i mean i'm not now closed off from that

4614
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:09,040
even though my views are are changed and

4615
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:10,559
i don't work in that world

4616
02:49:09,040 --> 02:49:12,160
but i i do think i think it's

4617
02:49:10,559 --> 02:49:14,159
interesting to figure out what's at the

4618
02:49:12,159 --> 02:49:15,200
ground of that of that response

4619
02:49:14,159 --> 02:49:17,439
yeah

4620
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:18,960
we talked about meaning quite a bit

4621
02:49:17,439 --> 02:49:21,359
throughout

4622
02:49:18,959 --> 02:49:25,039
in a secular age but let me ask you the

4623
02:49:21,359 --> 02:49:27,279
big ridiculous question almost too big

4624
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:30,880
what is the meaning of this thing we got

4625
02:49:27,279 --> 02:49:30,880
going on what is the meaning of life

4626
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:34,880
you're you're saving the softball for

4627
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:37,200
the end

4628
02:49:34,879 --> 02:49:39,278
easy one i i don't know what the meaning

4629
02:49:37,200 --> 02:49:41,520
of life is i i think there's something

4630
02:49:39,279 --> 02:49:43,600
that characterizes us

4631
02:49:41,520 --> 02:49:46,399
that's not the thing that people

4632
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:48,000
normally think characterizes us

4633
02:49:46,398 --> 02:49:50,639
the traditional thing to say in the

4634
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:52,959
philosophical tradition even in the ai

4635
02:49:50,639 --> 02:49:54,478
tradition which is a kind of

4636
02:49:52,959 --> 02:49:57,278
manifestation

4637
02:49:54,478 --> 02:49:58,559
of philosophy from plato forward the

4638
02:49:57,279 --> 02:50:01,120
traditional thing to say is that what

4639
02:49:58,559 --> 02:50:02,959
characterizes us is our

4640
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:05,279
rationality that we're intelligent

4641
02:50:02,959 --> 02:50:06,478
beings that we're the ones that that

4642
02:50:05,279 --> 02:50:08,560
think

4643
02:50:06,478 --> 02:50:10,959
and i think that's certainly part of of

4644
02:50:08,559 --> 02:50:13,439
what characterizes us

4645
02:50:10,959 --> 02:50:17,119
but i think there's

4646
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:19,239
more to it too i think we're capable

4647
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:21,200
of

4648
02:50:19,239 --> 02:50:23,600
experiencing

4649
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:26,399
simultaneously

4650
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:28,239
the complete and utter ungroundedness of

4651
02:50:26,398 --> 02:50:29,840
everything that's meaningful in our

4652
02:50:28,239 --> 02:50:34,159
existence

4653
02:50:29,840 --> 02:50:36,719
and also the real significance of it

4654
02:50:34,159 --> 02:50:38,879
and that sounds like it that sounds like

4655
02:50:36,719 --> 02:50:40,559
a contradiction like how could it really

4656
02:50:38,879 --> 02:50:42,000
be significant and not be based on

4657
02:50:40,559 --> 02:50:43,439
anything

4658
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:45,920
but i think that's the contradiction

4659
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:46,960
that somehow characterizes us and i

4660
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:49,200
think that

4661
02:50:46,959 --> 02:50:53,839
we're the being that sort of has to hold

4662
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:56,399
that weird mystery before us and live

4663
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:59,680
in the light of it that's the thing that

4664
02:50:56,398 --> 02:51:03,039
i think is really at our core and so how

4665
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:05,200
do we do that i will say this one thing

4666
02:51:03,040 --> 02:51:07,920
and i learned it from a philosopher from

4667
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:09,840
a guy named albert borgmon who's a

4668
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:12,879
german philosopher lives in montana now

4669
02:51:09,840 --> 02:51:16,079
taught in montana for his whole career

4670
02:51:12,879 --> 02:51:18,559
and when i i say this to my students at

4671
02:51:16,079 --> 02:51:20,398
harvard now he said this is the way that

4672
02:51:18,559 --> 02:51:22,559
i think about my life and i hope you'll

4673
02:51:20,398 --> 02:51:26,318
think about your life too

4674
02:51:22,559 --> 02:51:28,000
he said you should think about your life

4675
02:51:26,318 --> 02:51:31,439
hoping

4676
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:34,239
that there will be many moments in it

4677
02:51:31,439 --> 02:51:37,200
about which you can say

4678
02:51:34,239 --> 02:51:38,398
there's no place i'd rather be

4679
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:41,439
there's

4680
02:51:38,398 --> 02:51:45,119
no thing i'd rather be doing

4681
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:49,040
there's no buddy i'd rather be with

4682
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:51,760
and this i will remember well

4683
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:53,439
and i think if you can aim to fill your

4684
02:51:51,760 --> 02:51:54,880
life with moments like that it will be a

4685
02:51:53,439 --> 02:51:56,639
meaningful one i don't know if that's

4686
02:51:54,879 --> 02:51:58,478
the meaning of life

4687
02:51:56,639 --> 02:52:01,680
but i think if you can hold that before

4688
02:51:58,478 --> 02:52:04,079
you it'll help to clarify this mystery

4689
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:06,559
and this sort of bizarre situation in

4690
02:52:04,079 --> 02:52:08,879
which we find ourselves

4691
02:52:06,559 --> 02:52:11,119
sean this conversation was incredible

4692
02:52:08,879 --> 02:52:13,519
and those four requirements have

4693
02:52:11,120 --> 02:52:16,640
certainly been fulfilled for me

4694
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:18,880
this was a magical moment

4695
02:52:16,639 --> 02:52:20,879
in that way and i will remember it well

4696
02:52:18,879 --> 02:52:23,039
