00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,359
the following is a conversation with cal

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,439
newport he's a friend

3
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,878
and someone who's writing like his book

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,638
deep work for example

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:11,279
has guided how i strive to approach

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:14,000
productivity and life in general

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,759
he doesn't use social media and in his

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,359
book digital minimalism

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,039
he encourages people to find the right

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,160
amount of social media usage

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,800
that provides value and joy he has a new

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,039
book out

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,118
called a world without email where he

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,359
argues brilliantly i would say

15
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,160
that email is destroying productivity in

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,840
companies

17
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,399
and in our lives and very importantly

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,040
he offers solutions he is a computer

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,679
scientist

20
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,960
at georgetown university who practices

21
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,878
what he preaches

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
to do theoretical computer science at

23
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,718
the level that he does it

24
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,398
you really have to live a focused life

25
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,280
that minimizes distractions and

26
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,960
maximizes

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,039
hours of deep work lastly he's a host

28
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,000
of an amazing podcast called deep

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,399
questions

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,280
that i highly recommend for anyone who

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,600
wants to improve

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800

as a side note let me say that deep work

40
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,359
or long periods of deep

41
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,959
focused thinking have been something

42
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,400
i've been chasing more and more over the

43
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:27,679
past few years

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,280
deep work is hard but is ultimately the

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,000
thing that makes life so

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,478
damn amazing the ability to create

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,799
things

48
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,560
you're passionate about in a flow state

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,840
where the distractions of the world just

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,439
fade away

51
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,680
social media yes reading the comments

52
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,118
yes i still read the comments is a

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,000
source of joy for me

54
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,118
in strict moderation too much takes away

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,759
the focused mind

56
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,239
and too little at least i think takes

57
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,599
away

58
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,839
all of the fun we need both the focus

59
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,199
and the fun if you enjoy this thing

out how to spell that

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,400
and now here's my conversation with cal

68
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:19,119
newport what is deep work

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,520
let's start with a big question so i

70
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,599
mean

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,520
it's my term for when you're focusing

72
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,799
without distraction

73
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,800
on a cognitively demanding task which

74
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,040
is something we've all done but we had

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,319
never really given it a name

76
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,400
necessarily that was separate from other

77
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,958
type of work and so

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,640
i gave it a name and said let's compare

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,439
that to other types of efforts you might

80
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,199
do

81
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,359
while you're working and see that the

82
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,639
deep work efforts actually have

83
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
a huge benefit that we might be

84
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,279
underestimating what does it mean to

85
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,079
to work deeply on something you know i

86
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,080
had been calling it

87
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,519
hard focus in my writing uh before that

88
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
well so the context you would understand

89
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,519
i was in the theory group in csail at

90
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,799
mit right so i was surrounded at the

91
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,599
time when i was coming up with these

92
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,439
ideas

93
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,759
by these professional theoreticians and

94
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,439
that's like a murderer's row

95
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,359
of thinkers there right i mean it's like

96
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,439
turing award touring award macarthur

97
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
tauren ward i mean

98
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,560
you know the crew right theoretical

99
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,439
computer science theoretical computer

100
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,920
science yeah

101
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,840
yeah so so i'm in the theory group right

102
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,318
doing theoretical computer science

103
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,598
uh and i publish a book so you know so i

104
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,199
was in this milieu where i was being

105
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,518
exposed to people

106
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,639
uh where focus was their tier one skill

107
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,519
like that's what you would talk about

108
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,679
right like

109
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,120
how how intensely i can focus that was

110
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,799
the the key skill

111
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,719
it's like your 4 40 time or something if

112
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
you were an athlete right

113
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,799
so so this is something that people are

114
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,039
actually the the the theory folks

115
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,879
are thinking about oh yeah really like

116
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,560
they're openly discussing like how do

117
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,039
you focus i mean i don't know if they

118
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,080
would

119
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,359
you know quantify it but but focus was

120
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,120
the tier one skill

121
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,799
so you you would come in here would be a

122
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,480
typical day you'd come in

123
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,560
uh and eric domain would be sitting in

124
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,000
front of a white board yeah right with a

125
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
whole group of visitors

126
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,519
who had come to work with them and maybe

127
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,799
that projected like a grid on there

128
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
because they're working on some

129
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,319
graph theory problem you go to lunch you

130
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
go to the gym

131
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,000
you come back they're sitting there

132
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,280
staring at the same

133
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,878
same white board right like that's the

134
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,120
tier one skill this is the difference

135
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,680
between different disciplines like i

136
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
i often feel for many reasons like a

137
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,160
fraud

138
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,280
but i definitely feel like a fraud when

139
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
i hang out with like either

140
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,519
mathematicians or physicists

141
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,959
it's like it feels like they're doing

142
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,879
the legit work

143
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,560
because when you talk closer in computer

144
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,319
science you get to programming

145
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,478
or like machine learning like the the

146
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,360
the experimental machine learning or

147
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,439
like

148
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,040
just the engineering version of it it

149
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,478
it's it feels like you're

150
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,160
gone so far away from what's required to

151
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,159
solve something fundamental about this

152
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,919
universe it feels like you're just like

153
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,080
cheating your way into like some kind of

154
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,000
trick to figure out how to solve a

155
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,279
problem in this one particular case yeah

156
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,519
that's how it feels

157
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,719
right and it's uh i'd be interested

158
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,839
to hear what you think about that

159
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,039
because um programming doesn't always

160
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,239
feel

161
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,800
like you need to think deeply to

162
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,240
work deeply but sometimes it does so

163
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,560
it's a weird dance

164
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,600
for sure code does right i mean

165
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,038
especially if you're coming up with

166
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,199
original

167
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,560
algorithmic designs i think it's a great

168
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,000
example of deep work

169
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,319
i mean yeah the the hardcore

170
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,560
theoreticians they push it to an extreme

171
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,038
i mean i i think it's like

172
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,680
knowing that athletic endeavor is good

173
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:33,839
and then

174
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,519
hanging out with a olympic athlete like

175
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,198
oh i see that's what it is

176
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,038
now for the grad students like me were

177
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,400
not anywhere near that level but the

178
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,800
faculty

179
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,599
the faculty in that group these were the

180
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,478
cognitive

181
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,039
olympic athletes but coding i think is a

182
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,800
classic example of deep work because

183
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,079
i got this problem i want to solve i

184
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,120
have all of these tools

185
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,639
and i have to combine them somehow

186
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,720
creatively and on the fly but but so

187
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,160
basically i had been exposed to that

188
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,600
so i was used to this notion when i was

189
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,120
in grad school and i was writing my blog

190
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,199
i'd write about hard focus

191
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,478
you know that was a term i used then i

192
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,079
published this book

193
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,560
so good they can't ignore you which came

194
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,000
out in 2012 so like right as i began as

195
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,478
a professor

196
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,680
and that book had this notion of skill

197
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:16,800
being really important for career

198
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,360
satisfaction that

199
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,560
it's not just following your passion you

200
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,840
have to actually really get good at

201
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,959
something and then you use that skills

202
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,560
as leverage and there's this big

203
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,318
follow-up question to that book of okay

204
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,160
well how do i get really good at this

205
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,160
yeah and then i look back to my grad

206
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,000
school experience i was like huh

207
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,000
there's this focus thing that we used to

208
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,519
do i wonder how

209
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,879
generally applicable that is into the

210
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,159
knowledge sector and so as i started

211
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,759
thinking about it

212
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,439
it became clear there's this interesting

213
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,120
storyline that emerged that okay

214
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,478
actually undistracted concentration is

215
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,560
not just important for

216
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,758
esoteric theoreticians it's important

217
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
here it's important here and so forth

218
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,160
here

219
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,000
and that involved into the uh the deep

220
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,199
work hypothesis which is

221
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,879
across the whole knowledge work sector

222
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,879
focus is very important and we've

223
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,279
accidentally created circumstances where

224
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,360
we just don't do a lot of it so focus is

225
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,038
the sort of prerequisite for basically

226
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,960
uh you say knowledge work but

227
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:09,120
basically any kind of skill acquisition

228
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,519
any kind of major effort in this world

229
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
can we break that apart a little bit

230
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,439
yeah so

231
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,400
so a key a key aspect of focus is not

232
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,680
just that you're

233
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,000
you're concentrating hard on something

234
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,720
but you do it without distraction

235
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,560
so a big theme of my work is that

236
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,599
context shifting

237
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,280
kills the human capacity to think so if

238
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,959
i if i change what i'm paying attention

239
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,159
to to something different

240
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,439
really even if it's brief and then try

241
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,080
to bring it back to the main thing i'm

242
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,918
doing

243
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,918
that causes a huge cognitive pile up to

244
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,519
make it very hard to think clearly

245
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,279
so even if you think okay look i'm

246
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,839
writing this code or i'm writing this

247
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,519
essay and i'm not multitasking and all

248
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,000
my windows are closed and i have no

249
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,918
notifications on but every five or six

250
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,079
minutes you quickly check

251
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,839
like an inbox or your phone that

252
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,120
initiates a contact shift in your brain

253
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,239
right we're gonna start to suppress some

254
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,360
neural networks we're gonna try to

255
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,879
amplify some others

256
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,160
it's a pretty complicated process

257
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,160
actually there's a sort of neurological

258
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,080
cascade that happens

259
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
you rip yourself away from that halfway

260
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,399
through and go back to what you're doing

261
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,758
and i was trying to switch back to the

262
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,038
original thing even though it's also in

263
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,560
your brain's in the process of switching

264
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,680
to these emails and trying to understand

265
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,280
those contexts

266
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,160
and as a result your ability to think

267
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,598
clearly just goes really down

268
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,360
and it's fatiguing too i mean you do

269
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,639
this long enough you get midday and

270
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,560
you're like okay i can't

271
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,478
i can't think anymore you've exhausted

272
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,759
yourself is there some kind of

273
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:29,680
um perfect number of minutes

274
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,800
would you say so we're talking about

275
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,158
focusing

276
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,240
on a particular task for you know

277
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,559
one minute five minutes 10 minutes 30

278
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,200
minutes is it possible to kind of

279
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,399
context switch while maintaining deep

280
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,399
focus

281
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,759
you know every 20 minutes or so so if

282
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,000
you're thinking of like

283
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,360
this again maybe it's a selfish kind of

284
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,958
perspective but if you think about

285
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,560
programming

286
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,239
you know you're focused on a particular

287
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,759
design of a little bit maybe a small

288
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,440
scale on a particular function

289
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:02,080
or a large scale on a on a system

290
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,640
and then the shift to focus happens like

291
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,278
this

292
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,958
which is like wait a minute is there a

293
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,159
library that can achieve this little

294
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,399
task or something like that

295
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,360
and then you have to look it up this is

296
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,919
the danger zone

297
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,800
you go to the internets yeah and and so

298
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,958
you have to

299
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,559
now you it is a kind of contact switch

300
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,919
because as opposed to thinking about the

301
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,278
particular problem

302
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:26,399
you now have switch thinking about like

303
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,759
uh consuming and integrating knowledge

304
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,240
that's out there

305
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,919
that can plug into your solution to a

306
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,519
particular problem it definitely feels

307
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,519
like a contact switch

308
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,759
but is that is that a really bad thing

309
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,480
to do so should you be setting it aside

310
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,120
always

311
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,080
and really trying to as much as possible

312
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,639
go deep

313
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,759
and stay there for like a really long

314
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,199
period of time

315
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,600
well i mean i think if you're looking up

316
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
a library that's relevant to what you're

317
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
doing

318
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,800
that's probably okay and i don't know

319
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,560
that i would count that as a full

320
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,399
context shift because

321
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,079
the semantic networks involved are

322
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,919
relatively similar right

323
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,440
you're thinking about this type of

324
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,559
solution you're thinking about coding

325
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,360
you're thinking about this type of

326
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,639
functions

327
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,240
where you're really going to get hit is

328
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,799
if you switch your context to something

329
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
that's

330
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,958
different and if there's unresolved

331
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,159
obligations so really the worst possible

332
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,078
thing you could do would be to look at

333
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,559
like an email inbox

334
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,078
because here's 20 emails i can't answer

335
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,359
most of these right now they're

336
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:21,120
completely different

337
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,720
like the context of these emails like

338
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,679
okay there's a grant funding issue or

339
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,360
something like this is very different

340
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,278
than the coding i'm doing

341
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,959
and i'm leaving it unresolved so it's

342
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,320
like someone needs something from me

343
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,599
and i'm gonna try to pull my attention

344
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,120
back the second worst would be something

345
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
that's emotionally arousing

346
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,759
so if you're like let me just glance

347
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,278
over at twitter i'm sure it's nice and

348
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,720
calm and peaceful over there right

349
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,000
that could be devastating because you're

350
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,360
going to expose yourself to something

351
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,720
that's emotionally arousing

352
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,000
that's going to completely mess up the

353
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,759
cognitive platform there and then when

354
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,720
you come back to okay let me try to code

355
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,319
again

356
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
it's really difficult this is both the

357
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,240
information and the emotion

358
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,199
yeah both both can be killers if what

359
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,799
you're trying to do

360
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,879
so i would recommend at least an hour at

361
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,439
a time because it could take up to 20

362
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,000
minutes

363
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,279
to completely clear out the residue from

364
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,399
whatever it was you were thinking about

365
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:03,919
before

366
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,519
so if you're coding for 30 minutes you

367
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,479
might only be getting 10 or 15 minutes

368
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,799
of actual

369
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,039
sort of peak lex going on there right so

370
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,039
an hour at least you get a good 40 45

371
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,559
minutes plus i'm partial to 90 minutes

372
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,919
that's a really good

373
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,479
a really good chunk we can get a lot

374
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,759
done but just before you get exhausted

375
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,159
you can sort of

376
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,120
pull back a little bit yeah and now one

377
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,519
of the beautiful and

378
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,879
you know people can read about in your

379
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,799
book deep work

380
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,240
but and i know this has been out for a

381
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,479
long time and people are probably

382
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,480
familiar with many other concepts but

383
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,159
it's still pretty profound it has stayed

384
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,079
with me for a long time

385
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,278
uh there's something about adding the

386
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,000
terms to it

387
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,958
that actually solidifies the concepts

388
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,159
like words matter

389
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:49,278
it's pretty cool and uh just for me

390
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:51,439
sort of as a comment there's

391
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:52,559
uh it's a struggle and it's very

392
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,560
difficult

393
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,239
to uh maintain focus for prolonged

394
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,559
period of time

395
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,278
but the days on which i'm able to

396
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,319
accomplish

397
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,799
several hours of that kind of work

398
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,639
i'm happy so forget being productive and

399
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:10,479
all that yeah i'm just satisfied

400
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,519
with my life i'm i feel i feel fulfilled

401
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,440
it's like joyful and then i i can be i'm

402
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,440
less of a dick to other people in my

403
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,240
life afterwards

404
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,720
it's a it's a beautiful thing and there

405
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,200
there

406
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,278
i find the opposite when i don't do that

407
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,800
kind of thing i'm much more irritable

408
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,320
like i feel like i didn't accomplish

409
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,039
anything and there's the stress that

410
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,879
then

411
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,559
the negative emotion builds up to where

412
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:36,078
you're no longer able to sort of

413
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,518
uh enjoy the lot of this amazing life so

414
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,000
so in that sense deep work has been a

415
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,799
source of a lot of happiness i'd love to

416
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,120
ask you

417
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,199
how do you again you cover this in the

418
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,720
book but how do you integrate

419
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,399
deep work into your life what are

420
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,920
different scheduling strategies

421
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,919
that you would recommend just at a high

422
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,399
level yeah what are different ideas

423
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,759
there

424
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,000
well i mean i'm a big fan of time

425
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,720
blocking right so

426
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,679
if you're facing your workday don't

427
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,240
allow

428
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,679
like your inbox or to-do list to sort of

429
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,200
drive you don't just come into your day

430
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,719
and think what do i want to do next

431
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,480
yes i mean i'm a big plan of saying

432
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,519
here's the time here's the time

433
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,440
available

434
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,879
let me make a plan for it all right so i

435
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,279
have a meeting here of an appointment

436
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,559
here

437
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,480
here's what's left what do i actually

438
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:17,759
want to do with it so in this half hour

439
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,039
i'm going to work on this

440
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,159
for this 90 minute block i'm going to

441
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,360
work on that and during this hour i'm

442
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,799
going to try to fit this in and then

443
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,919
actually have this half hour gap between

444
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,679
two meetings so why don't i take

445
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,519
advantage of that to go run five errands

446
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,399
i can kind of batch those together

447
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,240
but blocking out in advance this is what

448
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,600
i want to do with the time available

449
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,720
i mean i find that's much more effective

450
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,159
now once you're doing this once you're

451
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,920
in a discipline of time blocking

452
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,000
it's much easier to actually see this is

453
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,439
where i want for example to deep work

454
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,198
and i can get a handle on the other

455
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,320
things that need to happen and find

456
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,078
better places to

457
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,360
fit them so i can prioritize this and

458
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,319
you're going to get a lot more of that

459
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,519
done

460
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,079
than if it's just going through your day

461
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,720
and saying what's next i schedule every

462
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,399
single day

463
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,839
kind of thing so as i try to in the

464
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,078
morning to try to uh

465
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,240
have a plan yeah so you know i do

466
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,319
quarterly weekly daily planning

467
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,320
so at the semester or quarterly level i

468
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,680
have a big picture

469
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,278
vision for what i'm trying to get done

470
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,399
you know during the fall let's say or

471
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,439
during the winter

472
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,120
like i want to these are there's a

473
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,480
deadline coming out for academic papers

474
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,278
at the end of the season here's what i'm

475
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,720
working on

476
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:15,919
i want to have this many chapters done

477
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,959
of a book something like this like you

478
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,799
have the

479
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,719
the big picture vision of what you want

480
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,639
to get done then weekly

481
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,639
you look at that and then you look at

482
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,919
your week and you put together a plan

483
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,120
for like okay what am i going to

484
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,719
what's my week going to look like what

485
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,799
do i need to do how am i going to make

486
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,480
progress on these things maybe

487
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,919
maybe i need to do an hour every morning

488
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,278
or i see that monday is my only really

489
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,879
empty day so that's going to be the day

490
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:37,919
that i really need to nail on writing or

491
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,919
something like this

492
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,958
and then every day you look at your

493
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,319
weekly plan

494
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,559
and still only block off the actual

495
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,879
hours so you do that that three scales

496
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,479
the

497
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:49,120
the quarterly down to weekly down to

498
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,000
daily and we're talking about actual

499
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,039
times of day

500
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,440
versus so the alternative is

501
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,319
what i end up doing a lot i'm not sure

502
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,519
it's the best way to do it is uh

503
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,278
uh scheduling the duration of time

504
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,799
this is this is called the luxury when

505
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,838
you don't have any meetings i'm like

506
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,799
religiously

507
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,240
don't do meetings all other academics

508
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,359
are jealous of you by the way yeah

509
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,919
i know no zoo meetings uh

510
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,959
i i find those are that's one of the

511
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,399
worst tragedies

512
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:22,399
uh tragedies of the pandemic is both the

513
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,039
opportunity to what okay the positive

514
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,198
thing

515
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,198
is to have more time with your family

516
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:27,439
you know sort of reconnect in many ways

517
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,078
and

518
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,880
that that's really interesting uh be

519
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,519
able to

520
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:35,198
remotely sort of not waste time on

521
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,839
travel and all those kinds of things the

522
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,639
negative

523
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,320
is actually both those things are also

524
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,240
sources of the negative uh

525
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,759
but the negative is like it seems like

526
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,120
people have multiplied the number of

527
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,159
meetings because they're so easy to

528
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,360
schedule

529
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:52,399
and there's nothing more draining

530
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,440
to me intellectually philosophically

531
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,919
just my spirit is destroyed

532
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,519
by even a 10-minute zoom meeting like

533
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,639
what are we doing here

534
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,240
what's the meaning of life yeah i have

535
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,399
every zoom meeting is i have an

536
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,560
existential crisis so kierkegaard with

537
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,559
the

538
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,399
so what the hell were we talking about

539
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,199
oh

540
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,919
so when you don't have meetings there's

541
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,799
a luxury to really

542
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,039
allow for certain things if they need to

543
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,439
like the important things

544
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:29,039
like deep work sessions to last way

545
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,120
longer than

546
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,120
you uh maybe planned for i mean that's

547
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,278
my goal is to try to schedule

548
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,360
the goals to schedule to sit and focus

549
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:40,320
for a particular task for an hour

550
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,839
and hope i can keep going yeah and hope

551
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,278
i can get lost in it

552
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,079
and uh do do you find that this is at

553
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,278
all

554
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,319
an okay way to go and uh the time

555
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,480
blocking is just

556
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,720
something you have to do to actually be

557
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,800
an adult and operate in this real world

558
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,759
or is there some magic to the time

559
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,599
blocking

560
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,800
well i mean there's magic to the

561
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,360
intention

562
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,519
uh there's magic to it if you have

563
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,160
varied responsibilities right so

564
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,359
i'm often juggling multiple jobs

565
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,959
essentially there's there's

566
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,798
academic stuff there's teaching stuff

567
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,400
there's book stuff there's the

568
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,480
the business surrounding you know

569
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,519
surrounding my my book stuff

570
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,959
but i'm of your same mindset if a deep

571
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,918
work session is going

572
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,759
well you just rock and roll and let it

573
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,360
go on so like one of the big keys of

574
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,640
time block at least the way i do it so i

575
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,879
even you know sell this

576
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,000
planner to help people time block it has

577
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,919
many columns because

578
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,759
the discipline is oh if your initial

579
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,120
schedule changes

580
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:38,798
you just move over one next time you get

581
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,918
a chance to move over one column

582
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,599
and then you just fix it for the time

583
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,080
that's remaining so in other words

584
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,959
there's not

585
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:46,079
there's no bonus for i made a schedule

586
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,360
and i stuck with it

587
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,119
like there's actually just like you get

588
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,399
a prize for it right like for me the

589
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,719
prize is

590
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,160
i have an intentional plan for my time

591
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,600
and if i have to change that plan that's

592
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,038
fine like the state i want to be

593
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,279
is basically at any point in the day

594
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,960
i've thought about what time remains and

595
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,079
and gave it some thought for what to do

596
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,000
because i'll do the same thing even

597
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:05,279
though i have a lot more

598
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,359
meetings and other types of things i

599
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,759
have to do in my various jobs and

600
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,959
i basically prioritize the deep work and

601
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,480
they get yelled at a lot

602
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,640
yeah so that's kind of my strategy is

603
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,240
like just be okay just be okay getting

604
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,600
yelled at a lot because i feel you if

605
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,960
you're rolling

606
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,639
yeah well that's that's what it is for

607
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
me like with writing i think it's

608
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,320
writing so hard in a certain way that

609
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,240
it's you don't really get on a roll in

610
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:30,319
some sense like it's just difficult

611
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,400
uh but working on proofs it's very hard

612
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,079
to pull yourself away from a proof if

613
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,360
you start to get some traction just

614
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,199
you've been at it for a couple hours

615
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,719
then you feel the uh the pins and

616
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,400
tumblers starting to click together and

617
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,000
progress is being made

618
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,440
it's really hard to call pull away from

619
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,038
that so so i'm willing to get yelled at

620
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,000
by almost everyone

621
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,720
of course there is also a positive

622
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,919
effect to

623
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,519
uh pulling yourself out of it when

624
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,520
things are going great because then

625
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,599
you're kind of excited to resume

626
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,200
yeah as opposed to stopping in a on a

627
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:03,199
dead end that's true

628
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,558
that there's a the yeah there's a

629
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,160
uh there's an extra force of

630
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:07,440
procrastination that comes with if you

631
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,840
stop on a dead end

632
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,640
to return to the task yeah or or a cold

633
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,879
start

634
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,200
yeah whenever i feel like i'm in a stage

635
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,520
now i submitted a few papers recently

636
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,480
so now we're sort of starting something

637
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,400
up from cold

638
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,079
and it takes way too long to get going

639
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,600
because it's very hard to

640
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,279
it's very hard to get the motivation to

641
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,678
schedule a time when it's not yeah we're

642
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:27,279
in it

643
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,400
like here's where we are we feel like

644
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,480
something's about to give here we need

645
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,160
the very early stages where it's just

646
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,360
i don't know i'm going to read hard

647
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,400
papers and it's going to be hard to

648
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,599
understand them and i'm going to have no

649
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,880
idea how to make progress

650
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,599
is not it's not motivating what about

651
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,080
deadlines

652
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,079
can we um okay so this is like a therapy

653
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:47,599
session uh

654
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,480
it's uh why it seems like i don't i only

655
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,759
get stuff done

656
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,599
that has deadlines and so the one of the

657
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:56,000
implied powerful things about time

658
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,558
blocking is there's a kind of deadline

659
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,919
or there's a artificial a real sense of

660
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,079
urgency

661
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,520
do you think it's possible to get

662
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,158
anything done in this world without

663
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,480
deadlines

664
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,840
why why do deadlines work so well well

665
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
it's i mean it's a clear motivational

666
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,279
signal

667
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,640
but in the in the short term you do get

668
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,480
an effect like that in time blocking i

669
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,360
think the the strong effect you get by

670
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,038
saying

671
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,359
this is the exact time i'm going to work

672
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,919
on this is that you don't have to debate

673
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,439
with yourself every three minutes about

674
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,720
should i take a break now right like

675
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,159
this is the big issue with just saying

676
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,120
you know i'm going to go right

677
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,559
i'm going to write for a while and

678
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,839
that's it because your mind is saying

679
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:30,558
well obviously we're going to take some

680
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,519
breaks

681
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,000
right we're not just going to write

682
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,038
forever and so why not right now

683
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
you have to be like well not right now

684
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:36,960
let's go a little bit longer five

685
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,079
minutes later we'll always take a break

686
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,640
now like we should probably look at the

687
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,918
internet

688
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,960
now you have to constantly have this

689
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,080
battle on the other hand if you're in a

690
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,600
time block schedule

691
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,960
like i've got these two hours put aside

692
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,918
for writing that's what i'm supposed to

693
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,159
be doing

694
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,679
i have a break scheduled over here i

695
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,200
don't have to fight with myself

696
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,038
right and maybe at a larger scale

697
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,400
deadlines give you a similar sort of

698
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,480
effect is i know this is what i'm

699
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,200
supposed to be working on because it's

700
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,200
uh it's due perhaps but we're describing

701
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,120
as much healthier

702
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,279
sort of giving yourself over you talk

703
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,199
about this in in the new email book

704
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,480
is the process i mean in general you

705
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,360
talk about it all over

706
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,759
is creating a process and then giving

707
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,038
yourself

708
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,640
over to the process the

709
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,879
but then you have to be strict with

710
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,840
yourself yeah but what are the deadlines

711
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,400
you're talking about it's like with

712
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,079
papers

713
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,679
like what's the main type of deadline

714
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:27,279
work

715
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,600
uh also papers definitely but

716
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,480
you know publications like say this this

717
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,599
podcast

718
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,759
uh i have to publish this podcast

719
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,519
next early next week one because your

720
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,640
book is coming out i'd love to

721
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:44,079
sort of uh support this amazing book but

722
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,280
the other is i have to fly to vegas

723
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,399
on thursday to run 48 miles with david

724
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,440
goggins

725
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,280
and so i want this podcast

726
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,798
this conversation we're doing now to be

727
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,158
out of my life

728
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,720
like i don't want to be in a hotel in

729
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,400
vegas yeah like uh editing the

730
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,919
like freaking out while david goggins is

731
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,400
yelling now we're on our 43

732
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,759
you're terrified but actually it's

733
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,519
possible that they still

734
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,879
will be doing that you know because

735
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,879
that's not a heart that's a softer

736
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,480
deadline right but those are sort of

737
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,320
the life imposes these kinds of

738
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,159
deadlines yeah

739
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,399
i'm not so yeah papers are nice because

740
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,520
there's an actual deadline

741
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,159
but i i'm almost referring to like

742
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,639
the pressure that people put on you hey

743
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,080
man

744
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,440
you said you're gonna get this done two

745
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:29,918
months ago why haven't you gotten it

746
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,519
done

747
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,200
i don't see i don't like that pressure

748
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,079
yeah i mean we now first i think we can

749
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,840
i hate it too

750
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,000
we can agree by the way having david

751
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:41,359
goggins yell at you is probably the

752
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,720
top productivity technique i think we'd

753
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,959
all get a lot more done if

754
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,360
he was yelling but see i don't like that

755
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,360
so i i will try to get things done early

756
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,119
i like i like having flex i also don't

757
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,439
like the idea of

758
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,239
this has to get done today right like

759
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,480
it's due

760
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,679
at midnight and we've got a lot to do as

761
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,599
the night before because then i get in

762
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,919
my head about what if i get sick

763
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,199
or like what if uh you know what if i i

764
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,559
don't i get a bad night's sleep and i

765
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,159
can't think clearly

766
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:07,839
so i like to have the flex so i'm all

767
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,440
processed and that's like the

768
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,879
philosophical aspect of that book deep

769
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,080
work is that there's something

770
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,679
very human and deep about just wrangling

771
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,199
with the world of ideas i mean aristotle

772
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,038
talked about this if you go back and

773
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,558
and read the ethics he's trying to

774
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,000
understand the meaning of life and he

775
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,279
eventually ends up ultimately

776
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,319
at the human capacity to contemplate

777
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,759
deeply

778
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,359
it's kind of a teleological argument

779
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,480
it's the things that only humans can do

780
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,918
and therefore it must be somehow

781
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,120
connected to our ends and he said

782
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,720
ultimately that's where

783
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,319
that's refound his meaning but you know

784
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,679
he's touching on some sort of intimation

785
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,038
there that's correct that

786
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,960
and so what i try to build my life

787
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:44,640
around is regularly thinking hard about

788
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,240
stuff that's interesting just like if

789
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,080
you get a fitness habit going

790
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,679
you feel off when you don't do it

791
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,439
i try to get that cognitive habit so

792
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,880
it's like i got it i mean look i have my

793
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
bag here somewhere i have my notebook in

794
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,760
it because

795
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,038
i was thinking on the uber ride over i

796
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:00,480
was like you know i could get some

797
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,960
i'm working on this new proof and it

798
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
just so you train yourself you train

799
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,558
yourself to appreciate certain things

800
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,200
and then over time the hope is that it

801
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,480
accretes well let's talk about some

802
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,480
demons because

803
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,679
i wonder it's okay there's like deep

804
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,120
work

805
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,600
which uh and the

806
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,639
the world without email books that to me

807
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,079
symbolize

808
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,799
the life i i want to live okay

809
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,599
and then there is i'm like despite

810
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,400
appearances

811
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:33,119
an adult at this point and this is the

812
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,159
life i actually live

813
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,678
and i it's i'm in constant chaos you

814
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,080
said you don't like that anxiety

815
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,120
i hate it too but it seems like i'm

816
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,240
always in it

817
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:46,399
it's a giant mess it's it's like

818
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,240
it it's almost like whenever i establish

819
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,200
whenever i have successful processes for

820
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,798
doing deep work

821
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,319
i'll add stuff on top of it just to

822
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,720
introduce the chaos yeah

823
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,519
and and like i don't want to yeah but

824
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,558
you know it's so

825
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,200
you have to look in the mirror at a

826
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:02,319
certain point and you have to say like

827
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,000
who the hell am i like i keep doing this

828
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,000
is this something that's fundamental to

829
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,679
who i am or do i really need to fix this

830
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,679
what's the chaos right now like i've

831
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,200
seen your video about like your routine

832
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,880
it seemed very

833
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,880
structured and deep in fact i was really

834
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,440
envious of it so like what's the chaos

835
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,960
now that's not in that video many of

836
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,759
those sessions go way longer

837
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,919
i don't get enough sleep yeah and then i

838
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,599
the main introduction of chaos is

839
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,679
it's taking on too many things on the

840
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,359
to-do list

841
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,038
it's i mean i suppose it's the problem

842
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,079
that everybody deals with was just

843
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,119
saying

844
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:37,599
not saying no but it's not like i have

845
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,959
trouble saying no it's that there's so

846
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,359
much cool in my life

847
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,640
yeah okay listen i've there's nothing i

848
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:46,000
love more in this world

849
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,679
than the boston dynamics robots

850
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,440
and the other yeah and they're giving me

851
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,440
spot so there's enough to do

852
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,880
what am i going to say no yeah and so

853
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,240
they're getting me spot and i want to do

854
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,240
some computer vision stuff for

855
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,359
for the hell of it okay so that's now

856
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,880
what to do item

857
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,719
and then you go to texas for a while and

858
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,320
there's texas and everything's happening

859
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,079
to all the interesting people down there

860
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,319
and then there's surprises right there

861
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,918
power outage in texas there's constant

862
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:08,480
changes to plans and all those kinds of

863
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,480
things

864
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,319
and you sleep less and then there's

865
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,558
personal stuff like just you know

866
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,480
people in your life sources of stress

867
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,399
all those kinds of things and

868
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,000
but it does feel like if i'm just being

869
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,720
introspective

870
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,319
that i bring it on to myself i suppose a

871
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,480
lot of people do this kind of thing

872
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:31,519
yes is they they flourish

873
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,159
under pressure yeah and i wonder if that

874
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,240
um if that's just the hack i've

875
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,679
developed as a habit

876
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,558
early on in life that needs you need to

877
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,798
let go of

878
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:43,918
you need to fix but it's all interesting

879
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,440
things

880
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,640
yeah that's that's that's interesting

881
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,360
yeah because these are all interesting

882
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,880
things

883
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,399
well one of the things you talked about

884
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,440
and deep work which is like really

885
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,840
important is like

886
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,960
having an end to the day yeah like

887
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,599
putting it down

888
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,960
yeah like that i don't think i've ever

889
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,959
done that in my life

890
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,079
yeah well see i started doing that early

891
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,640
because uh

892
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,079
i got married early so you know i didn't

893
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,520
have a real job i was a grad student but

894
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,918
my wife had a real job

895
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,720
and so i just figured i should do my

896
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,960
work

897
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,400
when she's at work because you know hey

898
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,640
when when works over she'll be home i

899
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,880
don't

900
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,880
i don't want to be you know on campus or

901
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,399
whatever and so real early on i just got

902
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,679
in that habit of

903
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:22,719
this is when you know this is when you

904
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,759
didn't work and then when i was a

905
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,480
postdoc

906
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,759
which is kind of an easy job right um i

907
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,000
put artificial

908
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,038
i was like i want to train i was like

909
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,319
when i'm a professor it's going to be

910
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:33,679
busier because there's

911
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,359
demands that professors have beyond

912
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,519
research and so as a postdoc

913
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,879
i added artificial large time consuming

914
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,398
things into the middle of my day i'd

915
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,039
basically exercise for two hours in the

916
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:42,719
middle of the day

917
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,398
and do all this this productive

918
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,399
meditation and stuff like this

919
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,079
while still maintaining the nine to five

920
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,319
so it's like okay i want to get really

921
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,439
good at putting artificial constraints

922
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,839
on so that i stay

923
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,360
i didn't want to get uh flabby when my

924
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,398
job was easy so that when i became a

925
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:57,839
professor

926
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:59,599
and now all of that's paying off because

927
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,678
i have a ton of kids so

928
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,959
so now i don't really have a choice

929
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,000
that's what's probably keeping me away

930
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,159
from cool things

931
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,200
is i just don't have time to do them and

932
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,039
then after a while people

933
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,240
you know stop bothering well but that

934
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:13,759
you know but that's how you have a

935
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,480
successful life otherwise you're going

936
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,158
to

937
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,519
it's too easy to then go into the full

938
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,440
hunter s thompson

939
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,918
yeah like to where no nobody

940
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,600
wants nobody functional wants to be in

941
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,759
your vicinity

942
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,199
like you're driving you attract the

943
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,480
people

944
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,880
that have a similar behavior pattern as

945
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,200
you

946
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,278
yeah so if you if you live in chaos

947
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,319
you're going to attract chaotic people

948
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,839
and then it becomes like this uh self

949
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,918
fulfilling prophecy yeah and it feels

950
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:48,398
like i'm not bothered by it

951
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,799
but i guess this is all coming around to

952
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,239
exactly what you're saying which is like

953
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:53,839
i think one of the big hacks for

954
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,880
productive people that i've met

955
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:59,199
is to get married and have kids

956
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,240
honestly it's it's very perhaps

957
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,840
counter-intuitive

958
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,720
yeah but it gets it's like the ultimate

959
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,158
timetable enforcer yeah it enforces a

960
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,120
lot of timetables

961
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,120
uh though it has a huge kids have a huge

962
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,398
productivity hit those he got away

963
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,079
but here okay here's the complicated

964
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:16,959
thing though like you could think about

965
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:18,398
in your own life

966
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,960
starting the podcast as one of these

967
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:21,678
just cool opportunities that you put on

968
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
yourself right

969
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,798
yeah like you know i could have been

970
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,399
talking to you at mit four years ago

971
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:27,839
and like don't do that like your

972
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,119
research is going well right

973
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,959
but then everyone who watches you is

974
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,319
like okay this podcast is the direction

975
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,519
that's taking you is like a couple years

976
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,918
from now

977
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,960
it's gonna it'll be something really

978
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,159
monumental that you're probably just

979
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
gonna probably lead to right there'll be

980
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,960
some

981
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,480
really it just feels like your life is

982
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,440
going somewhere it's going somewhere

983
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,038
it's interesting yeah

984
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,558
unexpected yeah yeah so how do you

985
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,079
balance those two things and

986
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,480
so what i try to throw at it is this

987
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:54,879
this motto of do less do better know why

988
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,480
right so do do less do better

989
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,000
know why it used to be the motto of my

990
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,720
website years ago

991
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,599
um so do a few things but like an

992
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,240
interesting array right so i was doing

993
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,639
mit stuff but i was also writing you

994
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,759
know

995
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,679
so a couple of things are you know they

996
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,359
were interesting like have a couple bets

997
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,559
placed on a couple different numbers on

998
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,398
the roulette table

999
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:15,839
but not too many things and then really

1000
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,038
try to do those things really well and

1001
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,558
and see where it goes like with my

1002
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:19,440
writing i just spent years and years and

1003
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:20,398
years just training

1004
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,759
i want to be a better writer i want to

1005
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,000
be a better writer i started writing

1006
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,519
student books when i was a student

1007
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,200
i really wanted to write hardcover idea

1008
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,519
books i started training i would

1009
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
i would use like new yorker articles to

1010
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,720
train myself i'd break them down and i'd

1011
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,880
get commissions with much smaller

1012
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,558
magazines and practice the skills and

1013
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,679
it took forever until you know but now

1014
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,119
today like i actually get to write for

1015
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,798
the new yorker but it took

1016
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,000
like a decade so a small number of

1017
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,960
things try to do them really well and

1018
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,480
then the know why

1019
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,120
is have a connection to some sort of

1020
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,278
value like in general i think

1021
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,479
this is worth doing uh and then seeing

1022
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:53,839
where it leads

1023
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,880
and so uh the choice of the few things

1024
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:59,359
is grounded in what like a little like a

1025
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,880
like a little flame of passion like a

1026
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,398
love for the thing like a sense that you

1027
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,039
say you wanted to write

1028
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:05,839
and get good at writing you had that

1029
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:07,839
kind of

1030
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,439
introspective moment of thinking this

1031
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,959
actually brings me a lot of joy

1032
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,240
and fulfillment yeah i mean it gets

1033
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,038
complicated because i wrote a whole book

1034
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,558
about

1035
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,398
following your passion being bad advice

1036
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:18,158
which is like the first thing i kind of

1037
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,038
got infamous for

1038
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,320
i wrote that back in 2012. but but the

1039
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:23,200
argument there is like passion

1040
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,678
cultivates right

1041
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,759
so what i was pushing back on was the

1042
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,720
myth that the passion for what you do

1043
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,398
exists full intensity before you start

1044
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,919
and then that's what propels you

1045
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:35,759
or actually the reality is as you get

1046
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,200
better at something as you gain more

1047
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:38,960
autonomy more skill and more impact the

1048
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,679
passion grows along with it so that when

1049
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,480
people

1050
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,759
look back later and say oh follow your

1051
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,200
passion what they really mean is i'm

1052
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:46,879
very passionate about what i do and

1053
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,240
that's a worthy goal

1054
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,600
but how you actually cultivate that is

1055
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,759
much more complicated than just

1056
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,199
introspection is going to identify

1057
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,640
like for sure you should be a writer or

1058
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,000
something like this so i was actually

1059
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,038
quoting you i was uh

1060
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,798
on a social network last night uh in

1061
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,558
clubhouse yeah i don't know if you've

1062
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:03,119
heard of it i was wait i have to ask you

1063
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:04,798
about this

1064
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,038
because i was invite i'm invited to do a

1065
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,720
clubhouse i don't know what that means

1066
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,720
a tech reporter has invited me to do a

1067
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,880
clubhouse about my new book

1068
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,079
uh that's awesome uh well let me know

1069
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,919
when because i'll show up

1070
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,278
but what is it okay so first of all let

1071
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,278
me just mention that i was in a

1072
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,839
clubhouse

1073
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,919
uh room last night and i kept plugging

1074
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:26,079
your exactly what exactly you said about

1075
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,240
uh passion so we'll talk about it it was

1076
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:31,918
a room that was focused on burnout

1077
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,480
okay but first clubhouse

1078
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,440
is a kind of fascinating place in terms

1079
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,759
of

1080
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,798
your mind would be very interesting to

1081
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,440
analyze this place

1082
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,440
because you know we talk about email we

1083
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,798
talk about social networks

1084
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,558
but clubhouse is something very

1085
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:47,918
different and i've encountered it in

1086
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,960
other places discord

1087
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,159
and so on that's voice only

1088
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,600
communication

1089
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,159
so it's a bunch of people in a room

1090
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,398
they're just now eyes closed

1091
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,200
all you hear is their voices real time

1092
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:01,119
real time

1093
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,038
live it only happens live you're

1094
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,038
technically not allowed to record

1095
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,398
but some people still do and you know

1096
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,480
especially when it's big

1097
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,678
big conversations but the whole point is

1098
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,120
that they're live

1099
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,080
and there's different structures like on

1100
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:16,798
discord it was so fascinating i

1101
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,879
have this discord server that would have

1102
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:20,960
hundreds of people in a room together

1103
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,720
right we're all just little icons that

1104
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,919
commute and i mute our mics

1105
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,720
okay and so you're sitting there not so

1106
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,759
it's it's just

1107
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,200
voices and you're able with hundreds of

1108
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,319
people

1109
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,720
to not interrupt each other but first of

1110
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:37,359
all

1111
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,278
like as a dynamic system yeah like you

1112
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,879
see icons just like mics muted or not

1113
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:41,440
muted basically yeah well so everyone's

1114
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,278
muted

1115
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,640
and they unmute and they start it starts

1116
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,640
flashing yeah

1117
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,840
and oh so you're like okay let me uh get

1118
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,440
precedence

1119
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,119
yeah so it's the digital equivalent of

1120
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,159
when you're in a conversation like a

1121
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:54,239
faculty meeting

1122
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,600
and you sort of like kind of make some

1123
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,399
noises like while the other person's

1124
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,079
finishing and

1125
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,759
so people realize like okay this person

1126
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,359
wants to talk next but now it's purely

1127
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,519
digital you see a flashing

1128
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:05,439
but in a faculty meeting which is very

1129
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,399
interesting like even as we're talking

1130
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,039
now

1131
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:11,199
there's a visual element that seems to

1132
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,838
increase the probability of interruption

1133
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,638
yeah when it's just darkness you

1134
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:17,358
actually

1135
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,119
listen better and you don't interrupt so

1136
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,878
like if you create a culture there's

1137
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,280
there's always going to be but

1138
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:25,598
they're they're actually exceptions

1139
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,320
everybody adjusts they kind of evolve to

1140
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,280
the

1141
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,039
the beat of the room okay that's one

1142
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,359
fascinating aspect like okay

1143
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,440
that's weird because it's different than

1144
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:39,279
like a zoom call where there's video

1145
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,838
yeah uh it's just audio you think video

1146
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,879
ads

1147
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:45,119
but actually seems like it subtracts the

1148
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:48,239
second aspect of it that's fascinating

1149
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,838
is when it's no video just audio there's

1150
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,158
an intimacy

1151
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,759
it's feel it's weird because with

1152
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,240
strangers

1153
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,520
it you you connect you know in a much

1154
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,639
more real way it's very

1155
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:02,079
it's similar to podcasts yeah but

1156
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,559
with a lot of people with a lot of

1157
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,440
people and new people huh and then you

1158
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,599
and they they bring okay first of all

1159
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,280
different voices like low voices and

1160
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,320
like high voices and

1161
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,560
and it's it's more difficult to judge in

1162
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,519
discord you couldn't even see

1163
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,559
uh the people it was a culture where you

1164
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,320
do funny

1165
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:23,920
profile pictures as opposed to your

1166
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,800
actual face your clubhouse it's your

1167
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,480
actual face

1168
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,640
so you can tell like as an older person

1169
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,000
younger person in discord you couldn't

1170
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:31,118
you just have to judge based on the

1171
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,920
voice

1172
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,880
but there's a there's something about

1173
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,920
the listening

1174
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,960
and the intimacy of being surprised by

1175
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,400
different strangers

1176
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,480
it feels almost like a party with

1177
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,119
friends and friends of friends you

1178
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,960
haven't met yet but you really like

1179
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,960
now clubhouse also has an interesting

1180
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,159
innovation where there's a large crowd

1181
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,880
that just listens

1182
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:56,559
and there's a stage and you can bring

1183
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,358
people up onto stage so

1184
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,320
only people on stage are talking and you

1185
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,559
can have like five

1186
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,240
six seven eight sometimes 20 30 people

1187
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,639
on stage and then you can also have

1188
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:09,039
thousands of people just listening i see

1189
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,559
so there's a i don't know a lot of

1190
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,159
people are being surprised by this

1191
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,440
why is it called a social network it

1192
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:15,279
seems like it doesn't have there's not

1193
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,039
social links there's not a

1194
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,680
feed that's trying to harvest attention

1195
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:22,400
it feels like a communication

1196
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:23,598
uh so the the social uh network aspect

1197
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,240
is you follow people

1198
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,920
yeah and the people you follow now this

1199
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:32,000
is like the first social network that's

1200
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,400
actually correct use of follow i think

1201
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,599
you're more likely to see the rooms

1202
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,280
they're in so there's a

1203
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,039
your feed is a bunch of rooms that are

1204
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,480
going on right now okay

1205
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:44,159
and the people you follow are

1206
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,519
the ones that will increase the

1207
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:46,239
likelihood that you'll see the room

1208
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,639
they're in

1209
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:51,279
and so the final result is like there's

1210
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,960
a list of really interesting rooms like

1211
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,359
uh i have all these i've been speaking

1212
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,079
russian quite a bit there's practicing

1213
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:59,920
uh but also just like talking politics

1214
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,280
and philosophy in russian

1215
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,200
i've never done that before but it

1216
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,880
allows me to connect with that community

1217
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:08,399
and then uh there's a community of like

1218
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,800
it's funny but like i'll go in a

1219
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,358
community of all african-american people

1220
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,839
talking about race and i'll be welcomed

1221
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,078
yeah

1222
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:16,960
i've never had like i've literally never

1223
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,079
been

1224
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,400
in a difficult conversation about race

1225
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,240
like with people from all over the place

1226
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,480
it's like fascinating and

1227
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,239
musicians jazz musicians i don't know

1228
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,679
you could say that a lot of other places

1229
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,559
could have created that culture i

1230
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,480
suppose

1231
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:35,119
uh twitter and facebook a lot for that

1232
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,599
culture but there's something about

1233
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,320
this network as it stands now because it

1234
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,920
ain't no android users

1235
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,838
it's probably just because it's iphone

1236
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,039
people yeah uh is there it's

1237
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:46,880
conspiratorial or something

1238
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,639
well like less listen i'm an android

1239
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,960
person so i i got an iphone just for

1240
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:54,400
this network yes it's funny yeah

1241
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,519
is for now it's all like there's very

1242
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,800
few trolls

1243
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:58,480
yeah there's very few people that are

1244
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,039
trying to manipulate the system and so

1245
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,800
on

1246
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,719
so i don't know it's it's interesting

1247
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,720
now the downside the reason you're going

1248
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:07,118
to hate it

1249
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,399
is because it's so intimate because it

1250
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,640
pulls you in

1251
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,599
and pulls in very successful people like

1252
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,639
you just

1253
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:19,119
ever like really successful productive

1254
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:21,759
very busy people uh it

1255
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,440
it it's a huge time sink it's very

1256
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,480
difficult to pull yourself out

1257
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,800
interesting you mean once you're in a

1258
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,320
room well no the uh leaving the room

1259
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,320
is actually easy the beautiful thing

1260
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,320
about a stage with multiple people

1261
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,519
there's a little button that says leave

1262
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,720
quietly okay

1263
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,000
so cultural uh no etiquette wise it's

1264
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,159
okay to just leave

1265
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,760
yeah so you're not in a room when it's

1266
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,039
just you and i it's a little awkward to

1267
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,680
believe if you're asking questions i'm

1268
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,759
just gonna

1269
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,838
yeah but and actually if you're being

1270
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,320
interviewed for the book

1271
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:50,960
that's weird because you're now in the

1272
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,119
event

1273
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,720
and you're supposed to but usually the

1274
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,640
person interviewing would be like okay

1275
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,319
it's time for you to go it's more normal

1276
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,559
but the the

1277
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,640
normal way to use the room it's like

1278
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,480
you're just opening the app

1279
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:05,759
and there'll be like i don't know sam

1280
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,960
harris

1281
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,839
uh eric weinstein

1282
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,800
um i think joe rogan showed up to the

1283
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:14,799
bill gates

1284
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,839
these people on stage just like randomly

1285
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,480
just plugged in

1286
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,440
and then you step up on stage listen

1287
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,800
maybe you won't

1288
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,240
contribute at all maybe you'll say

1289
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,039
something funny yeah and then you'll

1290
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:26,078
just leave

1291
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,599
yeah and there's uh the the addicting

1292
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,839
aspect to it the reason it's the time

1293
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,760
sink is you don't want to leave

1294
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:33,279
what i've noticed about exceptionally

1295
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,599
busy people yeah

1296
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,040
that they love this this the their i

1297
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,079
think might have to do with a pandemic

1298
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,000
because might be a little bit yeah

1299
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,320
there's a loneliness

1300
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,358
yeah but also it's really cool people

1301
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,960
yeah like

1302
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,880
when was when was the last time you

1303
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,199
talked to sam harris or whoever

1304
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,920
like you think of anybody uh tyler cope

1305
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,480
like

1306
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,720
any any faculty this is like what

1307
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,800
university strives to create

1308
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,319
but it's taken because you know here's a

1309
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,599
cultural evolution try to get a lot of

1310
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,559
interesting smart people together that

1311
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,838
run into each other

1312
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,480
we have really strong faculty in a room

1313
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:06,639
together

1314
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,000
with no scheduling this is the power of

1315
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,000
it it's like you just

1316
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,199
show up there's no none of that baggage

1317
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,280
of scheduling and so on

1318
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,960
and there's no pressure to leave uh

1319
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,720
sorry no pressure to stay

1320
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,838
it's very easy for you to leave you

1321
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:20,399
realize that there's a lot of

1322
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:23,519
constraints on meetings and like faculty

1323
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,079
there's uh like even stopping by

1324
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,000
you know before the pandemic a friend or

1325
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,280
faculty or colleague and so on

1326
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,280
you know there's a weirdness about

1327
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,720
leaving yeah but

1328
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,800
here there's not a weirdness about

1329
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:35,519
leaving so they've discovered something

1330
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,359
interesting

1331
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,719
the but the final result when you

1332
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:41,519
observe it

1333
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,279
is uh it's very fulfilling i think it's

1334
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,280
very beneficial

1335
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,640
but it's very addicting so you have to

1336
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,160
make sure

1337
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:52,239
you moderate yeah that's interesting and

1338
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:53,279
okay well so maybe i'll try it i mean

1339
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:54,799
look there's no

1340
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,560
the things that make me suspicious about

1341
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,960
other platforms aren't here

1342
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,799
so the feed is not full of

1343
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,240
user-generated content that is going

1344
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,760
through some sort of algorithmic grading

1345
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,199
process with all the weird incentives

1346
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,880
and nudging that does

1347
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:08,719
uh and you're you're not producing

1348
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,119
content that's being harvested

1349
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,039
to be monetized by another company i

1350
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,119
mean it it seems like it's more

1351
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,719
uh ephemeral right you're here you're

1352
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,680
talking the feed is just actually just

1353
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:19,039
showing you

1354
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,879
here's interesting things happening

1355
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,318
right you're not jocking in the feed for

1356
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,318
look i'm being clever or something and

1357
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:26,159
i'm going to get a light count that goes

1358
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:27,519
up and that's going to influence and

1359
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:29,279
right and there's more friction there's

1360
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,679
more cognitive friction i guess involved

1361
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,160
in

1362
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:33,279
listening to smart people versus

1363
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,719
scrolling through

1364
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,960
yeah there's something there so there's

1365
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,039
no why are people so i see a lot of

1366
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,240
there's all these articles that seem i

1367
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,679
haven't really read them but

1368
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:43,598
why are we why are reporters negative

1369
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,879
about this competition the new york

1370
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,640
times wrote this article called

1371
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,240
unfettered conversations happening on

1372
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:50,799
clubhouse is

1373
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,919
uh so i'm right in picking up a tone

1374
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,359
from even from the headlines that

1375
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,680
there's some like negative

1376
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:59,279
vibes from the press no so i can say

1377
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:00,879
let's say well i'll tell you what the

1378
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,720
article was saying

1379
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,720
which is uh they're having cancelable

1380
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,199
conversations like the biggest people in

1381
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,598
the world

1382
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:11,039
almost trolling the press right and the

1383
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,160
press is definitely before channing the

1384
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,559
press yeah

1385
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,159
the press but by saying that you just

1386
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:18,000
you guys are looking for click

1387
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,679
bait from our genuine human

1388
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,960
conversations and so

1389
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,960
so the i think the honestly

1390
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,000
the press is just like what do we do

1391
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,240
with this we can't

1392
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,519
yeah um first of all it's a lot of work

1393
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:32,318
for them okay

1394
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:34,400
uh it's what naval says which is like

1395
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,480
this is skipping the journalists

1396
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,318
like they interview you uh if you go on

1397
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,400
clubhouse the interview you might do

1398
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,000
for the book would be with somebody

1399
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,318
who's like a journalist and interviewing

1400
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,880
you

1401
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:46,400
yeah that that's more a traditional yeah

1402
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,119
it'd be a good introduction for you to

1403
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,800
try it

1404
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:53,920
but the like the way to use clubhouse

1405
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:57,280
is you just show up and it's like

1406
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,960
again like me i'm sorry i'm like

1407
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,880
i can't i keep mentioning sam harris as

1408
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,599
if it's like the only person i know but

1409
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,720
like a lot of these uh major faculty i

1410
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,880
don't know max tegmark

1411
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:08,639
like just just major faculty just

1412
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,200
sitting there and then you show up

1413
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,639
and then uh i'll ask like oh don't you

1414
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,318
have a book coming out or something

1415
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:15,519
and then you'll talk about the book and

1416
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:16,480
then you'll leave five minutes later

1417
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:18,719
because you have to go get

1418
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,880
coffee and interesting so like that's

1419
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,959
the yeah it's not the journalistic

1420
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,960
you're not gonna actually enjoy the

1421
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,599
interview as much because it'll be like

1422
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,199
the normal thing yeah like you're there

1423
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,559
40 minutes or an hour and there'll be

1424
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:32,719
questions from the audience

1425
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:34,159
right like i'm doing an event next week

1426
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:35,919
for the book launch where it's like

1427
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,239
jason fried and i are

1428
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,280
talking about email but it's using some

1429
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:40,719
more

1430
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,240
like a thousand people who are there to

1431
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:43,358
watch virtually but it's using some sort

1432
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,838
of traditional

1433
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:47,440
webinar clubhouse would be a situation

1434
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:48,960
where that could just happen informally

1435
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,000
like i jump in like jason's there and

1436
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,240
then someone else jumps in

1437
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,719
and and yeah that's interesting but for

1438
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:56,078
now it's still closed so

1439
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:58,078
even though there's a lot of excitement

1440
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,440
and there'll be quite

1441
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,839
famous people just sitting there

1442
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,318
listening to you yeah

1443
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,119
but the numbers aren't exactly high so

1444
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:07,920
you're talking about

1445
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,400
rooms like even the huge rooms are like

1446
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,240
just

1447
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,000
a few thousand right and this is this is

1448
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:12,479
probably soho in the 50s or something

1449
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,440
too

1450
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,920
just because of the exponential growth

1451
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,240
give it

1452
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,838
seven more months and if you let one

1453
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,598
invite be gets two invites because four

1454
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:23,279
invites begins pretty soon it'll be

1455
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,960
everyone and then the rooms in your feed

1456
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,040
are going to be whatever

1457
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,159
uh marketing performance enhancing drugs

1458
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,480
or something like that

1459
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,639
yeah but then and a bunch of competitors

1460
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,800
there's already like 30 plus competitors

1461
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,078
sprung up twitter spaces so twitter is

1462
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,000
creating a competitor

1463
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,280
that's going to likely destroy clubhouse

1464
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,400
yeah because they just have a much

1465
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,319
larger user base

1466
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,440
and they already have a social network

1467
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:46,239
so yeah i

1468
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,639
i i would be very cautious of course

1469
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:48,239
with the

1470
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,000
addictive element but it doesn't just

1471
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:52,000
like you said this particular

1472
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,199
implementation in its early stages

1473
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,400
doesn't have the like

1474
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,919
yeah the the uh well it doesn't have the

1475
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,160
context switching problem

1476
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,039
yeah it you'll just switch fantastically

1477
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,118
and you'll be stuck

1478
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,079
yeah the keep a context is great yeah

1479
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,480
yeah

1480
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,599
and but then i think the best way i've

1481
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,920
found to use it

1482
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,800
is uh to acknowledge that these things

1483
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,480
pull you in

1484
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,560
yeah so i've used it in the past

1485
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,920
uh like almost you know i'll go get a

1486
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:23,759
coffee and i'll tune into a conversation

1487
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,119
as if that's how i use podcasts

1488
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,119
sometimes i'll just like play a little

1489
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,440
bit of a podcast

1490
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,880
and then you know i can just turn it off

1491
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,079
the problem with these

1492
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,760
is it pulls you in it's really

1493
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,359
interesting and then the other problem

1494
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,240
that you will experience

1495
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:40,239
is like somebody will recognize you yeah

1496
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:42,559
and then they'll be like oh lex

1497
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,358
come on up come on no way i had a

1498
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:45,838
question for you

1499
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,480
and then it takes a lot for you to go

1500
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,199
like to

1501
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,960
to ignore that yeah yeah so yeah and

1502
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,559
then you pulled in and it's fascinating

1503
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,720
and it's really cool people so it's like

1504
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,119
a source of a lot of joy but

1505
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,000
it uh it's yet to be very very very

1506
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,079
careful

1507
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,920
the reason i brought it up is we uh

1508
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,599
there's a room there's an entire club

1509
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,519
actually on burnout and

1510
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,960
i brought you up and i brought david

1511
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:11,280
goggins as the process

1512
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,079
i go through which is you know my

1513
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,359
passion

1514
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:19,680
goes up and down it dips and

1515
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:21,838
i don't think i trust my own mind to

1516
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:22,879
to tell me whether i'm getting close to

1517
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:26,000
burnout or

1518
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,640
exhaustion or not i kind of go with the

1519
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,960
david goggins model of i mean he's

1520
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:33,598
probably more applying it to running but

1521
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,039
uh when it feels like your mind can't

1522
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,000
take any more

1523
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,800
that you're just 40 percent uh at your

1524
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,960
capacity

1525
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,560
i mean it's just like arbitrary levels

1526
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,838
the navy seal thing right the navy seal

1527
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:45,279
thing yeah i mean you could put that at

1528
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:48,078
any percent but it is

1529
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,920
remarkable that if you just take it one

1530
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,800
step at a time just keep going it's

1531
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,639
it's uh similar to this idea of a

1532
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,000
process if you just trust the process

1533
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:57,679
and you just keep following even

1534
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,639
if the passion goes up and down and so

1535
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:03,199
on then ultimately

1536
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:04,000
if you look in aggregate the passion

1537
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,439
will increase

1538
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,440
yeah your self-satisfaction will

1539
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,200
increase yeah i think and if you have

1540
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,480
two things this has been a big strategy

1541
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,879
of mine so that you can

1542
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,079
what you hope for is off phase off phase

1543
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,519
alignment like that

1544
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,680
sometimes it's in phase and that's a

1545
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:18,880
problem uh but off phase alignment's

1546
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:20,879
good so okay

1547
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,318
my research i'm struggling uh but my

1548
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,838
book stuff is going well

1549
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:25,199
right and so when you when you add those

1550
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:26,318
two waves together like oh we're doing

1551
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,078
pretty well and then

1552
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,119
uh in other periods like on my writing

1553
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,640
you know i feel like i'm just not

1554
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,240
getting anywhere but i've had some good

1555
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,480
papers i'm feeling good over there

1556
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,759
so having two things that they can

1557
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,599
counteract each other

1558
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,119
now sometimes they fall into sync and

1559
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,318
then it gets rough then when

1560
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,599
you know when everything because

1561
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:42,960
everything for me is cyclical you know

1562
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,838
good periods bad periods with all this

1563
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,480
stuff so

1564
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:47,440
uh typically they don't coincide so it

1565
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,599
helps compensate

1566
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,880
when they do coincide you get really

1567
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,000
high highs like where everything's

1568
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,838
clicking and then you get these really

1569
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,239
low lows where like your research is not

1570
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:57,358
working your program's not clicking

1571
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,838
you feel like you're nowhere with your

1572
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,639
writing uh and then it's a little

1573
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:03,119
rougher

1574
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:03,920
is do you do you think about the concept

1575
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,920
of burnout

1576
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,280
because i personally never experienced

1577
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,318
burnout in the way that

1578
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,640
folks talk about which is like it's not

1579
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:13,039
just

1580
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,719
the up and down it's like you don't want

1581
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:16,880
to do anything ever again

1582
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:18,639
yeah it like it's it's for some people

1583
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,599
it's like physical like to the hospital

1584
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:22,719
kind of thing

1585
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,720
yeah yeah so i do worry about it

1586
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:26,159
so when i used to do student writing

1587
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,358
like writing about students and student

1588
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,199
advice

1589
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:30,639
it came up a lot with students at elite

1590
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:32,239
schools and

1591
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,000
i used to call it deep procrastination

1592
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:37,039
but it was a real

1593
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,559
really vivid very replicatable

1594
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,318
syndrome where they stopped being able

1595
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,160
to do schoolwork yeah like

1596
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:43,759
this is due the professor gives you an

1597
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:45,118
extension and the professor goes to

1598
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,319
incomplete and says you got you

1599
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,400
you're going to fail the course you have

1600
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:50,639
to hand this in they can't do it

1601
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,240
right it's like it's a complete stop on

1602
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,598
the ability to actually do work

1603
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:55,039
so i used to counsel students who had

1604
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,318
that issue and often it was a

1605
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,199
combination of

1606
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,639
this is my best analysis is you have

1607
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:01,598
just the the physical and cognitive

1608
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:03,279
difficulties of

1609
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,480
they're usually under a very hard load

1610
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,920
right they're doing too many majors

1611
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,358
doing extracurriculars just you know

1612
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,159
really pushing themselves

1613
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:11,358
and the motivation is not sufficiently

1614
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,960
intrinsic

1615
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,400
right so if you have a motivational

1616
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,519
center that's not completely on board so

1617
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,639
a lot of these kids like when i'm

1618
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,639
dealing with mit kids

1619
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,480
they would be you know their whole town

1620
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:21,838
was shooting off fireworks that they got

1621
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,800
in there everyone's hoped that they were

1622
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:24,558
going there

1623
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,519
uh and that they're in three majors they

1624
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,800
don't want to let people down but

1625
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:28,000
they're not really interested in being a

1626
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,599
doctor or whatever

1627
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,119
so your motivation's not in the right

1628
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,720
place the motivational psychologist

1629
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,318
would say the locus of control was more

1630
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,639
towards the extrinsic end of

1631
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:37,759
the spectrum and you have hardship and

1632
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:38,639
you could just fritz out the whole

1633
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,079
system

1634
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:41,679
and so i would always be very worried

1635
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,079
about that so i think about that a lot

1636
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:45,279
i do a lot of multi-phase or multi-scale

1637
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,000
seasonality

1638
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,079
so i'll go hard on something for a while

1639
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,838
and then for a few weeks go easy

1640
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,280
i'll have semesters that are hard and

1641
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,039
semesters that are easier i'll take the

1642
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,160
summer really low so on multiple scales

1643
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:57,440
and in the day i'll go really hard on

1644
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,358
something but then have a hard cut off

1645
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,838
at five so like every scale

1646
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,119
it's all about rest and recovery because

1647
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:04,799
i really want to avoid that and i do

1648
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,480
burn out i burnt out

1649
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,160
pretty recently i get minor burnt outs i

1650
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,679
got a paper

1651
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:11,279
a couple papers that was trying to work

1652
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:13,919
through for a deadline

1653
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,480
a few weeks ago and i wasn't sleeping

1654
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,400
well

1655
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,240
and and um there's some other things

1656
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,079
going on and it just

1657
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,358
it knocks out and i get sick usually

1658
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,839
it's how i know i've pushed myself too

1659
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:23,358
far

1660
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:24,558
yeah and so i kind of pulled it back now

1661
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:25,838
i'm doing this book launch then after

1662
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,480
this book launch i'm pulling it back

1663
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:28,480
again

1664
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,920
so i like i seasonality for rest and

1665
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,199
recovery i think it's crucial

1666
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,960
and at every scale daily monthly

1667
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,399
you know and then at the annual scale an

1668
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,519
easy summer for example i think it's

1669
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,559
like a great idea

1670
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,519
if that's possible okay you just made me

1671
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,839
realize that

1672
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,358
that's exactly what i do because i i

1673
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:45,679
feel like i'm not even close to burning

1674
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:49,519
out

1675
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:51,519
anything even though i i'm in chaos yeah

1676
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:53,599
i feel the right exact ways of

1677
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,480
seasonality is the

1678
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,800
not not even the seasonality but like

1679
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,880
you

1680
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,920
always have multiple seasons operating

1681
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,200
it's like you said like

1682
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,119
because when you have a lot of cool

1683
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:04,480
going on yeah you there's

1684
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,240
always at least one thing that's a

1685
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,039
source of joy

1686
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,719
that there's always a reason i suppose

1687
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:12,239
the fundamental thing

1688
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,719
and i've known people that suffer from

1689
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,078
depression too the fundamental problem

1690
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:17,679
with the like the experience of

1691
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,119
depression and burnout

1692
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:24,399
is like why do like life is meaningless

1693
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,440
yeah and i always have an answer of like

1694
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,079
why

1695
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,720
why today could be cool yeah and yeah

1696
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,318
and you have to

1697
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,838
contrive it right if you don't have it

1698
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:32,960
you have to contrive it yeah i think

1699
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:35,119
it's really important

1700
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,119
like okay well this is going bad so now

1701
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,880
is the time to start thinking about

1702
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,480
i mean look i started a podcast during

1703
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,480
the pandemic it's like

1704
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,119
this is going pretty bad but you know

1705
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,119
what this could be something

1706
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,960
really interesting deep questions with

1707
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,150
colony abortion

1708
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,240
i do it all in that voice

1709
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:54,000
[Laughter]

1710
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:56,159
i love the podcast by the way but uh

1711
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,639
yeah i think david foster wallace said

1712
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,199
uh

1713
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,799
the key to life is to be unborable i

1714
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,598
i've always kind of

1715
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,000
taken that to heart which is like you

1716
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,200
should be

1717
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,719
able to maybe artificially generate

1718
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:13,838
anything like uh

1719
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:15,679
find something in your environment

1720
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:17,279
in your surroundings that's a source of

1721
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:20,078
joy like everything is fun

1722
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,359
yeah like did you read the pale king it

1723
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,960
goes deep on boredom

1724
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:24,799
it means it's like uncomfortable it's

1725
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,519
like an uncomfortable meditation on

1726
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,200
boredom

1727
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,838
like the characters in that are just

1728
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,598
driven to the like extremes of

1729
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:33,199
i just bought three books on boredom the

1730
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,640
other day uh

1731
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:36,159
so now i'm really interested in this

1732
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:37,039
topic because i was anxious about my

1733
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:38,558
book launch

1734
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,239
happening this week so i was like okay i

1735
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,960
need something else so i have this idea

1736
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:42,719
for a

1737
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,440
i might do as an article first but as a

1738
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:47,118
book like okay i need something cool

1739
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,639
to be thinking about because i was

1740
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,240
worried about like i don't know oh yeah

1741
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:51,358
is the launch going to work the pandemic

1742
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:52,558
what's going to happen i don't know if

1743
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:53,920
it's going to get there so i

1744
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,200
this is exactly what we're talking about

1745
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,838
so i went out and i bought a bunch of

1746
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:58,159
books

1747
00:52:55,838 --> 00:53:00,000
and i'm beginning like a whole uh sort

1748
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:02,239
of intellectual exploration

1749
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,760
well i think that's one of the profound

1750
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:06,558
ideas and deep work

1751
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,359
that you don't expand on uh too much is

1752
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,880
uh

1753
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:12,400
boredom yeah well so deepwork had a

1754
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,160
superficial idea

1755
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,838
about boredom which was i had this

1756
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:18,239
chapter called embrace boredom

1757
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:19,519
and a very functionalist idea was

1758
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:20,719
basically

1759
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:22,800
you have to have some boredom in your

1760
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,879
regular schedule or your mind is going

1761
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,280
to form a pavlovian connection

1762
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,318
between as soon as i feel boredom i get

1763
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,519
stimuli

1764
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:30,800
and once it forms that connection it's

1765
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:31,599
never going to tolerate deep work so

1766
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,880
there's this very

1767
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,559
pragmatic treatment of boredom of your

1768
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,920
mind better be used to the idea that

1769
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,119
sometimes you don't get stimuli because

1770
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,599
otherwise you can't write for three

1771
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,599
hours

1772
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,200
like it's just not going to tolerate it

1773
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,480
but more more recently what i'm really

1774
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:46,719
interested in boredom is it as a

1775
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,079
fundamental human drive

1776
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:50,399
right because it's incredibly

1777
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,839
uncomfortable and think about the other

1778
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,119
things that are incredibly uncomfortable

1779
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:55,599
like hunger or thirst

1780
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,440
they serve a really important purpose

1781
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,960
for a species right like if something is

1782
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,400
really distressing there's a reason pain

1783
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,800
is really uncomfortable because we need

1784
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,800
to

1785
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,000
worry about getting injured thirst is

1786
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,359
really uncomfortable because we need

1787
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,519
water to survive

1788
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:08,558
so what's boredom why is that

1789
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:10,800
uncomfortable

1790
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,000
and and i've been interested in this

1791
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,440
notion that

1792
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,318
boredom is about driving us towards

1793
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,679
productive action like as a species i

1794
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:21,599
mean think about it like what

1795
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:23,519
what got us to actually take advantage

1796
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,280
of these brains what got us to actually

1797
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,599
work with fire what got us to start

1798
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,800
shaping stones and the hand axes and

1799
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,599
figuring out if we could actually

1800
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,440
sharpen a stick

1801
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,519
sharp enough that we could throw it as a

1802
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,119
melee weapon or a distance weapon for

1803
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:38,159
hunting mammoth right

1804
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,599
boredom drives us towards action so now

1805
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,039
i'm fascinated by this fundamental

1806
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,559
action instinct

1807
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:44,400
uh because i have this theory that i'm

1808
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,160
working on that

1809
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,838
we're out of sync with it just like we

1810
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,279
got we have this drive for hunger but

1811
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:50,719
then we introduced junk food and got out

1812
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,559
of sync with hunger and it makes us

1813
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:54,558
really unhealthy we have this drive

1814
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,000
towards action but then we we overload

1815
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,920
ourselves and we have all of these

1816
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,798
distractions and then that causes

1817
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,240
uh it's like a cognitive action obesity

1818
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:03,599
type thing because it short-circuits

1819
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:04,719
this system that wants us to do things

1820
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,079
but we put more things in our plate than

1821
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:07,439
we can possibly do and then we're really

1822
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,720
frustrated we can't do them

1823
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,079
and we're short-circuiting all of our

1824
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:11,358
wires so it all comes back to this

1825
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,760
question

1826
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:17,279
well what would be the ideal the ideal

1827
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,799
sort of amount of stuff to do and type

1828
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,559
of things to do like if we wanted to

1829
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:22,639
look back at our ancestral environment

1830
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,839
and say if i could just build from

1831
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:25,358
scratch

1832
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:27,679
what type how much work i do and what i

1833
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:28,798
work on to be as in touch with that as

1834
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:30,159
like paleo people are trying to get

1835
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:31,039
their diets in touch with that and so

1836
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:32,159
now i'm just

1837
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,119
let's see this is i'm just it's

1838
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,879
something i made up yeah but now i'm

1839
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,240
going deep on it and one of my podcast

1840
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,798
listeners i was talking about on the

1841
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,239
show and

1842
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:41,838
i was like well i kept trying to learn

1843
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,118
about animals and boredom and she sent

1844
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,798
me this cool article from

1845
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,880
an animal behaviorist journal about what

1846
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:48,719
we know about human boredom versus

1847
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,920
animal boredom so trying to figure out

1848
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,639
that puzzle

1849
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,079
is uh the wave that's high so i can get

1850
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:55,279
through the wave that's low of like i

1851
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,039
don't know about this pandemic book

1852
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,200
launch and yeah

1853
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,798
and my research my research is stumbling

1854
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:03,598
a little bit because of the pandemic and

1855
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:05,199
so i needed a nice you know high so

1856
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,000
there we go there's a case study

1857
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:09,439
well the is both a case study and a very

1858
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,798
interesting set of concepts because i

1859
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,079
didn't even realize that

1860
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:16,239
it's so simple i'm one of the people

1861
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,318
that uh

1862
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:19,919
has a interesting push and pull dynamic

1863
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:22,639
with hunger trying to understand the

1864
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,480
hunger with myself like i probably have

1865
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,639
an unhealthy relationship with food

1866
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,240
i don't know but there's probably

1867
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,279
probably a perfect

1868
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:35,118
that's a nice way to think about diet as

1869
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:38,640
action there's probably an optimal risk

1870
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,440
diet response to the the experience that

1871
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:41,519
our body's

1872
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,119
telling us the signal that a body's

1873
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:45,599
sending which is hunger

1874
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:46,720
and in that same way boredom is sending

1875
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,880
a signal

1876
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:49,838
and most of our intellectual activities

1877
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,559
in this world

1878
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:54,318
our creative activities are essentially

1879
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:57,680
a response

1880
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:58,159
uh to that signal yeah and think about

1881
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:00,399
this

1882
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:01,519
analogy that we have this hunger

1883
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,920
instinct that

1884
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,559
junk food short circuits yes right it's

1885
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,720
like oh

1886
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,160
we'll satisfy that hyper palatably and

1887
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,558
it doesn't end up well

1888
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:11,759
now think about modern attention

1889
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,559
engineered

1890
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,839
digitally-mediated entertainment we have

1891
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,760
this board of instinct

1892
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:19,199
oh we can we can take care of that with

1893
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,119
a hyperpalatable

1894
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,118
alternative is that going to lead to a

1895
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,559
similar problem so i've been fasting a

1896
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,760
lot lately like

1897
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:29,519
i'm doing um eating once a day i've been

1898
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,960
doing that for over a month

1899
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,679
just eating one meal a day and primarily

1900
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,159
meat

1901
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:37,279
but it's very fasting has been

1902
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:40,159
incredible

1903
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,720
for me for focus for well-being for a

1904
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:42,159
few

1905
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,078
i don't i don't know just for feeling

1906
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:45,598
good okay we'll put on a chart what

1907
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:49,280
makes me feel good

1908
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:51,440
and uh that fasting and eating primarily

1909
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,319
meat-based diet makes me feel really

1910
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,599
good

1911
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:58,639
and so but that ultimately

1912
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,760
what fasting did i haven't fasted super

1913
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:02,078
long yet like a seven

1914
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:05,200
day diet which i really like to do but

1915
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:08,400
even just fasting for a day for 24 hours

1916
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:09,838
gets you in touch with your with this

1917
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,760
signal

1918
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:14,000
it's fascinating like you get to listen

1919
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,799
to your you learn to listen to your body

1920
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,519
that like you know it's okay to be

1921
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:19,119
hungry

1922
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:21,199
it's like a little signal that sends you

1923
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:24,160
stuff and then and then uh

1924
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:24,879
i get to listen to how it responds when

1925
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:28,399
i

1926
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,880
put food in my body like and i get to

1927
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,079
like

1928
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,640
okay cool so like food is the thing

1929
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,680
that pacifies the signal like it sounds

1930
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:36,798
ridiculous okay yeah

1931
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,039
you could do that with and do different

1932
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:40,960
types of food it feels different so you

1933
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:44,000
learn about what your body

1934
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,159
wants for some reason fasting

1935
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,280
it's similar to the deep work embrace

1936
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:49,759
boredom

1937
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,280
fasting allowed me to go into mode of

1938
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,920
listening of trying to understand the

1939
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,680
signal

1940
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:58,559
that i could say i have an unhealthy

1941
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,440
appreciation of fruit okay i love apples

1942
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,280
and cherries

1943
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,798
like i don't know how to moderate them

1944
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,000
so if you take just same amount of

1945
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:06,079
calories i don't know

1946
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
calories matter but they say calories 2

1947
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:11,280
000 calories of cherries

1948
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,599
versus 2 000 calories of steak

1949
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,599
if i eat 2 000 calories of steak maybe

1950
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,039
just a little bit of like green beans or

1951
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:20,720
cauliflower

1952
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:23,599
i'm going to feel really good fulfilled

1953
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:24,318
focused and happy yeah if i cherries i'm

1954
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,318
going to be

1955
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:27,679
i'm going to wake up behind a dumpster

1956
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:30,960
crying with like

1957
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,960
naked and like it's just all around

1958
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,000
with everything yeah and it's just like

1959
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,599
bloated

1960
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,639
just not and unhappy and also

1961
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:43,440
the mood swings up and down i don't know

1962
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,558
uh and i'll be much hungrier the next

1963
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,240
day

1964
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,160
sometimes it takes a couple days but

1965
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:51,439
when i introduce carbs into the system

1966
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:53,519
too many carbs i it starts

1967
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,280
it's just unhealthy i go into this

1968
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:57,358
roller coaster as opposed to a calm

1969
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,480
boat ride along the river in the amazon

1970
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:01,440
or something like that yeah

1971
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,838
so fasting was the mechanism of for me

1972
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,838
to start listening to the body

1973
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:07,279
i wonder if you can do that same kind of

1974
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:07,759
i guess that's what meditation a little

1975
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,920
bit is

1976
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,680
a little bit but yeah listen to boredom

1977
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,440
but so two years ago i had a book out

1978
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:14,798
called digital minimalism

1979
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,200
and one of the things i was recommending

1980
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:18,318
that people do is basically a 30-day

1981
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:20,318
fast

1982
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:21,358
but from digital personal entertainment

1983
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:24,079
social media online

1984
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:26,239
videos anything that captures uh your

1985
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,400
attention and dispels boredom

1986
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,279
and people were thinking like oh this is

1987
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,880
a detox

1988
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,720
like i just want to teach your body not

1989
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,079
to need the distraction to do that but

1990
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:36,239
it really wasn't what i was interested

1991
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:38,318
in i wanted there to be

1992
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,879
space that you could listen to your

1993
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:42,880
boredom like okay i can't just dispel it

1994
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,400
i can't just look at the screen and

1995
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,480
revel in it a little bit and start to

1996
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,039
listen to it and say what is this really

1997
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,639
pushing me towards and you take the new

1998
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:52,239
stuff the new technology off the table

1999
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:53,759
and sort of ask what is this

2000
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:55,759
what am i craving like what's the

2001
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,680
activity equivalent of

2002
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,200
2 000 calories of meat with a little bit

2003
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:01,118
of green beans on the side

2004
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:03,199
and i had 1700 people go through this

2005
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,640
experiment like spend 30 days doing this

2006
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:07,039
and it's hard at first but then they get

2007
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:08,400
used to listening to themselves and sort

2008
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,519
of seeking out what is this really

2009
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,200
pushing me towards

2010
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:13,280
and it was pushing people towards

2011
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:15,358
connection was pushing people towards

2012
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,119
i just want to go be around other people

2013
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,440
it was pushing people towards

2014
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,160
high quality leisure activities like i

2015
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,838
want to go

2016
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:23,358
do something that's complicated and it

2017
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:24,880
took weeks sometimes for them to get in

2018
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:27,679
touch with their boredom

2019
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,559
but then it completely rewired how they

2020
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,759
thought about

2021
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,200
what do i want to do with my time

2022
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,160
outside of work and then the idea is

2023
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:33,199
when you were done with that then it was

2024
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:34,798
much easier to go back

2025
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:37,199
and completely change your digital life

2026
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:38,559
because you have alternatives right

2027
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:39,679
you're not just trying to abstain from

2028
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,519
things you don't like

2029
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:43,199
but that's basically listening to

2030
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,599
boredom experiment like just

2031
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,519
be there with the boredom and see where

2032
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,960
it drives you when you don't have

2033
01:01:47,519 --> 01:01:50,880
you know the digital cheez-its okay so

2034
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,079
if i can't do that

2035
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,880
where is it going to drive me well i

2036
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,960
guess i kind of want to go to the

2037
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,880
library which came up a lot by the way a

2038
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,559
lot of people rediscovered the library

2039
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,318
you know physical books physical books

2040
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,079
like you can just go borrow them

2041
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:03,519
and like it there's like low pressure

2042
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:04,318
and you can explore and you bring them

2043
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,599
home and then you

2044
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:06,798
read them and you can like sit by the

2045
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,400
window and read them and it's nice

2046
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:09,440
weather outside and i used to do that 20

2047
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,519
years ago

2048
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,880
they're listening to boredom so can you

2049
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:15,038
maybe elaborate a little bit

2050
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,160
on the different experiences that people

2051
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,240
had when they quit

2052
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:20,639
social media for 30 days like is that if

2053
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:23,919
you were to recommend that process

2054
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:26,159
what is ultimately the goal yeah digital

2055
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,559
minimalism that's that's my philosophy

2056
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,558
for all this tech and it's working

2057
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,240
backwards from what's important

2058
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,599
so it's you figure out what you're

2059
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:34,879
actually all about like what you want to

2060
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,680
do what you want to spend your time

2061
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,838
doing

2062
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:39,440
and then you can ask okay is there a

2063
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,480
place that tech can amplify or support

2064
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,720
some of these things and that's how you

2065
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,199
decide what tech to use

2066
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:46,959
and so the the process is let's actually

2067
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:48,318
get away from everything let's be bored

2068
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,599
for a while let's let's really spend a

2069
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:50,798
month getting really figuring out what

2070
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,000
do i actually want to do

2071
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:53,759
what do i want to spend my time doing

2072
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,880
what's important to me you know what

2073
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,400
makes me feel good and then when you're

2074
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,480
done you can bring back in tech very

2075
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,559
strategically to help those things right

2076
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,000
and that was the goal that turns out to

2077
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:05,359
be much more successful than when

2078
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,679
people take a abstention only approach

2079
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:08,558
so if you come out your tech life and

2080
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:09,838
say

2081
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,599
you know whatever i look at instagram

2082
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:12,639
too much like i don't like how much i'm

2083
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,480
on instagram

2084
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,159
that's a bad thing i want to reduce this

2085
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,280
bad thing so here's my new thing i'm

2086
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,920
going to spend less time looking at

2087
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,599
instagram

2088
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,159
much less likely to succeed in the long

2089
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:22,480
term so we're much less likely at trying

2090
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:24,239
to

2091
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,599
reduce this sort of amorphous negative

2092
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:27,279
because you know in the moment

2093
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,960
yeah but it's not that bad it would be

2094
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,640
kind of interesting to look at it now

2095
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,920
when you're instead controlling behavior

2096
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:33,279
because you have a positive that you're

2097
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,720
aiming towards it's very powerful for

2098
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,839
people like i want my life to be like

2099
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:37,759
this

2100
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:39,038
here's the role that tech plays in that

2101
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,319
life

2102
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,319
the connection to wanting your life to

2103
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:44,000
be like that is very very strong

2104
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,599
and then much much easier say yeah like

2105
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,880
using instagram is not part of my plan

2106
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,079
for how i have that life and i really

2107
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,358
want to have that life so of course i'm

2108
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,559
not going to use instagram so it turns

2109
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,558
out to be a much

2110
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,720
more sustainable way to tame what's

2111
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:57,280
going on so if you quit social media for

2112
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:59,519
30 days you kind of have to

2113
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,519
do the work you have to do the work of

2114
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:03,838
thinking like what am i actually

2115
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:05,599
what makes me happy in terms of uh these

2116
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:08,798
tools that i've previously used

2117
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:10,798
and when you try to integrate them back

2118
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:12,000
how can i integrate them to maximize the

2119
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:14,318
thing they actually make yeah or what

2120
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,519
makes me happy unrelated to technology

2121
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:16,719
like what do i actually what do i want

2122
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:17,440
my life to be like well maybe what i

2123
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,959
want to do is be

2124
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,240
you know outside of nature two hours a

2125
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,000
day and spend a lot more time like

2126
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:23,919
helping my community and sacrificing on

2127
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,400
behalf of my connections and then have

2128
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,240
some sort of intellectually engaging

2129
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,599
leisure activity like i'm reading or

2130
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,798
trying to read the great books and

2131
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,400
having more calm and

2132
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:33,838
seeing the sunset like you you create

2133
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,280
this picture

2134
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:36,639
and then you go back and say well i

2135
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,359
still need my facebook group because

2136
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:39,838
that's how i

2137
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:40,719
i keep up with my cycling group but

2138
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:42,239
twitter is just

2139
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:44,159
you know toxic it's not helping any of

2140
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,519
these things and well i'm an artist so

2141
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:47,038
i kind of need instagram to get

2142
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:48,000
inspiration but if i know that's why i'm

2143
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,359
using instagram

2144
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,960
i don't need it on my phone it's just on

2145
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:53,199
my computer and i just follow 10 artists

2146
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,639
and check it once a week like you really

2147
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:55,919
can start to point it was the number one

2148
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:58,159
thing that differentiated in that

2149
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,079
experiment the people who ended up

2150
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:02,000
sustainably making changes and getting

2151
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:03,039
through the 30 days and those who didn't

2152
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,719
was the people who did the

2153
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:07,440
experimentation and the reflection like

2154
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:08,798
let me try to figure out what's positive

2155
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,639
they were much more successful than the

2156
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:11,679
people that just said i'm sick of using

2157
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:12,879
my phone so much

2158
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,879
so i'm just gonna white knuckle it just

2159
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,400
30 days will be good for me i just gotta

2160
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,720
just gotta get away from it or something

2161
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,680
it doesn't last so you don't use social

2162
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:22,078
media currently

2163
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:24,318
yeah of do you find that a lot of people

2164
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:28,240
go into this process

2165
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:29,279
will uh will seek to basically arrive at

2166
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:30,959
a similar place

2167
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,680
to not use social media primarily about

2168
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,880
half right so so about half when they

2169
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,679
went through this exercise and these

2170
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,680
aren't

2171
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:39,358
quantified numbers you know this is just

2172
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:42,000
they sent me reports and

2173
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:42,480
yeah that's pretty good though so 1700

2174
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,920
yeah

2175
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,519
yeah so so roughly half probably got rid

2176
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,880
of social media altogether once they did

2177
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:51,038
this exercise they realized these things

2178
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,160
i care about i don't

2179
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,319
social media is not the tools that's

2180
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:56,000
really helping the other half

2181
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,759
kept some there are some things in their

2182
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
life where some social media was

2183
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,319
useful but the key thing is if they knew

2184
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,639
why they were deploying social media

2185
01:06:02,318 --> 01:06:06,079
they could put fences around it so for

2186
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:06,960
example of those half that kept some

2187
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,079
social media

2188
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,000
almost none of them kept it on their

2189
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:11,839
phone oh interesting

2190
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,798
yeah so i can't optimize if you don't

2191
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:13,920
know what it is the function you're

2192
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:14,559
trying to optimize so it's like this

2193
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,838
huge hack

2194
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,839
like once you know this is why i'm using

2195
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:18,960
twitter then you can have a lot of rules

2196
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:20,719
about how you use twitter

2197
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,318
and and suddenly you take this cost

2198
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:24,399
benefit ratio and it goes like

2199
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:25,679
way from the company's advantage and way

2200
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,039
over towards your advantage

2201
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:29,519
it's kind of fascinating because i've

2202
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,640
been torn with social media but i did

2203
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,079
this kind of process i

2204
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:34,318
haven't actually done it for 30 days

2205
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,079
which i probably should i'll do it for

2206
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:36,798
like a week at a time and regularly and

2207
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,400
thinking

2208
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:42,079
what what kind of approach to twitter

2209
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,440
works for me

2210
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:48,720
uh what up i'm distinctly aware

2211
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:51,679
of the fact that i really enjoy

2212
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,239
posting once or twice a day and at that

2213
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:55,279
time

2214
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:57,519
checking from the previous post it

2215
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,319
like it makes me feel even when there's

2216
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:01,280
like

2217
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:02,798
negative comments they go right past me

2218
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,079
and when there's positive comments makes

2219
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:06,000
you smile i feel like

2220
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:08,000
love and connection with people

2221
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,519
especially people i i know but even just

2222
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,079
in general it's like it makes me feel

2223
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:14,079
like the world is full of awesome people

2224
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,280
okay when you increase that from

2225
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,039
checking from two to

2226
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,960
like i don't know what the threshold is

2227
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,440
for me but probably like five or six

2228
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,240
per day it starts going into anxiety

2229
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,639
world like

2230
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,439
where negative comments will actually

2231
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:28,639
stick

2232
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,798
to me mentally uh and

2233
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:32,239
and positive comments will feel more

2234
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:34,559
shallow

2235
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:36,078
yeah yeah it's it's kind of fascinating

2236
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:39,200
so i uh

2237
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:42,480
i've i've been trying to there's been

2238
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:44,078
long stretches of time i think december

2239
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,960
and january where i did just

2240
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:48,240
post and check post and check that was

2241
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,199
that makes me

2242
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:52,479
really happy most of 2020 i did that

2243
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:55,598
made me really happy

2244
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:57,119
recently i started like i'll go

2245
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,440
you know you go right back in like a

2246
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,640
drug addict well you check it like

2247
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,240
i don't know what that number is but

2248
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,038
that number is high not good you don't

2249
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:04,558
come out happy

2250
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,200
and you don't no one comes out of a day

2251
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:09,839
full of twitter celebrating humanity

2252
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:11,199
and it's not even because i'm very

2253
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:12,239
fortunate to have a lot of just like

2254
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:14,879
positivity in my

2255
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:17,838
the twitter but i there's just the

2256
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:19,920
general anxiety i wouldn't even say

2257
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:21,039
i wouldn't even say it's uh it's

2258
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,480
probably the thing that you're talking

2259
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:25,600
about with the contact switching

2260
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:26,879
it's almost like an exhaustion

2261
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,640
i i wouldn't even say it's like a

2262
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,560
negative feeling it's almost just an

2263
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,039
exhaustion to where i'm not creating

2264
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,839
anything

2265
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:35,119
beautiful in my yeah life just exhausted

2266
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:37,600
an existential exhaustion

2267
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:39,358
existential exhaustion but i wonder do

2268
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,520
you think it's possible to use

2269
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,480
from the people you've seen from

2270
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,000
yourself to

2271
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:46,079
to use social media and the way i'm

2272
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,920
describing moderation or is it always

2273
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:49,359
going to become

2274
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,239
when people do this exercise you get

2275
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:54,400
lots of lots of configurations

2276
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:55,919
so for people that have a public

2277
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,358
presence for example

2278
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,279
like what you're doing is not that not

2279
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:01,600
that unusual okay i

2280
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,759
i post one thing a day and my audience

2281
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,880
likes it and and that's kind of it

2282
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:06,798
which but you've thought through like

2283
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,159
okay this supports something i value

2284
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:11,278
which is like having a sort of

2285
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:14,479
informal connection with my audience and

2286
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:16,560
being exposed to some sort of uh

2287
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:18,639
positive randomness yes okay that's

2288
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,679
probably because if that's my goal

2289
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,880
what's the right way to do it well i

2290
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,079
don't need to be on twitter on my phone

2291
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,560
all day maybe what i do is

2292
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:25,519
every day at five i do my post and check

2293
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,000
on the day

2294
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,040
so i have a writer friend um ryan

2295
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,119
holiday

2296
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:33,039
who writes about the stoics a lot and he

2297
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:36,158
has this similar strategy he post

2298
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:37,359
one quote every day from usually from a

2299
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:38,399
famous stoic and sometimes from a

2300
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,679
contemporary figure and that's just what

2301
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,519
he does he just

2302
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:43,199
posted and it's a very positive thing

2303
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,799
like his readers really love it because

2304
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,318
it's just like a dose of inspiration he

2305
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:47,838
doesn't spend time

2306
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:50,000
he's never interacting with anyone on

2307
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:50,640
social media right but that's an example

2308
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,079
of

2309
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,199
i figured out what's important to me

2310
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:54,479
what's the best way to use tools to

2311
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:55,759
amplify it

2312
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:57,839
and then you get advantages out of the

2313
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,119
tools so i like what you're doing

2314
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:00,560
i looked you up if i looked up your

2315
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:01,439
twitter feed before i came came over

2316
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,440
here i was curious

2317
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:05,678
you're not on there a lot no i don't see

2318
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:08,319
you yelling at people now do you think

2319
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:09,679
social media as a medium changed the

2320
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:11,519
cultural standards

2321
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:13,039
and i mean it in a have you read neil

2322
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,800
postman at all have you read like

2323
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:16,719
amusing ourselves to death it was a

2324
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,719
social critic technology critic

2325
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,719
um and wrote a lot about sort of

2326
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,399
technological determinism so

2327
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,920
the ways which is a really influential

2328
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:25,039
idea to a lot of my work which is

2329
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,760
actually a little out of fashion right

2330
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:28,880
now in academia but uh the ways that the

2331
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,360
the properties and presence of

2332
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,960
technologies change things about humans

2333
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:34,479
in a way that's not really intended or

2334
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,640
planned by the humans themselves

2335
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:38,238
that book is all about how different

2336
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,600
communication medium

2337
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:42,158
like fundamentally just changed the way

2338
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,760
the human brain understands and operates

2339
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:45,198
and so he sort of gets into the what

2340
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,360
happened when the printed word was

2341
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:50,079
widespread and how television changed it

2342
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:51,599
and this was all pre-social media but

2343
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,198
this one these ideas i'm having is like

2344
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,640
what's the degree to which i get into it

2345
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:56,158
sometimes on my show again to a little

2346
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,800
bit like the degree to which

2347
01:10:56,158 --> 01:11:00,639
like twitter in particular just changed

2348
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,079
the way that people conceptualized what

2349
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,320
for example

2350
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:06,158
debate and discussion was like it

2351
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:08,479
introduced a rhetorical dunk culture

2352
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:10,799
where it's sort of more about tribes not

2353
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,479
giving ground to other tribes and

2354
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,960
and it's like it's a complete there's

2355
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:16,559
different places and times

2356
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,000
when that type of discussion was thought

2357
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,320
of differently right

2358
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,760
well yeah absolutely but i i tend to

2359
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,840
believe i don't know what you think that

2360
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,360
there's the technological solutions like

2361
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,079
there's literally

2362
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:30,158
different features in twitter that could

2363
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:31,600
completely reverse that there's so much

2364
01:11:30,158 --> 01:11:34,158
power in the different

2365
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,199
choices yeah that are made and it could

2366
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:37,198
still be

2367
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:38,879
highly engaging and have very different

2368
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:41,119
effects perhaps more negative but

2369
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,239
or hopefully more positive yeah so it's

2370
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:44,158
i'm trying to pull these two things

2371
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:45,919
apart so there's these

2372
01:11:44,158 --> 01:11:48,158
two ways social media let's say could

2373
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,359
change the experience of reading a major

2374
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:50,960
newspaper today

2375
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:52,880
one could be a little bit more economic

2376
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,319
right so so the internet made it cheaper

2377
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,840
to get news the newspapers had to

2378
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:56,719
retreat to a paywall model because it

2379
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,159
was the only way they were going to

2380
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,359
survive but once you're in a paywall

2381
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:01,119
model then then

2382
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:02,960
what you really want to do is make your

2383
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:04,640
tribe which is within the paywall very

2384
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,239
very happy with you so you want to work

2385
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,000
to them but then there's the sort of

2386
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,279
the determinist point of view which is

2387
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,560
the properties of twitter which were

2388
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:12,639
arbitrary

2389
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,080
jack and evan just whatever let's just

2390
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,520
do it this way

2391
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,119
influence the very way that people now

2392
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,520
understand and think about the world so

2393
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:19,679
the

2394
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,800
one influenced the other i think yeah

2395
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,119
they they kind of

2396
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,000
started adjusting together i i did this

2397
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:25,519
thing i mean

2398
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,760
i'm trying to understand this part of

2399
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:29,040
the part of the

2400
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,039
i've been playing with the

2401
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:32,000
entrepreneurial idea there's a very

2402
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:35,119
particular

2403
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,679
dream i've had of a startup that

2404
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:39,519
this is a longer-term thing uh it has to

2405
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,679
do with artificial intelligence

2406
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,679
but more and more it seems like there's

2407
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:46,319
a some trajectory through

2408
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,279
creating uh social media type of

2409
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:48,719
technologies

2410
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:50,399
very different than what people are

2411
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:53,679
thinking i'm doing but uh

2412
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:56,879
it's a kind of challenge to the way the

2413
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:58,239
twitter is done but it's not obvious

2414
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,480
what the best mechanisms

2415
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:01,599
are to still make an exceptionally

2416
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:04,158
engaging platform

2417
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,000
my clubhouse is very engaging and not

2418
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:08,079
have any other negative effects

2419
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,600
i for example there's uh chrome

2420
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:12,880
extensions that

2421
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,320
allow you to turn off all likes and

2422
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,319
dislikes and all of that

2423
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:18,158
from twitter so you all you're seeing is

2424
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:21,359
just the content yeah

2425
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:22,879
on twitter that to me is creates

2426
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:24,799
that's not a compelling experience at

2427
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:27,520
all because i still

2428
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,360
need i would argue i still need the

2429
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,920
likes to know what's a tweet worth

2430
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:31,039
reading

2431
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,039
yeah because i don't only have the

2432
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:34,800
limited amount of time so i need to know

2433
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,319
what's valuable it's like great yelp

2434
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:40,000
reviews on tweets or something

2435
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:42,719
exactly but i've turned off on

2436
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,198
for example on my account on youtube

2437
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,760
i've

2438
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:47,279
turned uh i wrote a chrome extension

2439
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,079
that turns off

2440
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:51,439
all likes and dislikes and just views

2441
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,158
yeah i don't know how many views the

2442
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:54,000
video gets

2443
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:56,238
and so yeah unless it's on my phone but

2444
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,359
you take off the recommendations

2445
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:01,119
uh the no no on youtube some people the

2446
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:01,519
distraction for youtube is a big one for

2447
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:03,359
people

2448
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,560
yeah no i'm not worried about the

2449
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:06,799
distraction because

2450
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,760
i'm able to control myself on youtube

2451
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,440
you don't rap at all

2452
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,039
no i don't rabbit hole so you have to

2453
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:11,678
know your demons or your addictions

2454
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:13,439
whatever

2455
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,800
on youtube i'm okay i don't have i don't

2456
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:17,919
keep clicking

2457
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,279
the negative feelings come from seeing

2458
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,920
the views

2459
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:24,000
on on stuff you've created have created

2460
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,239
oh so you don't want to see your views

2461
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,079
yeah so like i'm just like speaking to

2462
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:30,000
the things that i'm aware of of myself

2463
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:31,600
that yeah are helpful and things that

2464
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,560
are not helpful emotionally

2465
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,920
yeah and i feel like there should be we

2466
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,880
need to create actually tooling for

2467
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,440
ourselves

2468
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:41,039
that's not me with javascript but

2469
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,839
anybody's able to

2470
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:44,158
create sort of control the experience

2471
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,039
they

2472
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:48,960
that they have yeah well so so my my big

2473
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:49,279
unified theory on social media is i'm

2474
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,359
very

2475
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:52,319
i'm very bearish yes on the big

2476
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:54,559
platforms

2477
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:56,399
having a long future you are i think the

2478
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,840
moment i think the moment of three or

2479
01:14:56,399 --> 01:15:00,879
four major platforms

2480
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,880
is uh not gonna last

2481
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,159
right so i don't know okay this is just

2482
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,920
perspective right so you can start

2483
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:07,439
shorting these stocks uh

2484
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:09,520
i'm on my don't tell that's not

2485
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:12,319
financial yeah yeah don't do robinhood

2486
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:14,560
um so here's here's i think the the big

2487
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:17,519
mistake the major platforms made

2488
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,960
as when they they took out the network

2489
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,199
effect advantage

2490
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,039
right so the original pitch especially

2491
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:26,000
something like facebook or instagram

2492
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:27,679
was the people you know are on here

2493
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,960
right so like what you use this was you

2494
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:29,520
can connect to people that you already

2495
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,520
know

2496
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,040
this is what makes the network useful we

2497
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,520
so therefore the value of our network

2498
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:35,198
grows

2499
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,199
uh quadratically with the number of

2500
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:38,639
users and therefore it's such a head

2501
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:40,158
start that there's no way that someone

2502
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,920
else can catch up

2503
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:43,119
but when they shifted and when facebook

2504
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,520
took the lead of say we're going to

2505
01:15:43,119 --> 01:15:47,119
shift towards a news feed model

2506
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,360
they basically said we're going to try

2507
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:50,880
to in the moment get more data and get

2508
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:52,000
more likes like what we're going to go

2509
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,480
towards is actually just

2510
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,158
uh seeing interesting stuff like scene

2511
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:56,799
diverted information so people took this

2512
01:15:56,158 --> 01:15:58,799
social

2513
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,640
internet impulse to connect to people

2514
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,320
digitally to other tools

2515
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,280
like group text messages and whatsapp

2516
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:04,719
and stuff like this right so you don't

2517
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:06,319
think about these tools as oh this is

2518
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:07,920
where i connect with people

2519
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:10,079
once it's just a feed that's kind of

2520
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,199
interesting now you're competing with

2521
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,279
everything else that can produce

2522
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:15,599
interesting content that's diverting

2523
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:16,960
and i think that is a much fiercer

2524
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,239
competition because now for example

2525
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,920
you're going up against podcast

2526
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:21,519
right i mean like okay i guess you know

2527
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,480
the twitter feed is interesting right

2528
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,400
now

2529
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:25,519
um but also a podcast is interesting or

2530
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:27,119
something else could be interesting too

2531
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,760
i think it's a much fiercer competition

2532
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:29,840
when there's no

2533
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,360
there's no more network effects right

2534
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,199
and so my sense is we're going to see a

2535
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,639
fragmentation into what i call long tail

2536
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:37,519
social media

2537
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:39,679
where if i don't need everyone i know to

2538
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,679
be on a platform then why not have

2539
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:43,359
three or four bespoke platforms i use

2540
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,119
where it's a thousand people

2541
01:16:43,359 --> 01:16:46,399
and it's all we're all interested in you

2542
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:48,719
know whatever

2543
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:50,319
ai or comedy and it's we've we've

2544
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:51,920
perfected this interface and maybe it's

2545
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:52,158
like clubhouse it's audio or something

2546
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,760
and

2547
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:55,679
we all pay two dollars so we don't have

2548
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,119
to worry about attention harvesting

2549
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,399
and that's going to be wildly more

2550
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:00,479
entertaining i mean i'm thinking about

2551
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:03,439
comedians on twitter

2552
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,799
it's not the best internet possible

2553
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:05,919
format for them

2554
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,800
expressing themselves and being

2555
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,158
interesting that you have all these

2556
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,440
comedians that are trying to like well i

2557
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:10,799
can do like little clips and little

2558
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:11,759
whatever like i don't know if there was

2559
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,199
a

2560
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,560
long tail social media that's really

2561
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:16,238
this is where the comedians are and this

2562
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,520
podcast and the comedians are on podcast

2563
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:19,279
now so this is my thought is that

2564
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,199
there's really no

2565
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:22,319
there's really no strong advantage to

2566
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:25,759
having one

2567
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:27,359
large platform that everyone is on

2568
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,280
if all you're getting from it is i now

2569
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:31,119
have different options for diversion and

2570
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:33,119
and like uplifting aspirational or

2571
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:34,640
whatever types entertainment

2572
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:35,920
that whole thing could fragment and i

2573
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,280
think the glue that was holding together

2574
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,560
was network effects i don't think they

2575
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:39,759
realized that when network effects have

2576
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,039
been destabilized

2577
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,800
they don't have the centrifugal force

2578
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:45,279
anymore and they're spinning faster and

2579
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,039
faster but is is a twitter feed really

2580
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:48,399
that much more interesting than all

2581
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:49,600
these streaming services is it really

2582
01:17:48,399 --> 01:17:51,679
that much more interesting

2583
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,840
than clubhouse is it that much more

2584
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:55,920
interesting than podcast

2585
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,520
i feel like they don't realize how

2586
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,640
unstable their ground actually is yeah

2587
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,239
that's fascinating but

2588
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:03,280
uh the thing that makes twitter and

2589
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:06,238
facebook

2590
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,359
work i mean the the news feed you're

2591
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:09,678
exactly right like

2592
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:11,599
you can just duplicate the news like if

2593
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:13,359
it's not the social network

2594
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,120
and it's the news feed then why not have

2595
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:16,559
multiple different feeds

2596
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,559
that are more that are better at

2597
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,400
satisfying there's a dopamine

2598
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,679
gamification that they've figured out

2599
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:23,679
yeah the and

2600
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,719
uh you so you have to whatever you

2601
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,640
create

2602
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:28,719
you have to at least provide some

2603
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,520
pleasure in that same gamification kind

2604
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:32,000
of way

2605
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,760
it doesn't have to have to do with scale

2606
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,079
of large social networks but

2607
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,159
i mean i guess you're implying that you

2608
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:40,479
should be able to design that kind of

2609
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:42,399
uh mechanism in other forms or people

2610
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:44,319
are turning on the that gamification

2611
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:45,839
i mean so people are getting wise to it

2612
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,158
and are getting uncomfortable about it

2613
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,239
right

2614
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:49,439
so if i'm offering something there are

2615
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:52,000
these existing sugar

2616
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:53,439
people realize sugar is bad yeah

2617
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
drinking a lot's great too but it also

2618
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:56,238
after a while

2619
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,600
you realize there's there's problems so

2620
01:18:56,238 --> 01:18:58,799
some of the long tail social media

2621
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,679
networks that are out there that i've

2622
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,000
looked at

2623
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,039
they offer usually like a deeper sense

2624
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,039
of connection like

2625
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:06,640
it's usually interesting people that you

2626
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:08,479
share some affinity and you have these

2627
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,000
carefully cultivated i wrote this new

2628
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:11,519
yorker piece a couple years ago about

2629
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
the indie social media movement that

2630
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,239
really

2631
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,359
got into some of these different

2632
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:16,799
technologies but i think the

2633
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:19,439
technologies are a distraction

2634
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,960
we focus too much on you know mastodon

2635
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:22,399
versus you know whatever like forget

2636
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,800
or discord like actually let's forget

2637
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:27,359
the protocols right now it's the idea

2638
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,800
of okay and there's a lot of these long

2639
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:30,399
tail social media groups what people are

2640
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:33,440
getting out of it which i think can

2641
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:35,119
outweigh the dopamine gamification is

2642
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:36,879
strong connection and motivation like

2643
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:37,920
you're in a group with other guys that

2644
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,840
are all trying to

2645
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,679
be you know better dads or something

2646
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,119
like this and and you talk to them on a

2647
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,640
regular basis and you're sharing your

2648
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:45,599
stories and there's interesting talks

2649
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,520
and

2650
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,679
that's a powerful thing too one

2651
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,679
interesting thing about scale of twitter

2652
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:53,199
is you have these viral spread of

2653
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:55,520
information

2654
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:56,960
so sort of uh twitter has become a

2655
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,280
newsmaker in itself

2656
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,039
yeah i think it's a problem well yes but

2657
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:03,359
i wonder what replaces that

2658
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:05,840
because because then you immediately

2659
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:05,839
reporting

2660
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:09,760
some work again i don't know no the

2661
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:10,238
problem with reporters and journalism is

2662
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,840
that they're

2663
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:15,519
they're intermediary they have control

2664
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,360
i mean this is the problem in russia

2665
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:20,800
currently is that you have

2666
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:22,319
uh it creates a shield between the the

2667
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,760
people and the news

2668
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:25,920
the the interesting thing and the

2669
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,920
powerful thing about twitter is that

2670
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,760
the news originates from the individual

2671
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,760
that's creating the news like

2672
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,199
you you have the president united the

2673
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,719
former president of the united states on

2674
01:20:33,198 --> 01:20:36,719
twitter creating news

2675
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:38,560
you have elon musk creating news you

2676
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,639
have people announcing stuff

2677
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:42,560
on twitter as opposed to talking to a

2678
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:46,400
journalist and that feels

2679
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:48,400
much more genuine and uh

2680
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,399
it's it it feels very powerful but

2681
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:52,960
actually coming to realize it it

2682
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:54,799
it doesn't need the social network you

2683
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,319
can just put that announcement on the

2684
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,840
youtube type of thing this is what i'm

2685
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:59,439
thinking right so this is my point about

2686
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,039
that because that's right it it

2687
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:02,799
the democratizing power of the internet

2688
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:05,119
is fantastic i'm i'm an old school

2689
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,960
internet nerd a guy that was you know

2690
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:08,399
telnetting in the servers and gophering

2691
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,079
before the world wide web was around

2692
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:12,000
right so i'm a huge internet booster and

2693
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:14,319
that's that's one of its big power

2694
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,198
but when you put everything on twitter i

2695
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:17,439
think the fact that

2696
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:18,238
you've taken uh you homogenized

2697
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:20,559
everything right

2698
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:21,839
so everything looks the same moves with

2699
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,560
the same low friction it's very

2700
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,840
difficult

2701
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,159
you have no what i call distributed

2702
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,679
curation right the only curation that

2703
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:29,279
really happens there's a little bit with

2704
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:32,639
likes and also the algorithm

2705
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:34,319
but if you look back to pre web 2.0 or

2706
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:35,840
early web 2.0 when a lot of this was

2707
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:37,359
happening let's say on blogs

2708
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:39,039
where people own their own servers and

2709
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:40,719
you had your different blogs

2710
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:42,719
there was this distributed curation that

2711
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:45,279
happened where in order for

2712
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,800
your blog to get on people's radar and

2713
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:49,840
this had nothing to do with any

2714
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,279
gatekeepers or legacy media it was over

2715
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,560
time you got more links and people

2716
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:53,759
respected you and you would hear about

2717
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,679
this blog over here and there's this

2718
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,079
whole distributed curation and filtering

2719
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:58,319
going

2720
01:21:56,079 --> 01:22:00,079
on so if you think like the 2004

2721
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:01,439
presidential election

2722
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:02,559
most of the information people are

2723
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:03,839
getting from the internet when the first

2724
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,560
big internet

2725
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:08,319
news driven elections was from you know

2726
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,480
you had like the daily costs and

2727
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:11,679
and drudge but there was like blogs that

2728
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:13,519
were out there and and this was back

2729
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:14,239
ezra klein was just running a blog out

2730
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,239
of his uh

2731
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:18,479
you know a dorm room at this point right

2732
01:22:16,238 --> 01:22:21,519
and you would in a distributed fashion

2733
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:23,119
gain credibility because okay

2734
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,920
i people have paid it it's very hard to

2735
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:25,519
get people to pay attention to blog

2736
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,440
they're paying attention i get linked to

2737
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,360
this kid ezra or whatever it seems to be

2738
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:29,759
really sharp and now people are noticing

2739
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:32,079
it

2740
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,000
and now you have a distributed curation

2741
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:35,519
that solves a lot of the problems we see

2742
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,119
when you have a completely homogenized

2743
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,520
low-friction environment like friction

2744
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:39,760
where

2745
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,280
i mean twitter where any random

2746
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,800
conspiracy theory or whatever that

2747
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:45,119
people like can just

2748
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,400
shoot through and spread whereas if

2749
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:48,639
you're starting a blog

2750
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:49,439
to try to push q anon or something like

2751
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,719
that

2752
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:51,919
it's probably going to be a really weird

2753
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:53,119
looking blog and you're going to have a

2754
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,399
hard time like it's just never going to

2755
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:57,119
show up on people's radar

2756
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:58,960
right i mean so everything you've said

2757
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:00,800
up until the very last statement i would

2758
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,158
i would agree with

2759
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,239
this is a topic i don't know a ton about

2760
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:07,759
i guess there's uh

2761
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:10,079
i think i'll forget q anon uh yeah no

2762
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,280
but gyonan is yeah kyon could be that i

2763
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:13,600
also don't know i should

2764
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:14,880
no more i apologize i don't know more i

2765
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,000
mean that's the power

2766
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:21,279
and uh the downside you can have

2767
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,319
i mean hitler could have a blog today

2768
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:24,559
yeah and he would have

2769
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:26,079
potentially very large following if he's

2770
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:28,239
charismatic if he's

2771
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:30,479
has you know as good with words he's

2772
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:31,839
able to express the ideas whatever maybe

2773
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:33,359
he's able to channel

2774
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,119
the frustration the anger that people

2775
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:37,279
have about a certain thing and

2776
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:38,158
so i think that's the power of blogs but

2777
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:39,840
it's also the

2778
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:41,359
limitation but that doesn't we're not

2779
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,960
trying to solve that you can't solve

2780
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:44,399
that yeah the fundamental problem you're

2781
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,039
saying is not the problem

2782
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:48,000
the your your thesis is that there's

2783
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:51,439
nothing special

2784
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,439
about large-scale social networks that

2785
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:55,198
guarantees that they will keep existing

2786
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:55,759
and it's important to remember for a lot

2787
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:58,079
of the

2788
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,600
older generation of internet activists

2789
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:01,198
or the people who are very pro-internet

2790
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:04,000
in the early days

2791
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:05,039
they were completely flabbergasted by

2792
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,079
the rise of these

2793
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:09,519
platforms say why would you take the

2794
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:10,800
internet and then build your own version

2795
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:13,280
of the internet

2796
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,560
where you own all the servers and we

2797
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:16,479
built this whole distribute the whole

2798
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,920
thing with open protocols

2799
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:19,279
everyone anywhere in the world use the

2800
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,719
same protocols your machine can talk to

2801
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:23,359
any other machine it's the most

2802
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,800
democratic communication system that's

2803
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:25,920
ever been built and then these companies

2804
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,480
came along and said we're going to build

2805
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,760
our own

2806
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:29,279
let's own all the servers and put them

2807
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,000
in buildings that we own and the

2808
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:31,519
internet will just be

2809
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,279
the the first mile this gets you into

2810
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,120
our private internet where we own the

2811
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:36,479
whole thing it went completely against

2812
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:38,880
the entire

2813
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:40,638
motivation of the internet was like yes

2814
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,000
we it's not going to be one person owns

2815
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:42,960
all the servers and you pay to access

2816
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,479
them it's any one

2817
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,000
server that they own can talk to anyone

2818
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:47,678
else's server because we all agree on a

2819
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,920
standard set of

2820
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:51,679
protocols and so the the old guard of

2821
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,079
pro internet people

2822
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:55,119
never understood this move towards let's

2823
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:57,519
build

2824
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:58,559
private versions of the internet uh

2825
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,000
we'll build three or four private

2826
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,920
internets and that's what we'll all use

2827
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,279
it was the opposite basically well it's

2828
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,520
funny enough i don't know if you follow

2829
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:09,679
but jack dorsey is also

2830
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:12,000
uh as a proponent and is helping to fund

2831
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:13,199
create fully distributed version to

2832
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,520
twitter essentially

2833
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:16,638
that would potentially destroy twitter

2834
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,360
yeah but i think there

2835
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:20,960
you know there might be financial art

2836
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:21,679
like business cases to be made there i'm

2837
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,600
not sure

2838
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:26,800
but that seems to be another alternative

2839
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:30,079
as as opposed to creating a bunch of

2840
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:32,239
uh like the long tail uh creating like

2841
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:33,119
the ultimate long tail of like fully

2842
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:35,039
distributed

2843
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:36,158
yeah which is what the internet is but

2844
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:37,359
that's that's sort of like

2845
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:39,198
when i'm thinking about long tail social

2846
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:40,880
media i'm thinking it's uh

2847
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:42,319
like the text not so important like

2848
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,800
there's groups out there

2849
01:25:42,319 --> 01:25:46,000
right i know where the tech they use to

2850
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,600
actually implement their

2851
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,359
digital only social group whatever they

2852
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,880
might use slack they might use some

2853
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:52,559
combination of zoomer it doesn't matter

2854
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,400
i think in the tech world

2855
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,920
we want to build the beautiful protocol

2856
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,879
right that okay everyone's going to use

2857
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,880
as just a

2858
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,079
federated server protocol in which we've

2859
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,960
worked out x y and z and no one

2860
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:02,479
understands it because then the

2861
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,840
engineers need it all to make i get it

2862
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:04,959
because i'm a nerd like this like okay

2863
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,239
every standard has to fit with

2864
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,279
everything else and no one understands

2865
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:08,879
what's going on

2866
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:10,880
meanwhile you know you have this group

2867
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,520
of bike enthusiasts that are like yeah

2868
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,359
we'll just

2869
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,040
jump onto zoom and have some slack and

2870
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:15,599
put up a blog the tech doesn't really

2871
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:17,039
matter

2872
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,880
like we built the world with our own

2873
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:21,760
curation our own rules

2874
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,279
uh our own sort of social ecosystem

2875
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,719
that's generating a lot of value

2876
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:26,158
i mean i don't know if it'll happen

2877
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:27,119
there's a lot of money at stake with

2878
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:29,759
obviously these large

2879
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:30,800
but i just think they're more they're so

2880
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,520
i mean look how quickly

2881
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,880
americans left facebook right i mean

2882
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,760
facebook was savvy to buy other

2883
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,199
properties and

2884
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,800
to diversify right but how quick did

2885
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:40,719
that take for

2886
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,239
just standard facebook news yeah

2887
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:43,520
everyone under the age of something

2888
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:44,799
we're using it and no one under a

2889
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,880
certain age is using it now it took like

2890
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,679
four years i mean this stuff is

2891
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,800
really i believe you people can leave

2892
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:53,520
facebook overnight

2893
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,880
yeah like i i think uh facebook hasn't

2894
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,760
actually messed up

2895
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:59,039
for like enough to there's two things

2896
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,560
they haven't messed up enough for people

2897
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:03,119
to really leave aggressively

2898
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,760
and there's no good alternative for them

2899
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:06,158
to leave

2900
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,520
i think if good alternatives pop up it

2901
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:09,039
would just immediately happen

2902
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,960
this stuff is a lot more culturally

2903
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:12,238
fragile i think i mean twitter's having

2904
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,600
a moment because it was feeding a

2905
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:15,198
certain type of and there's a lot of

2906
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,960
anxieties that was in the the sort of

2907
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:20,079
political sphere anyways that

2908
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,600
twitter was working with

2909
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:23,439
but its moment could go to as well i

2910
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,440
mean it's a really arbitrary thing

2911
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:26,638
short little things and i read a wired

2912
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:28,879
article about this earlier in the

2913
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,239
pandemic like this is crazy

2914
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,520
that the way that we're trying to

2915
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:32,079
communicate information about the

2916
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,159
pandemic

2917
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:35,198
is all these weird arbitrary rules where

2918
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:37,198
people are screen

2919
01:27:35,198 --> 01:27:39,119
shotting pictures of articles that are

2920
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:39,759
part of a tweet thread where you say one

2921
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:41,840
slash

2922
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,960
n under it like we have the technology

2923
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,279
guys yeah

2924
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,960
to like really clearly convey in for

2925
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:48,479
long form information to people like

2926
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,600
why are we why do we have these and i

2927
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:50,959
know it's because it's the gamified

2928
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,880
dopamine hits but

2929
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,239
what a weird medium there's no reason

2930
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,319
for us to have to

2931
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:58,079
have these threads that you have to find

2932
01:27:56,319 --> 01:27:59,599
and pin will you screenshot i mean we

2933
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:01,039
have technology to communicate better

2934
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:03,679
using the internet i mean

2935
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:04,719
why are epidemiologists having to do

2936
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:06,158
tweet threads

2937
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:07,840
well because there's mechanisms of

2938
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:08,559
publishing that make it easier on

2939
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,719
twitter

2940
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,760
i mean we're evolving as a species and

2941
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:14,719
the internet is a very

2942
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:16,079
fresh thing yeah and so it's kind of

2943
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:18,639
interesting to think

2944
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:20,238
that as opposed to twitter it's this is

2945
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:22,639
what jack also complains about

2946
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:23,759
is twitter's not innovating fast enough

2947
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,079
yeah and

2948
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,159
so it's almost like the people are

2949
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:29,679
innovating and thinking about their

2950
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:32,079
productive life

2951
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:34,079
faster than the platforms in which they

2952
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:36,399
operate can catch up yeah and so

2953
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:37,359
at the point you the gap grows

2954
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:39,599
sufficiently

2955
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:41,279
they'll jump a few people a few

2956
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,480
innovative folks will just create an

2957
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:46,319
alternative

2958
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:48,559
and perhaps distributed uh perhaps just

2959
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:50,000
many little silos and then people will

2960
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,880
jump and it will just continue in this

2961
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,319
kind of way but see

2962
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,520
i think like sub stack for example what

2963
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:55,119
they're going to pull out of twitter

2964
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,320
among other things is the audience that

2965
01:28:55,119 --> 01:28:58,800
was

2966
01:28:56,319 --> 01:28:59,439
let's say like slightly left of sinner

2967
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,960
but

2968
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:04,719
um slate lisa slender don't like trump

2969
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,399
uncomfortable with like post-modern

2970
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:07,359
critical theories made into political

2971
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:08,799
action right

2972
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:10,158
and they're like yeah twitter there's a

2973
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,520
people on there talking about this and

2974
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:12,799
it made me feel

2975
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,560
sort of heard because i was feeling a

2976
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,000
little bit like a nerd about it but

2977
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,280
honestly i'd probably rather subscribe

2978
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,399
the four subs you know i'm gonna have

2979
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:20,238
like berries and

2980
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:22,000
andrew sullivan's i love like uh jesse's

2981
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:23,839
signals like i'll have a few sub stacks

2982
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,399
i can subscribe to and honestly that's

2983
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,719
i'm a

2984
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:28,559
knowledge worker who's 32 anyways

2985
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:29,840
probably that's an email all day and

2986
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,520
and so like there's an innovation that's

2987
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,760
going to that group you know it's going

2988
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,120
to

2989
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,440
suck them off which is actually a very

2990
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:36,238
large group yeah that's a lot of that's

2991
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:37,519
a lot of energy

2992
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:39,039
and then once trump's gone i guess

2993
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:40,320
that's probably gonna dr that drove a

2994
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:42,079
lot of uh

2995
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:43,679
uh more like trump people off twitter

2996
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:46,399
like this stuff is fragile

2997
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:46,800
i think i but the fascinating thing to

2998
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:49,359
me

2999
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,560
because i've hung out on parlor for a

3000
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:52,559
short amount enough

3001
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,639
to to know that the interface matters

3002
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:57,520
it's so fascinating like that

3003
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:58,319
that it's not just about ideas yeah it's

3004
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,600
about

3005
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:03,198
creating like sub stack to creating a

3006
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,719
pleasant experience

3007
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:06,399
uh addicting experience you're right

3008
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:07,600
you're right about that and it's hard

3009
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:09,198
and that's why this is one of the

3010
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,719
conclusions from that indie social media

3011
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:12,479
article is it's just

3012
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:13,760
the ugliness matters and i don't mean

3013
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:15,439
even just aesthetically but just the

3014
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,400
clunkiness of the interfaces

3015
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:19,759
the um and i don't know it's to some

3016
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:20,879
degree the social media companies have

3017
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,560
spent a lot of money on this

3018
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,159
and to some degree it's a survivorship

3019
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,239
bias yeah right i think

3020
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:27,920
twitter every time i hear jack talks

3021
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:30,158
about this it seems like

3022
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,199
he's as surprised as anyone else the way

3023
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:31,920
twitter is being used i mean it's

3024
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:35,439
basically

3025
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:37,760
the way you know they had it uh

3026
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:39,119
years ago and then it was like great

3027
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,960
it'll be statuses right

3028
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:42,479
yeah this is what i'm doing you know and

3029
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,760
my friends can follow me and see it and

3030
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:45,839
without really changing anything it just

3031
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,960
happened to hit everything right

3032
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,319
to support this other type of

3033
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,760
interaction well there's also the

3034
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:51,599
javascript model which

3035
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,880
brendan ike talked about he just

3036
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,960
implemented javascript

3037
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,960
uh like the crappy version of javascript

3038
01:30:54,960 --> 01:31:00,239
in 10 days threw it out there and just

3039
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,840
uh changed it really quickly yeah

3040
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:04,079
involved it really quickly and now has

3041
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,600
become uh according to stack exchange

3042
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:07,439
the most popular programming language in

3043
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,199
the world that yeah it drives like most

3044
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:10,559
of the internet and even the back end

3045
01:31:09,198 --> 01:31:13,359
and now mobile and

3046
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,639
yeah and so that that's an argument for

3047
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:15,679
the kind of thing you're talking about

3048
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:18,319
where like

3049
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:21,199
like the bike club people yeah could

3050
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:23,198
literally create the thing that would uh

3051
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:24,399
you know run most of the internet you

3052
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:26,879
know 10 years from now

3053
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:27,599
yeah it's so there's something to that

3054
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,279
like

3055
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,960
as opposed to trying to get lucky or

3056
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:31,599
trying to think through stuff is just to

3057
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,679
uh

3058
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,360
to solve a particular problem do stuff

3059
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,960
yeah and do stuff do something like

3060
01:31:35,359 --> 01:31:38,880
keep tinkering until you love it yeah

3061
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,800
yeah and then uh

3062
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,319
and of course the sad thing is timing

3063
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,840
and luck matter

3064
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:45,439
and that you can't really control that's

3065
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:48,159
the problem yeah but uh

3066
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:49,279
you can't go back to 2007. yeah that's

3067
01:31:48,158 --> 01:31:50,559
like the number one thing you could do

3068
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:51,519
to have a lot of success with a new

3069
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,000
platform is

3070
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,520
go back in time 14 years so the thing

3071
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,840
you have to kind of think about is

3072
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,120
what is the like what's the totally new

3073
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,079
thing

3074
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:02,880
that uh 10 years from now would seem

3075
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:04,238
obvious

3076
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:06,239
i mean some people are saying clubhouse

3077
01:32:04,238 --> 01:32:09,439
is that there's been a lot of stuff

3078
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:12,559
like clubhouse before yeah but it

3079
01:32:09,439 --> 01:32:14,638
it hit the right kind of thing uh

3080
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:16,560
similar to tesla actually what clubhouse

3081
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:18,159
did is it got a lot of

3082
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,080
relatively famous people on there

3083
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:23,039
quickly and um

3084
01:32:20,079 --> 01:32:25,198
and then the the other effect is like

3085
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:26,000
it's invite only so like oh all the

3086
01:32:25,198 --> 01:32:27,599
smart like

3087
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,760
famous people are on there i wonder

3088
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,199
what's it's the fomo like

3089
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,199
fear that you're missing something

3090
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:34,158
really profound there's exciting

3091
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:36,559
happening there

3092
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:38,559
so those social effects and then once

3093
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,320
you actually show up

3094
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,080
i'm a huge fan of this it's the

3095
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:45,198
javascript model it's like

3096
01:32:42,079 --> 01:32:47,119
clubhouse is so dumb like so

3097
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:48,719
simple in its interface like you

3098
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:51,679
literally can't do anything except

3099
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:53,439
mute a mute there's a mute button yeah

3100
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:54,158
and there's a leave quietly button yeah

3101
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:56,238
that's it

3102
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:57,439
yeah and it's it's kind of i love

3103
01:32:56,238 --> 01:33:00,879
single-use technology

3104
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:04,158
that that sense yeah there's no like

3105
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:07,359
there's no it's just like

3106
01:33:04,158 --> 01:33:08,238
trivial and uh you know twitter kind of

3107
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:10,238
started like that

3108
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:11,839
facebook started like that yeah but

3109
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:13,279
they've evolved quickly to add all these

3110
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:15,360
features and so on

3111
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:16,319
and you know i do hope clubhouse stays

3112
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:18,479
that way yeah

3113
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:20,000
be interesting or there's alternatives i

3114
01:33:18,479 --> 01:33:20,959
mean like i mean even with clubhouse

3115
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,479
though

3116
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:24,800
so one of the issues with a lot of these

3117
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:28,718
platforms i think is

3118
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:30,480
uh bits are cheap enough now uh that

3119
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:32,079
we don't really need a unicorn investor

3120
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:32,718
model i mean the investors need that

3121
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:36,158
model

3122
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:39,760
there's really not really an imperative

3123
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:42,399
of we need something that can scale

3124
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:44,320
to 100 million plus a year revenue so

3125
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:46,399
because it's going to require this much

3126
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:47,920
seed and angel investment and and you're

3127
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:49,198
not going to get this much seed angel

3128
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,880
investment unless you can have a

3129
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:52,079
potential exit this this wide because

3130
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,520
you have to be part of a portfolio that

3131
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:56,238
depends on one out of ten

3132
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:57,280
exiting here if you don't actually need

3133
01:33:56,238 --> 01:33:59,039
that

3134
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:00,479
and you don't need to satisfy that

3135
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:02,560
investor model which i think is

3136
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:04,079
basically the case i mean bits are so

3137
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,199
cheap everything is so cheap

3138
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:07,198
you don't necess so even like with

3139
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:08,559
clubhouse it's it's investor backed

3140
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:09,198
right this notion of like this needs to

3141
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,320
be a

3142
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:13,678
major platform um but the bike club

3143
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:14,799
doesn't necessarily need a major

3144
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:15,920
platform that's where i'm interested i

3145
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,199
mean i don't know

3146
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:19,039
there's so much money that's the only

3147
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:21,519
problem that bets against me is that

3148
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:22,479
you can concentrate a lot of capital if

3149
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,880
you do these things right

3150
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:26,718
i mean so facebook was like a fantastic

3151
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,840
capital concentration machine it's crazy

3152
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,840
how much

3153
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,279
where it even found that capital in the

3154
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,719
world that it could concentrate and

3155
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:34,079
ossify in the stock price that a very

3156
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:35,119
small number of people have you know

3157
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:37,279
access to right

3158
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:38,960
that's that's incredibly powerful so

3159
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:39,279
when there when there is a possibility

3160
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,279
to

3161
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:42,399
to to consolidate and gather a huge

3162
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:44,238
amount of capital that's a huge

3163
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:45,679
imperative that's very hard for the bike

3164
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:46,959
club to go up against so

3165
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,960
but there's a lot of money in the bike

3166
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,279
club you see with the wall street

3167
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,000
uh bets yeah and then when a bunch of

3168
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:54,079
people

3169
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,198
get together i mean it doesn't have to

3170
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:56,079
be a bike it could be a bunch of

3171
01:34:55,198 --> 01:34:58,479
different bike clubs

3172
01:34:56,079 --> 01:34:59,118
just kind of team up yeah and to

3173
01:34:58,479 --> 01:35:00,559
overtake

3174
01:34:59,118 --> 01:35:02,000
that's what we're doing now yeah yeah or

3175
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,639
we're going to repurpose off the shelf

3176
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,639
stuff

3177
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:05,920
yes that's not you we're going to yeah

3178
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:08,000
we're going to repurpose whatever it was

3179
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:09,679
for office productivity or something and

3180
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,439
like the the club's using slack just to

3181
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:14,560
build out these you know

3182
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:15,519
yeah let's talk about email yeah yeah

3183
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,719
that's right there

3184
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:21,440
i wrote a book you wrote uh

3185
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,639
yet another amazing book uh world

3186
01:35:21,439 --> 01:35:24,719
without email

3187
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,319
maybe one way to enter this discussion

3188
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,480
is to ask what is

3189
01:35:26,319 --> 01:35:29,759
the hyperactive hive mind which is the

3190
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:33,759
concept you open the book with

3191
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:35,360
yeah and the devil it's the scourge of

3192
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:39,199
hundreds of millions

3193
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:40,639
uh so i think so i called this book a

3194
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:41,599
world without email the real title

3195
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:42,719
should be a world without the

3196
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,199
hyperactive hive mind

3197
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:46,399
workflow but my publisher didn't like

3198
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:47,519
that right so we had to get a little bit

3199
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:48,799
more pithy

3200
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,600
i was trying to answer the question

3201
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,560
after deep work why is it so hard to do

3202
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,400
this

3203
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,000
like if this is so valuable if we can

3204
01:35:54,399 --> 01:35:58,799
produce much higher people are much

3205
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,639
happier um why do we check email a day

3206
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,320
why are we on slack all day you know

3207
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:04,159
and so i started working on this book

3208
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:05,679
immediately after deep work

3209
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:08,158
and so my initial interviews were done

3210
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:09,118
in 2016. so it took five years to pull

3211
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:10,399
the threads together i was trying to

3212
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:12,799
understand

3213
01:36:10,399 --> 01:36:14,238
why is it so hard for most people to

3214
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,520
actually find any time

3215
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:17,439
to do the stuff that actually moves to

3216
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,719
neil and the story was

3217
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:20,079
and i thought this was i hadn't heard

3218
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:21,920
this report anywhere else that's why it

3219
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:24,719
took me so long to pull together

3220
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:26,560
is email arrives on the scene email

3221
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:28,480
spreads i trace it it really picks up

3222
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:31,119
steam in the early 1990s

3223
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:31,678
between like 1990 and 1995 it makes its

3224
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:33,519
move

3225
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,880
right and it does so for very pragmatic

3226
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,800
reasons it was replacing

3227
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:38,319
existing communication technologies that

3228
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,920
it was better than it was mainly the fax

3229
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:41,039
machine voicemail and memos right so

3230
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,560
this was just

3231
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:44,158
better right so it was a killer app

3232
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,560
because it was useful

3233
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:47,679
in its wake came a new way of

3234
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,920
collaborating

3235
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:52,000
and that's the hyperactive mine so it's

3236
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:54,560
the like the virus that follows

3237
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
the the rats that went through western

3238
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,920
europe for the black pig as

3239
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,920
email spread through organizations in

3240
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:01,760
its weight came the hyperactive hivemind

3241
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:03,279
workflow which says okay guys here's the

3242
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,119
way we're going to collaborate

3243
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:07,198
we'll just work things out on the fly

3244
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:08,799
with unscheduled back and forth messages

3245
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:10,079
just boom boom let's go back and forth

3246
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,520
hey what about this you see this what

3247
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:13,118
about that client let's see what's going

3248
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:15,600
on over here

3249
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:16,559
that followed email it completely took

3250
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:20,480
over

3251
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:22,159
office work and the the need

3252
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:24,158
to keep up with all these asynchronous

3253
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:25,519
back and forth unscheduled messages

3254
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:26,960
as those got more and more and more and

3255
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,800
we had more there's a service the need

3256
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:30,158
to service those required us to check

3257
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,520
more and more and more and more right

3258
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:33,759
and so by the time and i go through the

3259
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,040
numbers by the time you get to today

3260
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,320
now the average knowledge worker has to

3261
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:37,198
check one of these channels once every

3262
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:38,799
six minutes

3263
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:40,158
because every single thing you do in

3264
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,440
your organization how you talk to your

3265
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:42,559
colleagues how you talk to your vendors

3266
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:44,158
how you talk to your clients how you

3267
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,760
talk to the hr department it's all this

3268
01:37:44,158 --> 01:37:46,960
asynchronous unscheduled back and forth

3269
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,920
messaging

3270
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,399
and you have to service the

3271
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:51,118
conversations and it spiraled out of

3272
01:37:50,399 --> 01:37:52,879
control

3273
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:55,118
and it has sort of devolved a lot of

3274
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,800
work in the office now to all i do is

3275
01:37:55,118 --> 01:37:59,039
constantly tend

3276
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,639
communication channels so it's

3277
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:04,560
fascinating what you're describing

3278
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:07,118
is uh nobody ever paused in this whole

3279
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,639
evolution to try to create a system that

3280
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:11,759
actually works

3281
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:13,840
that it was um kind of like a huge fan

3282
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,560
of cellular automata so it just kind of

3283
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,199
started

3284
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,639
yeah uh very a very simple mechanism

3285
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:20,479
just like cellular time and it just kind

3286
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:23,440
of grew to overtake

3287
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:25,198
all the fundamental communication of how

3288
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:27,279
we do business and also personal life

3289
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:29,039
yeah and that's one of the big ideas is

3290
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:30,479
that the unintentionality

3291
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:32,158
yeah right so this goes back to

3292
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:33,919
technological determinism i mean this is

3293
01:38:32,158 --> 01:38:34,879
a weird business book because i go deep

3294
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,960
on

3295
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:38,639
philosophy i go deep on for some reason

3296
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,399
we get into paleoanthropology for a

3297
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:41,679
while we do a lot of neuroscience it's

3298
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:43,198
kind of a weird book

3299
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:44,880
uh but i got real into this

3300
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:46,238
technological determinism right this

3301
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:48,560
notion that just the presence of a

3302
01:38:46,238 --> 01:38:49,919
technology can change how people act

3303
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,520
that's my big argument about what

3304
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,880
happened with the hive mind and i can

3305
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,719
document

3306
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,840
specific examples right so i document

3307
01:38:54,719 --> 01:39:00,480
this example in ibm

3308
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:01,760
1987 maybe 85 but it's in like the mid

3309
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:03,839
to late 80s ibm

3310
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,199
our monk headquarters we're going to put

3311
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,079
an internal email

3312
01:39:05,198 --> 01:39:09,678
right because uh it's convenient and so

3313
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:10,880
they ran a whole study and so i talked

3314
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:12,239
to the engineer

3315
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,279
who ran the study adrian stone like

3316
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:15,039
we're going to run this study to figure

3317
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:16,319
out how much do we communicate because

3318
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:18,000
it was still an era where

3319
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:20,079
it's expensive right so you have to

3320
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,359
provision a mainframe so you can't

3321
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:22,800
over provision like we want to know how

3322
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:24,000
much communication actually happened so

3323
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,600
they went and figured it out

3324
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,920
how many memos how many calls how many

3325
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:29,520
notes great we'll provision a mainframe

3326
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,319
to handle email that can handle all of

3327
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,400
that so if

3328
01:39:30,319 --> 01:39:34,000
all of our communication moves to email

3329
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:35,839
the mainframe will still be fine

3330
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,560
in three days they had melted it down

3331
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:41,119
people were communicating six times more

3332
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,800
than that estimate so just in three days

3333
01:39:41,118 --> 01:39:44,319
the presence of a low friction digital

3334
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,760
communication tool

3335
01:39:44,319 --> 01:39:47,359
drastically changed how everyone

3336
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,840
collaborated so that's not enough time

3337
01:39:47,359 --> 01:39:49,839
for

3338
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:51,440
you know an all hands meeting guys we

3339
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,719
figured it out you know this is what

3340
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:54,238
we need to communicate a lot more is

3341
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:55,840
what's going to make us uh more

3342
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:57,359
productive we need more emails it's

3343
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,600
emergent

3344
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:00,639
isn't that just on the positive end

3345
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:03,360
amazing to you

3346
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:04,639
like is isn't email amazing like in

3347
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:06,960
those early days

3348
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:08,079
like just the frictionless communication

3349
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,198
i mean

3350
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:12,559
email is awesome like the people say

3351
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:14,238
that there's a lot of problems with

3352
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,600
emails just like people say a lot of

3353
01:40:14,238 --> 01:40:17,519
problems with twitter and so on

3354
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:19,199
it's kind of cool that you can just send

3355
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,239
a little note it was a miracle

3356
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:23,678
right so i i so i i wrote a there's

3357
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:25,359
originally was a new yorker piece

3358
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:27,679
from a year or two ago called was email

3359
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:31,039
a mistake and then it's in the book too

3360
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:32,560
yeah but i go into the history of email

3361
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:34,800
like why did it come along

3362
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:36,560
and it solved a huge problem so it was

3363
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,679
the problem of fast asynchronous

3364
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:39,280
communication yeah

3365
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:40,800
and it was a problem did not exist until

3366
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:42,639
we got large offices

3367
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,840
and we got large offices synchronous

3368
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:45,118
communication like let's get on the

3369
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,400
phone at the same time there's too much

3370
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:47,920
overhead to it there's too many people

3371
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:49,439
you might have to talk to

3372
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:51,199
asynchronous communication like let me

3373
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:52,479
send you a memo when i'm ready and you

3374
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:54,479
can read it when you're ready

3375
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:55,759
took too long and so it was like a huge

3376
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:57,039
problem so one of the things i talked

3377
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,600
about is the way that when they built

3378
01:40:57,039 --> 01:40:59,840
the

3379
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,920
cia headquarters there was such a need

3380
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:04,159
for fast asynchronous communication

3381
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,840
that they built a pneumatic-powered

3382
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:07,519
email system they had these pneumatic

3383
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,440
tubes all throughout the headquarters

3384
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,360
with electromagnetic routers

3385
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:13,439
so you would put your message in a

3386
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:15,279
plexiglass tube and you would turn these

3387
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:16,799
brass dials about the location you would

3388
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:18,000
stick it in these things and pneumatic

3389
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,840
tubes and it would shoot and

3390
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,000
sort and work its way through these

3391
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,960
tubes to show up in just a minute or

3392
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,479
something

3393
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,079
at the floor and at the general office

3394
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:27,439
suite where you wanted to go and my

3395
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:27,840
point is the fact that they spent so

3396
01:41:27,439 --> 01:41:29,519
much

3397
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,880
money to make that work show how

3398
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,320
important

3399
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:34,800
fast asynchronous communication was

3400
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:37,039
large offices so when email came along

3401
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,079
it was a productivity silver bullet it

3402
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:39,760
was a miracle i talked to the

3403
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:41,118
researchers who were working on

3404
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,560
computer support and collaboration in

3405
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:44,000
the late 80s trying to figure out how

3406
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:45,119
are we going to use computer networks to

3407
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,039
be more productive and they were

3408
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:48,960
building all these systems and tools

3409
01:41:47,039 --> 01:41:50,079
email showed up it just wiped all that

3410
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,000
research off the map

3411
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:53,920
there was no need to build these custom

3412
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,679
intranet applications there was no need

3413
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:57,199
to build these these communication

3414
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:59,600
platforms email could just do

3415
01:41:57,198 --> 01:42:01,198
everything yeah right so it was a

3416
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,679
miracle application which is why it's

3417
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,519
spread

3418
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:05,520
everywhere that's one of these things

3419
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,280
where okay unintended consequences right

3420
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:08,960
you had this miracle productivity silver

3421
01:42:07,279 --> 01:42:11,359
bullet it spread everywhere

3422
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:12,560
but it was so effective it just you know

3423
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:14,479
i don't know like a drug i'm sure

3424
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:16,320
there's some pandemic

3425
01:42:14,479 --> 01:42:17,839
metaphor here analogy here of a drug

3426
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:19,118
that like is so effective at treating

3427
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,400
this that it also blows up your whole

3428
01:42:19,118 --> 01:42:21,759
immune system and then everyone gets

3429
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:23,359
sick but well ultimately

3430
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:25,039
it probably significantly increased the

3431
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:25,920
productivity of the world but there's a

3432
01:42:25,039 --> 01:42:29,519
kind of hump

3433
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:30,960
that it now has plateaued and then we're

3434
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:33,040
the the fundamental question you're

3435
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,600
asking is like okay how do we take the

3436
01:42:33,039 --> 01:42:34,639
next

3437
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,320
how do we keep increasing the

3438
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:37,118
productivity yeah no i think it brought

3439
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:40,479
it down so

3440
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:41,839
my think so my contention and uh

3441
01:42:40,479 --> 01:42:44,000
so again there's a little in the book

3442
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:47,119
but i have a more recent wired article

3443
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,800
that puts some newer numbers to this i

3444
01:42:47,118 --> 01:42:51,359
subscribe to the hypothesis that the

3445
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,440
hyperactive hive mind was so detrimental

3446
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:54,880
so yeah it helped productivity at first

3447
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:56,638
right when you could

3448
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:58,000
do fast asynchronous communication but

3449
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:59,199
very quickly there was a sort of

3450
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,520
exponential rise in

3451
01:42:59,198 --> 01:43:02,799
communication amounts once we got to the

3452
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,480
point where the hive mind meant you had

3453
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:06,719
to constantly check your email i think

3454
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:08,079
that made us so unproductive

3455
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:09,600
that it actually was pulling down

3456
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:10,000
non-industrial productivity and i think

3457
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,079
the only

3458
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,079
reason why so it certainly has not been

3459
01:43:12,079 --> 01:43:15,760
going up that metric's been stagnating

3460
01:43:14,079 --> 01:43:16,719
for a long time now while all this was

3461
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:18,079
going on

3462
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:20,239
i think the only reason why it hasn't

3463
01:43:18,079 --> 01:43:22,639
fallen is that we added these

3464
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:23,839
extra shifts off the books i'm going to

3465
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:25,600
work for three hours in the morning i'm

3466
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:27,440
gonna work for three hours at night and

3467
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,639
only that i think has allowed us to

3468
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:31,118
basically

3469
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:32,400
maintain a stagnated non-industrial

3470
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:34,079
growth we should have been shooting up

3471
01:43:32,399 --> 01:43:36,079
the charts i mean this is

3472
01:43:34,079 --> 01:43:37,760
miraculous innovations computer networks

3473
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:38,399
and then we built out these 100 billion

3474
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,719
dollar

3475
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:42,238
ubiquitous worldwide high speed wireless

3476
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:43,439
internet infrastructure with super

3477
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:45,279
computers in our pockets where we could

3478
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:46,719
talk to anyone at any time like

3479
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:47,840
why did our productivity not shoot off

3480
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:49,439
the charts because our brain can't

3481
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,880
contact switch once every six minutes so

3482
01:43:49,439 --> 01:43:52,079
it's fundamentally back to the context

3483
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:54,560
switching is the

3484
01:43:52,079 --> 01:43:55,519
poison in context switching is poison

3485
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,440
it's the

3486
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,719
what what is it about email that forces

3487
01:43:57,439 --> 01:43:59,759
context switching is it both our

3488
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:02,158
psychology that

3489
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,679
drags us in yeah or is it expectation

3490
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:04,839
yeah right right because it's not

3491
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:07,920
i think we've seen this through a

3492
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:10,079
personal a personal will or failure

3493
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:11,279
lens recently like oh am i addicted to

3494
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:13,920
email yes

3495
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:15,920
uh i have bad etiquette about my email

3496
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:18,960
no it's the underlying workflow

3497
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:21,520
so the tool itself i will exonerate

3498
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:23,198
right i think i would rather use pop3

3499
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:25,280
than a fax protocol

3500
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:26,879
right i think it's easier the issue is

3501
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:28,880
the hyperactive hivemind workflow

3502
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,719
so if i am now collaborating with 20 or

3503
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,079
30 different people

3504
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:33,679
with back and forth unscheduled

3505
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:34,800
messaging i have to tend those

3506
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:37,199
conversations

3507
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,719
right it's like you have 30 metaphorical

3508
01:44:37,198 --> 01:44:40,238
ping pong tables and when the balls come

3509
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:41,039
back across you have to pretty soon hit

3510
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:43,439
it back

3511
01:44:41,039 --> 01:44:44,800
or stuff actually grinds to a halt so

3512
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:45,359
it's not it's the workflow that's the

3513
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,800
problem

3514
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:48,399
it's not the tools the fact that we use

3515
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,840
it to do all of our collaboration let's

3516
01:44:48,399 --> 01:44:50,960
just send messages back and forth which

3517
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,360
means you can't be

3518
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:55,118
far from checking that because if you

3519
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:56,639
take a break if you batch if you try to

3520
01:44:55,118 --> 01:44:59,118
have better habits

3521
01:44:56,639 --> 01:45:00,719
it's going to slow things down so my

3522
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:02,238
whole villain is this hyperactive hive

3523
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:04,000
mind workflow

3524
01:45:02,238 --> 01:45:06,079
the tool is fine i don't want the tool

3525
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,600
to go away but i want to replace the

3526
01:45:06,079 --> 01:45:08,158
hyperactive my workflow i think this is

3527
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:10,960
going to be

3528
01:45:08,158 --> 01:45:12,799
one of the biggest value generating

3529
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:15,679
productivity revolutions

3530
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:17,279
of the 21st century i quote an anonymous

3531
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:18,480
ceo is pretty well known who says this

3532
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:20,158
is going to be the moon shot

3533
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:21,519
of the 21st century is going to be of

3534
01:45:20,158 --> 01:45:23,759
that importance there's so much

3535
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:25,199
latent productivity that's being

3536
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,880
suppressed because we just figure things

3537
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:30,000
out on the fly in email that as we

3538
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:32,719
figure that out i think it's going to be

3539
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,600
hundreds of billions of dollars you're

3540
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:36,960
so

3541
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:38,639
absolutely right the question is

3542
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,719
what is the world without email look

3543
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:43,920
like how do we fix email

3544
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:44,719
so what happens is at least in my vision

3545
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,118
you

3546
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:48,480
identify well actually there's these

3547
01:45:47,118 --> 01:45:49,039
different processes that make up my

3548
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:50,559
workday

3549
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:52,880
like these are things that i do

3550
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,560
repeatedly often in collaboration with

3551
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,960
other people that do useful things for

3552
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:57,039
my

3553
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,800
company or whatever right now most of

3554
01:45:57,039 --> 01:46:00,560
these processes are implicitly

3555
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,920
implemented with a hyperactive hive mine

3556
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,360
how do we do this thing like answering

3557
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,480
client questions to shoot messages back

3558
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:05,039
and forth you know how do we do this

3559
01:46:04,479 --> 01:46:06,399
thing

3560
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:08,079
posting podcast episodes we'll just

3561
01:46:06,399 --> 01:46:09,359
figure it out on the fly my main

3562
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:11,198
argument is we actually have to do like

3563
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:12,880
they did in the industrial sector

3564
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:14,719
take each of these processes and say is

3565
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:16,239
there a better way to do this

3566
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:18,000
and by better i mean a way that's going

3567
01:46:16,238 --> 01:46:19,118
to minimize the need to have unscheduled

3568
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,880
back and forth messaging

3569
01:46:19,118 --> 01:46:22,799
so we actually have to do process

3570
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:24,319
engineering this created a

3571
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:25,520
massive growth in productivity in the

3572
01:46:24,319 --> 01:46:26,559
industrial sector during the 20th

3573
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:28,000
century we have to do it in knowledge

3574
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,000
work we can't just rock and roll in

3575
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,279
inboxes we actually have to say

3576
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,639
how do we deal with client questions

3577
01:46:31,279 --> 01:46:33,840
well let's put in place a process that

3578
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:35,359
doesn't require us to

3579
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:37,039
send messages back and forth how do we

3580
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:38,399
post podcast episodes let's automate

3581
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:39,679
this to a degree where

3582
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:41,920
i don't have to just send you a message

3583
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:43,840
on the fly and you do this

3584
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:45,520
process by process and the pressure on

3585
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,800
that inbox is released and now you don't

3586
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:48,239
have to check it every six minutes

3587
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:49,520
so you still have email i mean like i

3588
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:50,158
need to send you a file sure i'll use

3589
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,360
email

3590
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:53,359
but we're not coordinating or

3591
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:54,719
collaborating over email or slack which

3592
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:56,079
is just a faster way of doing the hive

3593
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:57,118
mind i mean the slack doesn't solve

3594
01:46:56,079 --> 01:46:59,679
anything there

3595
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:00,960
uh you have better structured bespoke

3596
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,600
processes i think that's what's going to

3597
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,239
unleash

3598
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:05,520
this massive productivity bespoke so the

3599
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:06,799
interesting thing is like

3600
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,639
for example you and i exchanged some

3601
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,800
emails so obviously i

3602
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:12,319
uh for let's just say my particular case

3603
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,920
i schedule podcasts there's a bunch of

3604
01:47:12,319 --> 01:47:16,639
different tasks

3605
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:18,319
fascinatingly enough that i do that

3606
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:21,118
could be converted into processes

3607
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:21,679
yeah is it up to me to create that

3608
01:47:21,118 --> 01:47:23,198
process

3609
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:25,118
or do you think we also need to build

3610
01:47:23,198 --> 01:47:28,399
tools just like email was

3611
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:30,960
a protocol for uh helping us

3612
01:47:28,399 --> 01:47:33,198
create proxy for the different tasks i

3613
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,560
mean i think ultimately

3614
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:36,238
the whole organization the whole team

3615
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:37,440
has to be involved i think ultimately

3616
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:38,718
there's certainly a lot of investor

3617
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:40,158
money being spent right now to try to

3618
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:41,520
figure out those tools

3619
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:42,719
right so i think silicon valley has

3620
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,880
figured this out in the past couple of

3621
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:46,480
years this is the difference between

3622
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:49,199
when i was talking to people after deep

3623
01:47:46,479 --> 01:47:51,519
work and now five years later

3624
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:52,638
is this scent is in the air right

3625
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:53,920
because there's so much latent

3626
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:55,600
productivity so yes there are going to

3627
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,199
be new tools which i think could help

3628
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,000
they're already tools that exist i mean

3629
01:47:57,198 --> 01:47:59,759
in

3630
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,679
the different groups i profiled use

3631
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:05,119
things like trello or basecamp or

3632
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:06,960
asana or flow and you know our schedule

3633
01:48:05,118 --> 01:48:09,198
wants an acuity like there's there's

3634
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,639
a lot of tools out there the key is not

3635
01:48:09,198 --> 01:48:12,479
to think about it in terms of

3636
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:14,239
what tool do i replace email with

3637
01:48:12,479 --> 01:48:15,678
instead you think about it with

3638
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:17,118
i have a pro we're trying to come with a

3639
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:19,760
process that reduces back and forth

3640
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:21,920
messages oh what tool might help us

3641
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,360
might help us do that yeah and i would

3642
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:24,639
push it's not about necessarily

3643
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:25,519
efficiency in fact

3644
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:27,840
some of these things are going to take

3645
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:28,880
more time so writing a letter to someone

3646
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:30,239
is like a

3647
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,319
high value activity is probably worth

3648
01:48:30,238 --> 01:48:33,359
doing the thing that's killer is the

3649
01:48:32,319 --> 01:48:34,880
back and forth

3650
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:36,639
because now i have to keep checking

3651
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,440
right so we scheduled this together

3652
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:39,199
because i

3653
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:41,118
knew you from before but like most of

3654
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:41,439
the the interviews i was scheduling for

3655
01:48:41,118 --> 01:48:43,198
this

3656
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:45,198
actually i have a process with my

3657
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:46,638
publicist where we use a shared document

3658
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:48,479
and she puts stuff in there and then i

3659
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:50,159
check it twice a week and

3660
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:51,198
there's scheduling options and i say

3661
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:52,719
here's what i want to do this one or

3662
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:54,479
this will work for this one or whatever

3663
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:56,239
and it takes more time in the moment

3664
01:48:54,479 --> 01:48:58,718
than just but it means that we have

3665
01:48:56,238 --> 01:49:00,000
almost no back and forth messaging for

3666
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:02,480
podcast scheduling which without

3667
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,760
this so like with my uk publisher i

3668
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:04,718
didn't put this process into place

3669
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:06,800
because we're not

3670
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:08,560
doing as many interviews but it's all

3671
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:10,159
the time and i'm like oh man i could

3672
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:11,760
really feel the difference right it's

3673
01:49:10,158 --> 01:49:13,679
the back and forth that's killer i

3674
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,280
suppose it is up to

3675
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:16,880
the individual people involved like you

3676
01:49:15,279 --> 01:49:18,880
said uh

3677
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,960
knowledge workers like they have to

3678
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:24,000
carry the responsibility

3679
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:25,520
of uh creating processes like how

3680
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,039
always asking the first principles

3681
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:28,239
question how could this be converted

3682
01:49:27,039 --> 01:49:29,679
into a process

3683
01:49:28,238 --> 01:49:31,759
yeah so you can start by doing this

3684
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:32,639
yourself like just with what you can

3685
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:34,480
control

3686
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:35,520
i think ultimately once the team teams

3687
01:49:34,479 --> 01:49:36,319
are doing that i think that's probably

3688
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,280
the right scale

3689
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:38,479
if you try to do this at the

3690
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:39,759
organizational scale you're going to get

3691
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:42,959
bureaucracy right

3692
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:43,679
so if it's exactly right elon musk is

3693
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:46,000
going to

3694
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:46,719
dictate down to everyone at tesla or

3695
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
something like this

3696
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:49,760
that's too much remove you get

3697
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,880
bureaucracy but if it's we're a team of

3698
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:52,880
six

3699
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:55,039
that's working together on you know

3700
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,400
whatever powertrain software

3701
01:49:55,039 --> 01:49:57,760
then we can figure out on our own what

3702
01:49:56,399 --> 01:49:58,079
are our processes how do we want to do

3703
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,520
this

3704
01:49:58,079 --> 01:50:01,920
so it's ultimately also creating a

3705
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:03,679
culture we're saying like in email

3706
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:05,520
sending an email just for the hell of it

3707
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:08,719
it should be taboo like

3708
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:10,000
so like you are being uh

3709
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:11,679
you're being destructive to the

3710
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,279
productivity of the team by sending this

3711
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:16,480
email yes as opposed to

3712
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:17,039
uh helping develop uh a process and so

3713
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:20,319
on

3714
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:20,639
uh that that will ultimately automate

3715
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:22,000
this

3716
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:23,599
that's why i'm trying to spread this

3717
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,198
message of the context switches it's

3718
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:26,560
poison i get so much into the science of

3719
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:28,799
it i think we underestimate

3720
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,159
how much it kills us they have to wrench

3721
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,719
away our contacts look at a message and

3722
01:50:30,158 --> 01:50:32,879
come back

3723
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:35,039
and so once you have the mindset of it's

3724
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:36,719
a huge thing to ask of someone

3725
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:38,158
to have to take their attention off

3726
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:38,960
something and look back at this and if

3727
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:40,559
they have to do that

3728
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:42,000
for three or four times like we're just

3729
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:43,440
going to figure this out on the fly

3730
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,880
and every message is going to require

3731
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:45,439
five checks of the inbox while you wait

3732
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:47,199
for it well

3733
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:49,118
now you've created whatever it is at

3734
01:50:47,198 --> 01:50:51,279
this point 25 or 30

3735
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:52,799
contact shifts like you've just done a

3736
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:54,079
huge disservice to someone's day this

3737
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:55,679
would be like if i had a professional

3738
01:50:54,079 --> 01:50:57,039
athlete it's like hey do me a favor

3739
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:58,079
i need to go do this press interview but

3740
01:50:57,039 --> 01:50:59,439
to get there you're going to have to

3741
01:50:58,079 --> 01:51:01,118
carry this sandbag

3742
01:50:59,439 --> 01:51:02,238
and sprint up this hill like completely

3743
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:03,679
exhaust your muscles and then you have

3744
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:05,198
to go play a game like of course i'm not

3745
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:06,960
going to ask an athlete to do

3746
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:08,479
like an incredibly physically demanding

3747
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,880
thing right before a game

3748
01:51:08,479 --> 01:51:12,399
but something as easy as thoughts

3749
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:13,920
question mark or like hey do you want to

3750
01:51:12,399 --> 01:51:15,679
jump on a call and it's going to be six

3751
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:17,359
back and forth messages to figure it out

3752
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:18,560
it's kind of the cognitive equivalent

3753
01:51:17,359 --> 01:51:19,519
right you're taking the wind out of

3754
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:21,520
someone

3755
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:22,800
yeah and by the way for people who are

3756
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,719
listening because i

3757
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:26,400
recently posted a few job openings for

3758
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:28,319
so on to help with this thing

3759
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:29,839
and one of the things that people are

3760
01:51:28,319 --> 01:51:31,439
surprised when they work with me is how

3761
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:32,079
many spreadsheets and processes are

3762
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:33,598
involved

3763
01:51:32,079 --> 01:51:35,279
it's like claude shannon right i talked

3764
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:36,239
about communication theater information

3765
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:37,519
theory

3766
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:39,359
it takes time to come up with a clever

3767
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,639
code up front so you spend more time up

3768
01:51:39,359 --> 01:51:41,198
front figuring out those spreadsheets

3769
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:44,079
and trying to

3770
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:45,359
get people on board with it but then

3771
01:51:44,079 --> 01:51:47,439
your communication going forward is all

3772
01:51:45,359 --> 01:51:49,598
much more efficient so over time

3773
01:51:47,439 --> 01:51:51,839
you're using much less bandwidth right

3774
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:53,760
so you you do pain up front

3775
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:55,840
yes it's quicker just right now to send

3776
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,360
an email but if i spend a half day to do

3777
01:51:55,840 --> 01:52:00,719
this over the next six months

3778
01:51:57,359 --> 01:52:01,598
i've saved myself 600 emails now here's

3779
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:03,118
a tough question

3780
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:05,440
uh for you know from the computer

3781
01:52:03,118 --> 01:52:09,359
science perspective we often over

3782
01:52:05,439 --> 01:52:12,399
optimize so you create processes

3783
01:52:09,359 --> 01:52:17,118
and you okay just like you're saying

3784
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:19,759
it's so pleasurable to increase

3785
01:52:17,118 --> 01:52:20,719
uh in the long term productivity that

3786
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:22,880
sometimes you just

3787
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:25,039
enjoy that process in itself yeah by

3788
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:28,319
just creating processes

3789
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:30,000
and you actually never uh

3790
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:31,359
like it has a negative effect on

3791
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,359
productivity long term because you're

3792
01:52:31,359 --> 01:52:36,639
too obsessed with the processes

3793
01:52:33,359 --> 01:52:37,679
is that is that uh a nice problem to

3794
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:39,920
have essentially

3795
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:41,520
i mean it's a problem i mean because

3796
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:42,639
let's look at the one sector that does

3797
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:45,280
do this which is

3798
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:47,840
uh developers yeah right so agile

3799
01:52:45,279 --> 01:52:49,840
methodologies like scrum or kanban are

3800
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:51,119
basically workflow methodologies that

3801
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,239
are much better than the hyperactive

3802
01:52:51,118 --> 01:52:54,960
hive mine

3803
01:52:52,238 --> 01:52:56,079
but man some of those programmers get

3804
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,439
pretty obsessive i don't know if you've

3805
01:52:56,079 --> 01:53:00,238
ever talked to a whatever

3806
01:52:57,439 --> 01:53:01,039
level three scrum master they get really

3807
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:03,759
obsessive

3808
01:53:01,039 --> 01:53:04,079
about like it has to happen exactly this

3809
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,360
way

3810
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:07,118
and it's probably seven times more

3811
01:53:05,359 --> 01:53:08,799
complex than it needs to be

3812
01:53:07,118 --> 01:53:10,238
i'm hoping that's just because nerds

3813
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:12,639
like me you know

3814
01:53:10,238 --> 01:53:14,319
like to do that but it's it's a a

3815
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:15,760
broadly probably an issue right we have

3816
01:53:14,319 --> 01:53:16,880
to be careful because you can just go

3817
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:18,639
down that

3818
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,159
that fiddling path like so it needs to

3819
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:21,279
be here's how we do it let's reduce the

3820
01:53:20,158 --> 01:53:24,960
messages and let's roll

3821
01:53:21,279 --> 01:53:27,198
you know um you can't save yourself

3822
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,158
through if you can get the process just

3823
01:53:27,198 --> 01:53:30,479
right right

3824
01:53:28,158 --> 01:53:31,598
so i wrote this article kind of recently

3825
01:53:30,479 --> 01:53:32,718
called the rise and fall of getting

3826
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:36,079
things done

3827
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:36,960
and i profiled this productivity guru

3828
01:53:36,079 --> 01:53:38,319
name merlin man

3829
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:40,960
and i talked about this movement called

3830
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:41,759
productivity prawn as like elite speak

3831
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,359
term

3832
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:45,280
in the early 2000s where people just

3833
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:47,198
became convinced that if they could

3834
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:49,439
combine their productivity systems with

3835
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:50,479
software and they could find just the

3836
01:53:49,439 --> 01:53:51,839
right software just the right

3837
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:53,118
configuration where they could offload

3838
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,679
most of the difficulty of work would

3839
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:54,880
happen

3840
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:56,000
with the machines when you kind of

3841
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,440
figure out for and then they could just

3842
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,039
sort of crank widgets and would be

3843
01:53:57,439 --> 01:54:00,719
and the whole thing fell apart because

3844
01:53:59,039 --> 01:54:02,000
work is hard and it's hard to do

3845
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:04,079
and making decisions about what to work

3846
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,880
on is hard and no system can really do

3847
01:54:04,079 --> 01:54:09,679
that for you so you have to have this

3848
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:11,279
this sort of balance between i uh

3849
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:12,560
contact switches are poison so we got to

3850
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:13,759
get rid of the context which is once

3851
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:16,159
like something's working good enough to

3852
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:17,440
get rid of the context switches then

3853
01:54:16,158 --> 01:54:19,359
get after it yeah there's a

3854
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:20,879
psychological process there for me and

3855
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:23,118
the ocd nature

3856
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:25,920
like i've literally embarrassingly

3857
01:54:23,118 --> 01:54:28,479
enough have lost my before when

3858
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:30,319
uh so in in many of the processes that

3859
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:33,359
involve python scripts

3860
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:36,079
the rule is to not use

3861
01:54:33,359 --> 01:54:39,198
spaces underscore zone there's like

3862
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:42,238
rules for like how you format stuff okay

3863
01:54:39,198 --> 01:54:42,960
and like i should not lose my when

3864
01:54:42,238 --> 01:54:45,198
somebody

3865
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,279
had a space and maybe capital letters

3866
01:54:45,198 --> 01:54:49,118
like it's okay to have a space

3867
01:54:47,279 --> 01:54:50,880
i think because there's this feeling

3868
01:54:49,118 --> 01:54:54,079
like something is not perfect

3869
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:56,000
yeah and uh as opposed to in the python

3870
01:54:54,079 --> 01:54:56,559
script allowing some flexibility around

3871
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,319
that

3872
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:00,000
you create this programmatic way that's

3873
01:54:58,319 --> 01:55:00,719
flawless and when everything's working

3874
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,479
perfectly it's

3875
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:06,000
perfect but actually if you strive for

3876
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:09,519
perfection

3877
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,880
it has the same stress like has a lot of

3878
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,960
the stress that you were seeking to

3879
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:16,000
escape with the contact switching yeah

3880
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:18,639
because you're almost

3881
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,158
stressing about errors like when the

3882
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:22,159
process is functioning

3883
01:55:20,158 --> 01:55:24,238
you're there's always this anxiety of

3884
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:26,158
like i wonder if it's gonna

3885
01:55:24,238 --> 01:55:27,759
succeed yeah i wonder if it's gonna

3886
01:55:26,158 --> 01:55:28,559
succeed yeah no no i think some of

3887
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:29,920
that's just you and i

3888
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,840
probably i mean it's just our mindset

3889
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,319
right we're in we do computer science

3890
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:35,279
right

3891
01:55:32,319 --> 01:55:36,960
so chicken and egg yeah and a lot of the

3892
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:38,559
processes end up working here are much

3893
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,000
rougher it's like okay instead of

3894
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:43,039
letting clients just

3895
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,599
email me all the time we have a weekly

3896
01:55:43,039 --> 01:55:45,359
call

3897
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:46,800
and then we send them a breakdown of

3898
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:48,880
everything we committed to

3899
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:50,159
right that's a process that works okay i

3900
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,760
get asked a lot of questions because i'm

3901
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:53,279
the javascript guy in the company

3902
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:54,800
accepting it by email i have office

3903
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:55,840
hours this is what basecamp does all

3904
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:57,039
right so you come to my office hours

3905
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,840
that cuts down a lot of back and forth

3906
01:55:57,039 --> 01:56:00,560
all right we're gonna instead of

3907
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:03,279
emailing about this project we'll have a

3908
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:04,719
trello board and we'll do a weekly

3909
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:05,920
really structured status meeting real

3910
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:06,880
quick what's going on who needs what

3911
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:08,480
let's go

3912
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:09,679
and now everything's on there and on our

3913
01:56:08,479 --> 01:56:11,279
inboxes we'll have to send as many

3914
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:12,239
messages so like that rough level of

3915
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:15,039
granularity

3916
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:17,118
that gets you most of the way there so

3917
01:56:15,039 --> 01:56:19,760
the parts that you can't automate and

3918
01:56:17,118 --> 01:56:21,759
turn into a process

3919
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:24,639
so how many parts like that do you think

3920
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:28,000
should remain in a perfect world

3921
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:28,560
and uh for those parts where email is

3922
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,760
still

3923
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:33,199
useful what do you recommend those

3924
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:34,639
emails look like how

3925
01:56:33,198 --> 01:56:36,799
how should you write emails when should

3926
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:40,639
you send them yeah i think email

3927
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:42,000
email is good for delivering information

3928
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:43,440
right so i think of it like a fax

3929
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,359
machine or something you know it's a

3930
01:56:43,439 --> 01:56:46,638
really good fax machine so if i need to

3931
01:56:45,359 --> 01:56:48,479
send you something and you just send you

3932
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:50,159
a file i need to broadcast a new

3933
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:53,439
policy or something like email's a great

3934
01:56:50,158 --> 01:56:55,519
way to do it it's bad for collaboration

3935
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:56,719
so you're having a conversation like

3936
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,239
we're trying to reach a decision on

3937
01:56:56,719 --> 01:56:58,719
something i'm trying to learn about

3938
01:56:58,238 --> 01:57:00,399
something

3939
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:02,158
i'm trying to clarify what something

3940
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:04,638
what this is that it's more than just

3941
01:57:02,158 --> 01:57:05,839
like a one answer type question

3942
01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:08,800
then i think that you shouldn't be doing

3943
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:11,679
an email but see here's the thing

3944
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:13,679
like you and i don't talk often and so

3945
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:16,880
we have a kind of new interaction

3946
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:18,639
it's not so sure yeah you have a book

3947
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,159
coming out so there's a process and so

3948
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:21,840
on but

3949
01:57:20,158 --> 01:57:24,079
say there don't you think there's a lot

3950
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:26,159
of novel interactive experiences

3951
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:28,880
yeah that's fine so you could just for

3952
01:57:26,158 --> 01:57:30,319
every novel experience it's okay to have

3953
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:32,159
a little bit of exchange just fine like

3954
01:57:30,319 --> 01:57:33,920
i think it's fine uh if stuff comes in

3955
01:57:32,158 --> 01:57:35,198
over the transom or it's you hear from

3956
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,760
someone you haven't heard from in a

3957
01:57:35,198 --> 01:57:38,238
while

3958
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:40,079
i think oh that's fine i mean that's

3959
01:57:38,238 --> 01:57:41,359
that email at its best where it starts

3960
01:57:40,079 --> 01:57:42,639
to kill us is where

3961
01:57:41,359 --> 01:57:43,679
all of our collaboration is happening

3962
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:45,599
with the back and forth so when you've

3963
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:47,840
moved the bulk of that out of your inbox

3964
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:49,279
now you're back in that meg ryan movie

3965
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,920
like you got mail where it's like all

3966
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:51,439
right

3967
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:52,960
load this up and you wait for the modem

3968
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:54,559
you're like oh we got a message yeah

3969
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:55,760
yeah and there's like sent me a message

3970
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,719
this is interesting right you're back to

3971
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:58,960
the aol days

3972
01:57:56,719 --> 01:58:00,319
so you're talking about the bulk of the

3973
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:03,198
the business world where

3974
01:58:00,319 --> 01:58:04,000
like email has replaced the actual uh

3975
01:58:03,198 --> 01:58:05,759
communication

3976
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,039
all the communication protocols required

3977
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:08,880
to accomplish anything everything is

3978
01:58:07,039 --> 01:58:11,599
just happening with messages so if you

3979
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:12,880
now get most stuff done repeatable

3980
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:14,480
collaborations with

3981
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:15,679
with other processes that don't require

3982
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:17,678
you to check these inboxes then the

3983
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:19,359
inbox can serve like an inbox

3984
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:21,118
which includes hearing from interesting

3985
01:58:19,359 --> 01:58:22,158
people right or

3986
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:23,439
sending something hey i don't know if

3987
01:58:22,158 --> 01:58:24,638
you saw this i thought you might like it

3988
01:58:23,439 --> 01:58:26,479
like it's great for that

3989
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:29,039
so there's there's probably a bunch of

3990
01:58:26,479 --> 01:58:31,519
people listening to this they're like

3991
01:58:29,039 --> 01:58:33,118
uh yeah but i work on a team and they're

3992
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:34,719
all they use is email

3993
01:58:33,118 --> 01:58:36,719
how do you start the revolution from

3994
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:39,279
like the ground up yeah well do it

3995
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:40,719
do asymmetric optimization first so

3996
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:42,158
identify all your processes and then

3997
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:44,480
change what you can change

3998
01:58:42,158 --> 01:58:46,238
and be socially very careful about it so

3999
01:58:44,479 --> 01:58:48,319
don't necessarily say like okay this is

4000
01:58:46,238 --> 01:58:50,638
a new process we all have to do

4001
01:58:48,319 --> 01:58:51,840
you're just you know hey we gotta get

4002
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:52,719
this report ready

4003
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,560
here's what i think we should do like

4004
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:55,039
i'll get a draft into our dropbox folder

4005
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:58,080
by

4006
01:58:55,039 --> 01:59:00,000
like noon on monday grab it uh i won't

4007
01:58:58,079 --> 01:59:01,519
touch it again until tuesday morning

4008
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,039
and then i'll look at your changes i

4009
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,000
have this office hours always scheduled

4010
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:05,279
tuesday afternoon so

4011
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,359
if there's anything that catches your

4012
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:08,000
attention grab me then but i've told the

4013
01:59:07,359 --> 01:59:11,839
designer

4014
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:13,198
who cc'd on this that uh by cob tuesday

4015
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,960
the final version will be ready for them

4016
01:59:13,198 --> 01:59:16,000
to take and polish or whatever like the

4017
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:16,639
person on the other end is like great

4018
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,639
i'm glad

4019
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:19,920
you know cal has a plan so i just what

4020
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:21,039
do i need to do i need to edit this

4021
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,158
tomorrow whatever right

4022
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:23,279
but you've actually pulled them into a

4023
01:59:22,158 --> 01:59:24,879
process that means we're going to get

4024
01:59:23,279 --> 01:59:26,399
this report together without having to

4025
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:29,279
just go back and forth so you just

4026
01:59:26,399 --> 01:59:31,198
asymmetrically optimize these things and

4027
01:59:29,279 --> 01:59:32,559
then you can begin the conversation

4028
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:35,279
and maybe that's where my book comes in

4029
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:37,199
place you just sort of yeah slide it

4030
01:59:35,279 --> 01:59:38,479
slide it across to buy the book and just

4031
01:59:37,198 --> 01:59:40,238
leave it leave it out

4032
01:59:38,479 --> 01:59:41,759
give it to everybody on your team okay

4033
01:59:40,238 --> 01:59:42,799
so we solved the bulk of the email

4034
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:44,639
problem with this

4035
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:46,880
is there a case to be made that even for

4036
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:50,480
like communication between you and i

4037
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:51,920
we should move away from uh from email

4038
01:59:50,479 --> 01:59:52,959
like for example there's a guy i

4039
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:54,639
recently i don't know if you know

4040
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:55,439
comedians but there's a guy named joey

4041
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:57,039
diaz

4042
01:59:55,439 --> 01:59:58,799
yeah that i've had an interaction with

4043
01:59:57,039 --> 02:00:00,719
recently and that guy

4044
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:01,840
first of all the sweetest human despite

4045
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:03,279
what his comedy

4046
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:05,679
sounds like he's the sweetest human

4047
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:06,399
being and he's a big proponent of just

4048
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:08,639
pick up

4049
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:10,638
the phone yeah and call yeah and it

4050
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:12,000
makes me so uncomfortable people call me

4051
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:15,118
yeah it's like i don't know what to

4052
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,238
do with this thing uh but it kind of

4053
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:19,118
gets everything done

4054
02:00:16,238 --> 02:00:19,678
quicker i think if i remove the anxiety

4055
02:00:19,118 --> 02:00:21,198
from that

4056
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:23,599
is there a case to be made for that or

4057
02:00:21,198 --> 02:00:24,799
this email could still be the most

4058
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:26,159
efficient way to do this

4059
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:28,079
no i mean look if you if you have to

4060
02:00:26,158 --> 02:00:29,598
interact with someone there's a lot of

4061
02:00:28,079 --> 02:00:30,559
efficiency in synchrony

4062
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:32,079
right and this is something from

4063
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:33,360
distributed system theory where you know

4064
02:00:32,079 --> 02:00:34,559
if you go from synchronous to

4065
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:35,920
asynchronous networks

4066
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,520
there's a huge amount of overhead to the

4067
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:38,880
asynchrony so actually the protocol is

4068
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:40,639
required to solve things

4069
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:42,079
in asynchronous networks are

4070
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:42,960
significantly more complicated and

4071
02:00:42,079 --> 02:00:44,479
fragile than

4072
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:46,960
synchronous protocols so if we can just

4073
02:00:44,479 --> 02:00:47,919
do real time it's usually better and

4074
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,198
also from a

4075
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:50,399
interaction like social connection

4076
02:00:49,198 --> 02:00:51,919
standpoint there's a lot more

4077
02:00:50,399 --> 02:00:53,039
information in the human voice and the

4078
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:55,199
back and forth

4079
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:56,319
uh yeah if you just call so very

4080
02:00:55,198 --> 02:00:58,238
generational right

4081
02:00:56,319 --> 02:01:00,079
like our generation will be comfortable

4082
02:00:58,238 --> 02:01:01,919
talking on the phone in a way that like

4083
02:01:00,079 --> 02:01:03,840
a younger generation isn't but an older

4084
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:06,079
generation is more comfortable with well

4085
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:07,520
you just call people whereas we so

4086
02:01:06,079 --> 02:01:08,559
there's a happy medium but most of my

4087
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:10,880
good friends

4088
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:11,599
we just talk we have regular phone calls

4089
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,960
okay yeah

4090
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:14,560
it's not i don't just call them we

4091
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,399
schedule it we schedule it yeah just on

4092
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:18,880
text like yeah you want to talk

4093
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:20,719
sometime soon do you do you ever have a

4094
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:23,359
processes around friends

4095
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:24,319
not really no i feel like i should i

4096
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:26,000
feel like uh

4097
02:01:24,319 --> 02:01:27,599
you have like a lot of interesting

4098
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,800
friend possibilities

4099
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:30,719
you have like an interesting problem

4100
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:32,880
right like really interesting people

4101
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:33,840
you can talk to well that's that's one

4102
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:34,639
problem the other one is the

4103
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:36,560
introversion

4104
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:37,920
where i'm just afraid of people and get

4105
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:39,920
really stressed like

4106
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:41,359
i freak out and so you picked a good

4107
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,840
line of work

4108
02:01:41,359 --> 02:01:45,519
yeah now perhaps it's the goggins thing

4109
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:49,039
it's like facing your fears or whatever

4110
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:51,040
but but it's almost like

4111
02:01:49,039 --> 02:01:52,880
there's uh it has to do with the

4112
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:55,679
timetables thing and the deep work

4113
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:56,639
that the nice thing about the processes

4114
02:01:55,679 --> 02:02:00,880
is

4115
02:01:56,639 --> 02:02:03,440
it not only automates sort of uh

4116
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:05,520
automates away the contact switching it

4117
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:06,319
ensures you do the important things too

4118
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:08,480
like yeah

4119
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:10,319
it's like prioritize so the thing is

4120
02:02:08,479 --> 02:02:13,519
with email

4121
02:02:10,319 --> 02:02:16,079
because everything is done over email

4122
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:18,239
you can be lazy in the same way with

4123
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:19,359
like social networks and and do the easy

4124
02:02:18,238 --> 02:02:21,279
things first

4125
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:22,559
that are not that important so the

4126
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:24,238
process also

4127
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:26,480
enforces that you do the important

4128
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:28,959
things and for me the important

4129
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:30,238
things is like okay it sounds weird but

4130
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:31,840
like social connection

4131
02:02:30,238 --> 02:02:34,238
no that's one of the most important

4132
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:36,960
things in all of human existence

4133
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:37,439
yeah and doing it the the paradoxical

4134
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:39,520
thing

4135
02:02:37,439 --> 02:02:41,919
i got into this for digital minimalism

4136
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:43,199
uh the more you sacrifice on behalf of

4137
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:44,158
the connection the stronger the

4138
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:46,000
connection feels

4139
02:02:44,158 --> 02:02:48,158
right so sacrificing non-trivial time

4140
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:50,079
and attention on behalf of someone is

4141
02:02:48,158 --> 02:02:52,799
what tells your brain that this is a

4142
02:02:50,079 --> 02:02:54,800
a serious relationship which is why

4143
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,440
social media had this paradoxical effect

4144
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:57,440
making people

4145
02:02:55,439 --> 02:02:59,198
feel less social because it took the

4146
02:02:57,439 --> 02:03:00,000
friction out of it and so the brain just

4147
02:02:59,198 --> 02:03:01,839
doesn't like yeah

4148
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,840
you've been commenting on this person's

4149
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:06,079
whatever you've been retweeting them or

4150
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:07,360
sending them some text you haven't it's

4151
02:03:06,079 --> 02:03:09,519
not hard enough

4152
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:10,960
and then then the the perceived strength

4153
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:12,560
of that social connection diminishes

4154
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:14,399
where if you talk to them or go spend

4155
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:16,480
time with them or whatever

4156
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:17,598
you're going to feel better about it so

4157
02:03:16,479 --> 02:03:18,799
the friction is good

4158
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:20,880
i have a thing with some of my friends

4159
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:22,960
where at the end of each call we take a

4160
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:24,239
couple minutes to schedule the next

4161
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:25,679
then you never it's like i do with

4162
02:03:24,238 --> 02:03:26,959
haircuts or something right like if i

4163
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:28,399
don't schedule it then

4164
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:30,239
yeah i'm never gonna get my hair cut

4165
02:03:28,399 --> 02:03:32,479
right and so we it's like okay

4166
02:03:30,238 --> 02:03:33,598
when you want to talk next you know yeah

4167
02:03:32,479 --> 02:03:34,079
that's a really that's a really good

4168
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:37,119
idea

4169
02:03:34,079 --> 02:03:39,118
i i just don't call friends and uh like

4170
02:03:37,118 --> 02:03:40,479
every 10 years i do something dramatic

4171
02:03:39,118 --> 02:03:41,279
for them so then we maintain the

4172
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:42,718
friendship like

4173
02:03:41,279 --> 02:03:45,279
i'd murder somebody that they really

4174
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:48,480
don't like i just careful man

4175
02:03:45,279 --> 02:03:51,359
joey might ask you just yet that's why

4176
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:52,638
it's one of my favorites in new jersey

4177
02:03:51,359 --> 02:03:55,679
what's exactly what we're gonna do

4178
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:57,920
that robot dog of yours we're gonna go

4179
02:03:55,679 --> 02:04:00,639
down to jersey there's a special human i

4180
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:01,359
i love the comedian world they've been

4181
02:04:00,639 --> 02:04:02,639
shaking up

4182
02:04:01,359 --> 02:04:06,559
i don't know if you listen to joe rogan

4183
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:08,960
all those folks they kind of um

4184
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:11,679
are doing something interesting for mit

4185
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:12,960
and and academia they're shaking up this

4186
02:04:11,679 --> 02:04:14,800
world a little bit

4187
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,960
like podcasting because comedians are

4188
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:18,639
paving the way for podcasting yeah

4189
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:20,319
and so you have like andrew huberman

4190
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:21,199
who's a neuroscientist a stanford friend

4191
02:04:20,319 --> 02:04:24,399
of mine now

4192
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:25,919
yeah you know he he's like into

4193
02:04:24,399 --> 02:04:27,519
podcasting now and

4194
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:29,118
you're into podcasting of course you're

4195
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:30,960
not necessarily podcasting about

4196
02:04:29,118 --> 02:04:34,000
computer science currently right yeah

4197
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:36,480
but that it

4198
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,439
it feels like you could have a lot of

4199
02:04:36,479 --> 02:04:40,718
the free

4200
02:04:37,439 --> 02:04:41,919
spirit of the comedians implemented by

4201
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:43,840
the people

4202
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:45,440
who are academically trained who

4203
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:48,159
actually have a

4204
02:04:45,439 --> 02:04:49,759
niche specialty yeah and then and then

4205
02:04:48,158 --> 02:04:50,879
that results i mean who knows what the

4206
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:53,039
experiment looks like

4207
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:55,118
yeah but that results me being able to

4208
02:04:53,039 --> 02:04:57,760
talk about robotics with joey diaz

4209
02:04:55,118 --> 02:04:59,598
yeah when he says you know drops f-bombs

4210
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:02,320
every other sentence and

4211
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:03,199
i the world is like i've seen actually a

4212
02:05:02,319 --> 02:05:06,319
shift within

4213
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:07,839
uh colleagues and friends within mit

4214
02:05:06,319 --> 02:05:09,279
where they're becoming much more

4215
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:10,319
accepting of that kind of thing it's

4216
02:05:09,279 --> 02:05:11,519
very interesting

4217
02:05:10,319 --> 02:05:13,359
that's interesting so you're seeing

4218
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:14,960
because i okay because they're seeing

4219
02:05:13,359 --> 02:05:16,000
how popular it is they're like well

4220
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:17,279
you're really popular

4221
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,279
i don't know how they think about it at

4222
02:05:17,279 --> 02:05:21,279
georgetown for example i don't know

4223
02:05:19,279 --> 02:05:23,118
it's interesting but i think what what

4224
02:05:21,279 --> 02:05:26,158
happens is

4225
02:05:23,118 --> 02:05:28,559
the popularity of it combined with just

4226
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:29,598
good conversations with people they

4227
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:32,000
respect

4228
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:32,639
it's like huh okay wait this is the

4229
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,639
thing

4230
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:36,880
yeah and this is more fun to listen to

4231
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:39,520
than a shitty zoom

4232
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,719
lecture yeah about their work yeah it's

4233
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:42,239
like there's something here there's

4234
02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:44,000
something interesting and we don't

4235
02:05:42,238 --> 02:05:46,638
nobody actually knows what that is just

4236
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,319
like with like clubhouse or something

4237
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:50,239
nobody's figured out like where is this

4238
02:05:48,319 --> 02:05:50,559
medium take is this a legitimate medium

4239
02:05:50,238 --> 02:05:53,118
of

4240
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:54,079
education yeah or is this just like a

4241
02:05:53,118 --> 02:05:56,158
fun

4242
02:05:54,078 --> 02:05:57,279
well that's your innovation i think was

4243
02:05:56,158 --> 02:05:59,759
we can bring on

4244
02:05:57,279 --> 02:06:00,479
professors yeah and i know joe rogan did

4245
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:04,079
some of that too

4246
02:06:00,479 --> 02:06:05,598
but but you know but your professors in

4247
02:06:04,078 --> 02:06:07,279
your field like yeah you bring out all

4248
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:08,960
these mit guys who i remember

4249
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:11,519
you know well that's been the big

4250
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:15,039
challenge for me is i don't

4251
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:16,159
is i feel uh

4252
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:18,319
i would i would ask big like

4253
02:06:16,158 --> 02:06:21,359
philosophical questions of

4254
02:06:18,319 --> 02:06:24,158
only people like yourself that are

4255
02:06:21,359 --> 02:06:25,279
like really well public like so for

4256
02:06:24,158 --> 02:06:25,839
example you have a lot of excellent

4257
02:06:25,279 --> 02:06:29,279
papers

4258
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:30,000
on uh you know that a lot has a lot of

4259
02:06:29,279 --> 02:06:33,359
theory in it

4260
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,760
right and there's some temptation to

4261
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:35,920
just

4262
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:37,199
go through papers and i think it's

4263
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:39,279
possible to actually do that i haven't

4264
02:06:37,198 --> 02:06:41,519
done that much but i think it's possible

4265
02:06:39,279 --> 02:06:43,198
it just requires a lot of preparation

4266
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:46,000
and i can probably only do that

4267
02:06:43,198 --> 02:06:46,799
with things that i'm actually like in

4268
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,238
the field i'm

4269
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,760
aware of but there's a dance that

4270
02:06:50,238 --> 02:06:53,439
i would love to be able to try to hit

4271
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:54,880
right where it's actually getting to the

4272
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:56,638
core of some interesting ideas as

4273
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:58,880
opposed to just talking about philosophy

4274
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:00,400
yeah at the same time there's a large

4275
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:02,159
audience for people that just want to be

4276
02:07:00,399 --> 02:07:05,279
inspired by

4277
02:07:02,158 --> 02:07:06,799
like by disciplines where they don't

4278
02:07:05,279 --> 02:07:08,078
necessarily know the details

4279
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,480
yeah but there's a lot of people that

4280
02:07:08,078 --> 02:07:11,920
are like i'm really curious

4281
02:07:10,479 --> 02:07:14,559
i've been thinking about pivoting

4282
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:16,399
careers into software engineering

4283
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:17,920
they would love to hear from people like

4284
02:07:16,399 --> 02:07:19,920
you about computer science

4285
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:21,440
even if it's like theory yeah but just

4286
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:23,199
like the idea that you can have big

4287
02:07:21,439 --> 02:07:24,000
ideas you push them through and it's

4288
02:07:23,198 --> 02:07:25,759
interesting

4289
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:28,639
you fight for it yeah well there's some

4290
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:32,159
uh there's what is that computer file

4291
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:33,039
and uh uh number file these youtube

4292
02:07:32,158 --> 02:07:34,799
channels

4293
02:07:33,039 --> 02:07:37,039
there's uh there's channels i watch on

4294
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:40,159
like chess exceptionally popular

4295
02:07:37,039 --> 02:07:41,679
where i don't i don't understand

4296
02:07:40,158 --> 02:07:42,799
maybe 80 of the time what the hell

4297
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:43,840
they're talking about because they're

4298
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,440
talking about like

4299
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:46,960
why this move is better than this move

4300
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:48,719
but i love the passion

4301
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:50,000
and the genius of those people and just

4302
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:52,078
overhearing it yeah

4303
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,760
i don't know why that's so exciting did

4304
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:55,519
you look at like scott aronson's blog at

4305
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:57,840
all the yeah shuttle optimized yeah it's

4306
02:07:55,520 --> 02:08:00,000
like the hardcore complexity theory

4307
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:01,119
but it's there's an enthusiasm or like

4308
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,118
terry towels blog

4309
02:08:01,118 --> 02:08:04,880
a little bit of humor yeah dairy talk is

4310
02:08:03,118 --> 02:08:07,679
a blog he used to yeah he would

4311
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:08,078
he uh and it would just be i'm going all

4312
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:10,158
in

4313
02:08:08,078 --> 02:08:11,679
on you know here's the new affine group

4314
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:12,879
with which you can do whatever but i

4315
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:14,560
mean it's just equations

4316
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:17,920
well in the case of scott anderson he's

4317
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:20,960
good he's able to turn on like the

4318
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:22,880
inner troll and comedian and so on

4319
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:24,560
he keeps the fun which is the best and

4320
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:25,760
he's a philosophical guy he wrote that

4321
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:28,880
that turns out

4322
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:29,920
yeah yeah so you know we're exploring

4323
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:32,159
these different

4324
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:33,359
ways of communicating in science and and

4325
02:08:32,158 --> 02:08:35,118
exciting the world

4326
02:08:33,359 --> 02:08:36,960
speaking of which i got to ask you about

4327
02:08:35,118 --> 02:08:39,598
computer science

4328
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:40,078
that's right i do some of that uh so i

4329
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:42,960
mean

4330
02:08:40,078 --> 02:08:44,078
a lot of it a lot of your work is what

4331
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:46,560
inspired this

4332
02:08:44,078 --> 02:08:47,679
deep thinking about productivity from

4333
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:50,000
all the different

4334
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:51,920
angles because some of the most rigorous

4335
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:53,520
work is mathematical work

4336
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:55,840
and in computer science that theoretical

4337
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:57,360
computer science let me ask the scott

4338
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:59,840
anderson question of like

4339
02:08:57,359 --> 02:09:01,759
is is there something to you that stands

4340
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:03,360
out in particular that's beautiful or

4341
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:05,280
inspiring

4342
02:09:03,359 --> 02:09:06,559
or just really insightful about computer

4343
02:09:05,279 --> 02:09:09,840
science or the

4344
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:12,159
or maybe mathematics i mean i like

4345
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:13,599
theory and in particular what i've

4346
02:09:12,158 --> 02:09:14,799
always liked in theory is the notion of

4347
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:17,199
impossibilities

4348
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:19,199
that's kind of my specialty so within

4349
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:21,198
the within the context of distributed

4350
02:09:19,198 --> 02:09:23,839
algorithms my specialty is impossibility

4351
02:09:21,198 --> 02:09:26,479
results the idea that you can argue

4352
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:28,880
nothing exists that solves this or

4353
02:09:26,479 --> 02:09:31,279
nothing exists that can solve this

4354
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:32,319
faster than this and that's i think

4355
02:09:31,279 --> 02:09:34,000
that's really interesting and that goes

4356
02:09:32,319 --> 02:09:36,479
all the way back to turin

4357
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,599
there's his original paper on computable

4358
02:09:36,479 --> 02:09:38,879
numbers

4359
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:40,800
with their connection to that it's a

4360
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:41,359
german iceland problem but basically the

4361
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:43,039
german

4362
02:09:41,359 --> 02:09:44,880
name that hilbert called the decision

4363
02:09:43,039 --> 02:09:46,319
problem this was pre-computers

4364
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:47,199
but he was you know he's english so it's

4365
02:09:46,319 --> 02:09:48,719
written in english so it's very

4366
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:50,719
accessible paper

4367
02:09:48,719 --> 02:09:52,078
and it's it lays the foundation for all

4368
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:53,039
of theoretical computer science he just

4369
02:09:52,078 --> 02:09:54,479
has this insight

4370
02:09:53,039 --> 02:09:56,800
he's like well if we think about like an

4371
02:09:54,479 --> 02:09:58,238
algorithm i mean he figures out like all

4372
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:59,920
effective procedures or turing machines

4373
02:09:58,238 --> 02:10:01,919
or basically algorithms we could really

4374
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:03,440
describe a turing machine with a number

4375
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:04,880
which we can now imagine with like

4376
02:10:03,439 --> 02:10:06,000
computer code you could just take a

4377
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:07,679
source file and just

4378
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,279
treat the binary version of the file as

4379
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:11,440
like a really long number right

4380
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:12,319
but it's like every program is just a

4381
02:10:11,439 --> 02:10:14,319
finite number

4382
02:10:12,319 --> 02:10:15,840
it's a natural number and then he

4383
02:10:14,319 --> 02:10:16,479
realized like one way to think about a

4384
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:18,719
problem

4385
02:10:16,479 --> 02:10:20,399
is you have and this is like kind of the

4386
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:20,719
mike sipser approach but you have a sort

4387
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:22,638
of

4388
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:24,000
uh it's a language so of an infinite

4389
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:25,118
number of strings some of them are in

4390
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,719
the language and some of them aren't but

4391
02:10:25,118 --> 02:10:29,198
basically you can imagine a problem is

4392
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:30,880
represented as an infinite binary string

4393
02:10:29,198 --> 02:10:32,319
where in every position like a one means

4394
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:33,520
that string is in the language and zero

4395
02:10:32,319 --> 02:10:36,238
means it isn't

4396
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:36,880
and then he applied cantor from the 19th

4397
02:10:36,238 --> 02:10:38,399
century

4398
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:41,199
and said okay the natural numbers are

4399
02:10:38,399 --> 02:10:44,000
countable so it's accountably infinite

4400
02:10:41,198 --> 02:10:45,279
and infinite binary strings you can use

4401
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,920
a diagonalization argument to show

4402
02:10:45,279 --> 02:10:49,198
they're they're

4403
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:51,118
uh they're uncountable so there's just

4404
02:10:49,198 --> 02:10:52,960
vastly more problems than there are

4405
02:10:51,118 --> 02:10:54,158
algorithms so basically anything you can

4406
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:56,158
come up with for the most part almost

4407
02:10:54,158 --> 02:10:57,279
certainly is not solvable by a computer

4408
02:10:56,158 --> 02:10:58,960
you know and then and then he was like

4409
02:10:57,279 --> 02:11:00,479
let me give a particular example and he

4410
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:01,760
figured out the very first computability

4411
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:02,799
proof and he said let's just walk

4412
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,599
through with a little bit of simple

4413
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:05,039
logic

4414
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:07,119
the halting problem can't be solved by

4415
02:11:05,039 --> 02:11:07,920
an algorithm and that kicked off the

4416
02:11:07,118 --> 02:11:10,960
whole

4417
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:12,239
enterprise of some things can't be

4418
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:13,599
solved by

4419
02:11:12,238 --> 02:11:14,959
algorithms some things can't be solved

4420
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:16,239
by computers and we've just been doing

4421
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:18,480
theory on that

4422
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:20,559
since the that was the 30s he wrote that

4423
02:11:18,479 --> 02:11:22,559
so proving that something is impossible

4424
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:24,079
uh this is sort of a more a stricter

4425
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:24,960
version of that is it like proving

4426
02:11:24,078 --> 02:11:26,719
bounds on

4427
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:28,078
on the performance of different

4428
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:30,158
algorithms yeah so those are yeah so

4429
02:11:28,078 --> 02:11:32,559
bounds are upper bounds right so you say

4430
02:11:30,158 --> 02:11:33,759
uh this algorithm does at least this

4431
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:35,520
well and no worse than this but you're

4432
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:38,159
looking at a particular algorithm

4433
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:39,040
and possibility proof say no algorithm

4434
02:11:38,158 --> 02:11:40,399
ever

4435
02:11:39,039 --> 02:11:41,679
could ever solve this problem so no

4436
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:42,319
algorithm could ever solve the halting

4437
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:44,960
problem

4438
02:11:42,319 --> 02:11:46,158
so it's problem-centric it's it's making

4439
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:48,000
something diff

4440
02:11:46,158 --> 02:11:50,479
making a conclusive statement about the

4441
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,599
problem and that's somehow satisfying

4442
02:11:50,479 --> 02:11:53,598
because it's uh

4443
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:54,719
just philosophically interesting yeah i

4444
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:56,639
mean it all goes back to

4445
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:58,158
you you get back to plato it's all uh

4446
02:11:56,639 --> 02:11:59,599
reductive ad absurdum

4447
02:11:58,158 --> 02:12:01,118
so all these arguments have to start the

4448
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:02,400
only way to do it is there's an infinite

4449
02:12:01,118 --> 02:12:04,319
number of solutions you can't go through

4450
02:12:02,399 --> 02:12:06,559
them as you say let's assume

4451
02:12:04,319 --> 02:12:08,078
for the sake of contradiction that there

4452
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,880
existed something that solves this

4453
02:12:08,078 --> 02:12:10,078
problem

4454
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:11,760
and then you turn the crank of logic

4455
02:12:10,078 --> 02:12:13,039
until you blow up the universe and then

4456
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:13,920
you go back and say okay our original

4457
02:12:13,039 --> 02:12:16,319
assumption

4458
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:18,319
that this solution exists can't be true

4459
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:19,599
i i think philosophically it's like a

4460
02:12:18,319 --> 02:12:20,960
really exciting kind of beautiful thing

4461
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:22,400
it's what i specialize in within

4462
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:24,319
distributed algorithms is

4463
02:12:22,399 --> 02:12:25,920
more like time bound and possibility

4464
02:12:24,319 --> 02:12:27,359
results like no

4465
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:29,520
no algorithm can solve this problem

4466
02:12:27,359 --> 02:12:30,880
faster than this in this setting

4467
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:32,560
of all the infinite number of ways you

4468
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:34,800
might ever do it so

4469
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:36,320
you have of many papers but the one that

4470
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:38,400
caught my eyes smooth analysis of

4471
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:41,439
dynamic networks

4472
02:12:38,399 --> 02:12:42,879
in which you write a problem

4473
02:12:41,439 --> 02:12:44,799
with the worst case perspective is that

4474
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:45,440
it often leads to extremely strong lower

4475
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:47,199
bounds

4476
02:12:45,439 --> 02:12:49,439
these strong results motivate a key

4477
02:12:47,198 --> 02:12:51,198
question is this bond robust in the

4478
02:12:49,439 --> 02:12:51,919
sense that it captures the fundamental

4479
02:12:51,198 --> 02:12:54,799
difficulty

4480
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:55,920
introduced by dynamism or is the bond

4481
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:57,520
fragile

4482
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:59,359
in the sense that the poor performance

4483
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:00,079
it describes depends on an exact

4484
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:03,039
sequence

4485
02:13:00,078 --> 02:13:03,840
of adversarial changes fragile lower

4486
02:13:03,039 --> 02:13:05,760
bounds

4487
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:07,599
leave open the possibility of algorithms

4488
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:08,480
that might still perform well in

4489
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:10,960
practice

4490
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:13,359
that's a in in the sense of the

4491
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:15,599
impossible and the balance discussion

4492
02:13:13,359 --> 02:13:17,519
presents the interesting question i just

4493
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:18,400
like the idea of robust and fragile

4494
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:22,000
bounds

4495
02:13:18,399 --> 02:13:22,879
but uh what do you make about this kind

4496
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:26,078
of tension

4497
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:28,159
between what's provably like what the

4498
02:13:26,078 --> 02:13:30,399
what bounds you can prove

4499
02:13:28,158 --> 02:13:32,399
that are like robust and something

4500
02:13:30,399 --> 02:13:35,679
that's a bit more fragile

4501
02:13:32,399 --> 02:13:37,679
and then and also by way of answering

4502
02:13:35,679 --> 02:13:40,078
that for this particular paper

4503
02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:41,440
uh can you say what the hell are dynamic

4504
02:13:40,078 --> 02:13:42,799
networks

4505
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:45,519
what are distributed i don't know this

4506
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:47,039
come i have no idea and what is smooth

4507
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:49,440
analysis yeah well okay so

4508
02:13:47,039 --> 02:13:51,519
so smooth analysis it's so it wasn't my

4509
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:53,359
idea so spielman and tang

4510
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:55,280
came up with this in the context of

4511
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:56,960
sequential algorithms so just like

4512
02:13:55,279 --> 02:13:58,479
uh the normal world of an algorithm that

4513
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:59,760
runs on a computer

4514
02:13:58,479 --> 02:14:01,519
and they were they were looking at

4515
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:02,880
there's a well-known algorithm

4516
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:05,119
called the simplex algorithm but

4517
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:06,000
basically you're trying to whatever find

4518
02:14:05,118 --> 02:14:07,359
a

4519
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,719
hole around a group of points and

4520
02:14:07,359 --> 02:14:10,238
there's an algorithm that worked really

4521
02:14:08,719 --> 02:14:11,679
well in practice

4522
02:14:10,238 --> 02:14:13,118
but when you analyze it you would say

4523
02:14:11,679 --> 02:14:14,158
you know i can't guarantee it's going to

4524
02:14:13,118 --> 02:14:15,759
work well in practice because if you

4525
02:14:14,158 --> 02:14:18,158
have just the right

4526
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:19,840
inputs this thing could run really long

4527
02:14:18,158 --> 02:14:20,719
right but in practice it seemed to be

4528
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:22,319
really fast so

4529
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:24,239
smooth analysis as they came in and they

4530
02:14:22,319 --> 02:14:26,158
said let's assume that

4531
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:27,678
a bad guy chooses the inputs it could be

4532
02:14:26,158 --> 02:14:29,279
anything like really bad ones

4533
02:14:27,679 --> 02:14:30,719
and all we're going to do is because and

4534
02:14:29,279 --> 02:14:32,158
simplex they're numbers

4535
02:14:30,719 --> 02:14:33,840
we're going to just randomly put a

4536
02:14:32,158 --> 02:14:34,559
little bit of noise on each of the

4537
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:35,679
numbers

4538
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:37,599
and they said if you put a little bit of

4539
02:14:35,679 --> 02:14:38,480
noise on the numbers suddenly simplex

4540
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:40,480
algorithm

4541
02:14:38,479 --> 02:14:42,158
goes really fast like oh that explains

4542
02:14:40,479 --> 02:14:44,158
this this lower bound this this idea

4543
02:14:42,158 --> 02:14:45,679
that it could sometimes run really long

4544
02:14:44,158 --> 02:14:47,279
was a fragile bound because it could

4545
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:49,760
only run a really long time if you had

4546
02:14:47,279 --> 02:14:51,279
exactly the worst pathological input so

4547
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:52,480
then my collaborators and i brought this

4548
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:53,439
over to the world of distributed

4549
02:14:52,479 --> 02:14:54,799
algorithms

4550
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:56,158
we brought them over the general lower

4551
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:58,000
bounds right so so in the world of

4552
02:14:56,158 --> 02:14:59,359
dynamic networks

4553
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:01,039
so distributed algorithm is a bunch of

4554
02:14:59,359 --> 02:15:02,319
algorithms on different machines talking

4555
02:15:01,039 --> 02:15:03,439
to each other

4556
02:15:02,319 --> 02:15:05,519
trying to solve a problem and sometimes

4557
02:15:03,439 --> 02:15:07,279
they're in a network so you imagine them

4558
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:09,599
connected with network links

4559
02:15:07,279 --> 02:15:11,359
and a dynamic network those can change

4560
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:12,319
right so i was talking to you but now i

4561
02:15:11,359 --> 02:15:13,839
can't talk to you anymore and i'm

4562
02:15:12,319 --> 02:15:15,198
connected to a person over here

4563
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:17,199
it's a really hard environment

4564
02:15:15,198 --> 02:15:18,879
mathematically speaking and there's

4565
02:15:17,198 --> 02:15:20,078
a lot of really strong lower bounds

4566
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:22,560
which you could imagine if the network

4567
02:15:20,078 --> 02:15:23,359
can change all the time and a bad guy's

4568
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,960
doing it

4569
02:15:23,359 --> 02:15:26,639
it's like hard to do things well so

4570
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:28,319
there's an algorithm running on every

4571
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:29,599
single node in the network yeah

4572
02:15:28,319 --> 02:15:31,359
and then you're trying to say some

4573
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:33,440
something of any kind that makes any

4574
02:15:31,359 --> 02:15:34,799
kind of definitive sense about

4575
02:15:33,439 --> 02:15:36,719
the performance of that algorithm yeah

4576
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:38,159
so like uh we're sorry i just submitted

4577
02:15:36,719 --> 02:15:39,439
a new paper on this a couple weeks ago

4578
02:15:38,158 --> 02:15:40,078
and we were looking at a very simple

4579
02:15:39,439 --> 02:15:42,158
problem there's

4580
02:15:40,078 --> 02:15:44,078
there's uh some messages in the network

4581
02:15:42,158 --> 02:15:47,118
we want everyone to get them

4582
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:48,479
if the network doesn't change you can do

4583
02:15:47,118 --> 02:15:50,158
this pretty well you can pipeline them

4584
02:15:48,479 --> 02:15:51,839
there's some algorithms that work

4585
02:15:50,158 --> 02:15:53,920
basic algorithms that work really well

4586
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:56,880
if network can change every round

4587
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:58,158
there's these lower bounds that says uh

4588
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:59,440
it takes a really long time there's a

4589
02:15:58,158 --> 02:16:00,638
way that like no matter what algorithm

4590
02:15:59,439 --> 02:16:02,158
you come up with there's a way the

4591
02:16:00,639 --> 02:16:02,719
network can change in such a way that

4592
02:16:02,158 --> 02:16:04,399
just

4593
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:06,719
really slows down your progress

4594
02:16:04,399 --> 02:16:08,238
basically right so smooth analysis there

4595
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:10,078
says yeah but that seems like a

4596
02:16:08,238 --> 02:16:13,678
really you'd have really bad luck if

4597
02:16:10,078 --> 02:16:14,960
your network was changing like exactly

4598
02:16:13,679 --> 02:16:16,639
in the right way that you needed to

4599
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:17,679
screw your algorithm so we said what if

4600
02:16:16,639 --> 02:16:19,679
we uh

4601
02:16:17,679 --> 02:16:21,118
randomly just add or remove a couple

4602
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:22,158
edges in every round so the adversary's

4603
02:16:21,118 --> 02:16:22,960
trying to choose the worst possible

4604
02:16:22,158 --> 02:16:24,960
network we're just

4605
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:26,399
tweaking it a little bit and in that

4606
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:27,679
case this is a new paper i mean

4607
02:16:26,399 --> 02:16:29,598
it's a blind submission so maybe i

4608
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:32,239
shouldn't it's not whatever

4609
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:33,519
um we basically showed an anonymous

4610
02:16:32,239 --> 02:16:35,280
friend of yours submitted a paper

4611
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:37,840
anonymous friend of mine yeah

4612
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:39,519
yeah whose paper should be accepted so

4613
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:40,960
that even just adding like one random

4614
02:16:39,519 --> 02:16:43,120
edge per round

4615
02:16:40,959 --> 02:16:45,119
you uh the here's the cool thing about

4616
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:46,000
the simplest possible solution to this

4617
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:47,359
problem

4618
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,879
blows away that lower bound it does

4619
02:16:47,359 --> 02:16:50,479
really well so that's like a very

4620
02:16:48,879 --> 02:16:50,959
fragile lower bound because we're like

4621
02:16:50,478 --> 02:16:54,318
it's

4622
02:16:50,959 --> 02:16:57,039
it's almost impossible to actually

4623
02:16:54,318 --> 02:16:59,199
keep things slow i wonder how many lower

4624
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:01,280
bounds you can smash

4625
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:02,240
open with this kind of analysis and show

4626
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:04,000
that they're fragile

4627
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:05,519
it's my interest yeah because in

4628
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,280
distributed algorithms

4629
02:17:05,519 --> 02:17:10,478
there's a ton of really famous strong

4630
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:12,800
lower bounds but things have to go wrong

4631
02:17:10,478 --> 02:17:14,398
really really wrong for these lower

4632
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:16,000
bound arguments to work

4633
02:17:14,398 --> 02:17:17,920
and so i like this approach so this this

4634
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:19,200
whole notion of fragile versus robust i

4635
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,040
was like well let's go in and

4636
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:22,719
just throw a little noise in there and

4637
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:24,000
if it becomes solvable

4638
02:17:22,718 --> 02:17:25,358
then maybe that lower bound wasn't

4639
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,840
really something we should worry about

4640
02:17:25,359 --> 02:17:27,599
you know

4641
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:29,920
that's gonna embarrass that's really

4642
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:32,239
uncomfortable that's really embarrassing

4643
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:33,920
to a lot of people because okay this is

4644
02:17:32,239 --> 02:17:36,718
the ocd thing with the

4645
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:38,960
with the spaces is it feels really good

4646
02:17:36,718 --> 02:17:41,678
when you can prove a nice bound

4647
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:42,959
and uh if you say that that bond is

4648
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:44,960
fragile

4649
02:17:42,959 --> 02:17:46,879
yeah that that's that's like there's

4650
02:17:44,959 --> 02:17:49,598
going to be a sad kid that walks

4651
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:50,239
uh like with their lunchbox back home

4652
02:17:49,599 --> 02:17:52,558
like yeah

4653
02:17:50,239 --> 02:17:54,000
my my lower bond doesn't matter no i

4654
02:17:52,558 --> 02:17:55,279
don't think they care it's all

4655
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:57,280
and i don't know it feels like to me a

4656
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:58,639
lot of this theory is just math muchismo

4657
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:00,479
yeah it's like whatever this was a hard

4658
02:17:58,638 --> 02:18:02,239
bound to prove yeah do you

4659
02:18:00,478 --> 02:18:03,599
what do you think about that like uh so

4660
02:18:02,239 --> 02:18:04,558
if you show that something is fragile

4661
02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:06,558
that's more important

4662
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:08,159
that's really important for in practice

4663
02:18:06,558 --> 02:18:09,920
right uh

4664
02:18:08,159 --> 02:18:11,679
so do you think kind of theoretical

4665
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:12,960
computer science is living its own world

4666
02:18:11,679 --> 02:18:15,280
just like mathematics

4667
02:18:12,959 --> 02:18:17,199
yeah and their main effort which i think

4668
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:18,639
is very valuable is to develop ideas

4669
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:20,240
it's not necessarily

4670
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:21,679
interesting whether it's applicable in

4671
02:18:20,239 --> 02:18:23,359
the real world yeah we don't care about

4672
02:18:21,679 --> 02:18:24,478
the applicability yeah like we kind of

4673
02:18:23,359 --> 02:18:26,159
do but not really

4674
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:27,760
we're terrible with computers and can't

4675
02:18:26,159 --> 02:18:28,799
do anything useful with computers and we

4676
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:30,559
don't know how to code and

4677
02:18:28,799 --> 02:18:32,638
and you know we're not we're not

4678
02:18:30,558 --> 02:18:33,599
productive members of like technological

4679
02:18:32,638 --> 02:18:36,718
society but

4680
02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:38,478
i do think things percolate exactly you

4681
02:18:36,718 --> 02:18:40,239
percolate from the the world of theory

4682
02:18:38,478 --> 02:18:41,760
into the world of algorithm design which

4683
02:18:40,239 --> 02:18:42,799
will pull on the theory and now suddenly

4684
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:44,398
it's useful

4685
02:18:42,799 --> 02:18:45,679
uh and then the algorithm design gets

4686
02:18:44,398 --> 02:18:46,718
pulled into the world of practice where

4687
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:47,920
they say well actually we can make this

4688
02:18:46,718 --> 02:18:49,919
algorithm a lot better because in

4689
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:51,439
practice really these servers do xyz and

4690
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:53,760
now we can make this super efficient

4691
02:18:51,439 --> 02:18:55,519
and so i do think i mean i tell my i

4692
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,318
teach theory to the phd students at

4693
02:18:55,519 --> 02:18:58,719
georgetown

4694
02:18:56,318 --> 02:19:00,159
i show them the sort of funnel of like

4695
02:18:58,718 --> 02:19:00,799
okay we're over here doing theory but it

4696
02:19:00,159 --> 02:19:02,318
eventually

4697
02:19:00,799 --> 02:19:04,398
some of this stuff will percolate down

4698
02:19:02,318 --> 02:19:05,359
in effect at the very end you know a

4699
02:19:04,398 --> 02:19:08,398
phone

4700
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:10,239
but it's a long it's a long tunnel but

4701
02:19:08,398 --> 02:19:11,679
the very question you're asking at the

4702
02:19:10,239 --> 02:19:13,679
the highest philosophical level is

4703
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:16,558
fascinating like if you take a system

4704
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:18,318
a distributed system or a network and

4705
02:19:16,558 --> 02:19:22,000
introduce a little bit of noise

4706
02:19:18,318 --> 02:19:23,199
into it like how many problems of that

4707
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,760
nature

4708
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:27,439
are fundamentally changed by that little

4709
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:29,280
introduction of noise

4710
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:30,800
yeah because it's all especially in

4711
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:32,479
distributed algorithms the model is

4712
02:19:30,799 --> 02:19:34,000
everything like the way we work is we're

4713
02:19:32,478 --> 02:19:36,079
incredibly precise about

4714
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,760
here's exactly it's mathematical here's

4715
02:19:36,079 --> 02:19:38,799
exactly how the network works and it's a

4716
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:40,159
state machine

4717
02:19:38,799 --> 02:19:41,599
algorithms are state machines there's

4718
02:19:40,159 --> 02:19:43,840
rounds and schedulers we're super

4719
02:19:41,599 --> 02:19:45,120
precise we can improve lower bounds

4720
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:47,120
but yeah often those lower those

4721
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:49,600
impossibility results really

4722
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:51,200
get at the hard edges of exactly how

4723
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:53,040
that model works so we'll we'll see if

4724
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:54,960
this goes so we we published a paper on

4725
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:56,720
this that paper you mentioned

4726
02:19:54,959 --> 02:19:58,398
um that kind of introduced the idea to

4727
02:19:56,719 --> 02:19:59,199
the distributed algorithms world and i

4728
02:19:58,398 --> 02:20:01,199
think

4729
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:02,479
that's got some traction and there's

4730
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:03,760
been some follow-ups and we've just

4731
02:20:02,478 --> 02:20:06,318
submitted our

4732
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:07,600
uh our next i mean honestly the issue

4733
02:20:06,318 --> 02:20:09,119
with the next is that like the result

4734
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:10,720
fell out so easily

4735
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:12,720
and this is just a mathematical machismo

4736
02:20:10,719 --> 02:20:14,478
problem in these in these fields is

4737
02:20:12,719 --> 02:20:15,840
there's a good chance the paper won't be

4738
02:20:14,478 --> 02:20:18,159
accepted because there wasn't

4739
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:19,359
enough mathematical self-flagellation

4740
02:20:18,159 --> 02:20:21,760
that's such a nice

4741
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:22,479
finding so even it's just showing that

4742
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:24,398
very few

4743
02:20:22,478 --> 02:20:25,840
just very little bit of noise yeah gonna

4744
02:20:24,398 --> 02:20:27,920
have a dramatic

4745
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:29,280
uh make a dramatic statement about uh it

4746
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:31,040
was a big surprise to us

4747
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:34,000
but um once we figured out how to show

4748
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:36,399
it it's not too hard

4749
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:37,280
and these are these are venues that for

4750
02:20:36,398 --> 02:20:40,159
theoretical

4751
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:41,680
yeah theoretical okay so the the

4752
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:43,119
fascinating tension there exists in

4753
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:44,639
other disciplines like one of them is

4754
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:48,000
machine learning

4755
02:20:44,639 --> 02:20:49,519
now which it despite the the power of

4756
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
machine learning and deep learning and

4757
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:53,760
all

4758
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:55,840
like the impact of it in the real world

4759
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:57,600
the main conferences on machine learning

4760
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:58,880
are still resistant to application

4761
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:02,399
papers

4762
02:20:58,879 --> 02:21:03,839
i'm not uh sort of and application paper

4763
02:21:02,398 --> 02:21:06,879
is broadly defined

4764
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:09,200
meaning like finding

4765
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:10,079
almost like you would like darwin did by

4766
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:13,359
like

4767
02:21:10,079 --> 02:21:14,959
uh going around collecting some

4768
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:16,000
information saying huh isn't this

4769
02:21:14,959 --> 02:21:17,839
interesting yeah

4770
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:19,040
uh like those are some of the most

4771
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:20,318
popular blogs

4772
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:22,399
and yet as the paper is not really

4773
02:21:20,318 --> 02:21:23,600
accepted i i wonder what you think about

4774
02:21:22,398 --> 02:21:27,039
this whole world of

4775
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:30,559
deep learning from a perspective of

4776
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:31,520
theory what do you make of this whole

4777
02:21:30,559 --> 02:21:33,359
discipline

4778
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:34,800
of the success of neural networks of how

4779
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:37,840
to do science on them

4780
02:21:34,799 --> 02:21:39,438
are you excited by the possibilities

4781
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:40,880
of what we might discover about neural

4782
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:42,639
networks do you think is fundamentally

4783
02:21:40,879 --> 02:21:43,839
an engineering discipline or is there

4784
02:21:42,639 --> 02:21:46,639
something

4785
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:48,079
theoretical that we might crack open one

4786
02:21:46,639 --> 02:21:49,599
of these days and understanding

4787
02:21:48,079 --> 02:21:50,559
something deep about how system

4788
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:54,159
optimization

4789
02:21:50,559 --> 02:21:56,639
and how systems learn i am convinced by

4790
02:21:54,159 --> 02:21:57,840
is it tiger martin mit who's tag mark

4791
02:21:56,639 --> 02:21:59,519
yeah tech mark right

4792
02:21:57,840 --> 02:22:01,840
so his notion has always been convincing

4793
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:03,359
to me uh

4794
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:05,680
that the fact that some of these models

4795
02:22:03,359 --> 02:22:06,720
are inscrutable is not fundamental to

4796
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:07,920
them

4797
02:22:06,719 --> 02:22:09,438
and that we can we're going to get

4798
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,920
better and better because in the end you

4799
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:11,840
know

4800
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:14,159
the reason why practicing computer

4801
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:15,840
scientists often who are doing ai

4802
02:22:14,159 --> 02:22:17,680
or working at ai on industry aren't like

4803
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:19,520
worried about so much

4804
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:21,120
existential threats is because they see

4805
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:22,880
the reality is they're

4806
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:24,160
multiplying matrices with numpy or

4807
02:22:22,879 --> 02:22:25,759
something like this right yeah and

4808
02:22:24,159 --> 02:22:27,359
and tweaking constants and hoping that

4809
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:29,520
the classifier fitness

4810
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:31,040
yeah for god's sakes before the the

4811
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:32,720
submission deadline actually like gets

4812
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:36,240
above something like it feels like it's

4813
02:22:32,719 --> 02:22:38,719
it's linear algebra and and tdm right

4814
02:22:36,239 --> 02:22:40,239
um but anyways i'm really convinced with

4815
02:22:38,719 --> 02:22:41,519
his idea that once we understand better

4816
02:22:40,239 --> 02:22:42,959
and better what's going on from a theory

4817
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:44,479
perspective it's going to make it into

4818
02:22:42,959 --> 02:22:45,919
an engineering discipline

4819
02:22:44,478 --> 02:22:48,799
so in my mind where we're going to end

4820
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:50,478
up is okay forget these

4821
02:22:48,799 --> 02:22:52,478
metaphors of neurons and these things

4822
02:22:50,478 --> 02:22:53,279
are going to be get put down into these

4823
02:22:52,478 --> 02:22:55,199
mathematical

4824
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:57,439
kind of elegant equations differentiable

4825
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:59,120
equations that just kind of work well

4826
02:22:57,439 --> 02:23:01,280
and then it's going to be when i need a

4827
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:02,960
little bit of ai in this thing

4828
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:05,680
uh plumbing like let's get a little bit

4829
02:23:02,959 --> 02:23:07,199
of a a pattern recognizer with a noise

4830
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:08,239
module and let's connect i mean

4831
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:10,159
you know this feel better than me so i

4832
02:23:08,239 --> 02:23:11,439
don't know if this is like a reasonable

4833
02:23:10,159 --> 02:23:12,559
a reasonable prediction but that we're

4834
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:14,079
gonna

4835
02:23:12,559 --> 02:23:16,159
it's gonna become less inscrutable and

4836
02:23:14,079 --> 02:23:18,000
then it's gonna become more engineerable

4837
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:19,039
and then we're gonna have ai and more

4838
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,760
things because we're gonna have a little

4839
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:22,640
bit more

4840
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:23,120
control over how we piece together these

4841
02:23:22,639 --> 02:23:26,159
different

4842
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:26,800
classification black boxes so one of the

4843
02:23:26,159 --> 02:23:28,398
problems

4844
02:23:26,799 --> 02:23:29,759
and there might be some interesting

4845
02:23:28,398 --> 02:23:30,879
parallels that you might provide

4846
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:32,478
intuition on is

4847
02:23:30,879 --> 02:23:34,239
you know neural networks are very large

4848
02:23:32,478 --> 02:23:37,599
and they have a lot of

4849
02:23:34,239 --> 02:23:39,119
it you know we were talking about uh

4850
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:40,720
you know dynamic networks and

4851
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:42,880
distributed uh

4852
02:23:40,719 --> 02:23:45,438
algorithms one of the problems with the

4853
02:23:42,879 --> 02:23:48,559
analysis of neural networks

4854
02:23:45,439 --> 02:23:51,120
is uh you know you have a lot of nodes

4855
02:23:48,559 --> 02:23:52,719
and you love a lot of edges to be able

4856
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:55,280
to interpret and to control different

4857
02:23:52,719 --> 02:23:57,760
things is very difficult there's uh

4858
02:23:55,280 --> 02:24:00,880
uh there's fields and trying to figure

4859
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:04,559
out like mathematically how you form

4860
02:24:00,879 --> 02:24:06,959
uh clean representations that are like

4861
02:24:04,559 --> 02:24:08,639
like one node contains all the

4862
02:24:06,959 --> 02:24:10,879
information about a particular thing and

4863
02:24:08,639 --> 02:24:11,439
no other nodes it's correlated to it so

4864
02:24:10,879 --> 02:24:13,679
like

4865
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:16,000
it has unique knowledge and like but

4866
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:17,280
that ultimately boils down to trying to

4867
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,079
simplify this thing

4868
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:21,520
yeah into that goes against its very

4869
02:24:20,079 --> 02:24:24,959
nature which is like

4870
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:28,000
deeply connected and uh like

4871
02:24:24,959 --> 02:24:29,919
dynamic and just you know hundreds of

4872
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:32,799
millions billions of nodes

4873
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:34,478
yeah and in a distributed sense like

4874
02:24:32,799 --> 02:24:36,159
when you zoom out the thing has a

4875
02:24:34,478 --> 02:24:36,799
representation and understanding of

4876
02:24:36,159 --> 02:24:38,398
something

4877
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:40,398
but the individual nodes are just doing

4878
02:24:38,398 --> 02:24:42,159
their little exchanging thing

4879
02:24:40,398 --> 02:24:43,599
and it's the same thing with stephen

4880
02:24:42,159 --> 02:24:44,318
wolfram when you talk about cellular

4881
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:46,479
automata

4882
02:24:44,318 --> 02:24:48,318
it's very difficult to do math when you

4883
02:24:46,478 --> 02:24:50,239
have a huge collection of distributed

4884
02:24:48,318 --> 02:24:53,680
things each acting on their own

4885
02:24:50,239 --> 02:24:55,119
and it's almost like it's it feels like

4886
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:56,800
it's almost impossible to do

4887
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:58,960
any kind of theoretical work in the

4888
02:24:56,799 --> 02:25:00,639
traditional sense it almost becomes

4889
02:24:58,959 --> 02:25:03,039
completely

4890
02:25:00,639 --> 02:25:04,719
like uh like a biology you become a

4891
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:06,800
biologist as opposed to

4892
02:25:04,719 --> 02:25:09,119
yeah a theoretician you just study it

4893
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:10,559
experimentally yeah i i think that's the

4894
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:13,680
big question i guess right

4895
02:25:10,559 --> 02:25:15,760
yeah is so so is the large

4896
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:17,680
size and inner connectiveness of the

4897
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:19,359
like a deep learning network

4898
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:20,880
fundamental to that task or are we just

4899
02:25:19,359 --> 02:25:23,439
not very good at it yet because we're

4900
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:24,879
we're using the wrong metaphor i mean

4901
02:25:23,439 --> 02:25:27,520
the human brain

4902
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:28,159
learns with much fewer examples and and

4903
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:30,000
with

4904
02:25:28,159 --> 02:25:31,359
much less tuning of the whatever

4905
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,959
whatever whatever probably that

4906
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:34,720
requires to get those like deep mind

4907
02:25:32,959 --> 02:25:36,478
networks up and running but

4908
02:25:34,719 --> 02:25:38,079
yeah so i don't really know but the one

4909
02:25:36,478 --> 02:25:41,279
thing i have observed is that the

4910
02:25:38,079 --> 02:25:43,600
yeah there's a the mundane nature of

4911
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:46,640
some of the working with these models

4912
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:49,680
tends to lead people to think that

4913
02:25:46,639 --> 02:25:51,519
to do it like it could be skynet or it

4914
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:53,760
could be like a lot of pain to get

4915
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:55,120
you know the thermostat to do what we

4916
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:55,520
wanted to do and there's a lot of open

4917
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:58,079
questions

4918
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:58,960
yeah in between there and then of course

4919
02:25:58,079 --> 02:26:00,959
the

4920
02:25:58,959 --> 02:26:02,959
at the distributors the distributed

4921
02:26:00,959 --> 02:26:05,039
network

4922
02:26:02,959 --> 02:26:06,398
of humans they use these systems so like

4923
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:08,080
you can have

4924
02:26:06,398 --> 02:26:09,680
the system itself then the neural

4925
02:26:08,079 --> 02:26:10,879
network but you can also have like

4926
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:12,159
little algorithms controlling the

4927
02:26:10,879 --> 02:26:14,000
behavior of humans which is what you

4928
02:26:12,159 --> 02:26:16,478
have with social networks

4929
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:19,439
it's possible that a very what is a

4930
02:26:16,478 --> 02:26:21,039
toaster whatever the opposite of skynet

4931
02:26:19,439 --> 02:26:22,720
when taking a scale was used by

4932
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:24,800
individual humans and controlling their

4933
02:26:22,719 --> 02:26:27,760
behavior can actually have the skynet

4934
02:26:24,799 --> 02:26:28,959
effect yeah so this the scale there we

4935
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:30,398
might have that now

4936
02:26:28,959 --> 02:26:32,239
we might have that now we just don't

4937
02:26:30,398 --> 02:26:33,680
know yeah like what has this happened is

4938
02:26:32,239 --> 02:26:34,239
twitter creating a little mini skynet i

4939
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:36,559
mean

4940
02:26:34,239 --> 02:26:38,879
because what happens it twirls out

4941
02:26:36,559 --> 02:26:40,318
ramifications in the world and

4942
02:26:38,879 --> 02:26:42,639
is it really that much different if it's

4943
02:26:40,318 --> 02:26:45,119
a robot with tentacles

4944
02:26:42,639 --> 02:26:47,439
or a bunch of servers that yeah and the

4945
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:49,600
destructive effects could be

4946
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:50,960
i mean it could be political but it

4947
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:52,159
could also be like you know

4948
02:26:50,959 --> 02:26:54,478
you could probably make an interesting

4949
02:26:52,159 --> 02:26:58,159
case that the virus

4950
02:26:54,478 --> 02:27:01,519
the the coronavirus spread on twitter

4951
02:26:58,159 --> 02:27:03,840
too in the minds of people like the

4952
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:04,880
fear and the misinformation in some very

4953
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:07,439
interesting ways

4954
02:27:04,879 --> 02:27:09,119
yeah mixed up and maybe this pandemic

4955
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:11,359
wasn't sufficiently dangerous to where

4956
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:14,000
that could have created a weird like

4957
02:27:11,359 --> 02:27:16,239
on instability but maybe other things

4958
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:18,239
might create instability like somebody

4959
02:27:16,239 --> 02:27:20,639
god forbid detonates a nuclear weapon

4960
02:27:18,239 --> 02:27:21,760
somewhere and then maybe the destructive

4961
02:27:20,639 --> 02:27:23,760
aspect of that

4962
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:24,800
would not as much be the military

4963
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:27,120
actions

4964
02:27:24,799 --> 02:27:29,199
but the way those news are spread on

4965
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:31,200
twitter yeah and the panic that creates

4966
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:32,240
yeah yeah i mean i think that's a great

4967
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:34,479
case study right

4968
02:27:32,239 --> 02:27:35,359
like what what happened not but i'm not

4969
02:27:34,478 --> 02:27:36,879
suggesting that

4970
02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:39,200
lexico let off a nuclear bomb i meant

4971
02:27:36,879 --> 02:27:40,478
the coronavirus but okay

4972
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:42,880
but but yeah i think that's a really

4973
02:27:40,478 --> 02:27:44,719
interesting case study um

4974
02:27:42,879 --> 02:27:45,920
i'm interested in the counterfactual of

4975
02:27:44,719 --> 02:27:48,639
1995.

4976
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:50,318
like do the same virus in 1995. so first

4977
02:27:48,639 --> 02:27:53,519
of all it would have been

4978
02:27:50,318 --> 02:27:54,799
i get to hear whatever the nightly news

4979
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:56,880
we'll talk about it and then they'll be

4980
02:27:54,799 --> 02:27:58,719
my local health

4981
02:27:56,879 --> 02:28:00,159
board we'll talk about it that meant

4982
02:27:58,719 --> 02:28:01,599
mitigation decisions would probably

4983
02:28:00,159 --> 02:28:04,559
necessarily be

4984
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:05,439
very sort of localized like our

4985
02:28:04,559 --> 02:28:06,398
communities trying to figure out what

4986
02:28:05,439 --> 02:28:07,920
are we going to do what's going to

4987
02:28:06,398 --> 02:28:08,318
happen like we see this with schools

4988
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:10,478
like

4989
02:28:08,318 --> 02:28:11,600
where i grew up in new jersey uh there's

4990
02:28:10,478 --> 02:28:14,478
very localized

4991
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:14,880
school districts so even though they had

4992
02:28:14,478 --> 02:28:16,559
sort of

4993
02:28:14,879 --> 02:28:17,920
really bad viral numbers there my school

4994
02:28:16,559 --> 02:28:19,039
i grew up and has been open since the

4995
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:20,960
fall because it's

4996
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:22,240
very localized it's like these teachers

4997
02:28:20,959 --> 02:28:23,519
and these parents what do we want to do

4998
02:28:22,239 --> 02:28:25,439
what are we comfortable with

4999
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:26,960
i live in a school district right now in

5000
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:29,200
montgomery county that's a billion

5001
02:28:26,959 --> 02:28:30,799
dollar a year budget 150 000 kid

5002
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:32,479
school district it just can't it's

5003
02:28:30,799 --> 02:28:33,840
closed you know because it's too

5004
02:28:32,478 --> 02:28:35,438
so i'm interested in that counterfactual

5005
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:36,318
yes you have all this information moving

5006
02:28:35,439 --> 02:28:38,559
around

5007
02:28:36,318 --> 02:28:39,920
and then you have the the the effects on

5008
02:28:38,559 --> 02:28:40,879
discourse as we were talking about

5009
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:43,040
earlier that

5010
02:28:40,879 --> 02:28:44,639
the the neil postman style effects of

5011
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:46,080
twitter which shifts people into a sort

5012
02:28:44,639 --> 02:28:48,799
of a dunk culture mindset

5013
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:49,680
of uh don't give an inch to the other

5014
02:28:48,799 --> 02:28:50,879
team

5015
02:28:49,680 --> 02:28:52,639
and we're used to this and was fired up

5016
02:28:50,879 --> 02:28:53,358
by politics and the unique attributes of

5017
02:28:52,639 --> 02:28:54,719
twitter

5018
02:28:53,359 --> 02:28:57,760
now throw in the coronavirus and

5019
02:28:54,719 --> 02:28:59,199
suddenly we see decades of public health

5020
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:01,439
knowledge a lot of which was honed

5021
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:02,159
during the hiv epidemic was thrown out

5022
02:29:01,439 --> 02:29:03,439
the window

5023
02:29:02,159 --> 02:29:05,359
because a lot of this was happening on

5024
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:07,120
twitter and suddenly we had public

5025
02:29:05,359 --> 02:29:08,800
health officials using a don't give an

5026
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:09,680
inch to the other team mindset of like

5027
02:29:08,799 --> 02:29:11,759
well if we say

5028
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:13,520
this that might validate something that

5029
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:15,280
was wrong over here and we need to if we

5030
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:16,319
say this and maybe like that'll stop

5031
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:18,640
them from doing this

5032
02:29:16,318 --> 02:29:19,680
that's like very twittery yeah in a way

5033
02:29:18,639 --> 02:29:22,079
that in 1995

5034
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:23,359
is probably not the way public health

5035
02:29:22,079 --> 02:29:24,559
officials would be thinking right now

5036
02:29:23,359 --> 02:29:26,479
it's like well

5037
02:29:24,559 --> 02:29:28,079
this is if we said this about mass but

5038
02:29:26,478 --> 02:29:29,119
the other team said that about mass we

5039
02:29:28,079 --> 02:29:30,478
can't give an inch

5040
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:31,680
so we got to be careful and like we

5041
02:29:30,478 --> 02:29:33,358
can't tell people it's okay after

5042
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:34,880
they're vaccinated because that might

5043
02:29:33,359 --> 02:29:36,640
we're giving them an inch on this and

5044
02:29:34,879 --> 02:29:38,318
that's very twittery in my mind right

5045
02:29:36,639 --> 02:29:40,239
that is the the impact of

5046
02:29:38,318 --> 02:29:41,600
twitter on the way we think about this

5047
02:29:40,239 --> 02:29:42,959
course which is a dunking culture of

5048
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:44,318
don't give any inch to the other team

5049
02:29:42,959 --> 02:29:45,358
and it's all about slam dunks where

5050
02:29:44,318 --> 02:29:46,239
you're completely right and they're

5051
02:29:45,359 --> 02:29:47,920
completely wrong

5052
02:29:46,239 --> 02:29:49,520
it's as a rhetorical strategy is

5053
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:51,439
incredibly simplistic but it's also the

5054
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:54,239
way that we think right now about

5055
02:29:51,439 --> 02:29:55,040
how we do debate it combined terribly

5056
02:29:54,239 --> 02:29:57,359
with uh

5057
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:59,040
election year pandemic yeah election

5058
02:29:57,359 --> 02:30:00,960
year pandemic i wonder if we can do some

5059
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:01,760
smooth analysis let's run the simulation

5060
02:30:00,959 --> 02:30:04,719
over a few times

5061
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:06,159
a little bit noise yeah see if it can uh

5062
02:30:04,719 --> 02:30:07,119
dramatically change the behavior of the

5063
02:30:06,159 --> 02:30:09,600
system

5064
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:11,680
okay we talked about your love for

5065
02:30:09,600 --> 02:30:13,760
proving that something is impossible

5066
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:15,840
so there's quite a few still open

5067
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:18,800
problems and complexity

5068
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:19,280
of algorithms uh so let me ask does p

5069
02:30:18,799 --> 02:30:23,279
equal

5070
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:27,200
np probably not probably not

5071
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:29,600
if p equals np

5072
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:31,439
what kind of you know and you'd be

5073
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:34,000
really surprised somebody proves it

5074
02:30:31,439 --> 02:30:35,520
yeah what would that proof look like and

5075
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,318
why would that even be what would that

5076
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:38,560
mean

5077
02:30:36,318 --> 02:30:39,920
what would that proof look like in what

5078
02:30:38,559 --> 02:30:41,760
possible universe could p

5079
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:43,359
equals np is there something insightful

5080
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:46,079
you can say there

5081
02:30:43,359 --> 02:30:47,520
it could it could be true and i mean i'm

5082
02:30:46,079 --> 02:30:49,359
not a complexity theorist but every

5083
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:51,760
complexity theorist i know

5084
02:30:49,359 --> 02:30:53,120
is convinced they're not equal and are

5085
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:54,478
basically not working on anymore i mean

5086
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:55,840
there is a million dollars at stake if

5087
02:30:54,478 --> 02:30:57,679
you can if you can solve the proof it's

5088
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:59,760
one of the millennium prizes

5089
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:01,040
okay so here here's how i think the p

5090
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:01,840
not equals mp proof is going to

5091
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:04,399
eventually

5092
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:05,520
happen i think it's going to fall out

5093
02:31:04,398 --> 02:31:08,000
and it's going to be

5094
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:08,640
not super simple but not as hard as

5095
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:11,120
people think

5096
02:31:08,639 --> 02:31:12,478
because my my theory about a lot of

5097
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:12,960
theoretical computer science based on

5098
02:31:12,478 --> 02:31:14,559
just

5099
02:31:12,959 --> 02:31:16,239
some results i've done so this is a huge

5100
02:31:14,559 --> 02:31:17,359
extrapolation is that

5101
02:31:16,239 --> 02:31:20,639
a lot of what we're doing is just

5102
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:22,318
obfuscating deeper mathematics

5103
02:31:20,639 --> 02:31:23,599
so like this happens to me a lot not a

5104
02:31:22,318 --> 02:31:24,559
lot but it's happened to me a few times

5105
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:26,239
in my work where

5106
02:31:24,559 --> 02:31:28,159
yeah we obfuscate it because we say well

5107
02:31:26,239 --> 02:31:29,840
there's an algorithm and has this much

5108
02:31:28,159 --> 02:31:31,680
you know memory and they're connected on

5109
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:33,120
a network and okay here's our setup and

5110
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:34,398
now we're trying to see how fast it can

5111
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:36,160
solve a problem

5112
02:31:34,398 --> 02:31:37,519
and people do bounds about and in the

5113
02:31:36,159 --> 02:31:39,680
end it turns out that like we were just

5114
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:42,000
obfuscating some underlying

5115
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:43,120
you know mathematical thing that already

5116
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,959
existed

5117
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:46,319
right so this has happened to me i i had

5118
02:31:44,959 --> 02:31:48,719
this paper i was quite fond of

5119
02:31:46,318 --> 02:31:50,478
a while ago it was looking at this

5120
02:31:48,719 --> 02:31:52,639
problem called contention resolution

5121
02:31:50,478 --> 02:31:54,318
where you you you put an unknown set of

5122
02:31:52,639 --> 02:31:56,398
people on a shared channel

5123
02:31:54,318 --> 02:31:57,920
and they're trying to break symmetry so

5124
02:31:56,398 --> 02:31:59,039
it's like an ethernet whatever only one

5125
02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:00,398
person can use it at a time you try to

5126
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:02,160
break symmetry there's all these bounds

5127
02:32:00,398 --> 02:32:04,959
people have proven over the years

5128
02:32:02,159 --> 02:32:05,520
about how long it takes to do this right

5129
02:32:04,959 --> 02:32:07,519
and

5130
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:08,560
like i discovered at some point there's

5131
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:11,359
this one

5132
02:32:08,559 --> 02:32:12,559
combinatorial result from the early

5133
02:32:11,359 --> 02:32:14,318
1990s

5134
02:32:12,559 --> 02:32:16,478
all of these lower bound proofs all come

5135
02:32:14,318 --> 02:32:17,680
from this in fact it improved a lot of

5136
02:32:16,478 --> 02:32:19,039
them and simplified a lot you could put

5137
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:20,398
it all in one paper

5138
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:22,240
you know it's like are we really and

5139
02:32:20,398 --> 02:32:24,000
then okay so this new paper that i i

5140
02:32:22,239 --> 02:32:25,119
submitted a couple weeks ago

5141
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,478
i found you could take some of these

5142
02:32:25,120 --> 02:32:27,920
same lower bound proofs for this

5143
02:32:26,478 --> 02:32:30,799
contention resolution problem

5144
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:32,079
you could reprove them using shannon's

5145
02:32:30,799 --> 02:32:33,438
source code theorem

5146
02:32:32,079 --> 02:32:35,359
that actually when you're breaking

5147
02:32:33,439 --> 02:32:38,398
contention what you're really doing is

5148
02:32:35,359 --> 02:32:39,600
building a code over uh you know if you

5149
02:32:38,398 --> 02:32:41,119
have a distribution on the

5150
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:43,520
network sizes it's a code over that

5151
02:32:41,120 --> 02:32:46,399
source and if you plug in a high entropy

5152
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:47,840
information source and plug in from 1948

5153
02:32:46,398 --> 02:32:49,840
the source code theorem that says on a

5154
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:52,239
noiseless channel you can't send things

5155
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:53,680
at a faster rate than the entropy allows

5156
02:32:52,239 --> 02:32:54,959
the exact same lower bounds fall back

5157
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:56,318
out again right so like this type of

5158
02:32:54,959 --> 02:32:57,599
thing happens there's a there's some

5159
02:32:56,318 --> 02:32:59,039
famous lower bounds and

5160
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:01,439
distributed algorithms that turned out

5161
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:03,600
to all be algebraic topology

5162
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:05,359
underneath the covers and they won the

5163
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:07,280
girdle prize for working on that

5164
02:33:05,359 --> 02:33:09,840
so my sense is what's going to happen is

5165
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:11,840
at some point someone really smart

5166
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:13,439
to be very exciting is going to realize

5167
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:15,359
there's some sort of

5168
02:33:13,439 --> 02:33:17,280
other representation of what's going on

5169
02:33:15,359 --> 02:33:19,520
with these turing machines trying to

5170
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:20,800
sort of efficiently fall and there will

5171
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:24,079
be an existing

5172
02:33:20,799 --> 02:33:25,199
mathematical result that applies someone

5173
02:33:24,079 --> 02:33:27,520
or something i guess

5174
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:29,200
it could be ai theorem proverbs kind of

5175
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:31,600
thing it could be yeah i mean not a

5176
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:33,520
well yeah i mean there's theorem provers

5177
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:36,880
like what that means now

5178
02:33:33,520 --> 02:33:38,880
which is not fun it's just a bunch of

5179
02:33:36,879 --> 02:33:39,920
very carefully formulated postulates

5180
02:33:38,879 --> 02:33:43,358
that but

5181
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:45,760
i take your point yeah yeah so okay

5182
02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:46,880
uh you know on a small tangent on then

5183
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:49,040
then

5184
02:33:46,879 --> 02:33:50,639
you're kind of implying that mathematics

5185
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:52,960
it almost feels like a kind of

5186
02:33:50,639 --> 02:33:55,119
weird evolutionary tree that ultimately

5187
02:33:52,959 --> 02:33:57,279
leads back to some kind of ancestral

5188
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:58,640
a few fundamental ideas that all are

5189
02:33:57,280 --> 02:34:01,840
just like

5190
02:33:58,639 --> 02:34:03,599
they're all somehow connected in that

5191
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:06,799
sense do you think

5192
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:07,680
uh math is fundamental to our universe

5193
02:34:06,799 --> 02:34:11,039
and we're just like

5194
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:13,200
slowly trying to understand

5195
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:15,120
these patterns or is is it is it

5196
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:18,079
discovered

5197
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:18,800
or is it just a little game that we play

5198
02:34:18,079 --> 02:34:21,840
yeah

5199
02:34:18,799 --> 02:34:23,599
amongst ourselves to try to fit little

5200
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:24,880
patterns to the world

5201
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:26,640
yeah that's the question right that's

5202
02:34:24,879 --> 02:34:27,599
the physicist's question

5203
02:34:26,639 --> 02:34:29,680
i mean i'm probably i'm in the

5204
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:31,439
discovered camp but i don't do

5205
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:34,318
theoretical physics so i know

5206
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:35,439
they have a they feel like they have a

5207
02:34:34,318 --> 02:34:37,600
stronger claim to

5208
02:34:35,439 --> 02:34:39,200
answering that question but you don't

5209
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:40,559
come back to it everything comes back to

5210
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:45,520
it i mean all of physics

5211
02:34:40,559 --> 02:34:47,760
the fact that the universe is well okay

5212
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:49,280
it's a complicated question so how how

5213
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:53,040
often do you think

5214
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:56,880
how deeply does this result describe the

5215
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:59,520
fundamental reality of nature

5216
02:34:56,879 --> 02:35:00,879
so the the the reason i hesitated

5217
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:02,239
because it's something i'm

5218
02:35:00,879 --> 02:35:04,000
i taught the seminar and did a little

5219
02:35:02,239 --> 02:35:04,959
work on what are called biological

5220
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:09,040
algorithms

5221
02:35:04,959 --> 02:35:09,039
so there's this notion of

5222
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:14,960
so physicists used mathematics

5223
02:35:12,398 --> 02:35:16,879
to explain the universe right and it was

5224
02:35:14,959 --> 02:35:17,759
unreasonable that mathematics works so

5225
02:35:16,879 --> 02:35:18,719
well

5226
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:20,880
you know all these differential

5227
02:35:18,719 --> 02:35:22,398
equations why does that explain

5228
02:35:20,879 --> 02:35:23,679
all we need to know about thermodynamics

5229
02:35:22,398 --> 02:35:24,639
and gravity and all the all these type

5230
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:26,398
of things well there's this kind

5231
02:35:24,639 --> 02:35:27,519
there's this movement within the

5232
02:35:26,398 --> 02:35:28,639
intersection of computer science and

5233
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:30,239
biology

5234
02:35:28,639 --> 02:35:32,879
it's just kind of wolf ramyun i guess

5235
02:35:30,239 --> 02:35:34,799
really that uh

5236
02:35:32,879 --> 02:35:35,759
algorithms can be very explanatory right

5237
02:35:34,799 --> 02:35:37,559
like if you're trying to if you're

5238
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:40,318
trying to explain

5239
02:35:37,559 --> 02:35:41,840
parsimoniously something about like an

5240
02:35:40,318 --> 02:35:42,959
ant colony or something like this you're

5241
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:44,159
not going to

5242
02:35:42,959 --> 02:35:46,239
ultimately it's not going to be

5243
02:35:44,159 --> 02:35:47,359
explained as an equation like a physics

5244
02:35:46,239 --> 02:35:50,159
equation it's going to be explained by

5245
02:35:47,359 --> 02:35:52,640
an algorithm so like this algorithm

5246
02:35:50,159 --> 02:35:54,239
run distributedly is going to explain

5247
02:35:52,639 --> 02:35:55,519
the behavior so

5248
02:35:54,239 --> 02:35:56,799
that's mathematical but not quite

5249
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:58,000
mathematical but it is if you think

5250
02:35:56,799 --> 02:35:59,759
about an algorithm like a lambda

5251
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,280
calculus which brings you back to the

5252
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:04,478
the world of mathematics so i'm thinking

5253
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:04,479
out loud here but basically

5254
02:36:04,719 --> 02:36:08,959
abstract math is sort of like

5255
02:36:06,959 --> 02:36:10,478
unreasonably effective

5256
02:36:08,959 --> 02:36:12,079
at explaining a lot of things and that's

5257
02:36:10,478 --> 02:36:12,719
just what i feel like i glimpse i'm not

5258
02:36:12,079 --> 02:36:14,239
a

5259
02:36:12,719 --> 02:36:15,920
um not like a super well-known

5260
02:36:14,239 --> 02:36:16,799
theoretician i don't have really famous

5261
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:19,920
results

5262
02:36:16,799 --> 02:36:22,478
so even as a sort of middling

5263
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:23,920
you know career theoretician i keep

5264
02:36:22,478 --> 02:36:26,000
encountering this

5265
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:28,559
where we think we're solving some

5266
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:30,478
problem about computers and algorithms

5267
02:36:28,559 --> 02:36:33,039
and it's some much deeper underlying

5268
02:36:30,478 --> 02:36:34,478
math it's shannon but shannon is entropy

5269
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:37,600
but entropy was really

5270
02:36:34,478 --> 02:36:39,119
you know goes all the way back to

5271
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:41,280
whatever it was boiler all the way back

5272
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:43,760
to looking at the early physics and

5273
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:44,800
and it's anyways to me i think it's

5274
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:46,800
amazing

5275
02:36:44,799 --> 02:36:48,318
yeah i mean it but it could be the flip

5276
02:36:46,799 --> 02:36:50,398
side of that could be just our brains

5277
02:36:48,318 --> 02:36:53,199
draw so much pleasure from the

5278
02:36:50,398 --> 02:36:54,879
uh deriving generalized theories and

5279
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:57,040
simplifying the universe

5280
02:36:54,879 --> 02:36:58,559
that we just naturally see that kind of

5281
02:36:57,040 --> 02:37:00,479
simplicity and everything

5282
02:36:58,559 --> 02:37:02,719
yeah so that's the whole you know newton

5283
02:37:00,478 --> 02:37:04,159
de einstein right so you can you can say

5284
02:37:02,719 --> 02:37:05,760
this must be right because it's so

5285
02:37:04,159 --> 02:37:07,200
predictive well it's not quite

5286
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:08,478
predictive because mercury wobbles a

5287
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:09,760
little bit but i think we have it set

5288
02:37:08,478 --> 02:37:12,079
and then you turn out

5289
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:14,239
now einstein and then and then you get

5290
02:37:12,079 --> 02:37:15,920
boar like no not einstein it's actually

5291
02:37:14,239 --> 02:37:18,000
statistical and yeah so

5292
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:20,159
it's it's hard to also know like where a

5293
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:22,079
smooth analysis fits into all that

5294
02:37:20,159 --> 02:37:24,159
or a little bit of noi like you can say

5295
02:37:22,079 --> 02:37:26,398
something very clean

5296
02:37:24,159 --> 02:37:27,200
about a system and then a little bit of

5297
02:37:26,398 --> 02:37:28,959
noise

5298
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:30,560
like the average case is actually very

5299
02:37:28,959 --> 02:37:31,679
different and so

5300
02:37:30,559 --> 02:37:34,239
yeah i mean that's where like the

5301
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:35,680
quantum mechanics comes in it's like ugh

5302
02:37:34,239 --> 02:37:37,119
why does that have to be randomness in

5303
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:37,680
this yeah it would have through this

5304
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:41,040
complex

5305
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:43,439
statistics yeah yeah

5306
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:45,600
so to be determined yeah that'll be my

5307
02:37:43,439 --> 02:37:46,880
next book that'd be ambitious the

5308
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:49,840
fundamental

5309
02:37:46,879 --> 02:37:51,039
the fundamental core of reality comma

5310
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:53,520
and some advice for being more

5311
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:56,000
productive at work

5312
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:57,439
can i ask you just if it's possible to

5313
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:00,719
do an overview and just

5314
02:37:57,439 --> 02:38:02,800
some brief comments of wisdom on the

5315
02:38:00,719 --> 02:38:04,318
process of publishing a book

5316
02:38:02,799 --> 02:38:05,759
what's that process entail what are the

5317
02:38:04,318 --> 02:38:08,559
different options and what's your

5318
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:08,559
recommendation

5319
02:38:08,639 --> 02:38:12,239
for somebody that wants to write a book

5320
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:14,800
like yours

5321
02:38:12,239 --> 02:38:17,760
a nonfiction book that discovers

5322
02:38:14,799 --> 02:38:21,438
something interesting about this world

5323
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:25,439
so what i i usually advise is

5324
02:38:21,439 --> 02:38:27,840
follow the follow the process as is

5325
02:38:25,439 --> 02:38:30,239
don't try to reinvent i think that that

5326
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:31,600
happens a lot where

5327
02:38:30,239 --> 02:38:33,280
you'll try to reinvent the way the

5328
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:35,680
publishing industry should work like

5329
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:37,200
this kind of not like in a business

5330
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:38,000
model ways but just like this is what i

5331
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:39,520
want to do

5332
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,879
i want to write a thousand words a day

5333
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:42,720
and i want to do this and i'm going to

5334
02:38:40,879 --> 02:38:44,559
put on the internet and

5335
02:38:42,719 --> 02:38:46,159
the publishing industry is very specific

5336
02:38:44,559 --> 02:38:47,519
about how it works

5337
02:38:46,159 --> 02:38:49,039
and so like when i got started writing

5338
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:49,760
books was at a very young age so you

5339
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:52,240
know i

5340
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:53,520
sold my first book at the age of 21. the

5341
02:38:52,239 --> 02:38:56,639
way i did that

5342
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:59,280
is i found the family friend that was an

5343
02:38:56,639 --> 02:39:00,398
agent and i said i'm not trying to make

5344
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:02,239
you be my agent

5345
02:39:00,398 --> 02:39:03,519
just explain to me how this works not

5346
02:39:02,239 --> 02:39:05,520
just how the world works but

5347
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:06,560
give me the hard truth about how would a

5348
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:08,079
21 year old

5349
02:39:06,559 --> 02:39:09,199
under what conditions could a 21 year

5350
02:39:08,079 --> 02:39:10,398
old sell a book what would that look

5351
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:11,760
like and she just explained it to me

5352
02:39:10,398 --> 02:39:13,199
well you have to do this and have to be

5353
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:13,840
a subject that it made sense for you to

5354
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:14,960
write

5355
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:16,639
and you would have to do this type of

5356
02:39:14,959 --> 02:39:17,759
writing for the publications to validate

5357
02:39:16,639 --> 02:39:18,719
it and blah blah blah and you have to

5358
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:20,639
get the agent first

5359
02:39:18,719 --> 02:39:22,079
and i learned the whole game plan and

5360
02:39:20,639 --> 02:39:23,920
then i executed

5361
02:39:22,079 --> 02:39:26,239
and and so the rough game plan is with

5362
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:27,680
nonfiction you get the agent first

5363
02:39:26,239 --> 02:39:29,520
and the agent's going to sell it to the

5364
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:31,040
publishers so like you're never sending

5365
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:32,399
something directly to the publishers and

5366
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:33,520
non-fiction you're not writing the book

5367
02:39:32,398 --> 02:39:35,039
first

5368
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:37,280
right the you're going to get an advance

5369
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:39,439
from the publisher once sold

5370
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:41,120
and then you're going to do the primary

5371
02:39:39,439 --> 02:39:42,800
writing of the book in fact it will

5372
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:43,840
in most circumstances hurt you if you've

5373
02:39:42,799 --> 02:39:44,639
already written if you've already

5374
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:46,159
written it yeah

5375
02:39:44,639 --> 02:39:47,840
so you're you're trying to sell well i

5376
02:39:46,159 --> 02:39:49,280
guess the agent first you sell to the

5377
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:50,000
agent and the agent sells it to the

5378
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:51,680
publishers

5379
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:53,280
it's much easier to get an agent than a

5380
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:54,880
book deal so the thought is

5381
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:56,880
if you can't get an agent then why would

5382
02:39:54,879 --> 02:39:58,478
you so you start with and also

5383
02:39:56,879 --> 02:40:00,239
and the way this works with a good agent

5384
02:39:58,478 --> 02:40:01,358
is they know all the editors

5385
02:40:00,239 --> 02:40:02,239
and they have lunch with the editors and

5386
02:40:01,359 --> 02:40:03,359
they're always just looking what

5387
02:40:02,239 --> 02:40:04,559
projects you have coming what are you

5388
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:05,920
looking for here's one of my authors

5389
02:40:04,559 --> 02:40:07,199
that's the way all these deals happen

5390
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:08,239
it's not you're not emailing a

5391
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:10,960
manuscript to a

5392
02:40:08,239 --> 02:40:12,398
slush pile yeah and so so first of all

5393
02:40:10,959 --> 02:40:14,079
the agent takes a percentage and then

5394
02:40:12,398 --> 02:40:14,879
the publishers this is where the process

5395
02:40:14,079 --> 02:40:16,639
comes in they

5396
02:40:14,879 --> 02:40:18,639
they take also a cut that's probably

5397
02:40:16,639 --> 02:40:21,519
ridiculous so if you try to

5398
02:40:18,639 --> 02:40:22,799
reinvent the system you'll probably be

5399
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:24,560
frustrated by the percentage that

5400
02:40:22,799 --> 02:40:26,079
everyone takes relative to how much

5401
02:40:24,559 --> 02:40:27,680
bureaucracy and efficiency

5402
02:40:26,079 --> 02:40:29,840
yeah ridiculousness there is in the

5403
02:40:27,680 --> 02:40:32,880
system your recommendation is like

5404
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:35,359
you're just one ant stop trying to uh

5405
02:40:32,879 --> 02:40:36,879
build your own ant colony well or or or

5406
02:40:35,359 --> 02:40:37,520
if you create your own process for how

5407
02:40:36,879 --> 02:40:39,039
it should work

5408
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:40,399
it's not gonna the book's not gonna get

5409
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:41,840
published so so there's a separate

5410
02:40:40,398 --> 02:40:43,519
question the economic question of like

5411
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:44,880
should i create my own

5412
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:46,560
like self-publish it or do something

5413
02:40:44,879 --> 02:40:47,839
like that but yeah but putting that

5414
02:40:46,559 --> 02:40:48,719
aside there's a lot of people i

5415
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:50,159
encounter

5416
02:40:48,719 --> 02:40:52,000
that want to publish a book with a main

5417
02:40:50,159 --> 02:40:53,279
publisher but they invent their own

5418
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:55,200
rules for how that works

5419
02:40:53,279 --> 02:40:58,560
right so so then the alternative though

5420
02:40:55,200 --> 02:41:00,880
is self-publishing and the the downside

5421
02:40:58,559 --> 02:41:02,719
there's a lot of downsides it's like

5422
02:41:00,879 --> 02:41:04,478
it's almost like publishing an opinion

5423
02:41:02,719 --> 02:41:06,159
piece in the new york times versus

5424
02:41:04,478 --> 02:41:07,039
writing your own blog there's no reason

5425
02:41:06,159 --> 02:41:10,000
why

5426
02:41:07,040 --> 02:41:11,600
writing a blog post on medium can get

5427
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:15,359
way more attention

5428
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:16,880
and legitimacy and long lasting prestige

5429
02:41:15,359 --> 02:41:18,800
than a new york times article but

5430
02:41:16,879 --> 02:41:21,119
nevertheless for most people

5431
02:41:18,799 --> 02:41:22,719
writing in a prestigious newspaper

5432
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:26,479
quote-unquote prestigious

5433
02:41:22,719 --> 02:41:29,438
uh is is just easier

5434
02:41:26,478 --> 02:41:31,278
and well and depends on your goal so you

5435
02:41:29,439 --> 02:41:33,040
know like i push you towards

5436
02:41:31,279 --> 02:41:34,960
a big publisher because i think your

5437
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:35,600
goal is it's huge ideas you want to

5438
02:41:34,959 --> 02:41:37,599
impact

5439
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:38,880
right you can have more impact you know

5440
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:40,640
but even though

5441
02:41:38,879 --> 02:41:42,639
like actually so there's different ways

5442
02:41:40,639 --> 02:41:45,519
to measure impact the world of ideas

5443
02:41:42,639 --> 02:41:47,358
in the world of ideas and also yeah in

5444
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:49,680
the world of ideas it's kind of like the

5445
02:41:47,359 --> 02:41:51,120
clubhouse thing now even if the audience

5446
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:52,720
is not large

5447
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:54,640
that people in the audience are very

5448
02:41:52,719 --> 02:41:56,879
interesting as

5449
02:41:54,639 --> 02:41:58,719
it's like the conversation feels like it

5450
02:41:56,879 --> 02:42:01,920
has long lasting

5451
02:41:58,719 --> 02:42:03,599
impact yeah among among the people who

5452
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:05,760
in different and disparate industries

5453
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:07,120
that are also then starting their own

5454
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:08,880
conversations and all that kind of stuff

5455
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:11,200
because you have other

5456
02:42:08,879 --> 02:42:12,079
so like so like self-publishing the book

5457
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:13,760
um

5458
02:42:12,079 --> 02:42:15,200
the goals that would solve you have much

5459
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:16,559
better ways of getting to those goals

5460
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:18,240
might be part of it right so if there's

5461
02:42:16,559 --> 02:42:19,439
the financial aspect of well you get to

5462
02:42:18,239 --> 02:42:21,279
keep more of it

5463
02:42:19,439 --> 02:42:22,960
i mean the podcast is probably going to

5464
02:42:21,279 --> 02:42:24,079
crush right what the book's going to do

5465
02:42:22,959 --> 02:42:27,199
anyways right yeah

5466
02:42:24,079 --> 02:42:29,279
if it's i want to get directly to

5467
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:30,479
certain audiences or crowds it might be

5468
02:42:29,279 --> 02:42:31,600
harder through a traditional publisher

5469
02:42:30,478 --> 02:42:32,398
there's better ways to talk to those

5470
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:33,680
crowds

5471
02:42:32,398 --> 02:42:35,358
it could be on club house with all these

5472
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:36,800
new technologies a self-published book's

5473
02:42:35,359 --> 02:42:37,600
not going to be the most effective way

5474
02:42:36,799 --> 02:42:39,358
to

5475
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:40,800
find your way to a new crowd but if the

5476
02:42:39,359 --> 02:42:41,840
idea is like i want to have a leave a

5477
02:42:40,799 --> 02:42:44,478
dent

5478
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:46,719
in the world of ideas then to have a

5479
02:42:44,478 --> 02:42:48,239
vulnerable old publisher

5480
02:42:46,719 --> 02:42:52,000
you know put out your book and a nice

5481
02:42:48,239 --> 02:42:53,279
hardcover and do the things they do

5482
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:55,040
that goes a long way and they do do a

5483
02:42:53,279 --> 02:42:56,800
lot i mean there's it's very difficult

5484
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:58,240
actually there's so much involved in

5485
02:42:56,799 --> 02:42:59,599
putting together a book they get books

5486
02:42:58,239 --> 02:43:00,799
into bookstores and all that kind of

5487
02:42:59,600 --> 02:43:02,318
stuff all that stuff and from an

5488
02:43:00,799 --> 02:43:03,840
efficiency standpoint

5489
02:43:02,318 --> 02:43:05,359
i mean just the time involved and trying

5490
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:07,359
to do this yourself is

5491
02:43:05,359 --> 02:43:08,559
there any process right like you said

5492
02:43:07,359 --> 02:43:10,239
they have a process they've got a

5493
02:43:08,559 --> 02:43:11,760
process i mean i know like jocko did

5494
02:43:10,239 --> 02:43:12,959
this recently he started his own imprint

5495
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:15,200
and i have a couple other

5496
02:43:12,959 --> 02:43:17,039
but it's huge overhead i mean if you

5497
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:19,040
like if you run a business and you

5498
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:20,319
so like jocko is a good case study right

5499
02:43:19,040 --> 02:43:22,560
so he got you know

5500
02:43:20,318 --> 02:43:24,079
fed up with simon schuster uh dragging

5501
02:43:22,559 --> 02:43:25,519
their feet and said i'm gonna start

5502
02:43:24,079 --> 02:43:27,920
my own imprint then if you're not gonna

5503
02:43:25,520 --> 02:43:29,439
publish my kid's book um

5504
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:31,359
but he what does he do he runs

5505
02:43:29,439 --> 02:43:31,760
businesses right yeah so i think in his

5506
02:43:31,359 --> 02:43:33,840
world

5507
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:35,279
i already run i'm a i'm a partner in

5508
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:36,559
whatever in origin and i have this and

5509
02:43:35,279 --> 02:43:37,840
that and so it's like yeah

5510
02:43:36,559 --> 02:43:39,359
we can run businesses that's what we

5511
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:40,880
know how to do that's what i do i run

5512
02:43:39,359 --> 02:43:42,079
businesses i have people but for like

5513
02:43:40,879 --> 02:43:43,839
you or i

5514
02:43:42,079 --> 02:43:45,200
we don't run businesses it'd be terrible

5515
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:46,960
yeah yeah or

5516
02:43:45,200 --> 02:43:48,880
especially these kinds of businesses

5517
02:43:46,959 --> 02:43:50,398
right so i do want to launch a business

5518
02:43:48,879 --> 02:43:51,759
very different technology business it's

5519
02:43:50,398 --> 02:43:52,879
very very different very difficult it's

5520
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:54,639
very very different yeah

5521
02:43:52,879 --> 02:43:56,159
yeah i mean this is like okay i need

5522
02:43:54,639 --> 02:43:58,079
copy editors and and

5523
02:43:56,159 --> 02:43:59,439
graphic book binders and i need to

5524
02:43:58,079 --> 02:44:01,039
contract with the printer but oh the

5525
02:43:59,439 --> 02:44:01,680
printer doesn't have slots and so now i

5526
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:04,800
have to try to

5527
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:06,000
i mean it's i get so this i need to shut

5528
02:44:04,799 --> 02:44:07,679
this off in my brain but i get so

5529
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,478
frustrated when the system could clearly

5530
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:09,920
be improved

5531
02:44:08,478 --> 02:44:11,920
it's the thing that you're mentioning

5532
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:13,680
yeah it's like this is so inefficient

5533
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:15,439
this every time i go to the dmv or

5534
02:44:13,680 --> 02:44:16,960
something like that right

5535
02:44:15,439 --> 02:44:18,720
you think like ah this could be done so

5536
02:44:16,959 --> 02:44:21,919
much better yeah

5537
02:44:18,719 --> 02:44:24,159
but you know and the same thing is

5538
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:25,920
the worry with the with an editor which

5539
02:44:24,159 --> 02:44:29,840
i guess would come from the publisher

5540
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:31,840
like who would who would uh how much

5541
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:34,079
supervision on your book did you receive

5542
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:36,079
like hey do you think this is too long

5543
02:44:34,079 --> 02:44:38,159
or do you think the type like title

5544
02:44:36,079 --> 02:44:39,120
how much choice do you have in the title

5545
02:44:38,159 --> 02:44:41,119
in the cover

5546
02:44:39,120 --> 02:44:42,640
in the presentation and the branding and

5547
02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:44,479
all that kind of stuff yeah i mean

5548
02:44:42,639 --> 02:44:46,239
all of it depends right so when it comes

5549
02:44:44,478 --> 02:44:47,920
on the

5550
02:44:46,239 --> 02:44:49,359
the relationship on the with the editor

5551
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:50,478
on the writing it depends on the editor

5552
02:44:49,359 --> 02:44:53,120
and it depends on

5553
02:44:50,478 --> 02:44:54,000
you so at this point i'm on my seventh

5554
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:55,760
book

5555
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:57,760
and i write for a lot of major

5556
02:44:55,760 --> 02:44:59,680
publications and at this point i have

5557
02:44:57,760 --> 02:45:01,760
what i feel like is a

5558
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:03,680
voice that i've and a level of craft

5559
02:45:01,760 --> 02:45:05,840
that i i'm very comfortable with right

5560
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:07,120
so my editor is not going to be

5561
02:45:05,840 --> 02:45:09,120
chicano is going to trust me and it's

5562
02:45:07,120 --> 02:45:11,359
going to be more big picture like uh

5563
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:12,640
i'm losing the thread here or this seems

5564
02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:13,920
like it could be longer

5565
02:45:12,639 --> 02:45:16,478
whereas the first book i wrote when i

5566
02:45:13,920 --> 02:45:19,359
was 21 i had notes such as

5567
02:45:16,478 --> 02:45:20,879
you start a lot of sentences with so uh

5568
02:45:19,359 --> 02:45:22,479
you don't use any contractions because

5569
02:45:20,879 --> 02:45:23,599
i've been doing scientific writing yeah

5570
02:45:22,478 --> 02:45:25,278
use contractions like you should

5571
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:27,200
probably use contractions that

5572
02:45:25,279 --> 02:45:29,600
it was way more you know i had to go

5573
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:32,399
back and rewrite the whole thing yeah

5574
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:33,680
but ultimately the recommendation i mean

5575
02:45:32,398 --> 02:45:36,639
we talked offline and sort of

5576
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:38,559
i was thinking loosely not really sure

5577
02:45:36,639 --> 02:45:39,840
but i was thinking of writing a book and

5578
02:45:38,559 --> 02:45:41,359
there's a kind of desire to go

5579
02:45:39,840 --> 02:45:42,960
self-publishing not for financial

5580
02:45:41,359 --> 02:45:44,640
reasons and the money can be good by the

5581
02:45:42,959 --> 02:45:46,879
way right i mean

5582
02:45:44,639 --> 02:45:48,639
it's very it's very uh power law type

5583
02:45:46,879 --> 02:45:50,159
just distributed right so so the money

5584
02:45:48,639 --> 02:45:51,920
on a hard cover is somewhere between one

5585
02:45:50,159 --> 02:45:53,920
or two dollars a book

5586
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:55,439
so the thing is i personally don't but

5587
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:57,279
you give up 15 to the agent

5588
02:45:55,439 --> 02:45:58,960
so i personally don't care about money

5589
02:45:57,279 --> 02:46:00,880
as i've mentioned before but i

5590
02:45:58,959 --> 02:46:03,119
i for some reason really don't like

5591
02:46:00,879 --> 02:46:05,920
spending money

5592
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:06,240
on things that are not worth it like

5593
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:08,318
yeah

5594
02:46:06,239 --> 02:46:09,439
i don't care if i get money i just don't

5595
02:46:08,318 --> 02:46:11,840
like spending money

5596
02:46:09,439 --> 02:46:12,639
on like feeding a system that's

5597
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:13,920
inefficient

5598
02:46:12,639 --> 02:46:16,000
it's like i'm contributing to the

5599
02:46:13,920 --> 02:46:17,120
problem that's my biggest problem

5600
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:19,840
right so you think that you're you're

5601
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:21,840
worried about the inefficiencies of the

5602
02:46:19,840 --> 02:46:23,200
yeah the fact that like the overhead the

5603
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:23,920
number of people involved or the

5604
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:27,200
overheads yeah

5605
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:29,520
the emails again the the

5606
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:31,520
the the the fact that they have this way

5607
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:33,600
of speaking which i'm allergic to

5608
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:35,760
many people like that's very marketing

5609
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:37,600
speak like you could tell they've been

5610
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:41,359
having zoom meetings all day

5611
02:46:37,600 --> 02:46:44,079
it's like as opposed to a sort of

5612
02:46:41,359 --> 02:46:46,159
creative collaborators that are like

5613
02:46:44,079 --> 02:46:47,520
also a little bit crazy yeah

5614
02:46:46,159 --> 02:46:48,719
i suppose some of that is finding the

5615
02:46:47,520 --> 02:46:49,920
right people finding the right people

5616
02:46:48,719 --> 02:46:50,879
that's what i would say i say there's

5617
02:46:49,920 --> 02:46:53,680
definitely

5618
02:46:50,879 --> 02:46:55,119
and maybe it's just good fortune uh good

5619
02:46:53,680 --> 02:46:56,800
fortune in terms of like my agents and

5620
02:46:55,120 --> 02:47:00,000
editors i've worked with there's

5621
02:46:56,799 --> 02:47:01,920
really good people who they're

5622
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:03,040
see the vision are smart or incredibly

5623
02:47:01,920 --> 02:47:06,000
literary

5624
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:07,600
yeah and yeah i had a great editor when

5625
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,478
i was first moving into hardcover books

5626
02:47:07,600 --> 02:47:11,600
for example

5627
02:47:08,478 --> 02:47:12,398
it was my first you know big book

5628
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:15,520
advance and

5629
02:47:12,398 --> 02:47:16,719
my first sort of big deal and uh he was

5630
02:47:15,520 --> 02:47:19,279
like a senior editor and

5631
02:47:16,719 --> 02:47:19,760
and it was very useful you know he was

5632
02:47:19,279 --> 02:47:21,680
like

5633
02:47:19,760 --> 02:47:23,279
we had a lot of long talks right i was

5634
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:24,800
so this was my fourth book so good they

5635
02:47:23,279 --> 02:47:27,840
can't ignore you was my first

5636
02:47:24,799 --> 02:47:29,358
my big hardcover idea book um

5637
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:30,880
and we had a lot of talks like even

5638
02:47:29,359 --> 02:47:32,960
before i started writing it

5639
02:47:30,879 --> 02:47:34,719
just let's talk about books and his

5640
02:47:32,959 --> 02:47:36,079
philosophy he'd been in the business for

5641
02:47:34,719 --> 02:47:38,318
a long time he was the head of the

5642
02:47:36,079 --> 02:47:39,120
the head of the imprint it was useful

5643
02:47:38,318 --> 02:47:40,879
yeah but

5644
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:42,640
uh i mean the other frustrating thing is

5645
02:47:40,879 --> 02:47:45,519
how long the whole thing takes

5646
02:47:42,639 --> 02:47:46,478
a long time yeah but i suppose that's he

5647
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:48,560
just had to accept well

5648
02:47:46,478 --> 02:47:49,920
yeah i handed in this manuscript for the

5649
02:47:48,559 --> 02:47:52,398
the the book that comes out

5650
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:53,359
now like when this i handed it in i mean

5651
02:47:52,398 --> 02:47:55,278
over the summer

5652
02:47:53,359 --> 02:47:56,559
like during the pandemic so it's not

5653
02:47:55,279 --> 02:47:58,000
it's not terrible right and we were

5654
02:47:56,559 --> 02:47:58,799
editing during the pandemic and i

5655
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:02,079
finished it

5656
02:47:58,799 --> 02:48:03,519
in the spring we've talked most of today

5657
02:48:02,079 --> 02:48:06,719
except for a little bit computer science

5658
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:09,600
most of today about a productive life

5659
02:48:06,719 --> 02:48:12,639
um how does uh love friendship and

5660
02:48:09,600 --> 02:48:15,279
family fit into that

5661
02:48:12,639 --> 02:48:17,439
is there um do you find that is a

5662
02:48:15,279 --> 02:48:19,680
tension

5663
02:48:17,439 --> 02:48:22,398
is it possible for relationships to

5664
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:25,520
energize the whole process to benefit

5665
02:48:22,398 --> 02:48:27,439
or is it ultimately a trade-off but

5666
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:31,200
because life is short

5667
02:48:27,439 --> 02:48:32,800
and uh ultimately we seek happiness not

5668
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:36,159
productivity

5669
02:48:32,799 --> 02:48:39,119
that we have to accept that tension yeah

5670
02:48:36,159 --> 02:48:41,359
i mean i think relationships is the

5671
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:43,680
that's the found that's the whole deal

5672
02:48:41,359 --> 02:48:45,120
like i thought about this the other day

5673
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:46,318
i don't think context was i was thinking

5674
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:47,439
about if i was going to give like an

5675
02:48:46,318 --> 02:48:49,359
advice speech

5676
02:48:47,439 --> 02:48:51,680
like a commencement address or like

5677
02:48:49,359 --> 02:48:54,479
giving advice to young people

5678
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:55,200
and uh like the big question i have for

5679
02:48:54,478 --> 02:48:57,438
young people

5680
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:58,479
is if they haven't already bad things

5681
02:48:57,439 --> 02:49:00,479
are going to happen

5682
02:48:58,478 --> 02:49:02,478
that you don't control so what's the

5683
02:49:00,478 --> 02:49:03,519
plan right like let's start

5684
02:49:02,478 --> 02:49:05,519
let's start figuring that out now

5685
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:07,279
because it's not all

5686
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:08,720
some people get off better than others

5687
02:49:07,279 --> 02:49:10,720
but eventually

5688
02:49:08,719 --> 02:49:12,159
stuff happens right you get sick

5689
02:49:10,719 --> 02:49:15,199
something falls apart the

5690
02:49:12,159 --> 02:49:15,520
economy craters the someone you know you

5691
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:17,040
know

5692
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:18,880
dies like all sorts of bad stuff is

5693
02:49:17,040 --> 02:49:21,279
gonna happen right

5694
02:49:18,879 --> 02:49:23,119
so how are we gonna do this like how do

5695
02:49:21,279 --> 02:49:25,359
we like live life and life is hard and

5696
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:28,160
in ways that is unfair and unpredictable

5697
02:49:25,359 --> 02:49:30,159
um then relationships is the that's the

5698
02:49:28,159 --> 02:49:31,680
buffer for all of that

5699
02:49:30,159 --> 02:49:33,439
because we're wired for it right i went

5700
02:49:31,680 --> 02:49:34,960
down this this rabbit hole with digital

5701
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:35,359
minimalism i went down this huge rabbit

5702
02:49:34,959 --> 02:49:38,639
hole

5703
02:49:35,359 --> 02:49:40,079
about the human brain in sociality

5704
02:49:38,639 --> 02:49:42,159
it's all we're wired to do it's like all

5705
02:49:40,079 --> 02:49:44,398
of our brain is for this like everything

5706
02:49:42,159 --> 02:49:45,600
all of our mechanisms everything is made

5707
02:49:44,398 --> 02:49:46,639
to service

5708
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:48,000
social connections because that's what

5709
02:49:46,639 --> 02:49:49,920
kept you alive you know i mean you had

5710
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,559
to your tribal connections is how you

5711
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:52,398
didn't

5712
02:49:50,559 --> 02:49:54,478
uh starve during the famine people share

5713
02:49:52,398 --> 02:49:56,318
food et cetera

5714
02:49:54,478 --> 02:49:58,079
and so you can't neglect that and it's

5715
02:49:56,318 --> 02:49:59,278
like everything and and people feel it

5716
02:49:58,079 --> 02:50:00,478
right like there's no

5717
02:49:59,279 --> 02:50:02,560
our social networks are hooked up to the

5718
02:50:00,478 --> 02:50:04,000
pain center it's why it feels so

5719
02:50:02,559 --> 02:50:05,359
terrible when you miss someone or like

5720
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,879
someone dies or something right that's

5721
02:50:05,359 --> 02:50:08,880
like how seriously

5722
02:50:06,879 --> 02:50:10,318
we take it there's a pretty accepted

5723
02:50:08,879 --> 02:50:11,759
theory that the default mode network

5724
02:50:10,318 --> 02:50:13,119
like a lot of what the default mode

5725
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:14,960
network is doing so the sort of the

5726
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:16,160
default state our brain goes into when

5727
02:50:14,959 --> 02:50:18,079
we're not doing something in particular

5728
02:50:16,159 --> 02:50:19,680
is practicing sociality

5729
02:50:18,079 --> 02:50:21,760
practicing interactions think because

5730
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:22,398
it's it's so you know crucial to what we

5731
02:50:21,760 --> 02:50:24,960
do

5732
02:50:22,398 --> 02:50:25,599
it's like at the core of human thriving

5733
02:50:24,959 --> 02:50:26,959
so i've

5734
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:28,640
more recently the way i think about it

5735
02:50:26,959 --> 02:50:30,959
is like relationships first

5736
02:50:28,639 --> 02:50:32,079
like okay given that foundation of

5737
02:50:30,959 --> 02:50:33,519
putting like and i don't think we put

5738
02:50:32,079 --> 02:50:34,719
nearly enough time into it i worry that

5739
02:50:33,520 --> 02:50:36,159
social media

5740
02:50:34,719 --> 02:50:38,239
is reducing relationships strong

5741
02:50:36,159 --> 02:50:40,239
relationships strong relationships where

5742
02:50:38,239 --> 02:50:43,279
you're sacrificing non-trivial

5743
02:50:40,239 --> 02:50:44,478
time and attention resources whatever on

5744
02:50:43,279 --> 02:50:46,159
behalf of other people

5745
02:50:44,478 --> 02:50:48,239
that's the net that it's going to allow

5746
02:50:46,159 --> 02:50:50,879
you to get through anything

5747
02:50:48,239 --> 02:50:52,478
then all right now what do we want to do

5748
02:50:50,879 --> 02:50:53,759
with uh

5749
02:50:52,478 --> 02:50:55,199
the surplus that remains maybe i want to

5750
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:55,840
build some build some fire build some

5751
02:50:55,200 --> 02:50:58,079
tools

5752
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:59,680
so put relationships first i like the

5753
02:50:58,079 --> 02:51:00,959
worst case analysis from the computer

5754
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:03,760
science perspective

5755
02:51:00,959 --> 02:51:04,959
put relationships first yeah because

5756
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:08,478
everything else is just

5757
02:51:04,959 --> 02:51:10,000
uh assuming average case

5758
02:51:08,478 --> 02:51:11,438
assuming things kind of keep going as

5759
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,719
they were going and you're neglecting

5760
02:51:11,439 --> 02:51:14,639
the fundamental human

5761
02:51:12,719 --> 02:51:15,679
drive like we we have to talk about the

5762
02:51:14,639 --> 02:51:17,039
board of instinct we want to build

5763
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:18,639
things we want to have impact we want to

5764
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:20,080
do productivity that's not nearly as

5765
02:51:18,639 --> 02:51:23,199
clear-cut of a drive of we need

5766
02:51:20,079 --> 02:51:24,398
people but if we look at the real worst

5767
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:27,680
case

5768
02:51:24,398 --> 02:51:30,318
analysis here is one day

5769
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:31,760
you're pretty young now but that's not

5770
02:51:30,318 --> 02:51:33,119
going to last very long

5771
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:35,040
you're gonna die one day is that

5772
02:51:33,120 --> 02:51:37,359
something you think about

5773
02:51:35,040 --> 02:51:39,279
a little bit are you afraid of death

5774
02:51:37,359 --> 02:51:41,920
well i'm up the mindset of

5775
02:51:39,279 --> 02:51:43,120
let's make that a productivity hack i'm

5776
02:51:41,920 --> 02:51:46,719
in the mindset of

5777
02:51:43,120 --> 02:51:48,800
um we need to confront that soon

5778
02:51:46,719 --> 02:51:50,318
yeah so let's do what we can now so that

5779
02:51:48,799 --> 02:51:51,840
when we really confront and think about

5780
02:51:50,318 --> 02:51:53,199
it we're we're more likely to

5781
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:55,359
feel better about it so in other words

5782
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:56,880
like let's let's focus now on

5783
02:51:55,359 --> 02:51:58,479
living and doing things in such a way

5784
02:51:56,879 --> 02:51:59,599
that we're proud of

5785
02:51:58,478 --> 02:52:02,559
so that when it really comes time to

5786
02:51:59,600 --> 02:52:03,439
confront that we're more likely to say

5787
02:52:02,559 --> 02:52:05,039
like okay

5788
02:52:03,439 --> 02:52:06,559
i feel kind of good about the situation

5789
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:07,760
so what uh when you're laying on your

5790
02:52:06,559 --> 02:52:09,920
deathbed

5791
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:11,279
would you in looking back what would

5792
02:52:09,920 --> 02:52:14,000
make you think like oh i

5793
02:52:11,279 --> 02:52:14,640
did a i do okay i'm proud of that i

5794
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,318
optimized

5795
02:52:14,639 --> 02:52:17,760
the hell out of that that's a good i

5796
02:52:16,318 --> 02:52:18,398
mean it's a good question that the that

5797
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:21,200
go

5798
02:52:18,398 --> 02:52:22,159
backwards on i mean this is this is like

5799
02:52:21,200 --> 02:52:26,640
david brooks's

5800
02:52:22,159 --> 02:52:28,799
uh eulogy virtues versus resume virtues

5801
02:52:26,639 --> 02:52:30,318
right so his argument is that uh and

5802
02:52:28,799 --> 02:52:32,000
that's another interesting dc area

5803
02:52:30,318 --> 02:52:33,600
person i keep thinking of interesting

5804
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:36,000
syria people all right david brooks is

5805
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:38,159
here too um

5806
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:39,760
his argument he thinks eulogy virtues is

5807
02:52:38,159 --> 02:52:40,639
so what we eulogize is different than

5808
02:52:39,760 --> 02:52:43,200
what we

5809
02:52:40,639 --> 02:52:44,398
promote on the resume uh that's his

5810
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:45,120
whole thing now right his second

5811
02:52:44,398 --> 02:52:47,278
mountain

5812
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:48,160
wrote the character about these books or

5813
02:52:47,279 --> 02:52:49,040
he has this whole

5814
02:52:48,159 --> 02:52:50,639
premise of there's like this

5815
02:52:49,040 --> 02:52:51,920
professional phase and there's a phase

5816
02:52:50,639 --> 02:52:53,920
of

5817
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:55,520
uh giving of yourself and sacrifice on

5818
02:52:53,920 --> 02:52:56,559
behalf of other people

5819
02:52:55,520 --> 02:52:58,720
i don't know maybe it's all mixed

5820
02:52:56,559 --> 02:53:00,478
together right you wanna i think living

5821
02:52:58,719 --> 02:53:01,760
by a code is important right i mean

5822
02:53:00,478 --> 02:53:03,519
uh this is something that's not

5823
02:53:01,760 --> 02:53:04,398
emphasized enough i always think of

5824
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:05,920
advice that

5825
02:53:04,398 --> 02:53:07,039
my undergrad should be given that that

5826
02:53:05,920 --> 02:53:08,960
they're not given especially a place

5827
02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:10,960
like georgetown that has this like deep

5828
02:53:08,959 --> 02:53:12,318
history of you know trying to promote

5829
02:53:10,959 --> 02:53:13,438
human flourishing because of the jesuit

5830
02:53:12,318 --> 02:53:17,760
connection

5831
02:53:13,439 --> 02:53:20,800
uh there's such there's such uh

5832
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:22,079
resiliency and pride that comes out of

5833
02:53:20,799 --> 02:53:24,079
living well even when it's hard like

5834
02:53:22,079 --> 02:53:24,478
living according to a code living accord

5835
02:53:24,079 --> 02:53:26,079
to

5836
02:53:24,478 --> 02:53:28,000
which which you know i think religion

5837
02:53:26,079 --> 02:53:29,520
used to structure this for people

5838
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:31,200
and but in its absence you need some

5839
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:32,720
sort of replacement but this uh even

5840
02:53:31,200 --> 02:53:33,359
when things were soldiers get this a lot

5841
02:53:32,719 --> 02:53:34,719
right

5842
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:36,079
the experience is a lot even when things

5843
02:53:34,719 --> 02:53:37,278
were tough i was able to persist in

5844
02:53:36,079 --> 02:53:38,318
living this way that i knew was right

5845
02:53:37,279 --> 02:53:39,600
even though it wasn't the easiest thing

5846
02:53:38,318 --> 02:53:41,359
to do in the moment like fewer things

5847
02:53:39,600 --> 02:53:44,000
give humans more

5848
02:53:41,359 --> 02:53:45,279
resilience like having done that your

5849
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,799
relationships are strong

5850
02:53:45,279 --> 02:53:48,079
right many people coming to your funeral

5851
02:53:46,799 --> 02:53:49,119
as a standard like a lot of people are

5852
02:53:48,079 --> 02:53:51,039
going to come to your funeral like i

5853
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:52,880
mean you matter to a lot of people

5854
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:54,800
and then maybe having done to to the

5855
02:53:52,879 --> 02:53:56,719
extent of whatever

5856
02:53:54,799 --> 02:53:58,159
capabilities you are happen to be

5857
02:53:56,719 --> 02:53:59,278
granted you know and they're different

5858
02:53:58,159 --> 02:54:00,639
for different people and

5859
02:53:59,279 --> 02:54:02,720
some people can sprint real fast and

5860
02:54:00,639 --> 02:54:06,398
some people can do math problems uh

5861
02:54:02,719 --> 02:54:08,398
try to actually do something of impact

5862
02:54:06,398 --> 02:54:10,079
i'll just uh promise to give gift cards

5863
02:54:08,398 --> 02:54:11,519
to anybody shows up to the funeral

5864
02:54:10,079 --> 02:54:13,120
you're going to hack it i'm going to

5865
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:13,520
hack even the funeral there's going to

5866
02:54:13,120 --> 02:54:15,200
be a

5867
02:54:13,520 --> 02:54:16,479
lottery wheel you spend when you come in

5868
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:17,439
and someone goes away with ten thousand

5869
02:54:16,478 --> 02:54:20,159
dollars

5870
02:54:17,439 --> 02:54:22,000
the see the problem is like with all the

5871
02:54:20,159 --> 02:54:23,520
living by principles

5872
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:25,600
living in principle life focusing on

5873
02:54:23,520 --> 02:54:27,359
relationships and kind of

5874
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:29,439
thinking of this life as this perfect

5875
02:54:27,359 --> 02:54:33,600
thing kind of forgets the notion that

5876
02:54:29,439 --> 02:54:36,639
none of it you know makes any sense

5877
02:54:33,600 --> 02:54:39,439
right like the like it

5878
02:54:36,639 --> 02:54:41,039
it kind of implies that this is like a

5879
02:54:39,439 --> 02:54:42,318
video game and you want to get a high

5880
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:45,040
score

5881
02:54:42,318 --> 02:54:45,680
as opposed to none of this even makes

5882
02:54:45,040 --> 02:54:49,680
sense

5883
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:52,559
like why would he like what that

5884
02:54:49,680 --> 02:54:53,600
like like what does it even mean to die

5885
02:54:52,559 --> 02:54:56,559
it's going to be over

5886
02:54:53,600 --> 02:54:58,559
it's like everything i do all these

5887
02:54:56,559 --> 02:55:00,079
productivity hacks all this life all

5888
02:54:58,559 --> 02:55:01,278
these efforts all this creative efforts

5889
02:55:00,079 --> 02:55:02,000
kind of assume it's going to go on

5890
02:55:01,279 --> 02:55:05,040
forever

5891
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:06,559
there's a kind of sense of immortality

5892
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:08,240
and i don't even know how intellectually

5893
02:55:06,559 --> 02:55:10,639
makes sense that it ends uh

5894
02:55:08,239 --> 02:55:11,760
of course got to ask you in that context

5895
02:55:10,639 --> 02:55:13,680
what do you think is the

5896
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:15,120
meaning of it all especially for

5897
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:17,279
computer scientists i mean

5898
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:19,600
there's got to be some mathematical uh

5899
02:55:17,279 --> 02:55:22,239
yeah 27 or what's the

5900
02:55:19,600 --> 02:55:23,040
what's the douglas adams yeah or 40 40

5901
02:55:22,239 --> 02:55:25,039
42 okay

5902
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:26,240
20 27 is a better number i should read

5903
02:55:25,040 --> 02:55:28,880
more sci-fi

5904
02:55:26,239 --> 02:55:30,079
um you're on to something with a 27. i

5905
02:55:28,879 --> 02:55:30,799
don't want to give away too much but

5906
02:55:30,079 --> 02:55:34,799
just

5907
02:55:30,799 --> 02:55:37,039
trust me 27. invisible yeah um

5908
02:55:34,799 --> 02:55:37,840
so i mean i don't know obviously right i

5909
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:40,000
mean i'm

5910
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:41,439
just hoping you would yeah i i don't

5911
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,318
know but but going back to what you're

5912
02:55:41,439 --> 02:55:43,279
saying about the sort of the

5913
02:55:42,318 --> 02:55:46,000
existentialist

5914
02:55:43,279 --> 02:55:46,960
or the sort of the more nihilist style

5915
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:49,040
approach

5916
02:55:46,959 --> 02:55:50,079
the one thing that that there is are

5917
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:52,720
intimations

5918
02:55:50,079 --> 02:55:53,920
right so there's these intimations to

5919
02:55:52,719 --> 02:55:56,000
human haves of

5920
02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:58,478
somehow this feels right and this feels

5921
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:00,719
wrong this feels good this feels like

5922
02:55:58,478 --> 02:56:02,159
i'm doing i'm aligned with something you

5923
02:56:00,719 --> 02:56:04,000
know when i'm acting with courage to

5924
02:56:02,159 --> 02:56:05,359
save whatever right it's not

5925
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:07,040
these intimations are a grounding

5926
02:56:05,359 --> 02:56:08,000
against arbitrariness

5927
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:11,279
like one of the ideas i'm really

5928
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:13,840
interested in is that uh

5929
02:56:11,279 --> 02:56:15,359
when you look at religion right so i'm

5930
02:56:13,840 --> 02:56:15,920
i'm interested in world religions for

5931
02:56:15,359 --> 02:56:18,239
for

5932
02:56:15,920 --> 02:56:19,359
my grandfather was a like a theologian

5933
02:56:18,239 --> 02:56:20,478
that studied and wrote all these books

5934
02:56:19,359 --> 02:56:21,359
i'm very interested in this type of

5935
02:56:20,478 --> 02:56:24,559
stuff

5936
02:56:21,359 --> 02:56:27,040
and there's this great book that's it's

5937
02:56:24,559 --> 02:56:28,559
it's not um specific to a particular

5938
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:30,720
religion but it's karen armstrong wrote

5939
02:56:28,559 --> 02:56:32,159
this great book called the case for god

5940
02:56:30,719 --> 02:56:33,599
she's very interesting she was a

5941
02:56:32,159 --> 02:56:34,559
catholic nun who sort of left that

5942
02:56:33,600 --> 02:56:37,760
religion and is

5943
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:39,760
but one of the smartest thinkers uh in

5944
02:56:37,760 --> 02:56:41,279
terms of like accessible theological

5945
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:42,880
thinking that's not tied to any

5946
02:56:41,279 --> 02:56:44,560
particular religion

5947
02:56:42,879 --> 02:56:46,239
her whole argument is that the way to

5948
02:56:44,559 --> 02:56:47,439
understand religion you first

5949
02:56:46,239 --> 02:56:48,879
have to go way back pre-enlightenment

5950
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:49,680
where all this was formed we got messed

5951
02:56:48,879 --> 02:56:51,599
up thinking about

5952
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:53,600
religion post enlightenment right and

5953
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:55,040
and um

5954
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:57,840
these were operating systems for making

5955
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:59,200
sense of intimations

5956
02:56:57,840 --> 02:57:00,880
the one thing we had were these

5957
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:01,200
different informations of this field

5958
02:57:00,879 --> 02:57:04,398
like

5959
02:57:01,200 --> 02:57:05,760
ah and mystical experience and this

5960
02:57:04,398 --> 02:57:07,119
feels some there's something you feel

5961
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:09,040
when you act in a certain way

5962
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:10,560
and don't act in this other way and it

5963
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:11,120
was like the scientists who were trying

5964
02:57:10,559 --> 02:57:13,119
to

5965
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:14,640
study and understand the model of the

5966
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:15,920
atom by just looking at

5967
02:57:14,639 --> 02:57:17,760
experiments and trying to understand

5968
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:19,680
what's going on like the great religions

5969
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:20,719
of the world were basically figuring out

5970
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:22,800
how do we make sense of these

5971
02:57:20,719 --> 02:57:24,318
intimations and live in alignment with

5972
02:57:22,799 --> 02:57:24,799
them and build a life of meaning around

5973
02:57:24,318 --> 02:57:26,239
that

5974
02:57:24,799 --> 02:57:28,000
what were the tools they were using they

5975
02:57:26,239 --> 02:57:29,439
were using ritual they were using belief

5976
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:31,600
they were using action

5977
02:57:29,439 --> 02:57:34,800
but all of it was like an os it was like

5978
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:37,920
a liturgical model of the atom that

5979
02:57:34,799 --> 02:57:39,679
hardcoded in so it's it did uh through

5980
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:40,719
the evolutionary process sometimes

5981
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:42,800
i mean they wouldn't have called it that

5982
02:57:40,719 --> 02:57:44,478
back then or yeah i mean whether

5983
02:57:42,799 --> 02:57:45,759
they said who they didn't have that

5984
02:57:44,478 --> 02:57:46,879
there's pre-enlightenment they just said

5985
02:57:45,760 --> 02:57:49,439
this is here

5986
02:57:46,879 --> 02:57:50,799
and and the directive is to to try to

5987
02:57:49,439 --> 02:57:52,239
live in alignment with that

5988
02:57:50,799 --> 02:57:54,239
well then i want to ask who wrote the

5989
02:57:52,239 --> 02:57:56,000
original code yeah so that's so

5990
02:57:54,239 --> 02:57:57,439
one question yeah so so armstrong lays

5991
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,639
out this good argument and where it gets

5992
02:57:57,439 --> 02:58:01,120
really interesting is that

5993
02:57:58,639 --> 02:58:02,318
that she emphasizes that all of this was

5994
02:58:01,120 --> 02:58:04,720
considered ineffable

5995
02:58:02,318 --> 02:58:06,000
right so the whole notion and this is

5996
02:58:04,719 --> 02:58:08,239
like rich in jewish tradition in

5997
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:09,760
particular and also an islamic tradition

5998
02:58:08,239 --> 02:58:11,920
we can't comprehend and understand

5999
02:58:09,760 --> 02:58:13,439
what's going on here right and so

6000
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:14,719
the best we can do to approximate

6001
02:58:13,439 --> 02:58:16,960
understanding and live in alignment is

6002
02:58:14,719 --> 02:58:19,039
we like act as if this is true

6003
02:58:16,959 --> 02:58:21,039
do these rituals have these actions or

6004
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:22,640
whatever post enlightenment a lot of

6005
02:58:21,040 --> 02:58:25,120
that got

6006
02:58:22,639 --> 02:58:26,639
once we learned about enlightenment we

6007
02:58:25,120 --> 02:58:28,560
grew these suspicions around religion

6008
02:58:26,639 --> 02:58:29,840
that are very much of the modern era

6009
02:58:28,559 --> 02:58:32,079
right so like the

6010
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:33,840
the karen armstrong like uh sam harris's

6011
02:58:32,079 --> 02:58:35,680
critique of religion makes no sense

6012
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:36,960
right the the critiques based on well

6013
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:38,398
this is you're making the ascent to

6014
02:58:36,959 --> 02:58:39,519
propositions that you think are true for

6015
02:58:38,398 --> 02:58:39,920
which you do not have evidence that they

6016
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:41,439
are true

6017
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:43,600
like that's an enlightenment thing right

6018
02:58:41,439 --> 02:58:46,239
this is not the context and this is not

6019
02:58:43,600 --> 02:58:48,000
the religion is the rutherford model of

6020
02:58:46,239 --> 02:58:48,559
the atom like it's not actually maybe

6021
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,799
what

6022
02:58:48,559 --> 02:58:52,318
is underneath happening but this model

6023
02:58:50,799 --> 02:58:53,358
explains why your chemical equations

6024
02:58:52,318 --> 02:58:54,959
work and so this is like the way

6025
02:58:53,359 --> 02:58:56,559
religion was you you

6026
02:58:54,959 --> 02:58:58,159
there's a god we'll call it this this is

6027
02:58:56,559 --> 02:59:00,000
how it works we do this ritual we act in

6028
02:58:58,159 --> 02:59:01,600
this way it aligns with it just like the

6029
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:03,200
model the atom predicted why

6030
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:04,559
you know n a and c l is going to become

6031
02:59:03,200 --> 02:59:06,000
salt this predicts that you're going to

6032
02:59:04,559 --> 02:59:07,439
feel and live in alignment right it's

6033
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,639
like this beautiful

6034
02:59:07,439 --> 02:59:10,960
sophisticated theory which actually

6035
02:59:08,639 --> 02:59:11,439
matches how a lot of great theologians

6036
02:59:10,959 --> 02:59:13,599
have

6037
02:59:11,439 --> 02:59:15,200
you know thought about it um but then

6038
02:59:13,600 --> 02:59:16,239
when you come forward in time yeah maybe

6039
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:18,079
it's evolution i mean

6040
02:59:16,239 --> 02:59:20,639
this is like what peterson hints at

6041
02:59:18,079 --> 02:59:23,680
right like he's basically

6042
02:59:20,639 --> 02:59:24,959
he's not he he doesn't like to get super

6043
02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:27,279
pinned down on this but

6044
02:59:24,959 --> 02:59:28,959
it's kind of seems where he's he's

6045
02:59:27,279 --> 02:59:30,479
almost like searching for the words

6046
02:59:28,959 --> 02:59:32,239
he focuses more on like jung and other

6047
02:59:30,478 --> 02:59:33,278
people but uh i mean i know he's very

6048
02:59:32,239 --> 02:59:34,959
union but but

6049
02:59:33,279 --> 02:59:36,720
that same type of analysis i think

6050
02:59:34,959 --> 02:59:37,519
roughly speaking like armstrong is sort

6051
02:59:36,719 --> 02:59:39,199
of a

6052
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:41,200
it's kind of like a petersonian analysis

6053
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:43,760
but she's looking more at the

6054
02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:45,840
deep history of religion than uh but

6055
02:59:43,760 --> 02:59:48,398
yeah he throws in an evolutionary

6056
02:59:45,840 --> 02:59:49,680
yeah and i wonder what holmen finds i i

6057
02:59:48,398 --> 02:59:52,239
wonder what the new home is

6058
02:59:49,680 --> 02:59:54,000
if religion dissipates uh what the new

6059
02:59:52,239 --> 02:59:57,119
home for these kinds of

6060
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:58,559
natural inclinations are uh yeah well

6061
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:59,840
there's technology whether

6062
02:59:58,559 --> 03:00:03,439
and if it's evolution i mean this is

6063
02:59:59,840 --> 03:00:05,279
francis collins book also he's like well

6064
03:00:03,439 --> 03:00:06,880
that's a religious that could be a very

6065
03:00:05,279 --> 03:00:07,840
religious notion i don't i think this

6066
03:00:06,879 --> 03:00:09,119
stuff is interesting i'm not a very

6067
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:11,840
religious person but i'm

6068
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:13,520
uh i'm thinking it's not a bad idea

6069
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:15,439
maybe maybe what replaces honestly like

6070
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:16,399
maybe what replaces religion is a return

6071
03:00:15,439 --> 03:00:18,479
to

6072
03:00:16,398 --> 03:00:19,760
religion but in this sort of more

6073
03:00:18,478 --> 03:00:22,000
sophisticated

6074
03:00:19,760 --> 03:00:23,760
i mean if you went back yeah i mean it's

6075
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,799
the issue with like a lot of the the the

6076
03:00:23,760 --> 03:00:27,840
recent critiques

6077
03:00:24,799 --> 03:00:29,519
i think is it's a it's a straw man

6078
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:30,960
critique in a complicated way right

6079
03:00:29,520 --> 03:00:32,479
because the the whole way these

6080
03:00:30,959 --> 03:00:33,919
the way this works i mean the

6081
03:00:32,478 --> 03:00:35,438
theologians if you're reading paul

6082
03:00:33,920 --> 03:00:36,799
tillich if you're reading

6083
03:00:35,439 --> 03:00:38,479
heschl if you're reading these people

6084
03:00:36,799 --> 03:00:39,920
they're thinking very sophisticatedly

6085
03:00:38,478 --> 03:00:40,639
about religion in terms of this it's

6086
03:00:39,920 --> 03:00:42,559
ineffable

6087
03:00:40,639 --> 03:00:44,239
and we're just these things and this is

6088
03:00:42,559 --> 03:00:44,959
deep it connects us to these things in a

6089
03:00:44,239 --> 03:00:46,159
way that

6090
03:00:44,959 --> 03:00:47,358
puts life in the line man we can't

6091
03:00:46,159 --> 03:00:49,520
really explain what's going on because

6092
03:00:47,359 --> 03:00:52,399
we our brains can't handle it right

6093
03:00:49,520 --> 03:00:54,159
um for the average person though this

6094
03:00:52,398 --> 03:00:55,278
notion of live as if is kind of how

6095
03:00:54,159 --> 03:00:58,318
religions work

6096
03:00:55,279 --> 03:01:00,880
is live as if this is true it's like an

6097
03:00:58,318 --> 03:01:01,359
os for getting in alignment with because

6098
03:01:00,879 --> 03:01:03,278
through ev

6099
03:01:01,359 --> 03:01:04,640
cultural evolution like you behave in

6100
03:01:03,279 --> 03:01:06,319
this way do these rituals live as if

6101
03:01:04,639 --> 03:01:08,959
this is true um

6102
03:01:06,318 --> 03:01:09,920
gives you the what the goal you're

6103
03:01:08,959 --> 03:01:11,599
looking for

6104
03:01:09,920 --> 03:01:13,279
but that's a complicated thing live as

6105
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:15,040
if this is true because if you

6106
03:01:13,279 --> 03:01:16,319
especially if you're not a theologian to

6107
03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:17,840
say uh

6108
03:01:16,318 --> 03:01:19,359
yeah this is not true in an

6109
03:01:17,840 --> 03:01:20,239
enlightenment sense but i'm living as if

6110
03:01:19,359 --> 03:01:21,760
it kind of

6111
03:01:20,239 --> 03:01:23,279
takes the heat out of it but of course

6112
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:24,719
it's what people are doing because

6113
03:01:23,279 --> 03:01:27,120
you know highly religious people still

6114
03:01:24,719 --> 03:01:28,318
do bad things where if you really were

6115
03:01:27,120 --> 03:01:29,439
you know there's absolutely a hell and

6116
03:01:28,318 --> 03:01:31,439
i'm definitely going to go to it if i do

6117
03:01:29,439 --> 03:01:32,960
this bad thing you would never have

6118
03:01:31,439 --> 03:01:34,479
you know no one would ever murder anyone

6119
03:01:32,959 --> 03:01:34,959
if they were an evangelical christian

6120
03:01:34,478 --> 03:01:36,799
right so

6121
03:01:34,959 --> 03:01:38,239
so it's like what this is kind of a

6122
03:01:36,799 --> 03:01:40,559
tangent that i'm i'm

6123
03:01:38,239 --> 03:01:41,359
i'm on shaky ground here but it's

6124
03:01:40,559 --> 03:01:43,519
something i've been

6125
03:01:41,359 --> 03:01:45,120
interested off and on a lot well it's

6126
03:01:43,520 --> 03:01:46,479
this fast i mean i think we're in some

6127
03:01:45,120 --> 03:01:47,840
sense searching for

6128
03:01:46,478 --> 03:01:49,519
because it is it does make for a good

6129
03:01:47,840 --> 03:01:50,239
operating system we're searching for a

6130
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:52,720
good

6131
03:01:50,239 --> 03:01:53,600
live as if x is true and we're searching

6132
03:01:52,719 --> 03:01:56,559
for a new x

6133
03:01:53,600 --> 03:01:57,359
yeah and maybe artificial intelligence

6134
03:01:56,559 --> 03:02:01,119
will be

6135
03:01:57,359 --> 03:02:02,880
the very the new gods that we're so

6136
03:02:01,120 --> 03:02:04,800
desperately looking for or it'll just

6137
03:02:02,879 --> 03:02:07,920
spit out 42.

6138
03:02:04,799 --> 03:02:10,959
i thought it was 27. yeah this is uh

03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:12,960
