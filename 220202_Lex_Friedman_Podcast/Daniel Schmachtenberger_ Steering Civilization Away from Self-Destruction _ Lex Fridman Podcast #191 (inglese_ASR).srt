1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,040
daniel schmucktenberger

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,960
a founding member of the consilience

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,359
project that is aimed at improving

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,839
public sense-making and dialogue

6
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,638
he's interested in understanding how we

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,480
humans

8
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,160
can be the best version of ourselves as

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,359
individuals and as

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,399
collectives at all scales quick mention

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,519
of our sponsors

12
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:26,159
ground news netsuite four sigmatic

13
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,839
magic spoon and better help check them

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,278
out in the description to support this

15
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,198
podcast

16
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,960
as a side note let me say that i got a

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,440
chance to talk to daniel on and off the

18
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,439
mic

19
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,759
for a couple of days we took a long walk

20
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,359
the day before our conversation

21
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,359
i really enjoyed meeting him just on a

22
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,920
basic human level we talked about the

23
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,558
world

24
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,160
around us with words that carried hope

25
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:47,919
for us individual ants

26
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,839
actually contributing something of value

27
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
to the colony

28
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,680
these conversations are the reasons i

29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,399
love human beings our insatiable

30
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,719
striving

31
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,600
to lessen the suffering in the world but

32
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,160
more than that

33
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
there's a simple magic to two strangers

34
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,319
meeting for the first time

35
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
and sharing ideas becoming fast friends

36
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,879
and creating something that is far

37
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,960
greater than the sum

38
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,879
of our parts i've gotten to experience

39
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,039
some of that same magic here in austin

40
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,920
with a few new friends and in random

41
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,920
bars in my travels across this country

42
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,680
where a conversation leaves me with a

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,240
big stupid smile on my face

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,159
and a new appreciation of this too short

45
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,399
too beautiful life

46
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,000
this is the lex friedman podcast and

47
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,079
here is my conversation

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,719
with daniel schmuckenberger if aliens

49
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,438
were observing earth through the entire

50
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,840
history

51
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,679
just watching us and uh we're tasked

52
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,079
with uh summarizing what happened until

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,920
now

54
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,039
what do you think they would say what do

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
you think they would write up in that

56
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,759
summary

57
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,799
like it has to be pretty short less than

58
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,920
a page

59
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,840
like in uh hitchhiker's guide

60
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,560
there's i think like a paragraph or a

61
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,640
couple sentences how would you

62
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,840
summarize how sorry how would the aliens

63
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,680
summarize do you think

64
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,240
uh all of human civilization my

65
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,560
first thoughts take more than a page

66
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,439
they'd probably distill it

67
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,920
because if they watched well i mean

68
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,000
first

69
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,519
i have no idea if their senses are even

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
attuned to similar stuff to what our

71
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,319
senses are attuned to

72
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,239
or what the nature of their

73
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,799
consciousness is like relative to ours

74
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,400
and

75
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,920
so let's assume that they're kind of

76
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,280
like us just technologically more

77
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,679
advanced to get here from wherever they

78
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,120
are

79
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
that's the first kind of constraint on

80
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,239
the thought experiment

81
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,719
and then if they've watched throughout

82
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,800
all of history

83
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,680
they saw the burning of alexandria they

84
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,519
saw that 2000 years ago

85
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,360
in greece we were producing things like

86
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,680
clocks the anti-catherine mechanism and

87
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,599
then that technology got lost they saw

88
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
that there wasn't just a steady

89
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,878
dialectic of progress

90
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,599
so every once in a while there's a giant

91
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,719
fire that destroys a lot of things

92
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,759
there's a giant like

93
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,159
uh commotion that destroys a lot of

94
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,759
things

95
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:02,158
yeah and it's usually self-induced

96
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:04,399
uh they would have seen seen that and so

97
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:06,079
as they're looking at us now as we move

98
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,719
past the nuclear

99
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,840
weapons age into the full globalization

100
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,759
anthropocene

101
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,239
exponential tech age still making our

102
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,039
decisions relatively similarly to how we

103
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,120
did

104
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,639
um in the stone age as far as rivalry

105
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,920
game theory type stuff i

106
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,238
i think they would think that this is

107
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,518
probably most likely one of the planets

108
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,120
that is not going to make it to being

109
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,280
intergalactic because we blow ourselves

110
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,878
up in the technological adolescence

111
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,719
and if we are going to we're going to

112
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:36,798
need some

113
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:39,759
major progress rapidly in the

114
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,280
social technologies that can guide and

115
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,639
bind and direct the physical

116
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,158
technologies

117
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,759
so that we are safe vessels for the

118
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:50,079
amount of power we're getting

119
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:51,598
actually hitchhiker's guide has uh

120
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,519
estimation about how

121
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:57,679
how much of a risk this particular thing

122
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,959
poses to the rest of the galaxy and i

123
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,319
think

124
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,319
i forget what it was i think it was

125
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,759
medium or low

126
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:08,399
so so their estimation was would be that

127
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,079
this this species of ant-like creatures

128
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,680
is not going to survive long

129
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,680
there's ups and downs in terms of

130
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,000
technological innovation

131
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
the fundamental nature of their behavior

132
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,798
from a game theory perspective hasn't

133
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,040
really changed

134
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,799
they have not learned in any fundamental

135
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,000
way how to

136
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,199
control and properly incentivize

137
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,478
or properly do the mechanism design

138
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,520
of games to ensure long-term survival

139
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:38,800
and then they move on to not the planet

140
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,519
do you uh think there is

141
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,000
in a more slightly more serious question

142
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,959
do you think

143
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,639
there's some number or perhaps a very

144
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,799
very large number

145
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,040
of uh intelligent alien civilizations

146
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,040
out there

147
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,560
yes would be hard to think otherwise i

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,279
know

149
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,800
i think posturum had a new article not

150
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,239
that long ago on why that might not be

151
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,160
the case that

152
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,759
the drake equation might not be the kind

153
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,479
of in story on it

154
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,759
but when i look at the total number of

155
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,599
kepler planets just

156
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,280
that we're aware of just galactically

157
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,680
and and also

158
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,959
like when that um when those life forms

159
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,959
were discovered in mono lake

160
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,799
that didn't have the same six primary

161
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,399
atoms i think it had arsenic replacing

162
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,879
phosphorus as one of the

163
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,399
primary aspects of its energy metabolism

164
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,439
we get to think about that the building

165
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,799
blocks might be

166
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,319
more different so the physical

167
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
constraints even the planets have to

168
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,120
have might be more different

169
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,839
uh it seems really unlikely not

170
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,720
not to mention interesting things that

171
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,839
we've observed

172
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,759
that are still unexplained as you've had

173
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,159
guests on your show discussing tic tac

174
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,720
and oh oh the ones that have visited

175
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,280
yeah well let's dive right into that

176
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,960
what do you make sense of

177
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,839
the rich human psychology of uh there

178
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,279
being

179
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,439
hundreds of thousands probably millions

180
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,559
of witnesses of ufos of different kinds

181
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,519
on earth

182
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,959
most of which i presume are conjured up

183
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,519
by the human mind

184
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,000
through the perception system some

185
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,159
number

186
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,120
might be true some number might be

187
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
reflective of

188
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,399
actual physical objects whether it's uh

189
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,638
you know drones or testing military

190
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,599
technology that's secret or

191
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,160
otherworldly technology we make sense of

192
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,000
all of that

193
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,400
because it's gained quite a bit of

194
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,519
popularity recently

195
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:33,599
there's uh some sense in which that's um

196
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,879
that's us humans being hopeful and

197
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,240
dreaming

198
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:41,759
of otherworldly creatures

199
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,120
as a way to escape the dreariness of our

200
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,240
of the human condition but in another

201
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,000
sense it could be

202
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,960
it really could be something truly

203
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,478
exciting that a science should

204
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:56,399
turn its eye towards so what do you

205
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,560
where do you place it speaking of

206
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,879
turning eye towards this is one of those

207
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,399
super fascinating actually super

208
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,879
consequential possibly

209
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,560
topics that i wish i had more time to

210
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,000
study and just haven't allocated so i

211
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,959
i don't have firm beliefs on this

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,319
because i haven't got to study it as

213
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,758
much as i want so what i'm going to say

214
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,759
comes from a superficial assessment

215
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:19,598
um while we know there are plenty of

216
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,879
things that people thought of as ufo

217
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,240
sightings that we can fully

218
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,918
write off we have other better

219
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,439
explanations for them

220
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,799
uh what we're interested in is the ones

221
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,160
that we don't have better explanations

222
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,319
for and then not just immediately

223
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,400
jumping to

224
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,598
a theory of what it is but holding it as

225
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,839
unidentified and being

226
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:39,839
being curious and earnest i think the

227
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,879
the tic tac one is quite interesting and

228
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,918
made it in major media recently but

229
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,279
i don't know if you ever saw the

230
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:49,038
disclosure project a guy named steven

231
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,079
greer organized

232
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,878
a bunch of mostly us military and some

233
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,318
commercial

234
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,919
flight people who had

235
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,800
direct observation and classified

236
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,839
information uh disclosing it at a cnn

237
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,960
briefing

238
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,959
and so you saw high-ranking generals

239
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,038
admirals fighter pilots all describing

240
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:12,159
things that they saw

241
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:15,199
on radar with visual uh

242
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,800
with their own eyes or cameras and also

243
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,478
describing some

244
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,079
phenomena that had some consistency

245
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,719
across different

246
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,359
people and i find this interesting

247
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,560
enough that

248
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,960
i think it would be silly to just

249
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,120
dismiss it um

250
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,239
and specifically like we can we can ask

251
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,000
the question

252
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,158
how much of it is natural phenomena ball

253
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,320
lightning or something like that

254
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,799
and this is why i'm more interested in

255
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,000
what uh fighter pilots and astronauts

256
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,918
and people who are trained

257
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,039
in being able to

258
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:49,360
identify uh flying objects and um

259
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,439
atmospheric phenomena have to say about

260
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,440
it

261
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,560
i think the thing then you you could say

262
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,519
well are they

263
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,919
more advanced military craft is it some

264
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,799
kind of

265
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,639
you know human craft the interesting

266
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,000
thing that a number of them describe is

267
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,958
something that's kind of like

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,559
right angles at speed or not right

269
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,239
angles acute angles at speed

270
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,759
but something that looks like a

271
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,480
different relationship to inertia than

272
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,639
physics makes sense for us

273
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,480
i don't think that there are any human

274
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,439
technologies that are doing that even in

275
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,800
really deep

276
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,160
uh underground black projects now

277
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,639
one could say okay well could it be a

278
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,000
hologram well would it show up on radar

279
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,199
if radar is also seeing it

280
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,080
and so uh i don't know i think there's

281
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,480
enough

282
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
i mean and for that to be a massive

283
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,120
coordinated psyop

284
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,839
is it as interesting and

285
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,360
ridiculous in a way as the idea that

286
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,560
it's ufos

287
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,200
from some extra planetary source so

288
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,399
it's up there on the interesting topics

289
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,759
to me there

290
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,080
if it is at all alien technology it is

291
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,360
the

292
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,839
dumbest version of alien technology

293
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,959
it's so far away it's like the old old

294
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,279
crappy vhs

295
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,439
tapes of alien technology these are like

296
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,838
crappy drones that just floated

297
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
or even like space to the level of like

298
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,200
space junk

299
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,000
because it is so close to our human

300
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,240
technology

301
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360
we talk about it moves in ways that's uh

302
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,879
that's unlike

303
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,519
what we understand about physics but it

304
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,639
still has very similar

305
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,480
kind of geometric notions

306
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,000
and something that we humans can

307
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,440
perceive with our eyes all those kinds

308
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
of things i feel like

309
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,519
alien technology most likely would be

310
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,679
something that

311
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,200
we would not be able to perceive not

312
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,719
because they're hiding but because it's

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,160
so far advanced

314
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,519
that it would be much

315
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,439
it would be beyond the cognitive

316
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,278
capabilities of us humans just as you

317
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,040
were saying

318
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,120
as per your answer for aliens

319
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,159
summarizing earth

320
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,600
it's uh the starting assumption is they

321
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,078
have similar perception

322
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,200
systems they have similar cognitive

323
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,159
capabilities and

324
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,320
that very well may not be the case let

325
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,838
me ask you about

326
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,480
staying in aliens for just a little

327
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,120
longer because i think it's a good

328
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,839
transition

329
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,240
talking about governments and human

330
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,320
societies

331
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,480
do you think if a u.s government

332
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,600
or any government was in possession

333
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:30,720
of an alien spacecraft or of information

334
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,720
related to alien spacecraft they would

335
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,519
have the capacity structurally would

336
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
they have

337
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:43,600
the the processes

338
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:45,039
would they be able to uh

339
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,879
communicate that to the public

340
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,599
effectively or would they keep it secret

341
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,799
in the room

342
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,839
and do nothing with it both of uh to try

343
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,159
to preserve

344
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,519
military secrets but also because of the

345
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,159
incompetence that's inherent to

346
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,720
bureaucracies

347
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,719
or either

348
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:07,838
we can certainly see when certain things

349
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:10,078
become declassified 25 or 50 years later

350
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,519
that there were things that the public

351
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,519
might have wanted to know

352
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,240
that were kept secret for a very long

353
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:19,440
time for reasons of

354
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,039
at least supposedly national security um

355
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,839
which is also a nice source of plausible

356
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,319
deniability for

357
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,519
um people covering their ass for doing

358
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,240
things that would be problematic um

359
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,240
other purposes

360
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,039
there are there's a scientist at

361
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,159
stanford

362
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,480
who supposedly um got some material that

363
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,919
was

364
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,000
recovered from area 51 type area did

365
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,360
analysis on it using i believe electron

366
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,078
microscopy and a couple

367
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,639
other methods and came to the idea that

368
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,039
it was a nanotech alloy

369
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,639
um that was something we didn't

370
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,120
currently have the ability to do was not

371
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,959
naturally occurring

372
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,639
so there i've heard some things and

373
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,000
again like i said i'm not going to stand

374
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,680
behind any of these because i haven't

375
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,039
done the level of study to have high

376
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,039
confidence um

377
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,518
i think what you said also about would

378
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,240
it be super low-tech alien

379
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,078
craft like would they necessarily move

380
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,680
their atoms around in space

381
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,199
or might they do something more

382
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,159
interesting than that might they be able

383
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
to

384
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,519
uh have a different relationship to the

385
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,720
concept of space or

386
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,078
information or consciousness or um

387
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,920
one of the things that the craft

388
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,000
supposedly do is not only

389
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,319
accelerate and turn in a way that looks

390
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,480
non-inertial but also disappear

391
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,720
so there's a question as to like the two

392
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,120
are not necessarily mutually exclusive

393
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,560
and it could be possible to some people

394
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,799
run a hypothesis

395
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,719
that they create intentional amounts of

396
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:56,000
exposure as an invitation

397
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,120
of a particular kind um

398
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,600
who knows interesting field we tend to

399
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,000
assume

400
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,480
like seti that's listening out for

401
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,399
aliens out there

402
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,399
i've just been recently reading more and

403
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,320
more about gravitational waves and you

404
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,839
have

405
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,639
orbiting black holes that orbit each

406
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,720
other

407
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,120
they generate ripples in space time

408
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,560
on my uh for fun at night when i lay in

409
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,839
bed i think about what it would be like

410
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,879
to ride those waves

411
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,480
when they not not the low magnitude they

412
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,480
are as it when they reach earth but

413
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,720
get closer to the black holes because

414
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,839
they'll basically be shrinking

415
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,519
and expanding us in all dimensions

416
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,360
including time so it's actually

417
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,799
ripples through space time that they

418
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,240
generate

419
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:49,599
why is it that you couldn't use that

420
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,600
it travels the speed of light

421
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
travels that it's a very weird thing to

422
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,360
say when you're

423
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,879
when you're uh morphing space-time it's

424
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,240
it's a comp it's it's

425
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,000
you could argue it's faster than the

426
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,759
speed of light

427
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,519
so if you're able to communicate by

428
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,600
to someone enough energy to generate

429
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,639
black holes and to orbit the

430
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,040
uh to force them to orbit each other why

431
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,399
not

432
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:18,879
travel as the ripples

433
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,440
in space-time whatever the hell that

434
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,439
means

435
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,120
somehow combined with wormholes so if

436
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,480
you're able to communicate through

437
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,679
like we don't think of uh gravitational

438
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,560
waves that's something you can

439
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,359
communicate with

440
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,078
because the the radio will be have to be

441
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,639
the side

442
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,559
a very large size and very dense but

443
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,480
perhaps that's it

444
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,719
you know perhaps that's one way to

445
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,240
communicate it's a very effective way

446
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,920
and that would explain

447
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,839
like we wouldn't even be able to make

448
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,958
sense of that of the physics that

449
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,120
results

450
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,198
in an alien species that's able to

451
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,039
control gravity at that scale

452
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,639
i think you just jumped up the kardashev

453
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,319
scale so far

454
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,159
you're not just harnessing the power of

455
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,079
a star but harnessing the power

456
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:07,600
of mutually rotating black holes um

457
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:10,239
i i that's way above my physics pay

458
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,159
grade to think about including

459
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,759
even uh non-rotating black hole versions

460
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,198
of trans warp travel

461
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,199
um i think

462
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,559
you know you can talk with eric more

463
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,758
about that i think he has better ideas

464
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,159
on it than i do

465
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,919
my hope for the future of humanity

466
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,159
mostly does not

467
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,599
rest in the near term on our ability to

468
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,719
get to other habitable planets

469
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,040
in time and even more than that in the

470
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,800
list of possible solutions of uh how to

471
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,120
improve human civilization

472
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,639
uh orbiting black holes is not in the on

473
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,519
the first page for you

474
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,959
and not on the first page okay i bet you

475
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,720
did not expect us to start this

476
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:52,159
conversation here

477
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,160
but i'm glad the places it went

478
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:59,359
i am excited on a much smaller scale of

479
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:02,560
uh mars europa or titan

480
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:07,838
or venus potentially having very

481
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:10,958
like bacteria like life forms just on a

482
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:13,038
on a small human level it's a little bit

483
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,839
scary but mostly really exciting

484
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:18,959
that there might be life elsewhere in

485
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:21,599
the volcanoes and the oceans

486
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,798
all around us teaming having little

487
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,038
societies

488
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,480
and whether there's properties about

489
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,318
that kind of life

490
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,798
that's somehow different than ours i

491
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,960
don't know would be more exciting if

492
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:35,038
those colonies of single cell type

493
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,640
organisms

494
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,119
what would be more exciting if they're

495
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,038
different or they're the same

496
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:45,599
if they're the same that means

497
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,720
through the rest of the universe there's

498
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,839
life forms

499
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,798
like us something like us

500
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:55,519
everywhere if they're different that's

501
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:58,839
also really exciting because there's

502
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,160
life forms everywhere they're not like

503
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,079
us

504
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,480
that's a little bit scary i don't know

505
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,399
what's scary actually

506
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,400
i think both scary and exciting no

507
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,519
matter what right

508
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,880
the idea that they could be very

509
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,480
different is philosophically very

510
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,640
interesting for us to open our

511
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,679
aperture on what life and consciousness

512
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,520
and

513
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,600
and self-replicating possibilities could

514
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,879
look like

515
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,319
the question on are they different or

516
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,440
the same obviously there's lots of life

517
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,798
here that is

518
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,558
the same in some ways and different in

519
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,319
other ways um

520
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,759
when you take the thing that we call an

521
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:32,000
invasive species is something that's

522
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,720
still pretty the same hydrocarbon based

523
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,038
thing

524
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,319
but co-evolved with co-selective

525
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:37,440
pressures in a certain environment we

526
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,798
move it to another environment it might

527
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,480
be devastating to that whole

528
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,160
ecosystem because it's just different

529
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,519
enough that it messes up the

530
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,759
self-stabilizing

531
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,599
dynamics of that ecosystem so the

532
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,720
question of

533
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,639
are they would they be different

534
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,279
in ways where we could still figure out

535
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,080
a way to inhabit a biosphere together

536
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,879
or fundamentally not fundamentally the

537
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,480
uh

538
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,400
nature of how they operate and the

539
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,200
nature of how we operate would be

540
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,038
incommensurable is a deep question well

541
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,558
we offline talked about

542
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:13,119
mimetic theory right it seems like

543
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,440
if there were sufficiently different

544
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,199
where we would not even we can coexist

545
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,000
on different planes

546
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,960
uh it seems like a a good thing if we're

547
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,279
close enough

548
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,798
together to where we'd be competing then

549
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,399
it's you're getting into the world of

550
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,519
viruses and pathogens and all those

551
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,038
kinds of things

552
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,079
to where we would uh one of us would die

553
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,200
off quickly

554
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:38,558
through basically mass murder

555
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,960
without even even accidentally

556
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,879
even accidentally if we just had a

557
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,919
self-replicating single-celled kind of

558
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,360
creature

559
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,360
that happened to

560
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,759
not work well for the hydrocarbon life

561
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,079
that was here that god introduced

562
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,519
because it either output something that

563
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,879
was toxic or utilized up the same

564
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,079
resource too quickly and it just

565
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,520
replicated faster and mutated faster

566
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,960
it wouldn't be a um memetic theory

567
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,798
conflict theory kind of harm it would

568
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,038
just be uh

569
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,639
a von neumann machine a self-replicating

570
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,240
machine that was

571
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,320
fundamentally incompatible with these

572
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,880
kinds of self-replicating systems

573
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,399
with faster ooda loops for one final

574
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,520
time putting your alien

575
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,120
slash god hat on and you look at human

576
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,480
civilization

577
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:28,000
the do you think uh about the 7.8

578
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,319
billion people on earth

579
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,319
as individual little creatures

580
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,439
individual little organisms

581
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:39,200
or do you think of us as uh

582
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,440
one organism with the collective

583
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,120
intelligence

584
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,279
what's the proper framework through

585
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,119
which to analyze it

586
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,319
again as an alien so that i know where

587
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,239
you're coming from would you have asked

588
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,000
the question the same way

589
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,279
before the industrial revolution before

590
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,640
the agricultural revolution when there

591
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,000
were half a billion people and no

592
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,000
telecommunications connecting them

593
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,719
i would indeed ask the question the same

594
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:07,759
way but i would be less confident about

595
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,759
uh about your conclusions

596
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,839
um it would be an actually more

597
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,519
interesting way to ask the question at

598
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,399
that time but i was nevertheless asked

599
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,720
it the same way

600
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,840
yes well let's go back further and

601
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,919
smaller then

602
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:23,119
rather than just a single human or the

603
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,400
entire human species let's look at

604
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:29,918
uh in a relatively isolated tribe

605
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,360
yes in the relatively isolated probably

606
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,799
sub dunbar number sub

607
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:38,000
150 people tribe do i look at that

608
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,759
as one entity where evolution is

609
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,279
selecting for based on group selection

610
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:46,480
or do i think of it as 150 individuals

611
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,158
that are interacting in some way

612
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,919
well could those individuals exist

613
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,000
without the group

614
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:57,120
no the

615
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,839
evolutionary adaptiveness of humans

616
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,399
was involved critically group selection

617
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,720
and

618
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,559
individual humans alone trying to figure

619
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,440
out stone tools and protection and

620
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,720
whatever

621
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,240
uh aren't what was selected for

622
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,839
and so i think the ore is the wrong

623
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,880
frame i think it's

624
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,319
individuals are affecting the

625
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,640
group that they're a part of they're

626
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,798
also dependent upon and being affected

627
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,200
by the group that they're part of

628
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,480
and so this now starts to get in deep

629
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,120
into political theories

630
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,558
also which is theories that orient

631
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,399
towards the collective at different

632
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,240
scales whether a tribal scale or an

633
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,440
empire or nation state or something

634
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,038
and ones that orient towards the

635
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,120
individual liberalism and stuff like

636
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:43,038
that and i think there's very obvious

637
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,279
failure modes on both sides

638
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,640
and so the relationship between them is

639
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,000
more interesting to me than either of

640
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,120
them the relationship between the

641
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,798
individual and the collective and the

642
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,558
question around how to have a virtuous

643
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,400
process between those so

644
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,158
a good social system would be one where

645
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,440
the organism of the individual and the

646
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,400
organism

647
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,080
of the group of individuals is they're

648
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,280
both synergistic to each other so what

649
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,519
is best for the individuals and what's

650
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,720
best for the whole is aligned

651
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,720
but there is nevertheless an individual

652
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,679
they're not it's uh it's a matter of

653
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,279
degrees i suppose but

654
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:21,200
what is uh what defines a human

655
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:23,519
more the the social

656
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
network within the which they've been

657
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,480
brought up

658
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
through which they've developed their

659
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,480
intelligence or is it their

660
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,120
own sovereign individual self

661
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,079
like what's your intuition of how much

662
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,199
not just for

663
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:41,839
evolutionary survival but as

664
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,400
intellectual beings how much do we need

665
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,000
others

666
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,400
for our development yeah i think we have

667
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,278
a weird sense of this today

668
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,120
relative to most previous periods of

669
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,599
sapient history

670
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,798
i think the vast majority of sapient

671
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,839
history is tribal

672
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,038
like depending upon your early

673
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,038
human model two or three hundred

674
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:06,079
thousand years of

675
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,599
homo sapiens and little tribes where

676
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,158
they depended upon that tribe for

677
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,199
survival and excommunication from the

678
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,400
tribe was

679
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,319
was fatal i think they and our whole

680
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,679
evolutionary genetic history is in that

681
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,480
environment and the amount of time we've

682
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,519
been out of it is

683
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,240
is relatively so tiny and then

684
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,918
we still depended upon extended families

685
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,880
and local communities more

686
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,759
and the big kind of giant market complex

687
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,240
where

688
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,759
i can provide something to the market to

689
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,880
get money to be able to get other things

690
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:36,319
from the market where it seems like i

691
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,240
don't need anyone it's almost like

692
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,278
disintermediating our sense of need even

693
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,558
though

694
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,359
even though you're in my ability to talk

695
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:44,879
to each other

696
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,959
using these mics and the phones that we

697
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,559
coordinated on took millions of people

698
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,000
over six continents to be able to run

699
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:51,359
the supply chains it made all the stuff

700
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,720
that we depend on but we don't notice

701
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,639
that we depend upon them they all seem

702
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,558
fungible

703
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,080
um if you take a baby obviously that you

704
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:00,879
didn't even get to a baby without a mom

705
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,399
was it dependent

706
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,640
or dependent upon each other right

707
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,240
without two two parents at minimum and

708
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,120
they depended upon other people

709
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,120
but if we take that baby and we put it

710
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:12,798
out in the wild it obviously dies

711
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,239
so if we let it grow up for a little

712
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:15,759
while the minimum amount of time where

713
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,200
it starts to have some autonomy and then

714
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,038
we put it out in the wild and if this

715
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,640
has happened a few times

716
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:25,278
it doesn't learn language and

717
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,559
it doesn't learn the artic the small

718
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,839
motor articulation

719
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,519
that we learn it doesn't learn the

720
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,158
type of consciousness that we end up

721
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:37,200
having that is socialized

722
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:41,039
so i think i think we take for granted

723
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,558
how much conditioning affects us um

724
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,558
is it possible that uh

725
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,400
it affects basically 99.9

726
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,319
or maybe the whole thing the whole thing

727
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,600
is the connection between us humans

728
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,158
and that were we're uh no better than

729
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,038
apes

730
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,520
without our human connections because

731
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,640
that

732
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,319
that thinking of it that way

733
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,080
forces us to think very differently

734
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,359
about human society and how to progress

735
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,839
forward

736
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,639
if the connections are fundamental i

737
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,399
just

738
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,840
have to object to the no better than

739
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,519
apes because better here i think you

740
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,879
mean a specific thing which means have

741
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,558
capacities that are fundamentally

742
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,120
different then i think apes also depend

743
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,319
upon

744
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:25,599
troops um yes and

745
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,079
i i think the idea of humans as better

746
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:28,959
than

747
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,558
nature in some kind of um ethical sense

748
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,038
ends up having heaps of problems we'll

749
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,720
table that we can come back to it but we

750
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:36,480
say what is unique about homo sapien

751
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,679
capacity relative to the other animals

752
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,000
we currently

753
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,360
inhabit the biosphere with and i'm

754
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,798
saying it that way because there were

755
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,359
other early hominids that had some of

756
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:48,960
these capacities

757
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,879
we believe our tool creation and our

758
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,000
language creation and our coordination

759
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,000
are all kind of the results

760
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,759
of a certain type of capacity for

761
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,079
abstraction

762
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,599
and other animals will use tools but

763
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,199
they don't evolve the tools they use

764
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,199
they keep using the same types of tools

765
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,919
that they basically can find

766
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,519
so a chimp will notice that a rock can

767
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,360
cut a vine that it wants to and it'll

768
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:09,918
even notice that a sharper rock will cut

769
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,839
it better

770
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,360
and experientially it'll use the sharper

771
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,558
rock and if you even give it a knife

772
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,879
it'll probably use the knife because

773
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:19,519
it's experiencing the effectiveness

774
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,840
but it doesn't make stone tools because

775
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,200
that requires understanding why one is

776
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,000
sharper than the other what is the

777
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,240
abstract

778
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
principle called sharpness to then be

779
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,798
able to invent a sharper thing

780
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,519
that same abstraction makes language and

781
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:35,839
the ability for abstract representation

782
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,359
which makes the ability to coordinate in

783
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:39,599
a more

784
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:41,439
advanced set of ways so i do think our

785
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,439
ability to coordinate with each other is

786
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,558
pretty fundamental to the selection of

787
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,960
what we are

788
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:49,200
as a species i wonder if that

789
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,960
coordination that connection

790
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,880
is actually the thing that gives birth

791
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,840
to consciousness that gives birth to

792
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,120
well let's start with self awareness

793
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,319
more like theory of mind

794
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:01,759
theory of mind yeah you know i i i

795
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:02,000
suppose there's experiments that show

796
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,000
that

797
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,278
there's other mammals that have a very

798
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,839
crude theory of mind

799
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,440
i'm not sure maybe dogs something like

800
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,240
that but actually dogs probably has to

801
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,080
do with that they co-evolved with humans

802
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,079
see it'd be interesting if that theory

803
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:19,519
of mind is what leads

804
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,798
to consciousness in the way we think

805
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,960
about it

806
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,798
is the richness of the subjective

807
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,919
experience that is consciousness

808
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:30,798
i have a inkling sense that that only

809
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,520
exists because we're social creatures

810
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:35,278
that that doesn't come uh with this with

811
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,240
the hardware and the software any in the

812
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,440
beginning

813
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,759
that's like uh that's learned

814
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,798
as an effective uh tool for

815
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:46,398
communication almost like we we think

816
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,798
we i think we think uh that

817
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:53,918
consciousness is fundamental

818
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:56,639
and uh maybe it's not

819
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,000
there's a a bunch of folks kind of

820
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,360
criticize the idea that the

821
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,119
illusion of consciousness is

822
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:05,199
consciousness that

823
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:08,158
it is just a facade we use to

824
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,919
to uh help us construct theories of mind

825
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,240
you almost put yourself in the world

826
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,520
as a subjective being and that

827
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,440
experience you want to

828
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,839
richly experience it as an individual

829
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,038
person so that i could

830
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,398
empathize with your experience i find

831
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,158
that notion compelling

832
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,599
mostly because it allows you to then

833
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,200
create robots

834
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:31,199
that become conscious not by being quote

835
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,759
unquote conscious but by

836
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,399
just learning to fake it till they make

837
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,319
it

838
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:40,000
is uh creative you know present a facade

839
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,720
of consciousness

840
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,599
and with the with the task of uh making

841
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,319
that facade

842
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:47,918
very convincing to us humans and thereby

843
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,599
it will become conscious

844
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,600
have a sense ins that in some way

845
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,798
that will make them conscious if they're

846
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,918
sufficiently

847
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:57,918
convincing to humans

848
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,880
is there some element of that that you

849
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,880
uh

850
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:09,359
do you find convincing this is a

851
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,359
much harder set of questions

852
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:13,278
and deep end of the pool than starting

853
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:17,759
with the aliens was

854
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:19,359
um we went from aliens to consciousness

855
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,960
this is not the trajectory i was

856
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,558
expecting nor you

857
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,840
but let us walk a while we we can walk a

858
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,119
while and i don't think we will

859
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:32,398
do it justice so what do we mean by

860
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,519
consciousness versus conscious

861
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,439
self-reflective

862
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:36,879
awareness what do we mean by awareness

863
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,038
qualia

864
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,480
theory of mind there's a lot of terms

865
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,839
that we think of as slightly

866
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:47,360
different things and um

867
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,359
subjectivity first person

868
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,759
i don't remember exactly the quote but i

869
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,440
remember when

870
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,158
reading when sam harris wrote the book

871
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,679
free will and then dennett critiqued it

872
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,840
and then there was some writing back and

873
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,919
forth between the two because normally

874
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:05,839
they're on the same side

875
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,320
of kind of arguing for critical thinking

876
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,000
and

877
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,960
logical fallacies and philosophy of

878
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,480
science against um supernatural ideas

879
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,240
and here dennett believed there is

880
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,000
something like free will he is a

881
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,839
determinist compatibilist but no

882
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,119
consciousness an ex a radical

883
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,398
limitativist

884
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,079
and sam was saying no there is

885
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:25,278
consciousness but there's no free will

886
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,000
and that's like the most

887
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:29,359
fundamental kinds of axiomatic senses

888
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,319
they disagreed on but neither of them

889
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:31,278
could say it was because the other one

890
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,240
didn't understand the philosophy of

891
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,319
science

892
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,839
or logical fallacies and and they kind

893
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,119
of spoke past each other and at the end

894
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:38,240
if i remember correctly sam said

895
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,278
something that i thought was quite

896
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,000
insightful which was to the effect of it

897
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:43,599
seems it

898
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,599
because they weren't making any progress

899
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,038
in shared understanding it seems that we

900
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,480
simply have different intuitions about

901
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:52,398
this

902
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,720
and what you could see was that

903
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:56,079
what the words meant right at the level

904
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,440
of symbol grounding

905
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,720
might be quite different one of them

906
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,720
might have had

907
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,319
deeply different enough life experiences

908
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,919
that what is being referenced and then

909
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,678
also different associations of what the

910
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,200
words mean this is why

911
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,200
when trying to address these things

912
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,960
charles sanders purse said the first

913
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,798
philosophy has to be semiotics

914
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,038
because if you don't get semiotics right

915
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,639
we end up importing different ideas and

916
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,079
bad ideas right into the nature of the

917
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,960
language that we're using

918
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,278
and then it's very hard to do

919
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,159
epistemology or ontology together

920
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,519
uh so i'm saying this to say why i don't

921
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,799
think we're gonna get very far is i

922
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,519
think we would have to

923
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:32,240
go very slowly in terms of defining what

924
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,960
we mean by

925
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,519
words and fundamental concepts well and

926
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,319
also allowing our minds to drift

927
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,759
together for time so that our

928
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,200
definitions of these terms

929
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,839
align i think there's some

930
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,360
there's a beauty that some people enjoy

931
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,639
with sam

932
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:56,558
that he is quite stubborn

933
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:59,360
on his definitions of terms without

934
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:01,038
often clearly revealing that definition

935
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,038
so in his mind he can

936
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,319
like you could sense that he can deeply

937
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:07,359
understand what he means

938
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,359
exactly by term like free will and

939
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:12,000
consciousness and you're right he's very

940
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,439
he's very specific in in fascinating

941
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,240
ways that

942
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,320
not only does he think that free will is

943
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,599
an illusion

944
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:24,079
he thinks he's able not thinks he says

945
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,839
he's able to just remove himself from

946
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,599
the experience of free will

947
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:32,720
and just be like for minutes at a time

948
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,719
hours at a time like

949
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,519
really experience as if he has no free

950
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,960
will like he's a

951
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:44,000
leaf flowing down the river

952
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,679
and given that he's very sure that

953
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,558
consciousness is fundamental

954
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,278
so here's a this conscious leaf that's

955
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:54,079
subjectively experiencing the floating

956
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,919
and yet there's no ability to control

957
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:59,038
and make any decisions for its

958
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,080
for itself it's only a um

959
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,359
the decisions have all been made

960
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,319
there's some aspect to which the

961
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,439
terminology there perhaps is the problem

962
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:10,078
so that's a particular kind of

963
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,838
meditative experience and

964
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,440
the people in the vedantic tradition and

965
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,039
some of the buddhist traditions

966
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,398
thousands of years ago described similar

967
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,039
experiences and somewhat similar

968
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,638
conclusions

969
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:23,759
some slightly different there are other

970
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,960
types of phenomenal experience

971
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,560
that uh are the phenomenal experience of

972
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,800
pure agency

973
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,599
and you know like the the catholic

974
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,119
theologian

975
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,200
but evolutionary theorist terra

976
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,320
deshardon describes this

977
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,598
and that rather than a creator agent god

978
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,280
in the beginning there's a creative

979
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,039
impulse or a creative process

980
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,879
and he was would go into a type of

981
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,559
meditation that identified as the pure

982
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,559
essence of that kind of creative process

983
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:55,039
and i think the types of experiences

984
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:56,480
we've had and then one the types of

985
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,400
experience we've had make a big deal to

986
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,440
the nature of how we do symbol grounding

987
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,000
the other thing is the types of

988
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,440
experiences we have can't not

989
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,119
be interpreted through our existing

990
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,480
interpretive frames

991
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,240
and most of the time our interpretive

992
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,199
frames are unknown even to us some of

993
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,319
them

994
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:16,078
and so so this is a tricky

995
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,359
this is a tricky topic um so i guess

996
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,440
there's a bunch of directions we could

997
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:20,319
go with it but i want to come back to

998
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,079
what the

999
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,240
um impulse was that was interesting

1000
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,200
around what is consciousness and how

1001
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,519
does it relate to us

1002
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,319
as social beings and how does it relate

1003
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:30,320
to

1004
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,599
the possibility of consciousness with it

1005
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,760
ais right

1006
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,720
you're keeping us on track which is uh

1007
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,880
which is wonderful

1008
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:40,000
you're a wonderful hiking partner okay

1009
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,838
yes let's go back to the initial impulse

1010
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,760
of uh what is consciousness and how does

1011
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:47,279
the social impulse connected

1012
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,480
consciousness is consciousness a

1013
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,720
consequence of that social connection

1014
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,240
i'm gonna state a position and not argue

1015
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,239
it because it's honestly

1016
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:57,838
like it's a long hard thing to argue and

1017
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,078
we can totally do it another time if you

1018
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:00,078
want

1019
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,519
i don't subscribe to consciousness as an

1020
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,480
emergent property

1021
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,480
of biology or neural networks

1022
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,838
obviously a lot of people do obviously

1023
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,400
the

1024
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,838
the philosophy of science orients um

1025
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,200
towards that

1026
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:24,480
in not absolutely but

1027
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:27,679
largely um

1028
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,240
i think of the nature of first person

1029
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,039
the universe of first person of of

1030
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,399
qualia

1031
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:38,480
as uh experience

1032
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,039
sensation desire emotion phenomenology

1033
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,039
the but

1034
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,639
the felt sense not the we we say emotion

1035
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:45,039
and we think of a neurochemical pattern

1036
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,039
or an endocrine pattern

1037
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,320
but all of the physical stuff the third

1038
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,800
person stuff has

1039
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,880
position and momentum and charge and

1040
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,680
stuff like that that is

1041
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,760
measurable repeatable i think of the

1042
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:01,039
nature of first person and third person

1043
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,359
as ontologically orthogonal to each

1044
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:03,599
other

1045
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,920
not reducible to each other they're

1046
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,160
different kinds of stuff

1047
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,519
and so i think about the evolution of

1048
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,598
third person that we're quite

1049
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,358
used to thinking about from subatomic

1050
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,599
particles to atoms to molecules to

1051
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,440
on and on i think about a similar kind

1052
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,280
of and corresponding evolution in the

1053
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,280
domain of first person from

1054
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,359
the way whitehead talked about kind of

1055
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,280
prehension or proto-qualia

1056
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,559
in earlier phases of self-organization

1057
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,960
into higher orders of it and that

1058
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,559
there's

1059
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,960
correspondence but that neither like the

1060
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,559
like the idealists do we reduce third

1061
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,599
person to first person which is what

1062
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:37,599
idealists do

1063
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,240
or neither like the physical lists or do

1064
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,838
we reduce first person to third person

1065
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:45,519
obviously baum talked about uh

1066
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,119
an implicat order that was deeper then

1067
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:47,759
and gave rise to the explicat order of

1068
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,760
both

1069
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,200
um nagel talks about something like that

1070
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,880
i have a slightly different

1071
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,559
sense of that but again i'll just kind

1072
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,000
of not argue how that occurs for a

1073
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,078
moment and say

1074
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,119
so rather than say does consciousness

1075
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,839
emerge from

1076
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,640
i'll talk about do higher capacities of

1077
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:07,920
consciousness

1078
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:10,000
emerge in relationship with so it's not

1079
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,240
first person as a category emerging from

1080
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,760
third person but increased complexity

1081
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,239
within the nature of first person and

1082
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,880
third person co-evolving

1083
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,479
um do i think that it seems relatively

1084
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,519
likely that more advanced neural

1085
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,559
networks have

1086
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,159
deeper phenomenology more complex where

1087
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,519
it goes just from

1088
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:32,879
basic sensation to emotion to

1089
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,800
social awareness to abstract cognition

1090
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,680
to self-reflexive abstract cognition

1091
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,119
yeah

1092
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,399
but i wouldn't say that's the emergence

1093
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,240
of consciousness i would say it's

1094
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,760
increased complexity within the domain

1095
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:43,199
of first person corresponding to

1096
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,640
increased complexity

1097
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,399
and the correspondence should not

1098
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,920
automatically be seen as causal

1099
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,760
we can get into the arguments for why

1100
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,960
that often is the case

1101
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:56,079
so would i say that obviously the

1102
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,240
sapien brain is pretty unique and

1103
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,359
a single sapient now has that right even

1104
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,358
if it took

1105
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,519
sapiens evolving in tribes based on

1106
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,519
group selection to make that brain

1107
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:06,960
so the group made it now that brain is

1108
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:08,719
there now if i take the

1109
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,559
single person with that brain out of the

1110
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:11,919
group and try to raise them in a box

1111
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,639
they'll still not be very interesting

1112
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,079
even with the brain

1113
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,000
but the brain does give hardware

1114
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,119
capacities that if conditioned in

1115
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,280
relationship um can have interesting

1116
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,960
things emerge so do i think that

1117
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,960
the the human biology

1118
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,400
types of human consciousness and types

1119
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,000
of social interaction

1120
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,079
all co-emerged and co-evolved yes

1121
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,320
as a small aside as you're talking about

1122
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,880
the biology let me comment that i spent

1123
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,160
this is what i do this is what i do with

1124
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,760
my life this is why i will never

1125
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,239
accomplish anything as i spent

1126
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,200
much of the morning trying to calc

1127
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:49,199
trying to

1128
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,519
do research on how many computations the

1129
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,118
brain performs and how many um

1130
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:56,000
how much energy it uses versus the

1131
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:59,838
state-of-the-art cpus and gpus

1132
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,559
now arriving at uh about 20 quadrillion

1133
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:03,759
so that's two to the 10 to the 16

1134
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,318
computations so

1135
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,680
synaptic firings per second that the

1136
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:10,239
brain does

1137
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,000
and that's about a million times faster

1138
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:15,279
than the uh

1139
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,440
uh the let's say the 20 thread

1140
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,000
state of the arts intel cpu the uh

1141
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,880
the 10th generation and then there's

1142
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,920
similar calculation for the for the uh

1143
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,358
for the gpu and all ended up also trying

1144
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,800
to compute that it takes

1145
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:34,159
10 watts to run the brain about and then

1146
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,599
what does that mean in terms of calories

1147
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:38,960
per day kilocalories

1148
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:42,800
that's about to fit for an average

1149
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,400
uh human brain that's 250 to 300

1150
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,000
calories a day

1151
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,400
and so it ended up being a calculation

1152
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,920
where you're doing about

1153
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,240
20 quadrillion calculations

1154
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,599
uh that that are fueled by something

1155
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,879
like depending on your diet

1156
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:04,160
three bananas so three bananas results

1157
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,960
in uh in a computation that's about a

1158
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,279
million times

1159
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,559
more powerful than the current stadiak

1160
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,400
computers

1161
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,239
now let's take that one step further

1162
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,639
there's some assumptions built in there

1163
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,598
the assumption is that one what the

1164
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,799
brain is doing is

1165
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,400
just computation two the the

1166
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,599
relevant computations or synaptic

1167
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,680
firings and that there's nothing other

1168
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,720
than synaptic firings that we have to

1169
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,838
to factor so um

1170
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,639
i'm forgetting his name right now

1171
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:30,639
there's a very uh

1172
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,640
famous neuroscientist at stanford just

1173
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,839
passed away recently who

1174
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:37,679
did a lot of the pioneering work on

1175
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:39,920
glial cells and

1176
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,118
showed that his assessment glial cells

1177
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,960
did a huge amount of the thinking

1178
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,720
not just neurons and it opened up this

1179
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,400
entirely different field of like what

1180
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,239
the brain is and what consciousness is

1181
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,559
you look at demacio's work on embodied

1182
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:52,000
cognition and how much of what

1183
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:53,279
we would consider consciousness or

1184
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,719
feeling is happening outside of the

1185
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,040
nervous system completely

1186
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,399
happening in endocrine process involving

1187
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:00,318
lots of other cells and signal

1188
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,760
communication

1189
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:03,838
you talk to somebody like penrose who

1190
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,280
you've had on the show and even though

1191
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:06,960
the penrose hammerhoff

1192
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,800
conjecture's probably not right is there

1193
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,318
something like that that might be the

1194
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,519
case where we're actually having to look

1195
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,639
at stuff happening at the level of

1196
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,880
quantum computation of microtubules

1197
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:18,000
i'm not arguing for any of those i'm

1198
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,680
arguing that

1199
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,039
we don't know how big the unknown

1200
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,358
unknown set is

1201
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,119
well at the very least this is this has

1202
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:26,159
become like an infomercial for the human

1203
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,599
brain

1204
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:31,920
at the very but wait there's more

1205
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,079
at the very least the three bananas buys

1206
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,559
you a million times that's the very last

1207
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,240
that's very

1208
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,920
impressive and then you could have uh

1209
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,679
and then the synaptic firings we're

1210
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,318
referring to is strictly the electrical

1211
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:43,358
signals

1212
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:44,880
that could be the mechanical

1213
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:46,400
transmission information like this

1214
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,960
chemical transmission of information

1215
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,639
there's

1216
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,720
there's all kinds of other stuff going

1217
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,318
on and then there's memory that's built

1218
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,399
in that's also all tied in

1219
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:55,358
not to mention which i'm learning more

1220
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,559
and more about

1221
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:00,239
it's not just about the uh the neurons

1222
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:01,519
it's also about the immune system

1223
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,078
that's somehow helping with the

1224
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:06,159
computation so it's the entirety

1225
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,720
and the entire body is helping with the

1226
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:10,559
computation so the three bananas

1227
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,078
it could buy you a lot it could buy you

1228
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,679
a lot

1229
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:19,200
but on the topic of sort of uh

1230
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:22,879
the greater degrees of complexity

1231
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:25,279
emerging in consciousness i think

1232
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,000
few things are as beautiful and

1233
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,240
inspiring

1234
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,480
as taking a step outside of the human

1235
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:33,838
brain just looking at systems

1236
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:37,760
where simple rules create

1237
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:42,078
incredible complexity uh not create

1238
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,680
incredible complexity emerges so

1239
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,160
one of the simplest things to do that

1240
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:49,519
with is the cellular automata

1241
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:52,239
and there's i don't know what it is and

1242
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:54,159
maybe you can speak to it

1243
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:57,519
we can certainly we will certainly talk

1244
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:57,519
about the implications of this but

1245
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,280
there's so few things that are as

1246
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:06,078
awe-inspiring to me

1247
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,680
as knowing the rules of a system and not

1248
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,240
being able to predict what the heck it

1249
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,719
looks like and it creates incredibly

1250
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:14,239
beautiful complexity that when zoomed

1251
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,719
out on

1252
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:18,000
looks like there's actual organisms

1253
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:22,318
doing things

1254
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:26,880
that are much uh that operate on scale

1255
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:28,880
much higher than the underlying

1256
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,920
mechanism so with cellular automata

1257
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,920
that's cells that

1258
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,240
are born and die born or die and they

1259
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,599
only know about each other's neighbors

1260
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:37,838
and there's simple rules that govern

1261
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,280
that interaction of birth and death

1262
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:41,920
and then they create at scale organisms

1263
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,240
that

1264
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,440
look like they take up hundreds or

1265
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:47,598
thousands of cells

1266
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,119
and they're moving they're moving around

1267
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,720
they're communicating they're sending

1268
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:54,240
signals to each other

1269
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:57,279
and you forget at moments at a time

1270
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,078
before you remember that the simple

1271
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,400
rules

1272
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,680
on cells is all that it took to create

1273
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,920
that

1274
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:08,719
that's it's sad

1275
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,079
in that we can't come up with a simple

1276
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,078
description of that system

1277
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,800
that generalizes the behavior of the

1278
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,639
large organisms

1279
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,160
we can only come up we can only hope to

1280
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,039
come up with the thing the fundamental

1281
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:24,879
physics

1282
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:27,279
or the fundamental rules of that system

1283
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,960
i suppose it's sad that we can't predict

1284
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,119
everything we know about the mathematics

1285
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,039
of those systems it seems like we can't

1286
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,358
really in a nice way like economics

1287
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,880
tries to do to predict how this whole

1288
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:39,358
thing will unroll

1289
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,400
but it's beautiful because how simple it

1290
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:45,679
is underneath it all

1291
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,760
so what do you make of

1292
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,719
the emergence of complexity from simple

1293
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,680
rules

1294
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:53,118
what the hell is that about yeah well we

1295
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:55,838
can see that something like

1296
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,760
flocking behavior the murmuration can

1297
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:59,599
can be computer-coded it's not a very

1298
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,599
hard set of rules to be able to see

1299
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,039
some of those really amazing types of

1300
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,838
complexity

1301
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:07,039
and the whole field of complexity

1302
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:09,199
science and some of the

1303
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,400
sub disciplines like stigma g are are

1304
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,118
studying how

1305
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,280
following fairly simple responses to a

1306
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:16,800
pheromone signal do ant colonies do this

1307
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,000
amazing thing where the

1308
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,680
what you might describe is the

1309
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,800
organizational computational capacity of

1310
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,199
the colony

1311
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,240
is so profound relative to what each

1312
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:27,759
individual

1313
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:29,679
ants is doing i am not um

1314
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,200
anywhere near as well versed in the

1315
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:32,719
cutting edge of cellular automata as i

1316
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:34,399
would like unfortunately i

1317
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:36,000
in terms of topics that i would like to

1318
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,720
get to and haven't like

1319
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,559
et's more wolfram's a new kind of

1320
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:43,118
science i have only

1321
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:45,440
skimmed and read reviews of and not read

1322
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,960
the whole thing or his newer work since

1323
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,760
um but his idea of the four

1324
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,199
basic kind of categories of uh emergent

1325
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,720
phenomena that can come from cellular

1326
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:57,439
automata and that one of them is kind of

1327
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,879
interesting and looks a lot like

1328
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,679
complexity rather than just chaos or

1329
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,800
homogeneity or

1330
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:06,799
self-termination or whatever

1331
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,079
i think this is very interesting

1332
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,279
it does not instantly make me think that

1333
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,119
uh biology

1334
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,280
is operating on a similarly small set of

1335
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,680
rules and or the human consciousnesses

1336
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,359
i'm

1337
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:26,960
i'm not that reductionistly oriented and

1338
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:28,719
um so if you look

1339
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,318
at say santa fe institute one of the

1340
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,078
co-founders stuart kaufman

1341
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,920
um his work he should you should really

1342
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,440
get him on your show so

1343
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,920
a lot of the questions that you like one

1344
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,358
of kaufman's you know more recent books

1345
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,559
after investigations and some of the

1346
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,318
real fundamental stuff was called

1347
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,319
reinventing the sacred and it had to do

1348
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,558
with some of these exact questions

1349
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:47,519
uh in kind of non-reductionist approach

1350
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,800
but that is not

1351
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:52,960
just silly hippie-ism um and he was very

1352
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,599
interested in highly non-ergotic systems

1353
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,760
where

1354
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,119
you couldn't take a lot of behavior over

1355
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,079
a small period of time and predict what

1356
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,358
the behavior of

1357
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,680
subsets over a longer period of time

1358
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,759
would do um

1359
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,199
and then going further someone who spent

1360
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,680
some time at santa fe institute and then

1361
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:06,960
kind of

1362
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:08,879
made a whole new field that you should

1363
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,358
have on dave snowden

1364
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,720
who some people call the father of

1365
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:14,960
anthrocomplexity or what is the

1366
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:17,598
complexity unique to humans

1367
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:19,519
uh he says something to the effect of

1368
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,640
that modeling humans as termites really

1369
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:24,000
doesn't cut it like

1370
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,400
we we don't respond exactly identically

1371
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,639
to

1372
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,559
the same pheromone stimulus using stigma

1373
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:29,838
g like it works for flows of traffic and

1374
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:31,920
some very simple human

1375
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:33,358
behaviors but it really doesn't work for

1376
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,880
trying to make sense of the sistine

1377
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,440
chapel and picasso and general

1378
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,000
relativity creation and stuff like that

1379
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,358
and it's because the the termites are

1380
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,599
not doing abstraction

1381
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,519
forecasting deep into the future and

1382
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,119
making choices now based on forecasts of

1383
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:48,719
the future not just adaptive signals in

1384
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,440
the moment an evolutionary code from

1385
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,279
history

1386
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,200
that's really different right like

1387
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,920
making choices now that can factor deep

1388
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:59,118
modeling of the future

1389
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,358
and with humans our uniqueness

1390
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,160
one to the next in terms of response to

1391
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:04,400
similar stimuli

1392
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,838
is much higher than it is with a termite

1393
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,200
um

1394
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:08,799
one of the interesting things there is

1395
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,159
that their uniqueness is extremely low

1396
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,720
they're basically fungible within a

1397
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,318
class

1398
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:13,679
right the different classes but within a

1399
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,639
class they're basically fungible and

1400
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:19,759
their system uses that very high numbers

1401
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:22,239
and lots of um loss right like

1402
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,520
that the termite feels that way don't

1403
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,919
you think we humans are deceiving

1404
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,838
ourselves about our uniqueness perhaps

1405
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,440
it doesn't just isn't there some sense

1406
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:30,159
in which this emerges just creates

1407
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,760
different

1408
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,440
higher and higher levels of abstraction

1409
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,000
where every at every layer

1410
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,679
each organism feels unique is that

1411
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,358
possible

1412
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,279
that we're all equally dumb but at

1413
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:44,159
different scales no i think uniqueness

1414
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,359
is evolving

1415
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:48,558
i think that hydrogen atoms are more

1416
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:51,279
similar to each other

1417
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,880
than cells of the same type are and i

1418
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,559
think that cells are more similar to

1419
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,240
each other than humans are

1420
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:00,160
i think that highly k k-selected species

1421
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:01,199
are more unique than our selected

1422
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:02,799
species so they're different

1423
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:04,399
evolutionary processes

1424
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,119
they are selected species where you have

1425
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,760
a whole a lot of death

1426
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,400
and very high birth rates you're not

1427
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:14,000
looking for

1428
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,000
as much individuality within

1429
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,440
or individual possible expression to

1430
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,039
cover the evolutionary search space

1431
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,440
within an individual you're looking at

1432
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:23,838
it more in terms of a numbers game

1433
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,480
um so yeah i would say there's probably

1434
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:26,639
more

1435
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,240
difference between one orca and the next

1436
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:30,719
than there is between one cape

1437
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:32,239
buffalo and the next given that it will

1438
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:32,879
be interesting to get your thoughts

1439
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,919
about

1440
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,318
mimetic theory where we're imitating

1441
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,318
each other

1442
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:43,119
in the context of this idea of

1443
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:46,159
uniqueness

1444
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,440
how much truth is there to that uh how

1445
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:51,440
compelling is this

1446
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:55,679
world view to you of gerardian

1447
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:57,039
mimetic theory of desire where

1448
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:59,440
maybe you can explain it from your

1449
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:02,079
perspective but it seems like imitating

1450
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,880
each other is the fundamental

1451
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,480
property of the behavior of human

1452
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,480
civilization

1453
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,240
well imitation is not unique to humans

1454
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:14,240
right monkeys imitate

1455
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:15,679
um so a certain amount of learning

1456
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:18,479
through observing

1457
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:19,598
is not unique to humans humans do more

1458
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,838
of it

1459
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,440
uh it's actually kind of worth speaking

1460
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:26,719
to this for a moment

1461
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:29,440
um monkeys can learn new behaviors new

1462
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:30,879
we've even seen teaching an ape sign

1463
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,480
language and then the ape teaching other

1464
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,559
apes sign language

1465
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,760
um so that's a kind of mimesis right

1466
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:40,319
kind of learning through imitation

1467
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,240
and that needs to happen if they need to

1468
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,159
learn or develop capacities that are not

1469
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:45,919
just coded by their genetics right

1470
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:47,199
so within the same genome they're

1471
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,639
learning new things based on the

1472
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:50,719
environment

1473
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,838
and so based on someone else learn

1474
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:55,039
something first and

1475
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:57,279
so let's pick it up uh how

1476
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:58,880
much a creature is the result of just

1477
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,480
its genetic programming and how much

1478
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,119
it's learning is a very interesting

1479
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,280
question and i think this is a place

1480
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,800
where humans really show up radically

1481
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,599
different than everything else

1482
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,519
and you can see it in the in the neonate

1483
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,720
how long we're basically

1484
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:16,639
fetal um that a

1485
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,639
the closest ancestors to us if we look

1486
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,480
at a chimp a chimp can

1487
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,480
hold on to its mother's fur while she

1488
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,318
moves around day one

1489
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,400
and obviously we see horses up and

1490
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:28,639
walking within 20 minutes

1491
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,318
the fact that it takes a human a year to

1492
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:31,759
be walking and it takes horse 20 minutes

1493
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:33,358
and you say how many multiples of 20

1494
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,520
minutes go into a year like that's a

1495
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,119
long period of helplessness

1496
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,838
that it wouldn't work for a horse right

1497
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:43,119
like they or anything else

1498
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:43,838
and and not only could we not hold on to

1499
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,599
mom

1500
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:47,838
in the first day it's three months

1501
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,559
before we can move our head volitionally

1502
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:51,440
um so it's like why why are we embryonic

1503
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,640
for so

1504
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,800
long basically that it's like

1505
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,000
like it's still fetal on the outside had

1506
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,359
to be because

1507
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,358
couldn't keep growing inside and

1508
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:03,358
actually ever get out with big heads and

1509
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:06,719
narrower hips from going upright

1510
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:09,279
um so here's a place where there's a

1511
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:12,480
co-evolution of the pattern of humans

1512
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:15,040
specifically here are our neotony and

1513
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,599
what that pertends to learning

1514
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:19,759
with our being tool-making and

1515
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,838
environment modifying creatures

1516
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,359
which is because we have the abstraction

1517
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:24,960
to make tools

1518
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:25,838
we change our environments more than

1519
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,559
other creatures change their

1520
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:28,558
environments

1521
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,040
the next most environment modifying

1522
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,599
creature to us is like a beaver

1523
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:35,519
and then you we're in la you fly into

1524
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,519
lax and you look at the just

1525
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:38,800
orthogonal grid going on forever in all

1526
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,880
directions

1527
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,079
and you know we've recently come into

1528
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,358
the anthropocene where the

1529
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,119
surface of the earth is changing more

1530
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:46,000
from human activity than geological

1531
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,440
activity

1532
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,280
and then beavers and you're like okay

1533
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,800
wow we're really in a class of our own

1534
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,160
in terms of environments

1535
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:57,519
modifying yeah um so as

1536
00:53:54,159 --> 00:54:01,118
soon as we started tool making

1537
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:02,400
we were able to change our environments

1538
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,960
much more radically we could put on

1539
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,358
clothes and go to a cold place right

1540
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,039
and this is really important because we

1541
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:10,239
actually went and became apex predators

1542
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:12,159
in every environment

1543
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,000
we functioned like apex predators the

1544
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:16,159
polar bear can't leave the arctic

1545
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,119
right and the lion can't leave the

1546
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:18,399
savannah and

1547
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,838
orca can't leave the ocean and we went

1548
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,960
became apex predators in all those

1549
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:22,558
environments because of our tool

1550
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,000
creation capacity we could become better

1551
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,680
predators than them adapted to the

1552
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,039
environment or at least with our tools

1553
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:31,199
adapted to the environment

1554
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:34,159
so in every aspect towards any organism

1555
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:35,759
in any environment we're incredibly good

1556
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:39,039
at becoming apex predators

1557
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,760
yes and nothing else can do that kind of

1558
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,880
thing there

1559
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,559
there is no other apex predator that you

1560
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,838
see the other apex predator is only

1561
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,200
getting better at being a predator

1562
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:48,000
through evolutionary process that's

1563
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:49,759
super slow

1564
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,440
and that super slow process creates

1565
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,040
co-selective process with their

1566
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,240
environment so as the predator becomes a

1567
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,239
tiny bit faster

1568
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,679
it eats more of the slow prey the genes

1569
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:58,639
of the fast prey and breed and the prey

1570
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:00,239
becomes faster

1571
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:01,920
and so there's this kind of balancing

1572
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,759
and we in

1573
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,599
because of our tool making we increased

1574
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,000
our predatory capacity faster than

1575
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,318
anything

1576
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,079
else could increase its resilience to it

1577
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:12,159
as a result we start outstripping

1578
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,839
the environment and extincting species

1579
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:15,199
following stone tools

1580
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:16,239
and going and becoming apex predator

1581
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,598
everywhere this is why we can't keep

1582
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,118
applying apex predator series because

1583
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,318
we're not an apex predator we're an apex

1584
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,318
predator but we're something much more

1585
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:24,639
than that

1586
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,960
like just for an example the top apex

1587
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:29,039
predator in the world in orca

1588
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,960
and orca can eat one big fish at a time

1589
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:31,599
like one tuna and it'll miss most of the

1590
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,798
time

1591
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:37,200
or one seal and we can put a mile-long

1592
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:39,759
drift net out on a single boat

1593
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,480
and pull up an entire school of them

1594
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,000
right we can

1595
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,358
deplete the entire oceans of them that's

1596
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,880
not an orca right like that's not an

1597
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,798
apex predator

1598
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,318
um and that's not even including that we

1599
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:50,079
can then genetically engineer

1600
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:52,000
different creatures we can extinct

1601
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,760
species we can devastate whole

1602
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,199
ecosystems we can make built worlds that

1603
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,799
have no natural things that are just

1604
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,399
human built worlds we can build new

1605
00:55:56,798 --> 00:55:58,960
types of natural creatures synthetic

1606
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,960
life

1607
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,559
so we are much more like little gods

1608
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,079
than we are like apex predators now but

1609
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,599
we're still behaving as apex predators

1610
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,359
and little gods that behave as apex

1611
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,200
predators caused us a problem

1612
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:10,558
kind of core to my assessment of the

1613
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:13,118
world

1614
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,960
so what does it mean to be a predator so

1615
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:18,000
a predator is

1616
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,440
somebody that effectively can mine the

1617
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,039
resources from a place

1618
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:26,318
so for their survival or is it also

1619
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:29,679
just purely like higher level

1620
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:32,558
objectives of violence and what is can

1621
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:34,558
predators be predators towards the same

1622
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,000
each other towards the same species

1623
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,760
like we think are we using the word

1624
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,719
predator sort of generally

1625
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,200
which then connects to conflict and uh

1626
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:46,000
military conflict violent conflict

1627
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,838
in the space of human species obviously

1628
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,358
we can say that plants are mining the

1629
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:50,239
resources of their environment in a

1630
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:52,318
particular way

1631
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:53,759
using photosynthesis to be able to pull

1632
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:56,079
minerals out of the soil and

1633
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,119
nitrogen and carbon out of the air and

1634
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,760
like that

1635
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,519
um and we can say herbivores are being

1636
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,040
able to mine and concentrate that so i

1637
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,159
wouldn't say mining the environment is

1638
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:08,000
unique to predator

1639
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:10,239
predator is you know

1640
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,239
uh

1641
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:18,000
generally being defined as mining

1642
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,039
other animals right we don't consider

1643
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,719
herbivores

1644
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:24,960
predators but um animal which requires

1645
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:27,279
some type of violence capacity because

1646
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,599
animals move plants don't move so

1647
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,519
requires some capacity to

1648
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,119
uh overtake something that can move and

1649
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,759
try to get away

1650
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,440
um we'll go back to the gerard zing and

1651
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,119
we'll come back here

1652
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,519
why are we neon this why are we

1653
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:45,119
embryonic for so long

1654
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:46,719
because are we did we just move from the

1655
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,000
savannah to the arctic and we need to

1656
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:49,759
learn new stuff

1657
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,440
if we came genetically programmed we

1658
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,680
would not be able to do that

1659
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,798
are we throwing spears or are we fishing

1660
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,399
or are we

1661
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:58,079
running an industrial supply chain or

1662
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,280
are we texting what is the adaptive

1663
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,359
behavior

1664
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,798
horses today in the wild and horses ten

1665
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:04,159
thousand years ago are doing pretty much

1666
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:07,519
the same stuff

1667
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:08,078
and so since we make tools and we evolve

1668
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:09,838
our tools

1669
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,680
and then change our environments so

1670
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:13,039
quickly and other animals are largely

1671
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:13,440
the result of their environment but

1672
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:16,239
we're

1673
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,000
environment modifying so rapidly we need

1674
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:19,919
to come without too much programming so

1675
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
we can learn the environment we're in

1676
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,280
learn the language right which is uh

1677
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,119
going to be very important learn the

1678
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,280
tool making learn the um

1679
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,318
and so we have a very long period of

1680
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,240
relative helpless

1681
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:33,838
of helplessness because we aren't coded

1682
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:35,759
how to behave yet because we're

1683
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:36,960
imprinting a lot of software on how to

1684
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,000
behave that is useful to

1685
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,519
that particular time so our mimesis is

1686
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,239
not it's not unique to humans but the

1687
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:45,838
total amount of it is really unique

1688
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:47,919
and this is also where the uniqueness

1689
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:50,078
can go up right is because we are less

1690
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,358
just the result of the genetics and that

1691
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,720
means the kind of

1692
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:55,119
learning through history that they got

1693
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:57,919
coded in genetics and more the result of

1694
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,599
it's almost like our hardware selected

1695
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,519
for software

1696
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,760
right like if evolution is kind of doing

1697
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:05,358
these think of as a hardware selection

1698
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,359
i have problems with computer metaphors

1699
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:11,279
for biology but i'll use this one here

1700
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:14,400
um that we

1701
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,400
have not had hardware changes since the

1702
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,079
beginning of sapiens but our world is

1703
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,318
really really different

1704
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,440
and that's all changes in software right

1705
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:23,679
changes in

1706
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,880
on the same fundamental genetic

1707
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:26,879
substrate

1708
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,039
what we're doing with these brains and

1709
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:33,760
minds and bodies and social groups and

1710
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:36,719
like that and so um

1711
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,599
now gerard specifically was looking at

1712
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:40,639
when

1713
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,160
we watch other people talking so we

1714
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,679
learn language you and i would have a

1715
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:44,719
hard time learning mandarin today it

1716
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:46,159
would take a lot of work we'd be

1717
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:47,679
learning how to conjugate verbs and

1718
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:48,960
stuff but a baby learns it instantly

1719
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:50,639
without anyone even really trying to

1720
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,240
teach it just through mimesis so it's a

1721
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:53,838
it's a powerful thing

1722
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:55,199
they're obviously more neuroplastic than

1723
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:56,880
we are when they're doing that and all

1724
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:58,719
their attention is allocated that

1725
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,160
but they're also learning how to move

1726
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:02,480
their bodies and they're learning

1727
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:03,679
all kinds of stuff through mimesis one

1728
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,480
of the things that george says is

1729
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:08,078
they're also learning what to want

1730
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,280
and they learn what to want they learn

1731
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,240
desire by watching what other people

1732
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,240
want

1733
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:13,759
and so intrinsic to this people end up

1734
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:17,358
wanting what other people want

1735
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:19,839
and if we can't have what other people

1736
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:21,598
have without taking it away from them

1737
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:24,239
then that becomes a source of conflict

1738
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,000
so the mimesis of desire is the

1739
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:30,078
fundamental generator of conflict

1740
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,639
and that then the conflict energy within

1741
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,960
a group of people will build over time

1742
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,920
this is a very very crude interpretation

1743
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,079
of the theory

1744
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,039
can we just pause on that for people who

1745
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:41,920
are not familiar

1746
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,519
and for me who hasn't i'm loosely

1747
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,960
familiar but i haven't internalized it

1748
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:46,639
but every time i think about it's a very

1749
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,400
compelling view of the world whether

1750
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:51,679
it's true or not

1751
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:54,559
it's quite it's like when you take

1752
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:56,480
everything freud says as truth is a very

1753
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:59,920
interesting way to think about the world

1754
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,280
in the same way thinking about the

1755
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:07,119
memetic

1756
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:07,119
theory of desire that everything we want

1757
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:13,119
is imitation of other people's wants we

1758
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:17,519
don't have any original wants

1759
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:19,680
we're constantly imitating others and so

1760
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,119
and not just others but you know others

1761
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,798
were exposed to

1762
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,880
so there's these like little local

1763
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,519
pockets however defined local

1764
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,000
of people like imitating each other and

1765
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:29,920
uh

1766
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,039
one that's super empowering because then

1767
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:35,760
you can pick which group you can join

1768
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:36,079
like what what do you want to imitate

1769
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,319
it's

1770
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,680
it's uh it's the old like uh you know

1771
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:42,318
whoever your friends are

1772
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:43,838
that's what your life is gonna be like

1773
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:45,039
that's really powerful i mean it's

1774
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:48,159
depressing that we're so

1775
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:48,880
unoriginal but it's also liberating in

1776
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,838
that

1777
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,838
if this holds true that we can choose

1778
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:55,440
our life by choosing the people we hang

1779
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:57,599
out with

1780
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,599
so okay thoughts that are very

1781
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,559
compelling that seem like they're more

1782
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,559
absolute than they

1783
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,280
actually are end up also being dangerous

1784
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:07,280
we want communism um

1785
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,039
i'm gonna discuss here where i think we

1786
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,440
need to amend this particular

1787
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,960
theory but specifically you just said

1788
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,720
something that everyone

1789
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,400
who's paid attention knows is true

1790
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:18,558
experientially which is who you're

1791
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:21,440
around affects who you become

1792
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:23,440
and as as libertarian and

1793
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,798
self-determining and sovereign as we'd

1794
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:28,079
like to be

1795
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:30,239
um everybody i think knows that if you

1796
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,920
got put in a maximum security prison

1797
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:33,439
aspects of your personality would have

1798
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,880
to adapt or you wouldn't

1799
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,480
survive there right you would become

1800
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,400
different if you were

1801
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,838
if if you grew up in darfur versus

1802
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,960
finland you would be different with your

1803
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:43,599
same genetics like

1804
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,079
just there's no real question about that

1805
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,318
um

1806
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,440
and that even today if you hang out in a

1807
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:50,239
place

1808
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,280
with ultra marathoners as your roommates

1809
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:52,719
or

1810
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,880
um all people who are obese as your

1811
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,239
roommates the statistical likelihood of

1812
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,640
what happens to your fitness is pretty

1813
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,000
clear

1814
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,318
right like the behavioral science of

1815
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,239
this is pretty clear so uh

1816
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:03,440
the whole saying we are the average of

1817
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:04,159
the five people we spend the most time

1818
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,240
around

1819
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:07,279
i think the more self-reflective someone

1820
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,959
is the more time they spend by

1821
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,559
themselves in self-reflection the less

1822
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,838
this is true but it's still true

1823
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:16,000
so one of the best things someone can do

1824
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:17,358
to become more self-determined is be

1825
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,719
self-determined about the environments

1826
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:20,318
they want to put themselves in

1827
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:21,439
because to the degree that there is some

1828
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:23,199
self-determination and some

1829
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,960
determination by the environment

1830
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:26,879
don't be fighting an environment that is

1831
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,318
predisposing you in bad directions

1832
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,599
try to put yourself in an environment

1833
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:30,719
that is predisposing the things that you

1834
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:32,640
want

1835
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:34,000
in turn try to affect the environment in

1836
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:35,920
ways that predispose positive things for

1837
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,519
those around you

1838
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,039
or perhaps also to there there's

1839
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:40,079
probably interesting ways to play with

1840
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:43,440
this you could probably

1841
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:46,318
put yourself like form connections that

1842
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,159
have this perfect tension in all

1843
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:49,679
directions to where you're actually free

1844
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:50,399
to decide whatever the heck you want

1845
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,358
because

1846
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,639
the set of wants within your circle of

1847
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:57,279
interactions

1848
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:58,960
is so conflicting that you're free to

1849
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,720
choose whichever one

1850
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,519
so if there's enough tension as opposed

1851
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:05,358
to everybody align like a flock of birds

1852
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:07,199
yeah you i mean you definitely want that

1853
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:12,558
all of the dialectics

1854
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:14,960
would be balanced um so if you have

1855
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:16,640
someone who is extremely oriented to

1856
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,559
self-empowerment and someone who's

1857
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,679
extremely oriented to kind of empathy

1858
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:21,280
and compassion both

1859
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:22,798
the dialectic of those is better than

1860
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:26,079
either of them on their own

1861
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:27,838
um if you have both of them inhabiting

1862
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:29,280
being inhabited better than you by the

1863
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:30,318
same person spending time around that

1864
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,519
person will probably do

1865
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:34,719
well for you i think the thing you just

1866
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:36,079
mentioned is super important when it

1867
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:39,199
comes to cognitive

1868
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,200
schools which is

1869
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,280
i think one of the fastest things people

1870
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:46,078
can do to improve their learning

1871
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,839
and their not just cognitive learning

1872
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,720
but their

1873
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:52,558
meaningful problem-solving communication

1874
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,078
and civic capacity capacity to

1875
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,160
participate as a citizen with other

1876
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,559
people and making the world better

1877
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:00,798
is to be seeking dialectical synthesis

1878
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,640
all the time

1879
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:04,318
and so in the hegelian sense if you have

1880
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,960
a thesis

1881
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:09,038
you have an antithesis so maybe we have

1882
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,720
libertarianism on one side and marxist

1883
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,640
kind of communism on the other side and

1884
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:16,480
one is arguing that

1885
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:19,519
the individual is the unit of choice

1886
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,358
and so we want to uh increase the

1887
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:22,000
freedom and support of individual choice

1888
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:23,679
because as they

1889
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,119
make more agentic choices it'll produce

1890
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:26,078
a better hole for everybody

1891
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,358
the other side saying well the

1892
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,798
individuals are conditioned by their

1893
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:30,880
environment who would choose to be born

1894
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:34,400
into darfur rather than finland

1895
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:36,240
um so we actually need to collectively

1896
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,000
make environments

1897
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,838
that are good because that the

1898
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,159
environment conditions individuals

1899
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:42,880
so you have a thesis and an antithesis

1900
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:44,558
and then

1901
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,079
hegel's ideas you have a synthesis which

1902
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,079
is a kind of higher order truth that

1903
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:50,559
understands how those relate in a way

1904
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,559
that neither of them do and so it is

1905
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,160
actually at a higher order of complexity

1906
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,400
so the first part would be can i steal

1907
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:57,838
man each of these can i argue each one

1908
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,760
well enough that the proponents of it

1909
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:01,599
are like totally you got that

1910
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,200
and not just argue it rhetorically but

1911
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,359
can i inhabit it where i can

1912
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:06,960
try to see and feel the world the way

1913
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:08,318
someone seeing and feeling the world

1914
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,480
that way would

1915
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:11,920
because once i do then i don't want to

1916
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,719
screw those people because there's truth

1917
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,920
in it

1918
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,439
right and i'm not going to go back to

1919
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,039
war with them i'm going to go to finding

1920
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,240
solutions it could actually work at a

1921
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,599
higher order

1922
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,279
if i don't go to a higher order then

1923
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:22,880
there's war

1924
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,160
and but then the higher order thing

1925
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,440
would be well it seems like the

1926
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:27,759
individual

1927
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,039
does affect the commons and the

1928
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,839
collective and other people it also

1929
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,839
seems like

1930
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:32,880
the collective conditions individuals at

1931
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:34,558
least statistically

1932
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,240
and i can cherry pick out the one guy

1933
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,760
who got out of the ghetto

1934
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:39,118
um and pulled himself up by his

1935
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,880
bootstraps but i can also say

1936
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,400
statistically that most people born into

1937
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,079
the ghetto show up differently than most

1938
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,760
people born into the hamptons

1939
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:48,160
and so unless you want to argue that and

1940
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,359
have you

1941
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:51,279
take your child from the hamptons and

1942
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:52,798
put them in the ghetto then like come on

1943
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,680
be realistic about this thing

1944
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:57,519
so how do we make we don't want social

1945
01:06:55,679 --> 01:07:00,159
systems that make

1946
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:02,159
weak dependent individuals right so the

1947
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:04,000
welfare argument but we also

1948
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:06,480
don't want no social system that

1949
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,119
supports individuals to do better

1950
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,838
we want we don't want individuals where

1951
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:11,760
their

1952
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:13,279
self-expression and agency [ __ ] the

1953
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,440
environment and everybody else and

1954
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:18,960
employs slave labor and whatever

1955
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,039
so can we make it to where individuals

1956
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,559
are creating holes that are better for

1957
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,760
conditioning other individuals can we

1958
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,119
make it to where we have holes that are

1959
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,200
conditioning increased

1960
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:28,880
agency and sovereignty right that would

1961
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:31,598
be the synthesis so the thing

1962
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:33,358
that i'm coming to here is if people

1963
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,119
have that as a frame and sometimes it's

1964
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:36,239
not just thesis and antithesis it's like

1965
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:39,280
eight different views

1966
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:40,558
right can i steal man each view

1967
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,480
this is not just can i take the

1968
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:44,400
perspective but am i seeking them am i

1969
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,318
actively trying to inhabit other

1970
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,280
people's perspective

1971
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:50,318
then can i really try to essentialize it

1972
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,079
and argue

1973
01:07:50,318 --> 01:07:54,480
the best points of it both the sense

1974
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:57,680
making about reality and the values

1975
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,960
why these values actually matter then

1976
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:01,279
just like i want to seek those

1977
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:04,159
perspectives then i want to seek

1978
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:06,000
is there a higher order set of

1979
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:06,960
understandings that could fulfill the

1980
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,798
values of

1981
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,000
and synthesize the sense making of all

1982
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:11,280
of them simultaneously

1983
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,559
maybe i won't get it but i want to be

1984
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,319
seeking it and i want to be seeking

1985
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,798
progressively better ones

1986
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:18,640
so this is perspective seeking driving

1987
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:21,838
perspective taking

1988
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:24,880
and then seeking synthesis

1989
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:28,640
i think that that one

1990
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:32,079
cognitive disposition might be

1991
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,838
the most helpful thing would you put a

1992
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:35,679
title dialectic synthesis

1993
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:36,960
on that process because that seems to be

1994
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:40,880
such a part so like this

1995
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:43,198
rigorous empathy like

1996
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,480
like it's not just empathy it's empathy

1997
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:47,278
with the rigor like you

1998
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:48,959
really want to understand and and embody

1999
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:51,520
different world views and then try to

2000
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,600
find a higher order synthesis

2001
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,199
okay so i remember last night you told

2002
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:58,079
me when we first met

2003
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:59,678
uh you said that you looked in

2004
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:00,000
somebody's eyes and you felt that you

2005
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,359
had

2006
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,520
suffered in some ways that they had

2007
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,359
suffered and so you could trust them

2008
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,640
shared pathos right creates a certain

2009
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,120
sense of kind of shared

2010
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,719
bonding and shared intimacy so empathy

2011
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:12,318
is actually feeling the suffering of

2012
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:14,719
somebody else and feeling the

2013
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,759
the depth of their sentience i don't

2014
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,359
want to [ __ ] them anymore

2015
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,359
i may not hurt them i don't want to

2016
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,798
behave and i don't want my proposition

2017
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:22,480
to go through

2018
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:23,519
when i go and inhabit the perspective of

2019
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:24,718
the other people if they feel that's

2020
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,920
really going to mess them up

2021
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:29,439
right and so the rigorous empathy it's

2022
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,880
different than just compassion which is

2023
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,559
i generally care

2024
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,079
like i have a generalized care but i

2025
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,520
don't know what it's like to be them

2026
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,798
i can never know what it's like to be

2027
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,719
them perfectly and that there's a

2028
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:42,319
humility you have to have which is

2029
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:44,719
my most rigorous attempt is still not it

2030
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,159
my most rigorous attempt mine to know

2031
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:47,838
what it's like to be a woman is still

2032
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:48,879
not it i have no question that if i was

2033
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:50,238
actually a woman it would be different

2034
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,600
than my best guesses

2035
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:53,119
i have no question if i was actually

2036
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,320
black it's be different than my best

2037
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:55,760
guesses

2038
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:57,599
so there's a humility in that which

2039
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,560
keeps me listening because i don't think

2040
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,239
that i know fully

2041
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,159
but i want to and i'm going to keep

2042
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:03,678
trying better to

2043
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:05,119
and then i want to across them and then

2044
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,960
i want to say is there a way we can

2045
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:07,760
forward together and not have to be in

2046
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,760
war

2047
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,440
it has to be something that could meet

2048
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,199
the values that everyone holds

2049
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:14,879
it could reconcile the partial sense

2050
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:16,879
making that everyone holds

2051
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,719
and they could offer a way forward that

2052
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,319
is more agreeable

2053
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,399
than the partial perspectives at war

2054
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:24,079
with each other but the so the more

2055
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:25,439
you succeed at this empathy with

2056
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:27,198
humility

2057
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:29,519
the more you're carrying the burden of

2058
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:31,839
their of other people's pain

2059
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,840
essentially it just goes back to the

2060
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:37,760
question of do i see us as one

2061
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,760
being or 7.8 billion

2062
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,520
i think the

2063
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,479
if i'm overwhelmed with my own pain i

2064
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:47,840
can't empathize that much

2065
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:50,079
because i don't have the bandwidth i

2066
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,520
don't have the capacity if i don't feel

2067
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,800
like i can do something about a

2068
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,239
particular problem in the world it's

2069
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,679
hard to feel it because it's just too

2070
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:57,519
devastating

2071
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,880
and so a lot of people go numb and even

2072
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,199
go nihilistic

2073
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,800
because they just don't feel the agency

2074
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:04,000
so as i actually become more empowered

2075
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,920
as an individual

2076
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,279
and have more sense of agency i also

2077
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,800
become more empowered to be more

2078
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:09,439
empathetic for others and be more

2079
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,360
connected

2080
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:12,639
to that shared burden and want to be

2081
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:16,399
able to make choices

2082
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:20,000
on behalf of and in in benefit of so

2083
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:22,319
this way of living

2084
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,279
seems like a way of living that would

2085
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:28,479
solve a lot of problems in society

2086
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:29,759
from a cellular automata perspective so

2087
01:11:28,479 --> 01:11:32,479
if you have a bunch of little

2088
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,320
like little agents behaving in this way

2089
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:35,839
my intuition there'll be interesting

2090
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:37,279
complexities that emerge but my

2091
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,880
intuition is

2092
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:41,519
it will create a society that's very

2093
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,560
different and recognizably

2094
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:48,000
better than the one we have today

2095
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,039
how much um like oh wait hold that

2096
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,319
question because i want to come back to

2097
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:51,359
it but this brings us back to gerard

2098
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:53,198
which we didn't answer

2099
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:54,960
the conflict theory yes because about

2100
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:56,559
how to get past the conflict theory yes

2101
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,239
you know the robert frost poem about the

2102
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,760
two paths he never has

2103
01:11:58,238 --> 01:12:01,359
time to return back to the other we're

2104
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,400
gonna have to do that quite a lot we're

2105
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:05,359
gonna be

2106
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:06,238
uh living that poem over and over again

2107
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:09,359
but yes

2108
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:11,519
how how to uh let's return back

2109
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:13,039
okay so the rest of the argument goes

2110
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,440
you learn to want what other people

2111
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:17,039
want therefore fundamental conflict

2112
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:18,719
based in our desire because we want the

2113
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:21,439
thing that somebody else has

2114
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,880
and then people are conf they're in

2115
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:23,439
conflict over trying to get the same

2116
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,000
stuff

2117
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:27,439
power status attention physical stuff a

2118
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,760
mate whatever it is

2119
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,359
and then we learn the conflict by

2120
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,960
watching and so then the conflict

2121
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:35,198
becomes medic so the

2122
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,000
and you know we become on the

2123
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:37,359
palestinian side

2124
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,960
of the israeli side of the communist

2125
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:40,719
capitalist side or the left to right

2126
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,198
politically or whatever it is

2127
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:45,279
and until eventually the conflict energy

2128
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:48,079
in the system builds up so much

2129
01:12:45,279 --> 01:12:49,599
that some type of violence is needed to

2130
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:50,319
get the bad guy whoever it is that we're

2131
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,159
gonna blame

2132
01:12:50,319 --> 01:12:54,399
and you know george talks about why

2133
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:55,759
scapegoating was kind of a mechanism to

2134
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:57,198
minimize the amount of violence let's

2135
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,600
blame let's blame it a

2136
01:12:57,198 --> 01:13:00,719
sec a scapegoat as being more relevant

2137
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,159
than they really were but if we all

2138
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:04,480
believe it then we can all kind of calm

2139
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:05,839
down with the conflict energy

2140
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:07,519
it's a really interesting concept by the

2141
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,279
way i mean you went you

2142
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,960
beautifully summarized it but the idea

2143
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:12,479
that there's a scapegoat that there's a

2144
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:15,119
this kind of thing naturally leads to a

2145
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:17,279
conflict and then they find the other

2146
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:19,439
some group that's the other that's

2147
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:20,880
either real artificial as the cause of

2148
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:22,719
the conflict

2149
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,400
well it's always artificial because the

2150
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,319
cause of the conflict in gerard is the

2151
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:27,359
mimesis of desire itself and how do we

2152
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,799
attack that

2153
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,198
how do we attack that it's our own

2154
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,320
desire so this now gets to something

2155
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:34,000
more like buddha said

2156
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:36,238
right which was desire as the cause of

2157
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,238
suffering um

2158
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:39,919
gerard and buddha would kind of agree in

2159
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:42,559
this way

2160
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,640
so and so but that's that explains i

2161
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,120
mean again it's a compelling

2162
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,760
description of human history that we do

2163
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:50,960
tend to

2164
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,199
come up with the other and uh okay kind

2165
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,600
of

2166
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,039
i just i just had such a funny

2167
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,199
experience with someone critiquing

2168
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:59,519
gerard the other day in such a

2169
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:00,719
um elegant and beautiful and simple way

2170
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:04,719
it's a

2171
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:04,719
a friend who's uh

2172
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:09,039
grew up aboriginal australian uh as a

2173
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:12,479
scholar of

2174
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:15,359
aboriginal social technologies

2175
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:17,198
he's like nah man gerard just made [ __ ]

2176
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:18,880
up about how tribes work like we

2177
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:21,039
come from a tribe we've got tens of

2178
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,560
thousands of years and we didn't have

2179
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:23,519
increasing conflict and then scapegoat

2180
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,880
and kill someone

2181
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,640
we'd have a little bit of conflict and

2182
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,679
then we would dance and then everybody'd

2183
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,119
be fine

2184
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,158
like we'd dance around the campfire

2185
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:31,439
everyone would like kind of physically

2186
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:33,359
get the energy out we'd look in each

2187
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:35,439
other's eyes we'd have positive bonding

2188
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:36,799
and then we're fine and nobody no

2189
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:38,960
scapegoats and

2190
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,719
i think that's called the joe rogan

2191
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,359
theory of desire which is

2192
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:44,560
uh he's like all all of human problems

2193
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:46,079
have to do with the fact that you don't

2194
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,880
do enough hard [ __ ] in your day

2195
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:49,920
yeah so maybe maybe you could just dance

2196
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,279
it because he says like

2197
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,039
doing exercising running on the

2198
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:54,719
treadmill gets gets all the demons out

2199
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:55,119
maybe just dancing gets all the demons

2200
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,560
out

2201
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:58,559
so this is why i say we have to be

2202
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:00,640
careful with taking an idea

2203
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,719
that seems too explanatory and then

2204
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,400
taking it as a given and then saying

2205
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:05,520
well now that we're stuck with the fact

2206
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,599
that

2207
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,360
conflict is inexorable because human

2208
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,039
because memetic desire and therefore how

2209
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:12,799
do we deal with the inexorability of the

2210
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:13,119
conflict and how to sublimate violence

2211
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,640
well

2212
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:16,719
no the whole thing might be actually

2213
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,400
gibberish meaning it's only true in

2214
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,399
certain conditions and other conditions

2215
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:22,079
it's not true so the deeper question is

2216
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:23,679
under which conditions is that true

2217
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:24,960
under which conditions is it not true

2218
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,079
what do those other conditions make

2219
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,840
possible and look like

2220
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:29,439
and in general we should stay with

2221
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,600
really compelling models

2222
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:34,238
of reality because there's something

2223
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,000
about about our brains that these models

2224
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,119
become sticky and we can't even think

2225
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,719
outside of them

2226
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:40,000
so it's not that we stay away from them

2227
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,158
it's that we know that the model of

2228
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,640
reality is never reality

2229
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:46,158
that's the key thing humility again it

2230
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,679
goes back to just having the humility

2231
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:48,238
they don't have a perfect model of

2232
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:51,119
reality

2233
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:53,039
there's an ep the model of reality could

2234
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:54,719
never be reality the process of modeling

2235
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:57,760
is inherently

2236
01:15:54,719 --> 01:16:00,000
information reduction and

2237
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:03,119
i can never show that the unknown

2238
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,520
unknown set has been factored

2239
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:06,238
um it's back to the cellular automata

2240
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,280
you can't

2241
01:16:06,238 --> 01:16:10,000
you can't uh put the genie back in the

2242
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:13,519
bottle

2243
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:17,600
like when you realize it's unfortunately

2244
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,600
sadly impossible to um

2245
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:22,800
to create a model of cellular automata

2246
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:25,439
even if you know the basic rules

2247
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,159
that predict to even any degree of

2248
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:29,279
accuracy

2249
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:31,439
what uh um how that

2250
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:33,599
system will evolve which is fascinating

2251
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:34,479
mathematically sorry i i think about it

2252
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,039
quite a lot

2253
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:39,119
it's very annoying wolfram has this rule

2254
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:41,760
30

2255
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:42,399
like you should be able to predict it

2256
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,960
it's so

2257
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:46,238
simple but you can't predict what's

2258
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,158
going to be

2259
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:50,479
like there's a there's a problem he

2260
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:51,279
defines they try to predict some aspect

2261
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:53,198
of the middle

2262
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:54,399
middle column of the system just

2263
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:55,759
anything about it

2264
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:59,920
what's going to happen in the future and

2265
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,920
you can't you can't

2266
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,679
it sucks because then we can't make

2267
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:05,839
sense of this world

2268
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,440
you know really in of reality in a

2269
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,719
definitive way

2270
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:13,039
it's always like in the striving like it

2271
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:15,198
we're always striving yeah i don't think

2272
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:18,238
this sucks

2273
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:21,439
that so that's a feature not a bug

2274
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:23,198
well that's assuming a designer um

2275
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:24,479
i would say i don't think it sucks i

2276
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:26,559
think it's

2277
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:28,959
not only beautiful but maybe necessary

2278
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:32,320
for beauty

2279
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,679
the mess so you're uh so you're you

2280
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:34,880
disagree jordan peterson you should

2281
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,960
clean up your room

2282
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,079
see you like the room's messy it's uh

2283
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:41,520
it's essential for the

2284
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:44,800
for beauty it's not it's not

2285
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,760
okay i take i have no idea if it was

2286
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,600
intended this way

2287
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,800
and so i'm just interpreting it a way i

2288
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,400
like the

2289
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:54,480
commandment about having no false idols

2290
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:55,839
to me the way i interpret that that is

2291
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:58,559
meaningful

2292
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:00,400
is that re reality is sacred to me i

2293
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,159
have a reverence for reality

2294
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:04,719
but i know my best understanding of it

2295
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:08,000
is never complete

2296
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,640
i know my best model of it is a model

2297
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,198
where i

2298
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,600
tried to make some kind of predictive

2299
01:18:11,198 --> 01:18:14,079
capacity by reducing the complexity of

2300
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,600
it to

2301
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:17,279
a set of stuff that i could observe and

2302
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,960
then a subset of that stuff that i

2303
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:19,759
thought was the causal dynamics and then

2304
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,840
some set of

2305
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,520
you know mechanisms that are involved

2306
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,360
and what we find is that

2307
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,280
it can be super useful like newtonian

2308
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:28,799
gravity can help us

2309
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:30,479
do ballistic curves and all kinds of

2310
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,480
super useful stuff and then we get to

2311
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:33,759
the place where it doesn't

2312
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,000
explain what's happening at the

2313
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:38,159
cosmological scale or at a

2314
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,238
quantum scale and at each time what

2315
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:42,719
we're finding is

2316
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:44,238
uh we excluded stuff and it also doesn't

2317
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,920
explain the reconciliation

2318
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:47,279
of gravity with quantum mechanics and

2319
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,158
the other kind of fundamental laws and

2320
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:50,238
the

2321
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:52,000
so models can be useful but they're

2322
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:55,919
never true with a capital t

2323
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,359
meaning they're never an actual real

2324
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,039
full they're never a complete

2325
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:00,238
description of what's happening in real

2326
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:01,600
systems they can be a complete

2327
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:03,198
description of what's happening in an

2328
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,400
artificial system that was the result of

2329
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:05,839
applying a model

2330
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:07,519
so the model of a circuit board and the

2331
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,880
circuit board are the same thing but i

2332
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,120
would argue that the model of a cell in

2333
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,760
the cell are not the same thing

2334
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:15,039
and i would say this is key to what we

2335
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,119
call complexity

2336
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:18,640
versus the complicated which is a

2337
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:22,559
distinction dave snowden made

2338
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:24,480
well in defining the difference between

2339
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,440
simple complicated complex and chaotic

2340
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:27,839
systems

2341
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:29,519
um but one of the definers in complex

2342
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,119
systems is that no matter how you model

2343
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,880
the complex system it will still have

2344
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:34,079
some emergent behavior not predicted by

2345
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,760
the model

2346
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:38,319
can you elaborate on the complex versus

2347
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,920
the complicated complicated means we can

2348
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:41,279
fully explicate

2349
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,440
the face space of all the things that it

2350
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:46,639
can do we can program it

2351
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:48,238
uh all human not all

2352
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,960
for the most part human-built things are

2353
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:52,559
complicated they don't self-organize

2354
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,399
they don't self-repair they're not

2355
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,800
self-evolving and we can

2356
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:57,920
make a blueprint for them we're sorry

2357
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,840
for human systems

2358
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,960
for human technologies human

2359
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,960
technologies sorry

2360
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,399
okay so that are basically the

2361
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:08,239
application of models

2362
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:10,158
right right and engineering is kind of

2363
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:13,599
applied science science as the modeling

2364
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:16,319
process and but

2365
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,960
with but humans are complex complex

2366
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:21,119
stuff with biological type stuff

2367
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,880
and sociological type stuff it more has

2368
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,198
generator functions

2369
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,159
and even those can't be fully explicated

2370
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:28,719
then it has

2371
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:30,399
or our explication can't prove that it

2372
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:32,000
has closure of what would be in the

2373
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:33,519
unknown unknown set where we keep

2374
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,560
finding like oh it's just the genome oh

2375
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:36,400
well now it's the genome in the

2376
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,760
epigenome and then a recursive change on

2377
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:39,198
the epigenome because of the proteome

2378
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,600
and then there's mitochondrial dna and

2379
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:41,839
then

2380
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,760
virus is affected and [ __ ] right so it's

2381
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:46,880
like we get overexcited

2382
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,239
when we think we found the thing so on

2383
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,920
facebook you know how you can list your

2384
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:50,718
relationship as complicated it should

2385
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,279
actually say

2386
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,719
it's it's complex that's the more

2387
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:56,719
accurate description

2388
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,319
you uh self-terminating is a really

2389
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:01,119
interesting idea that you talk about

2390
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:02,880
quite a bit

2391
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:05,198
first of all what is a self-terminating

2392
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,960
system and

2393
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:09,519
i think you have a sense correct me if

2394
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,679
i'm wrong that

2395
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:15,840
human civilization as it currently is is

2396
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:15,840
a self-terminating system

2397
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,439
why do you have that intuition combined

2398
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,560
with the definition of what

2399
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:26,158
self-terminating means

2400
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:28,639
okay so if we look at

2401
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:30,879
human societies historically human

2402
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:33,920
civilizations

2403
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,960
uh it's not that hard to realize that

2404
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,639
most of the major

2405
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,399
civilizations and empires of the past

2406
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:40,319
don't exist anymore so they had a life

2407
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:43,119
cycle they died for some reason

2408
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:45,519
so we don't still have in the early

2409
01:21:43,119 --> 01:21:45,920
egyptian empire or inca or maya or aztec

2410
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,199
or

2411
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:51,119
any of those right and so they

2412
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:52,638
they terminated sometimes it seems like

2413
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,760
they were terminated from the outside in

2414
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:55,119
war sometimes it seems like they

2415
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,119
self-terminate when we look at easter

2416
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:59,760
island it was a self-termination

2417
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:01,519
um so uh let's go ahead and take an

2418
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,199
island situation if i have an island

2419
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,120
and we're consuming the resources on

2420
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:06,399
that island faster than the resources

2421
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:08,158
can replicate themselves and there's a

2422
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:09,679
finite space there

2423
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:10,960
that system is going to self-terminate

2424
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,840
it's not going to be able to keep doing

2425
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,439
that thing

2426
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,039
because you'll get to a place of there's

2427
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:18,079
no resources left

2428
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:19,840
and then you get uh so now

2429
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:21,679
if i'm utilizing the resources faster

2430
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,920
than they can replicate

2431
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:25,279
or fasten they can replenish and i'm

2432
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,158
actually growing our population in the

2433
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:27,920
process i'm even

2434
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:29,759
increasing the rate of the utilization

2435
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:31,600
of resources

2436
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,440
i might get an exponential curve and

2437
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:35,520
then hit a wall and then just collapse

2438
01:22:33,439 --> 01:22:39,759
the exponential curve rather than do an

2439
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:42,880
s curve or some other kind of thing

2440
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:46,159
so self-terminating system is any system

2441
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:48,800
that depends upon a substrate system

2442
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:50,879
that is debasing its own substrate it is

2443
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,679
debasing what it depends upon

2444
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,639
so you're right that uh if you look at

2445
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:56,480
empires

2446
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:58,079
they rise and fall throughout human

2447
01:22:56,479 --> 01:23:01,759
history but

2448
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:04,719
but not this time bro where

2449
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,400
this one's gonna last forever that's i

2450
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:07,920
like that idea

2451
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:09,920
i think that if we don't understand why

2452
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,600
all the previous ones failed we can't

2453
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,960
ensure that and so i think it's very

2454
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,760
important to understand it well so that

2455
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,480
we can

2456
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,280
have that be a designed outcome with

2457
01:23:16,479 --> 01:23:20,319
somewhat

2458
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:22,079
decent probability so we're it's sort of

2459
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:23,439
in terms of consuming the resources on

2460
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:25,760
the island

2461
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:27,279
we're a clever bunch and we keep coming

2462
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:30,719
up

2463
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:34,000
especially when the on the horizon

2464
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:36,239
there is a termination point we keep

2465
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,279
coming up with clever ways of avoiding

2466
01:23:36,238 --> 01:23:40,399
disaster

2467
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:42,000
of avoiding collapse of constructing

2468
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:43,679
this is where technological innovation

2469
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,359
this is where growth comes in

2470
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:47,440
coming up with different ways to improve

2471
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:48,000
productivity and the way society

2472
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,079
functions

2473
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,760
such that we consume less resources or

2474
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:53,679
get a lot more from the resources we

2475
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:58,239
have

2476
01:23:53,679 --> 01:24:01,600
so there's some sense in which there's a

2477
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:03,119
human ingenuity is a source for optimism

2478
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,800
about the future of this particular

2479
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:07,679
system that

2480
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:10,159
that may not be self-terminating if if

2481
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:13,840
there's more innovation than there is

2482
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:15,920
consumption so

2483
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:17,360
over consumption of resources just one

2484
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,679
way i think can self-terminate we're

2485
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:21,119
just

2486
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:24,960
kind of starting here but um

2487
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:26,639
there are reasons for optimism and

2488
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,239
pessimism then they're both worth

2489
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:29,600
understanding and there's failure modes

2490
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:31,359
on understanding either without the

2491
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:34,480
other

2492
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:36,960
as as we mentioned previously there

2493
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:39,759
there's what i would call naive techno

2494
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:42,079
optimism naive techno capital optimism

2495
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:43,440
that says stuff just has been getting

2496
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:45,039
better and better and we wouldn't want

2497
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:46,799
to live in the dark ages and tech has

2498
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:49,039
done all this awesome stuff and

2499
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,920
um we know the proponents of those

2500
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:51,439
models

2501
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,639
uh and this stuff is going to kind of

2502
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:54,559
keep getting better of course there are

2503
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:55,760
problems but human ingenuity rises to it

2504
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,560
supply and demand will solve the

2505
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,800
problems whatever

2506
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,920
would you put a red car as well on that

2507
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,279
or uh

2508
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,639
in that bucket is there some specific

2509
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:05,439
people you have in mind or naive

2510
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:08,159
optimism is

2511
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:10,079
truly naive to where you're essentially

2512
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:11,920
just have an optimism that's blind to

2513
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:13,760
any kind of realities of the way

2514
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:17,520
technology progresses

2515
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:20,639
i don't think that anyone is

2516
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:22,320
who thinks about it and writes about it

2517
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,920
is perfectly naive

2518
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:25,519
gotcha but there might be it's a

2519
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,079
platonic ideal

2520
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,520
there might be a bias in the nature of

2521
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:31,039
the assessment

2522
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,040
i would also say there's kind of naive

2523
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:36,479
techno pessimism

2524
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:36,479
and there are

2525
01:25:39,039 --> 01:25:44,158
critics of technology i mean you read

2526
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:45,599
the unabomber's manifesto on why

2527
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:47,198
technology can't not

2528
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,480
result in our self-termination so we

2529
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:49,359
have to take it out before it gets any

2530
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:52,479
further

2531
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:55,279
um but also if you read a lot of the

2532
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:58,799
x-risk community you know bostrom and

2533
01:25:55,279 --> 01:26:00,238
friends uh it's like our total number of

2534
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,840
existential risks

2535
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:03,359
and the total probability of them is

2536
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:06,960
going up

2537
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:10,479
and so i think that there are

2538
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:12,399
we have to hold together where our

2539
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:13,678
positive possibilities and our risk

2540
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:16,238
possibilities are both

2541
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:18,960
increasing and then say for the positive

2542
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:20,718
possibilities to be realized long term

2543
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,319
all of the catastrophic risks have to

2544
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:24,158
not happen

2545
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:25,519
any of the catastrophic risks happening

2546
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:27,839
is enough to keep

2547
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,440
that positive outcome from occurring so

2548
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,840
how do we ensure that none of them

2549
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:31,439
happen

2550
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,960
if we want to say let's have a

2551
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:35,678
civilization that doesn't collapse

2552
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,359
so again collapse theory it's worth

2553
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:39,119
looking at books like

2554
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:40,719
the collapse of complex societies by

2555
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:43,840
joseph tainter it does an

2556
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:45,920
analysis of that

2557
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,760
many of the societies fell for for

2558
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,000
internal

2559
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,280
institutional decay civilizational decay

2560
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,840
reasons

2561
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:55,359
beaudriard in simulation and simulacra

2562
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,880
looks at a very different way of looking

2563
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:58,319
at how institutional decay and the

2564
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:00,000
collective intelligence of a system

2565
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:02,319
happens and it becomes kind of more

2566
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,760
internally parasitic on itself

2567
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:05,759
obviously jared diamond made a more

2568
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,600
popular book called collapse

2569
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,280
um and as we were mentioning the

2570
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,719
anti-catheria mechanism

2571
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:12,880
has been getting attention in the news

2572
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:14,000
lately but it's like a 2 000 year old

2573
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:18,000
clock right like

2574
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:20,479
like metal gears and

2575
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,158
does that mean we lost like 1500 years

2576
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:24,799
of technological progress

2577
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:26,879
um and from a society that was

2578
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:30,079
relatively technologically advanced

2579
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:31,920
um so

2580
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:34,399
what i'm interested in here is being

2581
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:37,840
able to say okay well

2582
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:40,479
why did previous societies fail

2583
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:42,560
can we understand that abstractly enough

2584
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:44,879
that we can

2585
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,239
make a civilizational model that isn't

2586
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,480
just trying to solve one

2587
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:50,158
type of failure but solve the underlying

2588
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:51,279
things that generate the failures as a

2589
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:52,879
whole

2590
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:54,880
are there some underlying generator

2591
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,840
functions or patterns

2592
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,000
that would make a system

2593
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,360
self-terminating and can we solve those

2594
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,800
and have that be the kernel of a new

2595
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:02,319
civilizational model that is not

2596
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,880
self-terminating

2597
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:06,559
and can we even be able to actually look

2598
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,760
at the categories of x-rays we're aware

2599
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,039
of and see that we actually have

2600
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,480
resilience

2601
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:12,560
in the presence of those not just

2602
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:15,519
resilience but anti-fragility

2603
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,639
and i would say for the optimism to be

2604
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,719
grounded

2605
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:20,159
it has to actually be able to understand

2606
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:22,560
the risk space well

2607
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:25,519
and have adequate solutions for it so

2608
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,520
can we try to

2609
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,960
dig into some basic intuitions about the

2610
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:32,479
underlying

2611
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,960
sources of catastrophic failures of the

2612
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:35,839
system

2613
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:37,279
and over consumption that's built into

2614
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:39,360
self-terminating systems

2615
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:40,880
so both the over consumption which is

2616
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:43,359
like the slow death

2617
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,800
and then there's the fast death of

2618
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:46,000
nuclear war and all those kinds of

2619
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,159
things

2620
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,359
agi biotech bioengineering

2621
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:53,119
nanotechnology now

2622
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:56,399
my favorite nanobots okay

2623
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:59,439
nanobots are my favorite because it

2624
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:00,559
sounds so cool to me that i could just

2625
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:01,919
know that i would be one of the

2626
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,719
scientists that would be full steam

2627
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,920
ahead

2628
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:08,000
in building them without

2629
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,600
sufficiently thinking about the negative

2630
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,679
consequences i would definitely be

2631
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,520
i would be podcasting all about the

2632
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:16,800
negative consequences but

2633
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,440
but when i go back home i'd be i just in

2634
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,159
my heart

2635
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:22,839
know the amount of excitement is a dumb

2636
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:26,559
descendant of vape no offense to apes

2637
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:28,400
uh so i want to backtrack on my previous

2638
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:32,800
uh comments

2639
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:36,559
about uh negative comments about apes

2640
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:38,960
uh that i have that sense of excitement

2641
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,560
that uh would result in problems so

2642
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:43,439
sorry a lot of things said but

2643
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:45,199
what can we start to pull a thread

2644
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:47,119
because you've also provided kind of a

2645
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:49,519
beautiful

2646
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:52,719
general approach to this which is this

2647
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:55,360
dialectic synthesis or just

2648
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,880
rigorous empathy whatever whatever word

2649
01:29:55,359 --> 01:29:58,479
we want to put to it

2650
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,719
that seems to be from the individual

2651
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:02,319
perspective is one way to sort of

2652
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,079
live in the world as we try to figure

2653
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:06,399
out how to construct

2654
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:07,920
non-self-terminating systems so what

2655
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:11,039
what are some underlying sources

2656
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:14,158
yeah first i have to say um

2657
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:16,719
i i actually really respect

2658
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:19,039
drexler for emphasizing grey goo and

2659
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:22,800
engines of creation back in the day

2660
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:24,800
um to make sure the world was paying

2661
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,279
adequate attention to the risks of the

2662
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,920
the nanotech um as someone who was right

2663
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:32,319
at the

2664
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:34,158
cutting edge of what could be um

2665
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:36,079
there's definitely game theoretic

2666
01:30:34,158 --> 01:30:37,198
advantage to those who focus on the

2667
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:38,719
opportunities and

2668
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:41,919
don't focus on the risks or pretend

2669
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:45,840
there aren't risks um

2670
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:48,800
because they get to market first

2671
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,760
um and then they externalize all of the

2672
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,440
costs through

2673
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,960
limited liability or whatever it is to

2674
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:53,919
the commons or whatever happened to have

2675
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,520
it other people are going to have to

2676
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,960
solve those but now they have the power

2677
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,320
and capital associated the person who

2678
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,158
looked at the risks and tried to do

2679
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:02,399
better design and go slower

2680
01:31:00,158 --> 01:31:04,079
um is probably not going to move into

2681
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:05,279
positions of as much power influences

2682
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:06,800
quickly so this one of the issues we

2683
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:08,800
have to deal with is some of the

2684
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,119
the bad game theoretic dispositions in

2685
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:14,079
the system relative to its own

2686
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:16,158
um stability and the key aspect to that

2687
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:17,039
sorry to interrupt is the externalities

2688
01:31:16,158 --> 01:31:20,238
generated

2689
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:21,840
yes what flavors of catastrophic risk

2690
01:31:20,238 --> 01:31:24,799
are we talking about here what's your

2691
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:26,480
favorite flavor in terms of ice cream

2692
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:29,279
so mine is coconut nobody seems to like

2693
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:32,559
coconut ice cream so

2694
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:34,399
ice cream aside what's

2695
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:36,000
uh what are you most worried about if

2696
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:38,719
there's a catastrophic risk that will

2697
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:42,158
help us kind of um

2698
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:43,679
make concrete the the the discussion

2699
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:44,638
we're having about how to fix this whole

2700
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:46,480
thing

2701
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,840
yeah i think it's worth taking a

2702
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:49,519
historical perspective

2703
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,039
briefly to just kind of orient everyone

2704
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,440
to it we don't have to

2705
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:55,279
um go all the way back to the aliens

2706
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:58,479
who've seen all of civilization but

2707
01:31:55,279 --> 01:32:00,079
to just recognize that

2708
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:02,479
for all of human history as far as we're

2709
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:02,479
aware

2710
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:05,760
there were existential risks to

2711
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:07,679
civilizations

2712
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,880
and they happened right like there were

2713
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:12,239
civilizations that were

2714
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:14,239
killed in war that tribes that were

2715
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:16,000
killed in tribal warfare or whatever so

2716
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:17,919
uh people faced existential risks to the

2717
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,840
group that they identified with

2718
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,359
it's just those were local phenomena

2719
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:23,440
right they it wasn't a fully global

2720
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:25,119
phenomena so an empire could fall

2721
01:32:23,439 --> 01:32:28,638
and surrounding empires didn't fall

2722
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:28,639
maybe they came in and filled the space

2723
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:35,039
the first time that we were able to

2724
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,560
think about catastrophic risk not from

2725
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:37,760
like a solar flare or something that we

2726
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,960
couldn't control but from

2727
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,280
something that humans would actually

2728
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,719
create at a global level was world war

2729
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:43,920
ii in the bomb

2730
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:47,039
because it was the first time that we

2731
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:48,719
had tech big enough that could actually

2732
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:50,238
mess up everything at a global level it

2733
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:51,600
could mess up habitability we just

2734
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:52,879
weren't powerful enough to do that

2735
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,320
before

2736
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:56,000
it's not that we didn't behave in ways

2737
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:57,519
that would have done it we just

2738
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,679
only behaved in those ways at the scale

2739
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,280
we could affect and

2740
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:04,239
so it's important to get that there's

2741
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:05,920
the entire world before world war ii

2742
01:33:04,238 --> 01:33:07,678
where we don't have the ability to make

2743
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,520
a non-habitable biosphere

2744
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,960
non-inhabitable for us and then there's

2745
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:12,880
world war ii and

2746
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,158
the beginning of a completely new phase

2747
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,719
where global

2748
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:18,319
human induced catastrophic risk is now a

2749
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:19,920
real thing

2750
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:21,840
and that was such a big deal that it

2751
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:23,119
changed the entire world in a really

2752
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:26,239
fundamental way

2753
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:27,840
which is you know when you study history

2754
01:33:26,238 --> 01:33:29,839
it's amazing how big a percentage of

2755
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,279
history is studying war right in the the

2756
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,560
history of wars you said european

2757
01:33:31,279 --> 01:33:34,238
history whatever

2758
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:36,239
it's generals and wars and empire

2759
01:33:34,238 --> 01:33:38,799
expansions and and so the

2760
01:33:36,238 --> 01:33:40,479
the major empires near each other never

2761
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,840
had really long periods of time where

2762
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:42,718
they weren't engaged in war or

2763
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,360
preparation for

2764
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:46,239
or something like that that was humans

2765
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:49,599
don't have a good

2766
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:51,119
precedent in the post tribal phase the

2767
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,800
civilization phase of being able to

2768
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:54,319
solve conflicts without war for very

2769
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:57,440
long

2770
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:58,799
world war ii was the first time where

2771
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:00,479
we could have a war that no one could

2772
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,400
win

2773
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:03,759
and so the superpowers couldn't fight

2774
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:04,079
again they couldn't do a real kinetic

2775
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,400
war

2776
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:07,840
they could do diplomatic wars and cold

2777
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:09,359
war type stuff and they could fight

2778
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,039
proxy wars through other countries that

2779
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:13,119
didn't have the big weapons

2780
01:34:11,039 --> 01:34:14,479
and so mutually assured destruction and

2781
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:16,399
like coming out of world war

2782
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:18,158
ii we actually realized that nation

2783
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:21,359
states couldn't prevent

2784
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:22,960
world war and so we needed a new type of

2785
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:24,158
supervening government in addition to

2786
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,439
nation states which was the whole

2787
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:28,638
bretton woods world the

2788
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:31,839
united nations the world bank the imf

2789
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:33,520
the globalization trade type agreements

2790
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:35,520
mutually assured destruction

2791
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:36,639
that was how do we have some

2792
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,400
coordination beyond

2793
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:39,920
just nation states between them since we

2794
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:41,679
have to stop war between at least the

2795
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:44,319
superpowers

2796
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:46,560
and it was pretty successful given that

2797
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:50,559
we've had like 75 years of no

2798
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:52,400
superpower on superpower war um

2799
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:55,679
we've had lots of proxy wars during that

2800
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:57,839
time we've had you know cold war

2801
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,719
and i would say we're in a new phase now

2802
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:03,360
where the bretton woods solution

2803
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:04,000
is basically over almost over can you

2804
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:06,000
describe the

2805
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,439
breathless solution yeah so the bretton

2806
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:11,118
woods

2807
01:35:07,439 --> 01:35:14,960
the series of agreements for

2808
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:16,960
how uh the nations would be able to

2809
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:20,079
engage with each other in a solution

2810
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:22,399
other than war um was these igos these

2811
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:23,519
intergovernmental organizations and was

2812
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:25,519
the idea of

2813
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,800
globalization since we could have global

2814
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:28,239
effects we needed to be able to think

2815
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,840
about things globally

2816
01:35:28,238 --> 01:35:31,359
where we had trade relationships with

2817
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,239
each other where it would not be

2818
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:33,599
profitable

2819
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:35,118
to war with each other to be more

2820
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,960
profitable to actually be able to trade

2821
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:37,359
with each other so our own self-interest

2822
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,279
was

2823
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:40,839
you know going to drive our non-more

2824
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:44,000
interest

2825
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:45,760
um and so this started to look like

2826
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,439
and obviously this this couldn't have

2827
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,119
happened that much earlier either

2828
01:35:47,439 --> 01:35:50,799
because industrialization hadn't gotten

2829
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:52,479
far enough to be able to do massive

2830
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:52,960
global industrial supply chains and

2831
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:55,198
ships

2832
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:56,239
stuff around you know quickly but like

2833
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:58,399
we were mentioning earlier

2834
01:35:56,238 --> 01:36:00,479
almost all the electronics that we use

2835
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:01,198
today just basic cheap stuff for us is

2836
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:02,879
made on six

2837
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:04,158
continents made in many countries

2838
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,600
there's no single country in the world

2839
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:07,118
that could actually make many of the

2840
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,840
things that we have and from the

2841
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:11,118
raw material extraction to the plastics

2842
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:14,159
and polymers and the

2843
01:36:11,118 --> 01:36:15,759
you know etc and so the i the idea that

2844
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:16,879
we made a world that could do that kind

2845
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,039
of

2846
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,639
trade and create massive gdp growth we

2847
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:23,600
could all work together to be able to

2848
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:25,600
mine natural resources and grow stuff

2849
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:27,199
with the rapid gdp growth there was the

2850
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,840
idea that everybody could keep having

2851
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,118
more

2852
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,520
without having to take each other's

2853
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:33,519
stuff and so that

2854
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:35,280
that was part of kind of the bretton

2855
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,880
woods post world war ii model

2856
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:38,399
the other was that we would be so

2857
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,880
economically interdependent that blowing

2858
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:45,118
each other up would never make sense

2859
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:47,679
that worked for a while now

2860
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:48,880
it also brought us up into planetary

2861
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:51,440
boundaries faster

2862
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:53,440
the unrenewable use of resource and

2863
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:54,799
turning those resources into

2864
01:36:53,439 --> 01:36:56,479
pollution on the other side of the

2865
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:58,719
supply chain

2866
01:36:56,479 --> 01:37:00,879
so obviously that faster gdp growth

2867
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:02,480
meant uh

2868
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,000
the overfishing of the oceans and the

2869
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:06,238
cutting down of the trees and the

2870
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,319
climate change and the uh

2871
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:09,519
mining toxic mining tailings going into

2872
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:10,960
the water and the

2873
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,159
mountaintop removal mining and all those

2874
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,118
types of things that's the over

2875
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:14,799
consumption side

2876
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:17,118
of the of the risk that we're talking

2877
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:20,880
about and so the answer of

2878
01:37:17,118 --> 01:37:23,759
let's do positive gdp is the answer

2879
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,880
rapidly and exponentially obviously

2880
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,679
accelerated

2881
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:29,118
the planetary boundary side and that

2882
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:30,560
started to be that that was thought

2883
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:31,519
about for a long time but it started to

2884
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:33,280
be modeled

2885
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,840
with the club of rome and limits of

2886
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:39,198
growth

2887
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:40,719
and it but it's just very obvious to say

2888
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:41,839
if you have a linear materials economy

2889
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:43,679
where you take stuff

2890
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,360
out of the earth faster whether it's

2891
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:47,199
fish or trees or or ore

2892
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,719
you take or oil you take it out of the

2893
01:37:47,198 --> 01:37:49,839
earth faster than it can replenish

2894
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:52,158
itself

2895
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,279
and you turn it into trash after using

2896
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:55,118
it for a short period of time you put

2897
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:55,679
the trash in the environment faster than

2898
01:37:55,118 --> 01:37:57,519
it can

2899
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:59,760
process itself and there's toxicity

2900
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:02,320
associated with both sides of this

2901
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:04,159
you can't run an exponentially growing

2902
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:05,840
linear materials economy on a finite

2903
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:06,719
planet forever that's not a hard thing

2904
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,880
to figure out

2905
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:11,439
and it has to be exponential if there's

2906
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,118
an exponentiation in the monetary supply

2907
01:38:11,439 --> 01:38:15,599
because of interest and then fractional

2908
01:38:13,118 --> 01:38:17,198
reserve banking and to then be able to

2909
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,239
keep up with the growing monetary supply

2910
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:19,118
you have to have growth of goods and

2911
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:20,718
services and

2912
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:24,238
so that's that kind of thing that has

2913
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:24,239
happened um

2914
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:27,919
but you also see that when you get these

2915
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:28,879
supply chains that are so interconnected

2916
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,960
across the world

2917
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,800
you get increased fragility because a

2918
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:34,639
collapse or a problem in one area then

2919
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,920
affects the whole world in a much bigger

2920
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,639
area as opposed to the issues being

2921
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,000
local

2922
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:41,920
right so we got to see with covid and

2923
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
an issue that started in one part of

2924
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:46,000
china affecting the whole world

2925
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,039
so much more rapidly than would have

2926
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,880
happened

2927
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:50,800
before bretton woods right before

2928
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:52,480
international travel supply chains

2929
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,840
you know that whole kind of thing and

2930
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:54,718
with a bunch of second and third-order

2931
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,719
effects that people wouldn't have

2932
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:58,480
predicted okay we have to stop

2933
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:00,079
certain kinds of travel because of viral

2934
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:03,039
contaminants but

2935
01:39:00,079 --> 01:39:04,639
the countries doing agriculture depend

2936
01:39:03,039 --> 01:39:06,158
upon fertilizer they don't produce that

2937
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:07,760
is shipped into them and depend upon

2938
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:08,559
pesticides they don't produce so we got

2939
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,560
both

2940
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,719
crop failures and crops being eaten by

2941
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:14,000
locusts in scale in northern africa and

2942
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:15,439
iran and things like that because they

2943
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,279
couldn't get the supplies of stuff in so

2944
01:39:15,439 --> 01:39:19,599
then you get massive starvation

2945
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:21,840
or future kind of hunger issues because

2946
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,840
of supply chain shutdowns

2947
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,920
so you get this increased fragility and

2948
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:28,800
cascade dynamics where a small problem

2949
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:32,480
can end up leading to cascade effects

2950
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:35,119
and also we went from

2951
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:36,959
two superpowers with one catastrophe

2952
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:40,000
weapon

2953
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:43,920
to now that same catastrophe

2954
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,279
weapon is there's more countries

2955
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,960
that have it eight or nine countries

2956
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:48,800
that have it and

2957
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,079
there's a lot more types of catastrophe

2958
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,400
weapons

2959
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:53,840
we now have catastrophe weapons with

2960
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:55,920
weaponized drones that can hit

2961
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:57,760
infrastructure targets with bio with

2962
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,600
in fact every new type of tech has

2963
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:02,400
created an arms race

2964
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:04,000
so we have not with the un or the other

2965
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:05,359
kind of intergovernmental organizations

2966
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,359
we haven't been able to really do

2967
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:09,118
nuclear de-proliferation

2968
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:11,198
we've actually had more countries get

2969
01:40:09,118 --> 01:40:12,000
nukes and keep getting faster nukes the

2970
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:15,279
race to

2971
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:17,039
hypersonics and things like that and

2972
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:19,439
every new type of technology that has

2973
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:22,719
emerged has created an arms race

2974
01:40:19,439 --> 01:40:23,678
and so you can't do mutually assured

2975
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:25,279
destruction

2976
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:27,920
with multiple agents the way you can

2977
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:29,840
with two agents two agents it's a

2978
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:31,359
much easier to create a stable nash

2979
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,719
equilibrium that's forced

2980
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:34,000
but the ability to monitor and say if

2981
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:36,000
these guys shoot who do i shoot do i

2982
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,600
shoot them do i shoot everybody do i

2983
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,439
and so you get a three body problem you

2984
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,719
get a very complex type of thing when

2985
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:42,319
you have multiple agents and

2986
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:44,319
multiple different types of catastrophe

2987
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:45,599
weapons including ones that can be much

2988
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:46,960
more easily produced than

2989
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,639
nukes are really hard to produce there's

2990
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:51,520
only uranium in a few areas uranium

2991
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:54,159
enrichment is hard icbms are hard

2992
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:55,679
but weaponized drones hitting smart

2993
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:57,359
targets is not so hard there's a lot of

2994
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:58,960
other things where basically the scale

2995
01:40:57,359 --> 01:41:00,238
at being able to manufacture them is

2996
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,560
going way way down to where even

2997
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:05,599
non-state actors can have them

2998
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:06,400
and so when we talk about exponential

2999
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,560
tech

3000
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:10,960
and the decentralization of exponential

3001
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,080
tech what that means is decentralized

3002
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:15,198
catastrophe weapon

3003
01:41:12,079 --> 01:41:17,600
capacity and especially in a world of

3004
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:19,919
increasing numbers of people feeling

3005
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:21,280
disenfranchised frantic whatever for

3006
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,399
different reasons

3007
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:25,920
so uh i would say

3008
01:41:24,399 --> 01:41:27,839
where the bretton woods world doesn't

3009
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,118
prepare us to be able to deal with lots

3010
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,400
of different agents

3011
01:41:29,118 --> 01:41:31,759
having lots of different types of

3012
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:33,439
catastrophe weapons you can't put

3013
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:35,440
mutually assured destruction on

3014
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:37,678
where you can't keep doing growth of

3015
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:39,279
materials economy

3016
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:40,800
in the same way because of hitting

3017
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:43,279
planetary boundaries

3018
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,639
and where the fragility dynamics are

3019
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:46,960
actually now their own source of

3020
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:48,319
catastrophic risk so now we're

3021
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,158
so like there was all the world until

3022
01:41:48,319 --> 01:41:50,639
world war ii and world war ii is just

3023
01:41:50,158 --> 01:41:52,319
from a

3024
01:41:50,639 --> 01:41:54,400
from a civilization time scale point of

3025
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:55,759
view was just a second ago

3026
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:57,679
it seems like a long time but it is

3027
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,800
really not we get a short period of

3028
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:00,319
relative peace at the level of

3029
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,320
superpowers while building up the

3030
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:04,238
military capacity for much much much

3031
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:06,639
worse war the entire time

3032
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:08,000
and then now we're at this new phase

3033
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:09,600
where the things that

3034
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,079
allowed us to make it through the

3035
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:13,199
nuclear power are not the same systems

3036
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:13,679
that will let us make it through the

3037
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:16,319
next

3038
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:17,440
stage so what is this next post bretton

3039
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:21,118
woods

3040
01:42:17,439 --> 01:42:24,319
how how do we become safe vessels

3041
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:26,079
safe stewards of many different types of

3042
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:28,880
exponential technology

3043
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:29,840
is a key question when we're thinking

3044
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:34,560
about x-risk

3045
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:36,719
okay so and i i'd like to

3046
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:38,239
try to answer the how if you thought a

3047
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:41,439
few ways but first

3048
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:44,479
on the mutually assured destruction

3049
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:47,839
do you give credit to the idea

3050
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:49,599
of two superpowers not blowing each

3051
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,840
other up with nuclear weapons

3052
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:53,199
to the simple game theoretic model of

3053
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,319
mutually shared destruction

3054
01:42:53,198 --> 01:42:59,759
or something you've said previously

3055
01:42:56,319 --> 01:43:03,679
this idea of inverse correlation which i

3056
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,679
tend to believe between

3057
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:07,039
the now if you were talking about tech

3058
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:10,239
but i think it's

3059
01:43:07,039 --> 01:43:11,840
maybe broadly true the inverse

3060
01:43:10,238 --> 01:43:13,839
correlation between competence and

3061
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:17,039
propensity for destruction

3062
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:19,600
so the better

3063
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:21,279
the the the bigger your weapons not

3064
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,119
because you're afraid of uh

3065
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:24,880
mutually assured self-destruction but

3066
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:28,559
because we're human beings and there's

3067
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:30,639
a deep moral fortitude there

3068
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:32,080
that's somehow aligned with competence

3069
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:35,679
and being good at your job

3070
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:35,679
that like it's very hard to be

3071
01:43:36,238 --> 01:43:43,439
a psychopath and be good

3072
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:43,440
at killing at scale

3073
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:48,560
do you share any of that intuition kind

3074
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:50,639
of

3075
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:52,480
i think most people would say that

3076
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:54,319
alexander the great and genghis khan and

3077
01:43:52,479 --> 01:43:58,079
napoleon were effective

3078
01:43:54,319 --> 01:44:00,880
people that were good at their job

3079
01:43:58,079 --> 01:44:01,439
that were actually maybe asymmetrically

3080
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:04,480
good

3081
01:44:01,439 --> 01:44:06,158
at being able to organize people and do

3082
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:08,479
certain kinds of things

3083
01:44:06,158 --> 01:44:10,479
that were pretty oriented towards

3084
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:13,439
certain types of destruction

3085
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:14,718
um or pretty willing to maybe they would

3086
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:16,559
say they were oriented towards empire

3087
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:18,239
expansion but pretty willing to

3088
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:20,239
commit certain acts of destruction in

3089
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:20,638
the name of it what what are you worried

3090
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:24,079
about

3091
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:27,520
the genghis khan or

3092
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:30,000
you could argue he's not a psychopath uh

3093
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,440
that are you worried about genghis khan

3094
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,560
are you worried about hitler or are you

3095
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:36,399
worried about

3096
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:38,480
a terrorist who is

3097
01:44:36,399 --> 01:44:39,519
has a very different ethic which is not

3098
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:43,039
even

3099
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:46,480
for uh from it's not trying to preserve

3100
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:48,639
and build and expand my community

3101
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:50,399
it's more about just destruction in

3102
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:53,440
itself is the goal

3103
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:54,559
i think the thing that you're looking at

3104
01:44:53,439 --> 01:44:56,799
that i do agree with

3105
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:59,679
is that there's a psychological

3106
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,440
disposition towards construction

3107
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:02,960
right and the psychological disposition

3108
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:04,479
more towards destruction obviously

3109
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,760
everybody has both and can toggle

3110
01:45:04,479 --> 01:45:08,399
between both

3111
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:09,600
and oftentimes one is willing to destroy

3112
01:45:08,399 --> 01:45:11,039
certain things we have this idea of

3113
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:12,719
creative destruction right willing to

3114
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:13,519
destroy certain things to create other

3115
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:16,319
things

3116
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:18,000
and utilitarianism and trolley problems

3117
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:19,439
are all about exploring that space and

3118
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,359
the idea of

3119
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:23,118
war is all about that i am trying to

3120
01:45:21,359 --> 01:45:24,559
create something for our people

3121
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:27,759
and it requires destroying some other

3122
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,760
people um

3123
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,080
sociopathy is a funny topic because it's

3124
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:32,879
possible to have very high fealty to

3125
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:35,039
your in-group

3126
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:36,560
and work on perfecting the methods of

3127
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:38,880
torture to the out group

3128
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:41,280
um at the same time because you can

3129
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:44,480
dehumanize and then remove empathy

3130
01:45:41,279 --> 01:45:48,158
um and

3131
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:51,198
i would also say that there are types

3132
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:53,519
so the reason the thing that gives hope

3133
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:55,118
about the orientation towards

3134
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,880
construction and destruction

3135
01:45:55,118 --> 01:45:59,519
being a little different in psychologies

3136
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:01,359
is what it takes to build really

3137
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,880
catastrophic tech

3138
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:04,719
even today where it doesn't take what it

3139
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,760
took to make a new small group people

3140
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:08,239
could do it

3141
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:09,119
takes still some real technical

3142
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:11,198
knowledge

3143
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:13,759
that required having studied for a while

3144
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:15,759
and some been building capacity

3145
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:16,880
and there's a question of is that

3146
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:20,079
psychologically

3147
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:23,760
inversely correlated with the desire to

3148
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:23,760
damage civilization meaningfully

3149
01:46:24,238 --> 01:46:30,559
a little bit a little bit i think um

3150
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,359
i think a lot i think it's actually i

3151
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:33,199
mean

3152
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:35,920
this is the conversation i had like with

3153
01:46:33,198 --> 01:46:38,559
i think offline with dan carlin

3154
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,520
which is like it's pretty easy to come

3155
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:42,239
up with ways

3156
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:44,880
that any competent i can come up with a

3157
01:46:42,238 --> 01:46:47,279
lot of ways to hurt a lot of people

3158
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,079
and it's pretty easy like i alone can do

3159
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:51,198
it

3160
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:53,439
and like

3161
01:46:51,198 --> 01:46:55,039
there's a lot of people as smart or

3162
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:57,919
smarter than me

3163
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:58,238
at least in the creation of explosives

3164
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:01,840
why

3165
01:46:58,238 --> 01:47:05,439
are we not seeing more insane

3166
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:09,199
mass murder i i think there's something

3167
01:47:05,439 --> 01:47:11,919
fascinating and beautiful about this yes

3168
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:13,839
and it does have to do with some deeply

3169
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,440
pro-social types of characteristics in

3170
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:19,520
humans and

3171
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:20,479
um but when you're dealing with very

3172
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,080
large numbers

3173
01:47:20,479 --> 01:47:24,079
you don't need a whole lot of a

3174
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:26,000
phenomena and so then you start to say

3175
01:47:24,079 --> 01:47:27,519
well what's the probability that x won't

3176
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,039
happen this year then won't happen in

3177
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,920
the next two years three years four

3178
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:31,840
years

3179
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,760
and then how many people are doing

3180
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,360
destructive things with lower tech

3181
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:36,800
and then how many of them can get access

3182
01:47:35,359 --> 01:47:38,960
to higher tech that they didn't have to

3183
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:42,079
figure out how to build

3184
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:45,039
so when i can get

3185
01:47:42,079 --> 01:47:46,559
commercial tech and maybe i don't

3186
01:47:45,039 --> 01:47:48,238
understand tech very well but

3187
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:50,400
i understand it well enough to utilize

3188
01:47:48,238 --> 01:47:51,198
it not to create it and i can repurpose

3189
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:54,799
it

3190
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:56,719
when we saw that commercial drone with a

3191
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:58,960
homemade thermite bomb hit the ukraine

3192
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:00,719
ukrainian munitions factory and do the

3193
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:03,920
equivalent of an incendiary bomb

3194
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:05,039
level of damage that's just home tech

3195
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:08,399
that's just simple

3196
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:11,760
kind of thing and so the

3197
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:13,118
question is not what is does it stay

3198
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,719
being a small percentage of the

3199
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:18,000
population the question is

3200
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:20,560
does can you bind that phenomena nearly

3201
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,560
completely

3202
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:25,039
and especially now when you as you start

3203
01:48:24,319 --> 01:48:27,118
to get into

3204
01:48:25,039 --> 01:48:28,960
bigger things crisper gene drive

3205
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:30,559
technologies and various things like

3206
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:34,000
that

3207
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:36,480
can you bind it completely long term

3208
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
over what period of time not perfectly

3209
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:41,039
though that's the thing i'm trying

3210
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:44,479
i'm trying to say that there is some

3211
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:47,840
let's call it uh let's uh a random word

3212
01:48:44,479 --> 01:48:50,799
love that's inherent in

3213
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:52,079
that's core to human nature that's

3214
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:55,119
preventing

3215
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:57,760
destruction at scale and you're saying

3216
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:59,679
yeah but there's a lot of humans there's

3217
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,360
going to be eight plus billion

3218
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:03,118
and then there's a lot of seconds in the

3219
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:05,920
day to come up with stuff there's a lot

3220
01:49:03,118 --> 01:49:07,679
of pain in the world that can lead to a

3221
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,279
distorted view of the world such that

3222
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:10,480
you want to channel that pain into the

3223
01:49:09,279 --> 01:49:12,319
destruction

3224
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:14,158
all those kinds of things and it's only

3225
01:49:12,319 --> 01:49:15,359
a matter of time that any one individual

3226
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:18,879
can do large damage

3227
01:49:15,359 --> 01:49:21,519
especially as we create more and more

3228
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:23,039
democratized decentralized ways to

3229
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,159
deliver that damage even if you don't

3230
01:49:23,039 --> 01:49:27,599
know how to build the

3231
01:49:24,158 --> 01:49:32,158
initial weapon you can but the thing is

3232
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:36,719
it seems like it's a race between

3233
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:40,399
the cheapening of destructive weapons

3234
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:41,679
and the capacity of humans to express

3235
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:44,799
their love

3236
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:46,319
towards each other and it's a race that

3237
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:48,880
so far

3238
01:49:46,319 --> 01:49:49,759
i know on twitter you it's not popular

3239
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,639
to say but

3240
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:55,119
love is winning okay so what is the

3241
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:58,079
argument that love is going to lose here

3242
01:49:55,118 --> 01:49:58,799
against uh nuclear weapons and biotech

3243
01:49:58,079 --> 01:50:02,079
and

3244
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:05,440
and ai and uh and drones

3245
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:07,760
okay i'm gonna come at the end of this

3246
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:09,359
to a how love wins so i just want you to

3247
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,840
know that that's where i'm oriented

3248
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:13,359
that's the end but i'm i'm going to

3249
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:17,119
argue against

3250
01:50:13,359 --> 01:50:19,920
why that is a given because it

3251
01:50:17,118 --> 01:50:20,639
because it's not a given i don't believe

3252
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,719
and i think

3253
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:24,960
this is a good romantic comedy so you're

3254
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:27,039
going to create drama right now

3255
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,800
but it will end in a happy ending well

3256
01:50:27,039 --> 01:50:30,399
it's because it's only a happy ending if

3257
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,920
we actually understand the issues well

3258
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:32,399
enough and take responsibility to shift

3259
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:34,480
it

3260
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:36,479
do i believe like there's a reason why

3261
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:38,879
there's so much more dystopic sci-fi

3262
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:40,000
than topic sci-fi and the in the some

3263
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:45,359
pro topic sci-fi

3264
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:47,520
usually requires magic is because

3265
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:49,279
or at least magical tech right dilithium

3266
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:52,560
crystals and warp drives and stuff

3267
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:54,238
because it's very hard to imagine

3268
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:56,480
people like the people we have been in

3269
01:50:54,238 --> 01:51:00,000
the history books

3270
01:50:56,479 --> 01:51:02,238
with exponential type

3271
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,840
technology and power that don't

3272
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:05,439
eventually blow themselves up

3273
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,960
that make good enough choices as

3274
01:51:05,439 --> 01:51:08,158
stewards of their environment and their

3275
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,560
comments and

3276
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:12,000
and each other and etc so like it's

3277
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,440
easier to think of scenarios where we

3278
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,960
blow ourselves up than it is to think of

3279
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:16,479
scenarios where we avoid every single

3280
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:18,000
scenario where we blow ourselves up

3281
01:51:16,479 --> 01:51:20,319
and when i say blow ourselves up i also

3282
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,639
i mean the environmental versions

3283
01:51:20,319 --> 01:51:24,559
the terrorist versions the war versions

3284
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:28,000
the cumulative externalities

3285
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:29,840
versions um

3286
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,039
can i and i'm sorry if i'm interrupting

3287
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,239
your flow of thought

3288
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:36,399
but why is it easier is it could be a

3289
01:51:34,238 --> 01:51:38,479
weird psychological thing where we

3290
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:40,960
either was just more capable to

3291
01:51:38,479 --> 01:51:42,959
visualize explosions and destruction

3292
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:44,399
and then the sicker thought which is

3293
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,239
like we kind of enjoy

3294
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:47,359
for some weird reason thinking about

3295
01:51:46,238 --> 01:51:48,799
that kind of stuff even though we

3296
01:51:47,359 --> 01:51:51,439
wouldn't actually

3297
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:53,440
act on it it's almost like some weird uh

3298
01:51:51,439 --> 01:51:56,158
like i love playing shooter games

3299
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:56,479
you know uh first person shooters and

3300
01:51:56,158 --> 01:51:58,479
like

3301
01:51:56,479 --> 01:51:59,519
especially if it's like murdering zombie

3302
01:51:58,479 --> 01:52:01,839
and doom

3303
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,719
you're shooting demons i played one of

3304
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,800
my favorite games

3305
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:06,639
diablo is like slashing through

3306
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:08,239
different monsters and the screaming and

3307
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,800
pain and the hellfire

3308
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:12,399
and then i go out into the real world uh

3309
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,199
to eat my coconut ice cream and i'm all

3310
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:16,879
about love

3311
01:52:13,198 --> 01:52:19,519
so like i can we trust our ability to

3312
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:22,639
visualize how all it all goes to [ __ ]

3313
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:23,520
as an actual rational way of thinking i

3314
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:25,920
think it's a

3315
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:27,280
fair question to say to what degree is

3316
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:30,719
there just kind of

3317
01:52:27,279 --> 01:52:32,559
perverse fantasy and

3318
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:34,399
morbid exploration and whatever else

3319
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,599
that happens in our imagination

3320
01:52:34,399 --> 01:52:37,920
uh but i don't think that's the whole of

3321
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:41,199
it

3322
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:43,520
i think there is also a reality to the

3323
01:52:41,198 --> 01:52:45,118
combinatorial possibility space

3324
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:47,920
and the difference in the probabilities

3325
01:52:45,118 --> 01:52:48,559
that there's a lot of ways i could try

3326
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:50,399
to put

3327
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:52,880
the 70 trillion cells of your body

3328
01:52:50,399 --> 01:52:54,238
together that don't make you

3329
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:55,440
there's not that many ways i can put

3330
01:52:54,238 --> 01:52:56,799
them together that make you there's a

3331
01:52:55,439 --> 01:52:58,399
lot of ways i can try to connect the

3332
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,679
organs together that make some weird

3333
01:52:58,399 --> 01:53:02,158
kind of

3334
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:03,679
group of organs on a on a desk but that

3335
01:53:02,158 --> 01:53:07,439
doesn't actually make a functioning

3336
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:09,118
human and and you can kill an adult

3337
01:53:07,439 --> 01:53:10,079
human in a second but you can't get one

3338
01:53:09,118 --> 01:53:12,000
in a second takes

3339
01:53:10,079 --> 01:53:13,760
20 years to grow one and a lot of things

3340
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,399
to happen right i could destroy this

3341
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:17,679
building

3342
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:19,439
in a couple minutes with demolition

3343
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:21,679
but it took a year or a couple years to

3344
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:24,479
build it there is

3345
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:27,599
uh there's outdone coal this is just an

3346
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:30,079
example it's not he doesn't mean it

3347
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:32,159
there's a there's a gradient where

3348
01:53:30,079 --> 01:53:35,279
entropy is easier

3349
01:53:32,158 --> 01:53:36,879
and there's a lot more ways to put a set

3350
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:38,399
of things together that don't work than

3351
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:40,480
the few that really do produce higher

3352
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:43,839
order synergies

3353
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:43,839
and so

3354
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:49,599
when we look at a history of war and

3355
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:51,279
then we look at

3356
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:52,560
exponentially more powerful warfare an

3357
01:53:51,279 --> 01:53:53,439
arms race that drives that in all these

3358
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,560
directions

3359
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:56,238
and when we look at a history of

3360
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:57,520
environmental destruction and

3361
01:53:56,238 --> 01:53:59,279
exponentially more powerful tech that

3362
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:00,960
makes exponential externalities

3363
01:53:59,279 --> 01:54:02,238
multiplied by the total number of agents

3364
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,359
that are doing it in the cumulative

3365
01:54:02,238 --> 01:54:04,959
effects

3366
01:54:03,359 --> 01:54:07,279
there's a lot of ways the whole thing

3367
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:09,118
can break like a lot of different ways

3368
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:11,599
and for it to get ahead it has to have

3369
01:54:09,118 --> 01:54:14,880
none of those happen

3370
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:16,400
and so there's just a probability space

3371
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:17,039
where it's easier to imagine that thing

3372
01:54:16,399 --> 01:54:19,519
so

3373
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:21,039
what so to say how do we have a protopic

3374
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:24,080
future we have to say well

3375
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:25,519
one criteria must be that it avoids all

3376
01:54:24,079 --> 01:54:27,519
of the catastrophic risks

3377
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:28,719
so can we understand can we inventory

3378
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:30,320
all the catastrophic risks can we

3379
01:54:28,719 --> 01:54:31,920
inventory the patterns of human behavior

3380
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:34,960
that give rise to them

3381
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:36,000
and could we try to solve for that and

3382
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:38,800
could we have that be

3383
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,399
the the essence of the social technology

3384
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:42,159
that we're thinking about to be able to

3385
01:54:40,399 --> 01:54:43,839
guide bind and direct a new physical

3386
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:45,118
technology because so far our physical

3387
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,719
technology

3388
01:54:45,118 --> 01:54:48,799
like we were talking about the genghis

3389
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:50,560
khans and like that that obviously use

3390
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:52,719
certain kinds of physical

3391
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:54,159
technology and armaments um and also

3392
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:55,439
social technology and unconventional

3393
01:54:54,158 --> 01:54:58,158
warfare

3394
01:54:55,439 --> 01:54:59,839
for a particular set of purposes but we

3395
01:54:58,158 --> 01:55:03,519
have things that don't look like warfare

3396
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:05,920
like rockefeller and standard oil

3397
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:06,880
and it looked like a constructive

3398
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:10,319
mindset

3399
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,960
to be able to bring this new energy

3400
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:14,399
resource

3401
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:15,599
to the world and it did and the second

3402
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:18,719
order effects of that

3403
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:21,279
are climate change

3404
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:23,118
and all of the oil spills that have

3405
01:55:21,279 --> 01:55:25,759
happened and will happen

3406
01:55:23,118 --> 01:55:27,598
and all of the wars in the middle east

3407
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:30,880
over the oil that have been there

3408
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:32,000
and the massive political [ __ ]

3409
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:33,920
and human life issues that are

3410
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:37,520
associated with it and

3411
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:40,960
on and on right um and so

3412
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:43,040
it's also not just

3413
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:44,639
the orientation to construct a thing can

3414
01:55:43,039 --> 01:55:46,399
have a narrow focus on what i'm trying

3415
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:47,599
to construct but be affecting a lot of

3416
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:48,799
other things through second and

3417
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:50,239
third-order effects i'm not taking

3418
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:52,239
responsibility for

3419
01:55:50,238 --> 01:55:53,519
and you you you often another and

3420
01:55:52,238 --> 01:55:56,000
another tangent

3421
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:57,040
mentioned second third and fourth order

3422
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,158
effects

3423
01:55:57,039 --> 01:56:02,719
and order and and skating which is

3424
01:56:00,158 --> 01:56:04,559
really fascinating like starting with

3425
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:08,079
the third order

3426
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:09,520
plus it gets really interesting

3427
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:11,039
because we we don't we don't even

3428
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,679
acknowledge like the second order

3429
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:14,639
effects

3430
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:15,199
right but like thinking because those it

3431
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,400
could mat

3432
01:56:15,198 --> 01:56:18,799
it could get bigger and bigger and

3433
01:56:16,399 --> 01:56:20,559
bigger in ways we're not anticipating

3434
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:23,279
so how do we make those so it sounds

3435
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:25,280
like part of the

3436
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:27,359
part of the thing that you are thinking

3437
01:56:25,279 --> 01:56:30,238
through in terms of a solution

3438
01:56:27,359 --> 01:56:32,559
how to create an anti-fray agile a

3439
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:36,399
resilient society

3440
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:39,440
is to make explicit

3441
01:56:36,399 --> 01:56:40,960
acknowledge understand the externalities

3442
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:43,198
the second order

3443
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:44,560
third order fourth order and the order

3444
01:56:43,198 --> 01:56:46,000
effects

3445
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:47,760
how do we start to think about those

3446
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,520
effects

3447
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,800
yeah the war application is harm we're

3448
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,400
trying to cause or that we're aware

3449
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:55,119
we're causing right

3450
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:56,960
um the externality is harm that at least

3451
01:56:55,118 --> 01:56:59,039
supposedly we're not aware we're causing

3452
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,800
or at minimum it's not our intention

3453
01:56:59,039 --> 01:57:02,319
right maybe we're either totally unaware

3454
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,760
of it or we're aware of it but

3455
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:05,118
it is a side effect of what our

3456
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:06,320
intention is it's not the intention

3457
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:08,238
itself

3458
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:10,399
there are catastrophic risks from both

3459
01:57:08,238 --> 01:57:13,519
types the direct application

3460
01:57:10,399 --> 01:57:15,920
of increased technological power to a

3461
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:17,840
rivalrous intent

3462
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:19,440
which is going to cause harm for some

3463
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:20,960
out group for some in-group to win

3464
01:57:19,439 --> 01:57:22,879
but the out group is also working on

3465
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:25,039
growing the tech and if they don't lose

3466
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:26,960
completely they reverse engineer the tac

3467
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:29,760
up regulator come back with more

3468
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:30,880
capacity so there's the exponential tech

3469
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:33,599
arms race

3470
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:35,118
side of in-group out-group rivalry using

3471
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:36,079
exponential tech that is one set of

3472
01:57:35,118 --> 01:57:39,279
risks

3473
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:41,679
and the other set of risks is

3474
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:42,719
the application of exponentially more

3475
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:46,000
powerful tech

3476
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:47,760
not intentionally to try and beat an out

3477
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,439
group but to try to achieve some goal

3478
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:51,119
that we have but that produces second

3479
01:57:49,439 --> 01:57:54,479
and third order effects

3480
01:57:51,118 --> 01:57:55,519
that do have harm to the commons to

3481
01:57:54,479 --> 01:57:58,799
other people to

3482
01:57:55,520 --> 01:58:01,440
environment to other groups

3483
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:02,639
that might actually be bigger problems

3484
01:58:01,439 --> 01:58:03,759
than the problem we were originally

3485
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:05,118
trying to solve with the thing we were

3486
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:09,119
building

3487
01:58:05,118 --> 01:58:10,399
when facebook was building a dating app

3488
01:58:09,118 --> 01:58:12,799
and then building a social app where

3489
01:58:10,399 --> 01:58:16,000
people could tag pictures

3490
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:17,599
they weren't trying to build a democracy

3491
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:22,238
destroying app

3492
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:25,599
uh that would maximize time on site

3493
01:58:22,238 --> 01:58:27,678
as part of its ad model through ai

3494
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:29,279
optimization of a news feed to the thing

3495
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:31,118
that made people spend most time on site

3496
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:32,479
which is usually them being limbically

3497
01:58:31,118 --> 01:58:34,000
hijacked more than

3498
01:58:32,479 --> 01:58:36,079
something else which ends up appealing

3499
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,279
to people's cognitive biases and group

3500
01:58:36,079 --> 01:58:39,679
identities

3501
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:40,880
and creates no sense of shared reality

3502
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:42,800
they weren't trying to do that but it

3503
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:45,599
was a second order effect

3504
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:47,440
and it's a pretty [ __ ] powerful

3505
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:50,000
second order effect

3506
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:51,519
um and a pretty fast one because the

3507
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,279
rate of tech is obviously

3508
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:54,960
able to get distributed to much larger

3509
01:58:53,279 --> 01:58:57,439
scale much faster and

3510
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:59,198
with a bigger jump in terms of total

3511
01:58:57,439 --> 01:59:00,479
vertical capacity then that's what it

3512
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:02,719
means to get to the verticalizing part

3513
01:59:00,479 --> 01:59:06,319
of an exponential curve

3514
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:08,079
so um just like we can see

3515
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:09,679
that oil had these second order

3516
01:59:08,079 --> 01:59:11,198
environmental effects and also social

3517
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:14,560
and political effects

3518
01:59:11,198 --> 01:59:17,678
war and so much of the whole

3519
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:19,599
like the total amount of oil used is

3520
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:20,719
has a proportionality to total global

3521
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:22,079
gdp

3522
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:24,800
and that's why we have this you know the

3523
01:59:22,079 --> 01:59:28,079
petrodollar and um

3524
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:30,400
and so the the oil thing also had the

3525
01:59:28,079 --> 01:59:31,679
externalities of a major aspect of what

3526
01:59:30,399 --> 01:59:33,519
happened with military industrial

3527
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:35,840
complex and things like that

3528
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:36,719
so but we can see the same thing with

3529
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:38,319
with

3530
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:39,920
more current technologies with facebook

3531
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:44,639
and google and

3532
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:46,800
other things so i don't think we can run

3533
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:48,239
and the more powerful the tech is we

3534
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:51,599
build it for

3535
01:59:48,238 --> 01:59:52,959
reason x whatever reason x is maybe x is

3536
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:56,000
three things maybe it's one thing

3537
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:57,118
right we we're doing the oil thing

3538
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,800
because we want to make

3539
01:59:57,118 --> 02:00:00,238
cars because it's a better method of

3540
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:01,279
individual transportation we're building

3541
02:00:00,238 --> 02:00:03,118
the facebook thing because we're going

3542
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:04,399
to connect people socially in a personal

3543
02:00:03,118 --> 02:00:07,279
sphere

3544
02:00:04,399 --> 02:00:08,638
but it it interferes with it interacts

3545
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:11,759
with complex systems

3546
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:14,239
with ecologies economies psychologies

3547
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:16,320
cultures and so it has effects on other

3548
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:18,879
than the thing we're intending

3549
02:00:16,319 --> 02:00:20,319
some of those effects can end up being

3550
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:21,599
negative effects but because this

3551
02:00:20,319 --> 02:00:24,479
technology

3552
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:25,840
if if we make it to solve a problem it

3553
02:00:24,479 --> 02:00:26,959
has to overcome the problem the

3554
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:28,000
problem's been around for a while it's

3555
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,118
going to overcome in a short period of

3556
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,198
time so it usually has

3557
02:00:29,118 --> 02:00:32,399
greater scale greater rate of magnitude

3558
02:00:31,198 --> 02:00:34,719
in some way

3559
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:37,359
that also means that the externalities

3560
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:39,359
that it creates might be bigger problems

3561
02:00:37,359 --> 02:00:40,719
and you can say well but then that's the

3562
02:00:39,359 --> 02:00:41,598
new problem humanity will innovate its

3563
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:43,039
way out of that

3564
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:44,639
well i don't think that's paying

3565
02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:46,719
attention to the fact that we can't keep

3566
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:49,199
up with exponential curves

3567
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:51,920
like that nor do finite spaces allow

3568
02:00:49,198 --> 02:00:54,799
exponential externalities forever

3569
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:56,158
and this is why a lot of the smartest

3570
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:58,480
people thinking about this are

3571
02:00:56,158 --> 02:00:59,759
thinking well no i think we're totally

3572
02:00:58,479 --> 02:01:01,519
screwed and

3573
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:03,679
unless we can make a benevolent ai

3574
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:06,239
singleton that rules all of us

3575
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:06,719
um you know guys like bostrom and and

3576
02:01:06,238 --> 02:01:08,000
others

3577
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:09,760
uh thinking in those directions because

3578
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,198
they're like how do

3579
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:15,599
humans try to do multi-polarity

3580
02:01:13,198 --> 02:01:16,479
and make it work and i i have a

3581
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:18,079
different answer

3582
02:01:16,479 --> 02:01:20,158
of what i think it looks like that does

3583
02:01:18,079 --> 02:01:21,760
have more to do with the

3584
02:01:20,158 --> 02:01:23,198
love but some applied social tech

3585
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:24,560
alignment aligned with

3586
02:01:23,198 --> 02:01:26,238
good because i have a bunch of really

3587
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:28,320
dumb ideas

3588
02:01:26,238 --> 02:01:29,839
i prefer to uh i'd like to hear i'd like

3589
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:32,719
to hear some of them first

3590
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:34,159
i think the idea i would have is uh to

3591
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:39,520
be a bit more rigorous

3592
02:01:34,158 --> 02:01:42,479
in trying to measure the amount of

3593
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,880
love you add or subtract from the world

3594
02:01:42,479 --> 02:01:46,238
in

3595
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:48,400
second third fourth fifth order effects

3596
02:01:46,238 --> 02:01:49,519
it's actually i think especially in the

3597
02:01:48,399 --> 02:01:53,039
world of tech

3598
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:54,719
quite doable you know you just might not

3599
02:01:53,039 --> 02:01:56,399
like

3600
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:58,079
you know the the shareholders may not

3601
02:01:56,399 --> 02:02:01,039
like that kind of metric

3602
02:01:58,079 --> 02:02:03,679
but it's pretty easy to measure like

3603
02:02:01,039 --> 02:02:06,560
that's not even uh

3604
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:08,000
i'm perhaps half joking about love but

3605
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,639
we could talk about just happiness and

3606
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,520
well-being

3607
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:13,840
long-term well-being it's pretty easy

3608
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:17,199
for facebook for youtube for all these

3609
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:18,960
companies to measure that they do a lot

3610
02:02:17,198 --> 02:02:21,039
of kinds of surveys they could do i mean

3611
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:24,239
there's very simple solutions here

3612
02:02:21,039 --> 02:02:26,639
that you could just survey how i mean

3613
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:27,279
servers are in some sense use useless

3614
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:31,279
because they're

3615
02:02:27,279 --> 02:02:32,880
um a subset of the population you're

3616
02:02:31,279 --> 02:02:34,238
just trying to get a sense it's very

3617
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:36,000
loose kind of understanding

3618
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:38,079
but integrated deeply as part of the

3619
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,920
technology most of our tech is

3620
02:02:38,079 --> 02:02:43,439
recommender systems most of the

3621
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:45,679
sorry not tech uh online interactions

3622
02:02:43,439 --> 02:02:48,399
driven by recommender systems that

3623
02:02:45,679 --> 02:02:49,920
learn very little data about you and use

3624
02:02:48,399 --> 02:02:52,000
that data

3625
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:53,679
based on mostly based on traces your

3626
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,920
previous behavior to suggest

3627
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:58,000
future things this is how twitter is how

3628
02:02:55,920 --> 02:03:00,480
facebook works this is how

3629
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:02,399
adsense for google adsense works is how

3630
02:03:00,479 --> 02:03:04,319
netflix youtube work and so on

3631
02:03:02,399 --> 02:03:06,238
and and for them to just track as

3632
02:03:04,319 --> 02:03:08,238
opposed to engagement

3633
02:03:06,238 --> 02:03:09,839
how much you spend in a particular video

3634
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:13,759
a particular site

3635
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:14,079
is also track give you the technology to

3636
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:16,960
do

3637
02:03:14,079 --> 02:03:19,359
self-report of what makes you feel good

3638
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:22,399
what makes you grow as a person

3639
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:25,679
of what makes you uh

3640
02:03:22,399 --> 02:03:29,439
you know the best version of yourself

3641
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:30,800
the the the rogan uh idea of the hero of

3642
02:03:29,439 --> 02:03:32,559
your movie

3643
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:34,000
and just add that little bit of

3644
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:36,159
information

3645
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:38,000
if you you have people you have this

3646
02:03:36,158 --> 02:03:40,960
like happiness surveys of

3647
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,719
how you feel about the last five days

3648
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:44,880
how would you report your experience

3649
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:45,840
you can lay out the set of videos this

3650
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:47,279
is kind of fascinating

3651
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:49,360
i don't know if you ever look at youtube

3652
02:03:47,279 --> 02:03:51,198
the history of videos you've looked at

3653
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:52,559
it's fascinating it's very embarrassing

3654
02:03:51,198 --> 02:03:55,118
for me like

3655
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:56,320
it'll be like a lecture and then like a

3656
02:03:55,118 --> 02:03:58,559
set of videos

3657
02:03:56,319 --> 02:03:59,599
that i don't want anyone to know about

3658
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:02,239
which is

3659
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:04,319
which which will be like i don't know

3660
02:04:02,238 --> 02:04:05,598
maybe like five videos in a row where it

3661
02:04:04,319 --> 02:04:07,439
looks like i watched the whole thing

3662
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:08,239
which i probably did about like how to

3663
02:04:07,439 --> 02:04:10,559
cook a steak

3664
02:04:08,238 --> 02:04:12,238
even though or just like with the best

3665
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:13,760
chefs in the world cooking steaks and

3666
02:04:12,238 --> 02:04:15,759
i'm just like

3667
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:17,760
sitting there watching it for no purpose

3668
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:21,119
whatsoever wasting away my life

3669
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:23,119
or like funny cat videos or like legit

3670
02:04:21,118 --> 02:04:25,118
that that doesn't that's always a good

3671
02:04:23,118 --> 02:04:27,279
one and i could look back

3672
02:04:25,118 --> 02:04:29,039
and rate which videos made me a better

3673
02:04:27,279 --> 02:04:31,679
person and not

3674
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:33,198
and i mean on a more serious note

3675
02:04:31,679 --> 02:04:34,239
there's a bunch of conversations

3676
02:04:33,198 --> 02:04:36,399
podcasts or

3677
02:04:34,238 --> 02:04:37,279
lectures i've watched which made me a

3678
02:04:36,399 --> 02:04:40,000
better person

3679
02:04:37,279 --> 02:04:40,800
and some of it made me a worse person

3680
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,719
quite honestly

3681
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,719
not for stupid reasons like i feel

3682
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:47,439
dumber but because i do

3683
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:49,760
have a sense that that started me on a

3684
02:04:47,439 --> 02:04:49,759
path

3685
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:54,400
of

3686
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:55,598
of not being kind to other people for

3687
02:04:54,399 --> 02:04:58,078
example i'll give you

3688
02:04:55,599 --> 02:04:59,520
uh for my own and i'm sorry for ranting

3689
02:04:58,078 --> 02:05:02,319
but maybe there's some usefulness to

3690
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:06,000
this kind of exploration of self

3691
02:05:02,319 --> 02:05:09,519
when i focus on creating on programming

3692
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:12,479
on science i become

3693
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:14,320
a much deeper thinker and a kinder

3694
02:05:12,479 --> 02:05:16,399
person to others

3695
02:05:14,319 --> 02:05:18,559
when i listen to too many a little bit

3696
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:22,158
as good but too many

3697
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:24,159
podcasts or videos about how how our

3698
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:27,279
world is melting down

3699
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:29,198
or criticizing ridiculous people the

3700
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:32,158
worst of the quote unquote woke

3701
02:05:29,198 --> 02:05:34,638
for example all there's all these groups

3702
02:05:32,158 --> 02:05:36,879
that are misbehaving in fascinating ways

3703
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:39,118
because they've been corrupted by power

3704
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,800
the more i want the more i watch

3705
02:05:39,118 --> 02:05:44,000
criticism

3706
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:46,960
of them the worse i become

3707
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,279
and i'm aware of this but i'm also aware

3708
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:49,279
that

3709
02:05:47,279 --> 02:05:50,800
for some reason it's pleasant to watch

3710
02:05:49,279 --> 02:05:53,279
those sometimes

3711
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:54,719
and so for for me to be able to

3712
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:55,679
self-report that to the youtube

3713
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:57,760
algorithm

3714
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:59,440
to the systems around me and they

3715
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:01,840
ultimately try to optimize

3716
02:05:59,439 --> 02:06:03,039
to make me the best person the best

3717
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:04,960
version of myself

3718
02:06:03,039 --> 02:06:06,560
which i personally believe would make

3719
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:08,158
youtube a lot more money because i'd be

3720
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:08,960
much more willing to spend time on

3721
02:06:08,158 --> 02:06:11,359
youtube and give

3722
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:12,000
youtube a lot more a lot more of my

3723
02:06:11,359 --> 02:06:14,719
money

3724
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:16,639
that's a that's great for business and

3725
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:17,920
great for humanity because it'll make me

3726
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:21,440
a kinder person

3727
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:24,719
it'll increase the the love quotient

3728
02:06:21,439 --> 02:06:26,238
the love metric and uh it'll make them a

3729
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:26,800
lot of money i feel like everything is

3730
02:06:26,238 --> 02:06:29,039
aligned

3731
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:30,719
and so you should do that not just for

3732
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:32,719
youtube algorithm but also for our

3733
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:33,599
military strategy and whether to go to

3734
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:35,760
war or not

3735
02:06:33,599 --> 02:06:37,599
because one externality you can think of

3736
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:40,079
about going to war

3737
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:41,039
which i think we talked about offline is

3738
02:06:40,078 --> 02:06:43,439
we often go to

3739
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:44,158
war with kind of governments with a uh

3740
02:06:43,439 --> 02:06:46,399
with

3741
02:06:44,158 --> 02:06:47,198
not with the people you have to think

3742
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:51,519
about

3743
02:06:47,198 --> 02:06:51,519
the kids of countries

3744
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:57,840
that see a soldier and

3745
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:59,679
because of what they experienced their

3746
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:02,319
interaction with the soldier

3747
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:03,279
hate is born when you're like eight

3748
02:07:02,319 --> 02:07:05,359
years old

3749
02:07:03,279 --> 02:07:06,880
six years old you lose your dad you lose

3750
02:07:05,359 --> 02:07:09,039
your mom

3751
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:10,000
you lose a friend somebody close to you

3752
02:07:09,039 --> 02:07:12,078
that want a

3753
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,439
really powerful externality that could

3754
02:07:12,078 --> 02:07:16,479
be reduced to love

3755
02:07:13,439 --> 02:07:18,238
positive and negative is uh

3756
02:07:16,479 --> 02:07:20,879
the hate that's born when you make

3757
02:07:18,238 --> 02:07:23,919
decisions and that's going to

3758
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:25,760
take fruition that that little seed is

3759
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:26,960
going to become a tree that then leads

3760
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:30,000
to the kind of destruction

3761
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:30,000
that we talk about

3762
02:07:30,639 --> 02:07:35,118
so but my sense it's possible to reduce

3763
02:07:33,118 --> 02:07:38,078
everything to a measure of how much love

3764
02:07:35,118 --> 02:07:38,078
does this add to the world

3765
02:07:38,479 --> 02:07:42,959
all that to say uh do you have ideas of

3766
02:07:41,198 --> 02:07:46,078
how we practically

3767
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:50,000
uh build systems

3768
02:07:46,078 --> 02:07:51,359
that that create a resilient society

3769
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,599
there are a lot of good things that you

3770
02:07:51,359 --> 02:07:55,598
shared where there's like

3771
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:57,599
15 different ways that we could enter

3772
02:07:55,599 --> 02:07:59,119
this that are all interesting so i'm

3773
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:01,119
trying to see which one will probably be

3774
02:07:59,118 --> 02:08:02,479
most useful pick the uh

3775
02:08:01,118 --> 02:08:05,839
the one or two things that are at least

3776
02:08:02,479 --> 02:08:09,598
ridiculous when you're mentioning

3777
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:11,279
if we could see some of the

3778
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:12,239
second order effects or externalities

3779
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:13,359
that we aren't used to seeing

3780
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:15,439
specifically the one

3781
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:17,439
of a kid being radicalized somewhere

3782
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:18,799
else which engenders enmity in them

3783
02:08:17,439 --> 02:08:20,078
towards us which decreases our own

3784
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:21,360
future security

3785
02:08:20,078 --> 02:08:22,479
even if you don't care about the kid if

3786
02:08:21,359 --> 02:08:23,519
you care about the kids the whole other

3787
02:08:22,479 --> 02:08:27,039
thing

3788
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:28,880
um yeah i mean i think when

3789
02:08:27,039 --> 02:08:30,960
we saw this when jane fonda and others

3790
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:32,560
went to vietnam and took

3791
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:34,078
photos and videos of what was happening

3792
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:37,280
and you got to see the pictures of

3793
02:08:34,078 --> 02:08:40,479
the kids with napalm on them uh

3794
02:08:37,279 --> 02:08:42,158
that like the anti-war effort was

3795
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:43,519
bolstered by that in a way it couldn't

3796
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:46,719
have been without that there's

3797
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:48,639
there's a until we can see the images

3798
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:50,560
you can't have a mere neuron

3799
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:52,078
effect in the same way and when you can

3800
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:54,000
that starts to have a

3801
02:08:52,078 --> 02:08:55,198
powerful effect i think there's a deep

3802
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:58,560
principle that you're

3803
02:08:55,198 --> 02:09:02,479
sharing there which is

3804
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:03,679
that if we we can have a rivalrous

3805
02:09:02,479 --> 02:09:06,399
intent

3806
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:07,920
where our in-group whatever it is maybe

3807
02:09:06,399 --> 02:09:08,799
it's our political party wanting to win

3808
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:11,279
within the u.s

3809
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:12,239
maybe it's our nation state wanting to

3810
02:09:11,279 --> 02:09:14,639
win in a

3811
02:09:12,238 --> 02:09:16,479
a war or an economic war over resource

3812
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:18,319
or whatever it is

3813
02:09:16,479 --> 02:09:19,678
that if we don't obliterate the other

3814
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:22,559
people completely

3815
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:25,440
they don't go away they're they're not

3816
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:27,360
engendered to like us more

3817
02:09:25,439 --> 02:09:29,118
they didn't become less smart so they

3818
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:31,118
have more enmity towards us and whatever

3819
02:09:29,118 --> 02:09:32,000
technologies we employ to be successful

3820
02:09:31,118 --> 02:09:34,479
they will now reverse

3821
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,198
engineer make iterations on and come

3822
02:09:34,479 --> 02:09:37,359
back

3823
02:09:35,198 --> 02:09:38,559
and so you drive an arms race which is

3824
02:09:37,359 --> 02:09:41,679
why you can see

3825
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:45,679
that the wars were over

3826
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:49,359
history employing more lethal weaponry

3827
02:09:45,679 --> 02:09:51,118
and not just the kinetic war um

3828
02:09:49,359 --> 02:09:52,559
the information war and the narrative

3829
02:09:51,118 --> 02:09:54,078
war and the

3830
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:56,159
economic war right like it just

3831
02:09:54,078 --> 02:09:57,439
increased capacity in all of those

3832
02:09:56,158 --> 02:10:01,759
fronts

3833
02:09:57,439 --> 02:10:03,519
um and so what seems like a win to us

3834
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:05,119
on the short term might actually really

3835
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:06,960
produce losses in the long term

3836
02:10:05,118 --> 02:10:08,238
and what's even in our own best interest

3837
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:09,359
in the long term is probably more

3838
02:10:08,238 --> 02:10:10,799
aligned with everyone else because we

3839
02:10:09,359 --> 02:10:13,598
inter-affect each other

3840
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:14,719
and i think the thing about globalism

3841
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:16,639
globalization

3842
02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:17,840
and exponential tech and the rate at

3843
02:10:16,639 --> 02:10:19,039
which we affect each other and the rate

3844
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:20,719
at which we affect the biosphere that

3845
02:10:19,039 --> 02:10:24,078
we're all affected by

3846
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:27,279
is that this this kind of

3847
02:10:24,078 --> 02:10:28,639
proverbial spiritual idea that we're all

3848
02:10:27,279 --> 02:10:29,920
interconnected and need to think about

3849
02:10:28,639 --> 02:10:32,880
that in some way

3850
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:33,840
it was easy for tribes to get because

3851
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:35,599
everyone in the tribe

3852
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:37,599
so clearly saw their interconnection and

3853
02:10:35,599 --> 02:10:41,360
dependence on each other

3854
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:42,960
but in terms of a global level the

3855
02:10:41,359 --> 02:10:44,399
the speed at which we are actually

3856
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:46,158
interconnected the speed at which the

3857
02:10:44,399 --> 02:10:48,879
harm happening to something in

3858
02:10:46,158 --> 02:10:50,158
wuhan affects the rest of the world or a

3859
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:51,520
new technology developed somewhere

3860
02:10:50,158 --> 02:10:53,598
affects the entire world or an

3861
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:56,000
environmental issue or whatever

3862
02:10:53,599 --> 02:10:57,039
is making it to where we either actually

3863
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,719
all get

3864
02:10:57,039 --> 02:11:00,158
not as a spiritual idea just even as

3865
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:01,679
physics right we all get

3866
02:11:00,158 --> 02:11:04,238
the interconnectedness of everything and

3867
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:05,679
that we either all consider that and see

3868
02:11:04,238 --> 02:11:06,799
how to make it through more effectively

3869
02:11:05,679 --> 02:11:10,078
together

3870
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:11,599
or failures anywhere end up becoming

3871
02:11:10,078 --> 02:11:13,359
decreased quality of life and failures

3872
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:14,800
and increased risk everywhere don't you

3873
02:11:13,359 --> 02:11:15,519
think people are beginning to experience

3874
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:17,119
that at the

3875
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:19,119
individual level so governments are

3876
02:11:17,118 --> 02:11:20,719
resisting it they're they're trying to

3877
02:11:19,118 --> 02:11:22,158
make us not empathize with each other

3878
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:23,439
feel connected but don't you think

3879
02:11:22,158 --> 02:11:24,799
people are beginning to feel more and

3880
02:11:23,439 --> 02:11:26,158
more connected

3881
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:28,239
like isn't that exactly what the

3882
02:11:26,158 --> 02:11:30,960
technology is enabling like social

3883
02:11:28,238 --> 02:11:34,238
networks we tend to criticize them but

3884
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:37,679
isn't there a sense which were

3885
02:11:34,238 --> 02:11:38,078
experience you know when you watch those

3886
02:11:37,679 --> 02:11:41,039
videos

3887
02:11:38,078 --> 02:11:42,559
that are criticizing whether it's the

3888
02:11:41,039 --> 02:11:45,840
woke antifa side

3889
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:48,719
or the q anon trump supporter side

3890
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:50,400
does it seem like they have increased

3891
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:52,239
empathy for people that are outside of

3892
02:11:50,399 --> 02:11:55,279
their ideological not at all

3893
02:11:52,238 --> 02:11:58,158
so i may be um

3894
02:11:55,279 --> 02:11:58,719
i may be conflating my own experience of

3895
02:11:58,158 --> 02:12:02,078
the world

3896
02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:02,078
and that of uh

3897
02:12:02,319 --> 02:12:08,078
that of the populace i i tend to see

3898
02:12:05,198 --> 02:12:08,078
those videos

3899
02:12:08,399 --> 02:12:11,920
as feeding something that's a relic of

3900
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:16,239
the past

3901
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:19,118
they figured out that drama fuels clicks

3902
02:12:16,238 --> 02:12:20,000
but whether i'm right or wrong i don't

3903
02:12:19,118 --> 02:12:23,359
know but i

3904
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:25,760
tend to sense that that is not

3905
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:27,118
that hunger for drama is not fundamental

3906
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:30,159
to human beings

3907
02:12:27,118 --> 02:12:33,439
that we want to actually

3908
02:12:30,158 --> 02:12:34,000
that we want to understand antifa and we

3909
02:12:33,439 --> 02:12:36,078
want to

3910
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,039
like empathize we want to take radical

3911
02:12:36,078 --> 02:12:40,078
ideas

3912
02:12:37,039 --> 02:12:41,760
and be able to empathize with them and

3913
02:12:40,078 --> 02:12:45,679
synthesize it all

3914
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:49,119
okay let's look at

3915
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:52,319
cultural outliers in terms of

3916
02:12:49,118 --> 02:12:54,719
violence versus compassion we can see

3917
02:12:52,319 --> 02:12:56,880
that a lot of cultures have

3918
02:12:54,719 --> 02:12:58,800
relatively lower in-group violence

3919
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:00,400
bigger out-group violence and there's

3920
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:02,000
some variants in them and variants at

3921
02:13:00,399 --> 02:13:04,319
different times based on the scarcity or

3922
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:07,520
abundance of resource and other things

3923
02:13:04,319 --> 02:13:11,039
but you can look at say

3924
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:12,719
jane's whose whole religion is around

3925
02:13:11,039 --> 02:13:14,719
non-violence so much so that they don't

3926
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:16,480
even hurt plants they only take fruits

3927
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:18,880
that fall off them and stuff

3928
02:13:16,479 --> 02:13:19,759
or to go to a larger population you take

3929
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:21,520
buddhists

3930
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:22,960
where for the most part with a few

3931
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:24,400
exceptions for the most part across

3932
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:26,158
three millennia

3933
02:13:24,399 --> 02:13:27,920
and across lots of different countries

3934
02:13:26,158 --> 02:13:30,158
and geographies and whatever

3935
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:32,880
you have 10 million people plus or minus

3936
02:13:30,158 --> 02:13:34,638
who don't hurt bugs

3937
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:36,078
the whole spectrum of genetic variants

3938
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:37,279
that is happening within a culture of

3939
02:13:36,078 --> 02:13:40,078
that many people

3940
02:13:37,279 --> 02:13:41,759
um and head traumas and whatever and

3941
02:13:40,078 --> 02:13:43,840
nobody hurts bugs

3942
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:45,520
and then you look at a group where the

3943
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:47,360
kids grow up as child soldiers in

3944
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:48,719
liberia or darfur

3945
02:13:47,359 --> 02:13:50,158
where to make it to adulthood pretty

3946
02:13:48,719 --> 02:13:51,439
much everybody's killed people

3947
02:13:50,158 --> 02:13:53,198
hand-to-hand

3948
02:13:51,439 --> 02:13:55,279
and killed people who were civilian or

3949
02:13:53,198 --> 02:13:58,479
innocent type of people

3950
02:13:55,279 --> 02:14:00,078
and you say okay so we were very neonos

3951
02:13:58,479 --> 02:14:01,039
we can be conditioned by our environment

3952
02:14:00,078 --> 02:14:04,078
and humans can

3953
02:14:01,039 --> 02:14:05,599
be conditioned where almost all the

3954
02:14:04,078 --> 02:14:06,880
humans show up in these two different

3955
02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:08,239
bell curves it doesn't mean that the

3956
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:09,760
buddhists had no violence it doesn't

3957
02:14:08,238 --> 02:14:10,479
mean that these people had no compassion

3958
02:14:09,760 --> 02:14:11,920
but the

3959
02:14:10,479 --> 02:14:13,759
they're very different gaussian

3960
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:17,039
distributions

3961
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:17,760
and so i think one of the important

3962
02:14:17,039 --> 02:14:19,840
things

3963
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,199
that i like to do is look at the

3964
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:23,360
examples of the

3965
02:14:21,198 --> 02:14:26,879
populations what buddhism shows

3966
02:14:23,359 --> 02:14:28,880
regarding compassion or what

3967
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:30,480
judaism shows around education the

3968
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:31,840
average level of education that

3969
02:14:30,479 --> 02:14:33,678
everybody gets because of a culture that

3970
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:36,319
is really working on conditioning it or

3971
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:37,760
various cultures what are the positive

3972
02:14:36,319 --> 02:14:40,479
deviants

3973
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:40,960
outside of this statistical deviance to

3974
02:14:40,479 --> 02:14:43,678
see

3975
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:44,319
what is actually possible and then say

3976
02:14:43,679 --> 02:14:46,078
what are the

3977
02:14:44,319 --> 02:14:47,679
conditioning factors and can we

3978
02:14:46,078 --> 02:14:48,719
condition those across a few of them

3979
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:50,239
simultaneously

3980
02:14:48,719 --> 02:14:51,920
and could we build a civilization like

3981
02:14:50,238 --> 02:14:53,839
that becomes a very

3982
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:56,639
interesting question so there's this

3983
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:58,960
kind of real politic idea that

3984
02:14:56,639 --> 02:15:00,400
humans are violent large groups of

3985
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:01,679
humans become

3986
02:15:00,399 --> 02:15:03,279
violent they become irrational

3987
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:04,880
specifically those two things rivalrous

3988
02:15:03,279 --> 02:15:07,039
and violent and irrational

3989
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:08,319
and so in order to minimize the total

3990
02:15:07,039 --> 02:15:10,319
amount of violence and have some good

3991
02:15:08,319 --> 02:15:12,559
decisions they need ruled somehow

3992
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:14,238
and that not getting that is some kind

3993
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:15,039
of naive utopianism that doesn't

3994
02:15:14,238 --> 02:15:16,799
understand

3995
02:15:15,039 --> 02:15:20,000
human nature yet this gets back to like

3996
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:22,159
mimesis of desire as an inexorable thing

3997
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,960
i think the idea of the masses is

3998
02:15:22,158 --> 02:15:27,279
actually a kind of propaganda

3999
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:29,198
um that is useful for the classes that

4000
02:15:27,279 --> 02:15:32,719
control

4001
02:15:29,198 --> 02:15:36,479
um to popularize the idea that most

4002
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:38,319
people are too violent lazy

4003
02:15:36,479 --> 02:15:39,678
undisciplined and irrational to make

4004
02:15:38,319 --> 02:15:41,118
good choices

4005
02:15:39,679 --> 02:15:43,279
and therefore their choices should be

4006
02:15:41,118 --> 02:15:44,799
sublimated in some kind of way

4007
02:15:43,279 --> 02:15:47,439
i think that if we look back at these

4008
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:50,960
conditioning environments

4009
02:15:47,439 --> 02:15:54,319
we can say okay so the kids

4010
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:56,639
they go to

4011
02:15:54,319 --> 02:15:58,238
a really fancy school and have a good

4012
02:15:56,639 --> 02:15:59,440
developmental environment like exeter

4013
02:15:58,238 --> 02:16:00,879
academy

4014
02:15:59,439 --> 02:16:02,319
there's still a gaussian distribution of

4015
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:03,199
how well they do on any particular

4016
02:16:02,319 --> 02:16:06,399
metric

4017
02:16:03,198 --> 02:16:08,158
but on average they become senators and

4018
02:16:06,399 --> 02:16:09,039
the worst ones become high-end lawyers

4019
02:16:08,158 --> 02:16:10,479
or whatever

4020
02:16:09,039 --> 02:16:11,920
and then i look at an inner city school

4021
02:16:10,479 --> 02:16:13,359
with a totally different set of things

4022
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:14,960
and i see a very very differently

4023
02:16:13,359 --> 02:16:16,319
displaced gaussian distribution but very

4024
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:18,480
different set of conditioning factors so

4025
02:16:16,319 --> 02:16:19,920
then i say the masses well if all those

4026
02:16:18,479 --> 02:16:21,519
kids who were one of the parts of the

4027
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:22,800
masses got to go to exeter and have that

4028
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:24,880
family and whatever would they still be

4029
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:28,079
the masses

4030
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:30,800
could we actually condition

4031
02:16:28,078 --> 02:16:32,718
more social virtue more civic virtue

4032
02:16:30,800 --> 02:16:33,359
more orientation towards dialectical

4033
02:16:32,718 --> 02:16:37,199
synthesis

4034
02:16:33,359 --> 02:16:41,120
more empathy more rationality widely

4035
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:43,120
yes would that lead to

4036
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:45,040
better capacity for something like

4037
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:47,040
participatory governance democracy or

4038
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:47,840
republic or some kind of participatory

4039
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:51,760
governance

4040
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:56,799
yes yes is it necessary for it actually

4041
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:59,920
yes and is it good for class interests

4042
02:16:56,799 --> 02:17:01,039
not not really by the way when you say

4043
02:16:59,920 --> 02:17:03,280
class interest

4044
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:06,399
this is the powerful leading over the

4045
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:08,159
less powerful that kind of idea

4046
02:17:06,398 --> 02:17:09,679
anyone that benefits from asymmetries of

4047
02:17:08,159 --> 02:17:12,159
power

4048
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:14,000
doesn't necessarily benefit from

4049
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:17,840
decreasing those asymmetries of power

4050
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:21,120
and kind of increasing the capacity of

4051
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:24,639
people more widely and

4052
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:26,719
um so when we talk about

4053
02:17:24,638 --> 02:17:29,279
power we're talking about asymmetries

4054
02:17:26,718 --> 02:17:31,039
and agency influence and control

4055
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:33,040
you think that hunger for power is

4056
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:34,559
fundamental to human nature

4057
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:36,240
i i think we should get that straight

4058
02:17:34,558 --> 02:17:37,119
before we talk about other stuff so like

4059
02:17:36,239 --> 02:17:40,398
uh

4060
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:41,280
this uh this this pickup line that i use

4061
02:17:40,398 --> 02:17:43,358
at a bar off

4062
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:45,359
which is uh power corrupts and absolute

4063
02:17:43,359 --> 02:17:47,359
power crops absolutely

4064
02:17:45,359 --> 02:17:48,479
is that true or is that just a fancy

4065
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:50,800
thing to say

4066
02:17:48,478 --> 02:17:53,438
in modern society there's something to

4067
02:17:50,799 --> 02:17:54,879
be said have we changed as societies

4068
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:58,079
over time

4069
02:17:54,879 --> 02:17:58,959
in terms of how much we crave power that

4070
02:17:58,079 --> 02:18:01,920
there is an

4071
02:17:58,959 --> 02:18:03,598
impulse towards power that is innate in

4072
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:05,040
people and can be conditioned one way or

4073
02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:06,799
the other yes but you can see that

4074
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:08,719
buddhist society does a very different

4075
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:10,159
thing with it at scale

4076
02:18:08,718 --> 02:18:12,159
that you don't end up seeing the

4077
02:18:10,159 --> 02:18:15,920
emergence of

4078
02:18:12,159 --> 02:18:17,599
the same types of sociopathic behavior

4079
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:19,679
and particularly then creating

4080
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:23,040
sociopathic institutions

4081
02:18:19,679 --> 02:18:26,799
um and so it's like

4082
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:28,399
is eating the foods that were rare in

4083
02:18:26,799 --> 02:18:29,840
our evolutionary environment that give

4084
02:18:28,398 --> 02:18:31,358
us more dopamine hit because they were

4085
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:32,318
rare and they're not anymore salt fat

4086
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:34,559
sugar

4087
02:18:32,318 --> 02:18:36,558
um is there something pleasurable about

4088
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:38,959
those where humans have an orientation

4089
02:18:36,558 --> 02:18:40,718
to overeat if they can well the fact

4090
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:42,718
that there is that possibility doesn't

4091
02:18:40,718 --> 02:18:44,159
mean everyone will obligately be obese

4092
02:18:42,718 --> 02:18:47,279
and die of obesity right like

4093
02:18:44,159 --> 02:18:48,718
it's possible to have a uh

4094
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:50,399
a particular impulse and to be able to

4095
02:18:48,718 --> 02:18:52,079
understand it have other ones and be

4096
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:56,000
able to balance them

4097
02:18:52,079 --> 02:18:58,799
and so to say that um

4098
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,398
power dynamics are are obligate in

4099
02:18:58,799 --> 02:19:03,039
humans and we can't do anything about it

4100
02:19:00,398 --> 02:19:04,398
is very similar to me to saying like

4101
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:06,559
we could everyone is going to be

4102
02:19:04,398 --> 02:19:07,840
obligately obese yeah so there's some

4103
02:19:06,558 --> 02:19:09,840
degree to which those

4104
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:11,359
the control those impulses has to do

4105
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:14,318
with the conditioning early in life

4106
02:19:11,359 --> 02:19:16,000
yes and the culture that creates the

4107
02:19:14,318 --> 02:19:18,000
environment to be able to do that

4108
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:20,239
and then the recursion on that okay so

4109
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,478
what if we were to uh

4110
02:19:20,239 --> 02:19:24,159
just bear with me just asking for a

4111
02:19:22,478 --> 02:19:25,438
friend if we were to kill all humans on

4112
02:19:24,159 --> 02:19:28,398
earth

4113
02:19:25,439 --> 02:19:28,398
and then start over

4114
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:33,359
is there ideas about how to build up

4115
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:35,120
okay we don't have to kill let's leave

4116
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:38,960
the humans on earth they're fine

4117
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:41,040
and go to mars and start a new society

4118
02:19:38,959 --> 02:19:42,000
is there ways to construct systems of

4119
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:47,040
conditioning

4120
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:50,398
education of how we live with each other

4121
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:53,520
that would um that would

4122
02:19:50,398 --> 02:19:54,239
incentivize us properly to not seek

4123
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:57,520
power

4124
02:19:54,239 --> 02:20:00,559
not to not construct systems that are

4125
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:02,079
of asymmetry of power and to create

4126
02:20:00,559 --> 02:20:03,279
systems that are resilient to all kinds

4127
02:20:02,079 --> 02:20:06,318
of terrorist attacks

4128
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:09,600
to all kinds of destructions

4129
02:20:06,318 --> 02:20:10,159
i believe so so is there some inklings

4130
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:11,840
we'll get

4131
02:20:10,159 --> 02:20:13,600
of course you probably don't have the

4132
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:15,600
ant all the answers but you have

4133
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:18,000
insights about what that looks like i

4134
02:20:15,600 --> 02:20:18,880
mean is it just rigorous practice of

4135
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:22,239
dialectic

4136
02:20:18,879 --> 02:20:25,119
synthesis as essentially conversations

4137
02:20:22,239 --> 02:20:26,559
with [ __ ] of various flavors until

4138
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:27,520
they're not [ __ ] anymore because

4139
02:20:26,559 --> 02:20:30,478
you've become

4140
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:31,680
deeply apathetic with their experience

4141
02:20:30,478 --> 02:20:34,799
okay so

4142
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:36,559
there's a lot of things that we

4143
02:20:34,799 --> 02:20:39,119
would need to construct to come back to

4144
02:20:36,559 --> 02:20:39,439
this like what is the basis of rivalry

4145
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:42,399
what

4146
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:43,280
how do you bind it how does it relate to

4147
02:20:42,398 --> 02:20:45,358
tech

4148
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:46,960
if you have a culture that is doing less

4149
02:20:45,359 --> 02:20:48,800
rivalry does it always

4150
02:20:46,959 --> 02:20:50,318
lose in war to those who do war better

4151
02:20:48,799 --> 02:20:52,559
and how do you make something on the

4152
02:20:50,318 --> 02:20:55,439
enactment of how to get there from here

4153
02:20:52,559 --> 02:20:57,760
um great great so what's rivalry why is

4154
02:20:55,439 --> 02:21:00,639
rivalry bad or good

4155
02:20:57,760 --> 02:21:02,639
is is so is another word for our very

4156
02:21:00,639 --> 02:21:06,239
competition

4157
02:21:02,639 --> 02:21:09,519
yes i think roughly yes i think

4158
02:21:06,239 --> 02:21:10,398
bad and good are kind of silly concepts

4159
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:12,079
here

4160
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:15,519
good for some things bad for other

4161
02:21:12,079 --> 02:21:18,559
things for some contexts and others

4162
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:20,079
even that um okay let me give you an

4163
02:21:18,559 --> 02:21:21,279
example that relates back to the

4164
02:21:20,079 --> 02:21:23,760
facebook measuring thing you were

4165
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:25,520
mentioning a moment ago

4166
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:26,559
first i think what you're saying is

4167
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:28,239
actually aligned with the right

4168
02:21:26,559 --> 02:21:28,639
direction and what i want to get to in a

4169
02:21:28,239 --> 02:21:30,719
moment

4170
02:21:28,639 --> 02:21:32,079
um but it's not the devil is in the

4171
02:21:30,719 --> 02:21:35,599
details here

4172
02:21:32,079 --> 02:21:36,478
so i i enjoy praise feeds my ego i grow

4173
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:38,399
stronger

4174
02:21:36,478 --> 02:21:40,478
so i appreciate that i'll make sure to

4175
02:21:38,398 --> 02:21:42,239
include one piece every 15 minutes as we

4176
02:21:40,478 --> 02:21:44,398
thank you

4177
02:21:42,239 --> 02:21:44,398
so

4178
02:21:46,639 --> 02:21:50,159
it's easier to measure

4179
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:54,399
there are problems with this argument

4180
02:21:52,559 --> 02:21:54,959
but there's also utility to it so let's

4181
02:21:54,398 --> 02:21:58,639
take it

4182
02:21:54,959 --> 02:21:58,639
for the utility it has first

4183
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:03,840
it's harder to measure happiness than it

4184
02:22:00,959 --> 02:22:03,839
is to measure comfort

4185
02:22:04,719 --> 02:22:09,760
we can measure with technology that the

4186
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:13,359
shocks in a car are making the car

4187
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:13,840
bounce less that the bed is um softer

4188
02:22:13,359 --> 02:22:15,040
and

4189
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:17,200
you know material science and those

4190
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:18,880
types of things and happiness

4191
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:20,720
is actually hard for philosophers to

4192
02:22:18,879 --> 02:22:23,358
define because

4193
02:22:20,719 --> 02:22:24,879
some people find that there's certain

4194
02:22:23,359 --> 02:22:26,159
kinds of overcoming suffering that are

4195
02:22:24,879 --> 02:22:27,759
necessary for happiness there's

4196
02:22:26,159 --> 02:22:29,280
happiness it feels more like contentment

4197
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:29,920
and happiness it feels more like passion

4198
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:31,439
that's

4199
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:33,200
is passion the source of all suffering

4200
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:35,280
or the source of all creativity like the

4201
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:37,120
there's deep stuff and it's mostly first

4202
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:39,200
person not measurable third-person stuff

4203
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:40,880
even if maybe it corresponds to

4204
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:42,319
third-person stuff to some degree but we

4205
02:22:40,879 --> 02:22:43,839
also see examples of

4206
02:22:42,318 --> 02:22:45,279
some of our favorite examples is people

4207
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:46,799
who are in the worst environments who

4208
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:48,479
end up finding happiness right where the

4209
02:22:46,799 --> 02:22:51,119
third-person stuff looks to be less

4210
02:22:48,478 --> 02:22:54,159
conducive and there's some victor frankl

4211
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:55,520
nelson mandela whatever

4212
02:22:54,159 --> 02:22:57,840
but it's pretty easy to measure comfort

4213
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:59,359
and it's pretty universal and

4214
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:01,040
i think we can see that the industrial

4215
02:22:59,359 --> 02:23:03,840
revolution started to replace

4216
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:05,439
happiness with comfort quite heavily as

4217
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:07,200
the thing it was optimizing for and we

4218
02:23:05,439 --> 02:23:08,318
can see that when increased comfort

4219
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:10,240
is given maybe because of the

4220
02:23:08,318 --> 02:23:12,959
evolutionary disposition

4221
02:23:10,239 --> 02:23:14,318
that expending extra calories when for

4222
02:23:12,959 --> 02:23:16,000
the majority of our history we didn't

4223
02:23:14,318 --> 02:23:19,359
have extra calories was not a

4224
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:21,920
safe thing to do who knows why

4225
02:23:19,359 --> 02:23:22,880
when extra comfort is given it's very

4226
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:25,439
easy

4227
02:23:22,879 --> 02:23:27,279
to take that path even if it's not the

4228
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:28,559
path that supports overall well-being

4229
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:32,800
long term

4230
02:23:28,559 --> 02:23:35,600
and so we can see that

4231
02:23:32,799 --> 02:23:37,759
you know when you when you look at the

4232
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:38,880
techno-optimist idea that we have better

4233
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:40,639
lives than

4234
02:23:38,879 --> 02:23:42,719
egyptian pharaohs and kings and whatever

4235
02:23:40,639 --> 02:23:45,760
what they're largely looking at

4236
02:23:42,719 --> 02:23:47,358
is how comfortable our beds are

4237
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:48,478
and how comfortable the transportation

4238
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:49,680
systems are and things like that in

4239
02:23:48,478 --> 02:23:51,119
which case there's massive

4240
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:53,280
improvement but we also see that in some

4241
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:54,960
of the nations where people have access

4242
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:57,040
to the most comfort suicide and mental

4243
02:23:54,959 --> 02:23:58,959
illness are the highest

4244
02:23:57,040 --> 02:24:00,319
and we also see that some of the

4245
02:23:58,959 --> 02:24:01,438
happiest cultures

4246
02:24:00,318 --> 02:24:03,920
are actually some of the ones that are

4247
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:05,439
in materially lame environments

4248
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:07,120
and so there's a very interesting

4249
02:24:05,439 --> 02:24:09,840
question here and if i

4250
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:11,680
understand correctly you do cold showers

4251
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:13,760
and joe rogan was talking about how he

4252
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:15,760
needs to do some fairly intensive kind

4253
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:18,159
of

4254
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:19,040
struggle that is a non-comfort to

4255
02:24:18,159 --> 02:24:21,039
actually induce

4256
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:22,319
being better as a person this concept of

4257
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:25,840
hormesis

4258
02:24:22,318 --> 02:24:27,519
that it's actually stressing an adaptive

4259
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:28,239
system that increases its adaptive

4260
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:30,880
capacity

4261
02:24:28,239 --> 02:24:32,959
and that there's something that the

4262
02:24:30,879 --> 02:24:34,559
happiness of a system has something to

4263
02:24:32,959 --> 02:24:36,318
do with its adaptive capacity its

4264
02:24:34,559 --> 02:24:37,920
overall resilience health well-being

4265
02:24:36,318 --> 02:24:40,559
which requires a decent bit of

4266
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:43,040
discomfort and

4267
02:24:40,559 --> 02:24:45,119
yet in the in the presence of the

4268
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:46,880
comfort solution it's very hard to not

4269
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:48,880
choose it and then as you're choosing it

4270
02:24:46,879 --> 02:24:51,119
regularly to actually down regulate your

4271
02:24:48,879 --> 02:24:56,719
overall adaptive capacity

4272
02:24:51,120 --> 02:25:00,079
and so when we start saying can we

4273
02:24:56,719 --> 02:25:01,920
make tech where we're measuring for the

4274
02:25:00,079 --> 02:25:04,000
things that it produces beyond just

4275
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,960
the measure of gdp or whatever

4276
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,040
particular

4277
02:25:04,959 --> 02:25:08,839
measures look like the revenue

4278
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:11,680
generation or profit generation of my

4279
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:15,600
business

4280
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:17,840
are all the meaningful things measurable

4281
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:20,079
and what are the right measures and what

4282
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:21,680
are the externalities of optimizing for

4283
02:25:20,079 --> 02:25:22,879
that measurement set what meaningful

4284
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:24,398
things aren't included in that

4285
02:25:22,879 --> 02:25:25,759
measurement set they might have their

4286
02:25:24,398 --> 02:25:26,799
own externalities

4287
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:28,800
these are some of the questions we

4288
02:25:26,799 --> 02:25:30,239
actually have to take seriously yeah and

4289
02:25:28,799 --> 02:25:33,039
i think they're answerable questions

4290
02:25:30,239 --> 02:25:35,119
right progressively better not perfect

4291
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:36,880
right so so first of all let me throw

4292
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:39,200
out happiness and comfort out of the

4293
02:25:36,879 --> 02:25:41,519
discussion those seems like useless

4294
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:43,439
the distinction so i because i said

4295
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:46,880
they're useful well-being is useful but

4296
02:25:43,439 --> 02:25:50,479
i think i i take it back

4297
02:25:46,879 --> 02:25:54,079
i knew uh i proposed new metrics

4298
02:25:50,478 --> 02:25:58,959
in this brainstorm session which is uh

4299
02:25:54,079 --> 02:26:01,439
so one is like personal growth

4300
02:25:58,959 --> 02:26:02,719
which is intellectual growth i think

4301
02:26:01,439 --> 02:26:06,159
we're able to

4302
02:26:02,719 --> 02:26:09,358
make that concrete for ourselves like

4303
02:26:06,159 --> 02:26:10,239
you're a better person than you were a

4304
02:26:09,359 --> 02:26:11,840
week ago

4305
02:26:10,239 --> 02:26:13,520
or a worse person than you were a week

4306
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:16,398
ago i think we can

4307
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:18,399
ourselves report that and and and

4308
02:26:16,398 --> 02:26:19,119
understand what that means is this gray

4309
02:26:18,398 --> 02:26:21,039
area

4310
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:22,479
and we try to define it but i think we

4311
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:24,640
humans are pretty good at that

4312
02:26:22,478 --> 02:26:26,079
because we have a sense an idealistic

4313
02:26:24,639 --> 02:26:26,959
sense of the person we might be able to

4314
02:26:26,079 --> 02:26:28,639
become we

4315
02:26:26,959 --> 02:26:30,719
we all dream of becoming a certain kind

4316
02:26:28,639 --> 02:26:33,358
of person and i think we have a sense

4317
02:26:30,719 --> 02:26:35,279
of getting closer and not towards that

4318
02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:36,159
person maybe this is not a great metric

4319
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:39,359
fine

4320
02:26:36,159 --> 02:26:41,200
the other one is love actually

4321
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:42,880
[ __ ] if you're happy or not or you're

4322
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:45,680
comfortable or not

4323
02:26:42,879 --> 02:26:46,879
how much love do you have towards your

4324
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:48,800
fellow human beings

4325
02:26:46,879 --> 02:26:50,239
i feel like if you try to optimize that

4326
02:26:48,799 --> 02:26:51,679
and increasing that

4327
02:26:50,239 --> 02:26:54,079
that's going to have that's a good

4328
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:54,079
metric

4329
02:26:55,439 --> 02:26:59,920
how many times a day sorry if i can make

4330
02:26:58,079 --> 02:27:01,600
quantify how many times a day have you

4331
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:02,398
thought positively of another human

4332
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:04,800
being

4333
02:27:02,398 --> 02:27:06,239
just put that down as a number and

4334
02:27:04,799 --> 02:27:10,719
increase that number

4335
02:27:06,239 --> 02:27:13,119
i think the process of saying okay so

4336
02:27:10,719 --> 02:27:14,559
let's not take gdp or gdp per capita as

4337
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:16,560
the metric we want to optimize for

4338
02:27:14,559 --> 02:27:18,318
because gdp goes up during war and it

4339
02:27:16,559 --> 02:27:19,920
goes up with more health care spending

4340
02:27:18,318 --> 02:27:21,279
from sicker people and various things

4341
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:22,478
that we wouldn't say correlate to

4342
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:25,600
quality of life

4343
02:27:22,478 --> 02:27:27,119
uh addiction drives gdp awesomely um

4344
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:28,960
by the way when i said growth i wasn't

4345
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:31,120
referred to

4346
02:27:28,959 --> 02:27:32,879
i'm giving an example now of the primary

4347
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:33,680
metric we use and why it's not not

4348
02:27:32,879 --> 02:27:35,279
equipment

4349
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:37,120
because we're exploring other ones so

4350
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:38,399
the idea of saying what would the

4351
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:42,000
metrics

4352
02:27:38,398 --> 02:27:43,279
for a good civilization be if i had to

4353
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,879
pick a set of metrics what would the

4354
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:46,079
best ones be if i was going to optimize

4355
02:27:44,879 --> 02:27:48,478
for those

4356
02:27:46,079 --> 02:27:49,200
and then really try to run the thought

4357
02:27:48,478 --> 02:27:51,840
experiment

4358
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:54,159
more deeply and say okay so what happens

4359
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:55,920
if we optimize for that

4360
02:27:54,159 --> 02:27:57,359
try to think through the first and

4361
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:59,040
second and third order effects

4362
02:27:57,359 --> 02:28:00,559
of what happens it's positive and then

4363
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:02,000
also say

4364
02:28:00,559 --> 02:28:04,318
what negative things can happen from

4365
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:06,000
optimizing that what actually matters it

4366
02:28:04,318 --> 02:28:08,079
is not included in that or in that way

4367
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:09,920
of defining it because love versus

4368
02:28:08,079 --> 02:28:11,680
number of positive thoughts per day i

4369
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:13,439
could just make a long list of names and

4370
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:15,520
just think say positive thing about each

4371
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:17,439
one it's all very superficial

4372
02:28:15,520 --> 02:28:19,120
not include animals or the rest of life

4373
02:28:17,439 --> 02:28:20,880
have a have a very

4374
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:22,399
shallow total amount of it but i'm

4375
02:28:20,879 --> 02:28:23,519
optimizing the number and if i get some

4376
02:28:22,398 --> 02:28:25,840
credit for the number

4377
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:28,960
so the and this is when i said the model

4378
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:30,799
of reality isn't reality

4379
02:28:28,959 --> 02:28:32,079
when you make a set of metrics they were

4380
02:28:30,799 --> 02:28:34,478
going to optimize for this

4381
02:28:32,079 --> 02:28:36,079
whatever reality is that is not included

4382
02:28:34,478 --> 02:28:37,920
in those metrics can be the areas where

4383
02:28:36,079 --> 02:28:39,920
harm occurs which is why

4384
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:42,239
i would say that wisdom is something

4385
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:42,239
like

4386
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:48,720
the discernment that leads to right

4387
02:28:46,239 --> 02:28:52,079
choices

4388
02:28:48,719 --> 02:28:55,119
beyond what metrics based optimization

4389
02:28:52,079 --> 02:28:58,719
would offer yeah

4390
02:28:55,120 --> 02:29:02,319
but another way to say that is

4391
02:28:58,719 --> 02:29:05,840
wisdom is uh constantly

4392
02:29:02,318 --> 02:29:07,840
expanding and evolving set of metrics

4393
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:09,520
so which means there is something in you

4394
02:29:07,840 --> 02:29:10,639
that is recognizing a new metric

4395
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:13,040
that's important that isn't part of that

4396
02:29:10,639 --> 02:29:16,639
metric set so there's a certain kind of

4397
02:29:13,040 --> 02:29:18,319
connection discernment awareness

4398
02:29:16,639 --> 02:29:20,159
and this is this is iterative game

4399
02:29:18,318 --> 02:29:21,920
theory there's a girdles in completeness

4400
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:23,520
theorem right which is if the system if

4401
02:29:21,920 --> 02:29:24,719
the set of things is consistent it won't

4402
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:26,399
be complete so we're going to keep

4403
02:29:24,719 --> 02:29:27,920
adding to it which is

4404
02:29:26,398 --> 02:29:30,000
why we were saying earlier i don't think

4405
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:31,200
it's not beautiful

4406
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,478
and especially if you were just saying

4407
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:34,159
one of the metrics you want to optimize

4408
02:29:32,478 --> 02:29:35,358
for at the individual level is becoming

4409
02:29:34,159 --> 02:29:36,559
right they were becoming more well

4410
02:29:35,359 --> 02:29:38,640
that's zen becomes true for the

4411
02:29:36,559 --> 02:29:41,119
civilization and our metric sets as well

4412
02:29:38,639 --> 02:29:42,000
yeah and our definition of how to think

4413
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:44,399
about a meaningful

4414
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:45,359
life in a meaningful civilization i can

4415
02:29:44,398 --> 02:29:46,398
tell you what some of my favorite

4416
02:29:45,359 --> 02:29:50,239
metrics are

4417
02:29:46,398 --> 02:29:52,239
what's that

4418
02:29:50,239 --> 02:29:53,760
uh well love is obviously not a metric

4419
02:29:52,239 --> 02:29:55,520
it's like you can bench

4420
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:56,800
yeah it's a good metric yeah i want to

4421
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:58,640
optimize that across the entire

4422
02:29:56,799 --> 02:30:03,358
population starting with infants

4423
02:29:58,639 --> 02:30:03,358
um so

4424
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:06,560
in the same way that love isn't metric

4425
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:08,000
but you could make metrics that look at

4426
02:30:06,559 --> 02:30:09,519
certain parts of it this thing i'm about

4427
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:11,120
to say isn't the metric but it's a it's

4428
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:12,560
a consideration

4429
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:14,240
because i thought about this a lot i i

4430
02:30:12,559 --> 02:30:15,119
don't think there is a metric a right

4431
02:30:14,239 --> 02:30:18,318
one

4432
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:19,680
um i think that every metric by itself

4433
02:30:18,318 --> 02:30:21,039
without this thing we talked about of

4434
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:22,559
the continuous improvement becomes a

4435
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:24,960
paperclip maximizer

4436
02:30:22,559 --> 02:30:25,840
i think that's why what the idea of

4437
02:30:24,959 --> 02:30:28,639
false idol

4438
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:29,600
means in terms of the model of reality

4439
02:30:28,639 --> 02:30:31,519
not being reality

4440
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:33,439
then my sacred relationship is to

4441
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:34,880
reality itself which also binds me to

4442
02:30:33,439 --> 02:30:36,398
the unknown forever

4443
02:30:34,879 --> 02:30:38,478
to the known but also to the unknown and

4444
02:30:36,398 --> 02:30:40,159
there's a sense of sacredness

4445
02:30:38,478 --> 02:30:41,760
connected to the unknown that creates an

4446
02:30:40,159 --> 02:30:43,520
epistemic humility that is always

4447
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:45,600
seeking not just to optimize the thing i

4448
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:47,120
know but to learn new stuff

4449
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:48,479
and to be open to perceive reality

4450
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:51,280
directly so my model never becomes

4451
02:30:48,478 --> 02:30:52,879
sacred my model is useful

4452
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:54,479
the model can't be the false idol

4453
02:30:52,879 --> 02:30:57,039
correct yeah

4454
02:30:54,478 --> 02:30:58,799
and this is why the first verse of the

4455
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,399
tao te ching is the dao that is nameable

4456
02:30:58,799 --> 02:31:02,079
is not the eternal dao

4457
02:31:00,398 --> 02:31:03,439
the naming then can become the source of

4458
02:31:02,079 --> 02:31:03,760
the ten thousand things that if you get

4459
02:31:03,439 --> 02:31:04,960
too

4460
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:06,639
carried away with it can actually

4461
02:31:04,959 --> 02:31:08,079
obscure you from paying attention to

4462
02:31:06,639 --> 02:31:10,639
reality beyond in

4463
02:31:08,079 --> 02:31:12,079
the models it sounds a lot a lot like

4464
02:31:10,639 --> 02:31:14,799
steven wolfram but in a different

4465
02:31:12,079 --> 02:31:15,280
language much more poetic i can imagine

4466
02:31:14,799 --> 02:31:17,840
that

4467
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:18,399
no i'm referring to i'm joking but

4468
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:20,000
there's

4469
02:31:18,398 --> 02:31:22,478
echoes of cellular automata which you

4470
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:24,079
can't name you can't construct a good

4471
02:31:22,478 --> 02:31:27,679
model cellular automata

4472
02:31:24,079 --> 02:31:29,520
you can only watch in awe i apologize

4473
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:32,000
i'm distracting your train of thought

4474
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:34,319
horribly and miserably making it by the

4475
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:36,318
way something robots aren't good at

4476
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:37,840
in uh dealing with the uncertainty of

4477
02:31:36,318 --> 02:31:39,439
uneven ground you've been

4478
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:40,960
okay so far you've been doing

4479
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:41,520
wonderfully so what's your favorite

4480
02:31:40,959 --> 02:31:42,879
metrics

4481
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:44,640
okay so i know you're not wrong so i

4482
02:31:42,879 --> 02:31:47,039
haven't passed anything test so one

4483
02:31:44,639 --> 02:31:48,478
metric

4484
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:50,160
and there are problems with this but one

4485
02:31:48,478 --> 02:31:53,438
metric that i like to just

4486
02:31:50,159 --> 02:31:56,318
as a thought experiment to consider is

4487
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:58,239
because you're actually asking work i

4488
02:31:56,318 --> 02:31:59,439
mean i know you ask your guests

4489
02:31:58,239 --> 02:32:00,719
about the meaning of life because

4490
02:31:59,439 --> 02:32:02,239
ultimately when you're designing when

4491
02:32:00,719 --> 02:32:04,478
you're saying what is a desirable

4492
02:32:02,239 --> 02:32:05,600
civilization you can't answer that

4493
02:32:04,478 --> 02:32:08,559
without answering

4494
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:10,000
what is a meaningful human life and to

4495
02:32:08,559 --> 02:32:11,359
say what is a good civilization

4496
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:13,120
because it's going to be in relationship

4497
02:32:11,359 --> 02:32:15,439
to that right

4498
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:15,439
um

4499
02:32:16,799 --> 02:32:20,000
and then you have whatever your answer

4500
02:32:18,799 --> 02:32:22,799
is how do you know what is the

4501
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:24,318
what is the epistemic basis for for

4502
02:32:22,799 --> 02:32:26,478
postulating that

4503
02:32:24,318 --> 02:32:27,439
um there's also a whole other reason for

4504
02:32:26,478 --> 02:32:29,760
asking that question

4505
02:32:27,439 --> 02:32:30,479
i don't i mean but that doesn't even

4506
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:34,239
apply to you

4507
02:32:30,478 --> 02:32:36,239
whatsoever which is it's interesting how

4508
02:32:34,239 --> 02:32:40,239
few people have been

4509
02:32:36,239 --> 02:32:42,879
asked questions like it

4510
02:32:40,239 --> 02:32:43,680
we we we joke about these questions is

4511
02:32:42,879 --> 02:32:47,759
silly

4512
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:49,760
right it's it's funny to watch a person

4513
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:51,520
and if i was more of an [ __ ] i would

4514
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:54,079
really stick on that question

4515
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:55,280
right it's a silly question in some

4516
02:32:54,079 --> 02:32:57,439
sense but

4517
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:58,640
like we haven't really considered what

4518
02:32:57,439 --> 02:33:00,479
it means just

4519
02:32:58,639 --> 02:33:02,719
a more concrete version of that question

4520
02:33:00,478 --> 02:33:04,079
is what is what is a better world

4521
02:33:02,719 --> 02:33:06,559
what is the kind of world we're trying

4522
02:33:04,079 --> 02:33:08,318
to create really i think well have you

4523
02:33:06,559 --> 02:33:10,000
really thought

4524
02:33:08,318 --> 02:33:11,439
i'll give you some kind of simple

4525
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,719
answers to that that are meaningful to

4526
02:33:11,439 --> 02:33:14,479
me

4527
02:33:12,719 --> 02:33:17,119
but let me do the societal indices first

4528
02:33:14,478 --> 02:33:18,719
because they're fun yes

4529
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:19,760
we should take a note of this meaningful

4530
02:33:18,719 --> 02:33:21,039
thing because it's important to come

4531
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:22,478
back to

4532
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:25,760
are you reminding me to ask you about

4533
02:33:22,478 --> 02:33:25,760
the meaning of life noted

4534
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:31,280
let me jot that down yeah so um

4535
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:33,040
well because i think i stopped tracking

4536
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:37,520
it like 25 open threads

4537
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:40,160
um okay let it all burn one

4538
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:41,760
index that i find very interesting is

4539
02:33:40,159 --> 02:33:44,719
the inverse correlation of addiction

4540
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:44,719
within the society

4541
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:48,560
the more a society produces addiction

4542
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:50,560
within the people

4543
02:33:48,559 --> 02:33:52,159
in it the less healthy i think the

4544
02:33:50,559 --> 02:33:55,119
society is

4545
02:33:52,159 --> 02:33:57,280
as a pretty fundamental metric and so

4546
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:58,079
the more the individuals feel that there

4547
02:33:57,280 --> 02:34:01,359
are less

4548
02:33:58,079 --> 02:34:02,799
compulsive things in

4549
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:05,439
compelling them to behave in ways that

4550
02:34:02,799 --> 02:34:08,559
are destructive to their own values

4551
02:34:05,439 --> 02:34:09,760
uh and in so far as a civilization is

4552
02:34:08,559 --> 02:34:12,000
conditioning and influencing the

4553
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:17,840
individuals within it

4554
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:17,840
the inverse of addiction uh

4555
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:21,600
yeah compulsive behavior that is

4556
02:34:20,398 --> 02:34:24,318
destructive towards

4557
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:24,318
things that we value

4558
02:34:26,799 --> 02:34:30,478
yeah i think that's a very interesting

4559
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:30,960
one to think that's a really interesting

4560
02:34:30,478 --> 02:34:32,879
one yeah

4561
02:34:30,959 --> 02:34:35,358
and this is then also where comfort and

4562
02:34:32,879 --> 02:34:37,759
addiction start to get very close

4563
02:34:35,359 --> 02:34:39,439
and the ability to go in the other

4564
02:34:37,760 --> 02:34:41,680
direction from addiction is the ability

4565
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:43,359
to be exposed to hypernormal stimuli and

4566
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:45,680
not

4567
02:34:43,359 --> 02:34:46,800
go down the path of desensitizing to

4568
02:34:45,680 --> 02:34:48,559
other stimuli and needing that

4569
02:34:46,799 --> 02:34:51,759
hypernormal stimuli

4570
02:34:48,559 --> 02:34:53,920
which does involve a kind of hormesis so

4571
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:56,639
i do think the civilization of the

4572
02:34:53,920 --> 02:35:00,159
future has to create

4573
02:34:56,639 --> 02:35:03,279
something like ritualized discomfort

4574
02:35:00,159 --> 02:35:06,318
and um

4575
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:07,680
virtualized discomfort yeah i think

4576
02:35:06,318 --> 02:35:10,398
that's what the sweat lodge

4577
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:12,000
and the vision quest and the solo

4578
02:35:10,398 --> 02:35:13,279
journey and the ayahuasca journey and

4579
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,639
the sundance were

4580
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:17,280
i think it's even a big part of what

4581
02:35:14,639 --> 02:35:20,559
yoga asana was

4582
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:22,880
is to make beings that are resilient and

4583
02:35:20,559 --> 02:35:24,559
strong they have to overcome some things

4584
02:35:22,879 --> 02:35:26,239
to make beings that can control their

4585
02:35:24,559 --> 02:35:27,359
own mind and fear they have to face some

4586
02:35:26,239 --> 02:35:29,680
fears

4587
02:35:27,359 --> 02:35:30,960
but we don't want to put everybody in

4588
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:33,359
war or real trauma

4589
02:35:30,959 --> 02:35:34,639
and yet we can see that the most [ __ ]

4590
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:36,640
up people we know

4591
02:35:34,639 --> 02:35:38,000
had childhoods of a lot of trauma but

4592
02:35:36,639 --> 02:35:39,840
some of the most incredible people we

4593
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:41,439
know had childhoods have a lot of trauma

4594
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:43,040
whether or not they happen to make it

4595
02:35:41,439 --> 02:35:46,559
through and overcome that or not

4596
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:48,960
so how do we get the benefits of the

4597
02:35:46,559 --> 02:35:50,478
stealing of character and the resilience

4598
02:35:48,959 --> 02:35:52,719
and the whatever that happened from the

4599
02:35:50,478 --> 02:35:57,438
difficulty without traumatizing people

4600
02:35:52,719 --> 02:36:00,799
a certain kind of ritualized discomfort

4601
02:35:57,439 --> 02:36:02,479
that not only has us overcome something

4602
02:36:00,799 --> 02:36:04,079
by ourselves but overcome it together

4603
02:36:02,478 --> 02:36:05,358
with each other where nobody bails when

4604
02:36:04,079 --> 02:36:07,200
it gets hard because the other people

4605
02:36:05,359 --> 02:36:08,720
are there so it's both a resilience of

4606
02:36:07,200 --> 02:36:11,120
the individuals and the resilience of

4607
02:36:08,719 --> 02:36:12,478
the bonding

4608
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:14,479
so i think we'll keep getting more and

4609
02:36:12,478 --> 02:36:15,199
more comfortable stuff but we have to

4610
02:36:14,478 --> 02:36:16,879
also

4611
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:19,120
develop resilience in the presence of

4612
02:36:16,879 --> 02:36:19,119
that

4613
02:36:19,200 --> 02:36:22,960
for the anti-addiction direction and the

4614
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:25,840
fullness of character

4615
02:36:22,959 --> 02:36:27,199
and the trustworthiness to others so you

4616
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:29,359
have to be uh

4617
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:30,960
consistently injecting discomfort into

4618
02:36:29,359 --> 02:36:33,120
the system ritualize

4619
02:36:30,959 --> 02:36:35,119
i mean this sounds like uh you have to

4620
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:38,399
imagine sisyphus happy

4621
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:40,720
you have to uh imagine sisyphus with his

4622
02:36:38,398 --> 02:36:40,719
rock

4623
02:36:40,959 --> 02:36:44,879
optimally resilient from a metrics

4624
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:48,318
perspective

4625
02:36:44,879 --> 02:36:51,199
in society so we we want

4626
02:36:48,318 --> 02:36:52,318
we want to constantly be throwing rocks

4627
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:54,800
at ourselves

4628
02:36:52,318 --> 02:36:56,719
not constantly uh you didn't have to

4629
02:36:54,799 --> 02:36:59,119
frequently

4630
02:36:56,719 --> 02:37:00,879
um periodically periodically and there's

4631
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:02,720
different levels of intensity different

4632
02:37:00,879 --> 02:37:06,159
periodicities now i do not think this

4633
02:37:02,719 --> 02:37:08,639
should be imposed by states i think it

4634
02:37:06,159 --> 02:37:10,559
should emerge from cultures

4635
02:37:08,639 --> 02:37:12,318
and i think the cultures are developing

4636
02:37:10,559 --> 02:37:13,119
people that understand the value of it

4637
02:37:12,318 --> 02:37:16,959
so the people

4638
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:18,800
so there is both a cultural cohesion to

4639
02:37:16,959 --> 02:37:20,079
it but there's also a voluntarism

4640
02:37:18,799 --> 02:37:21,438
because the people value

4641
02:37:20,079 --> 02:37:23,200
the thing that is being developed they

4642
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:24,079
understand it and that's what conditions

4643
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:26,800
is conditioning

4644
02:37:24,079 --> 02:37:27,920
it's conditioning some of these some of

4645
02:37:26,799 --> 02:37:29,599
these values and

4646
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:31,120
conditioning is a bad word because we

4647
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:32,239
like our idea of sovereignty but when we

4648
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:35,200
recognize

4649
02:37:32,239 --> 02:37:36,398
the language that we speak and the words

4650
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:38,319
that we think and in the

4651
02:37:36,398 --> 02:37:40,000
in the patterns of thought built into

4652
02:37:38,318 --> 02:37:41,680
that language and the aesthetics that we

4653
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:43,760
like and so much is conditioned

4654
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:45,600
in us just based on where we're born you

4655
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:47,280
can't not condition people so all you

4656
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:48,800
can do is take more responsibility for

4657
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:49,920
what the conditioning factors are and

4658
02:37:48,799 --> 02:37:51,358
then you have to think about this

4659
02:37:49,920 --> 02:37:52,799
question of what is a meaningful human

4660
02:37:51,359 --> 02:37:54,479
life because we're

4661
02:37:52,799 --> 02:37:55,840
unlike the other animals born into

4662
02:37:54,478 --> 02:37:57,438
environment that they're genetically

4663
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:58,639
adapted for we're building new

4664
02:37:57,439 --> 02:38:00,880
environments that we were

4665
02:37:58,639 --> 02:38:02,719
not adapted for and then we're becoming

4666
02:38:00,879 --> 02:38:04,719
affected by those so then we have to say

4667
02:38:02,719 --> 02:38:06,318
well what kinds of environments digital

4668
02:38:04,719 --> 02:38:09,279
environments physical environments

4669
02:38:06,318 --> 02:38:10,959
social environments

4670
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:12,479
would we want to create that would

4671
02:38:10,959 --> 02:38:14,879
develop the

4672
02:38:12,478 --> 02:38:15,920
healthiest happiest most moral noble

4673
02:38:14,879 --> 02:38:17,599
meaningful people

4674
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:19,840
and what are even those sets of things

4675
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:21,760
that matter so you end up getting

4676
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:23,359
deep existential consideration at the

4677
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:24,559
heart of civilization design when you

4678
02:38:23,359 --> 02:38:26,079
start to realize how powerful we're

4679
02:38:24,559 --> 02:38:27,359
becoming and how much

4680
02:38:26,079 --> 02:38:30,079
what we're building it in service

4681
02:38:27,359 --> 02:38:32,559
towards matters before i pull it

4682
02:38:30,079 --> 02:38:33,920
i think three threads you just laid down

4683
02:38:32,559 --> 02:38:35,600
uh is there another

4684
02:38:33,920 --> 02:38:38,719
metric index that you're interested i'll

4685
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:41,120
tell you one more that i really like

4686
02:38:38,719 --> 02:38:44,398
there's a there's a number but one then

4687
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:44,399
the next one that comes to mind is

4688
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:51,120
i have to make a very quick model uh

4689
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:56,079
healthy human bonding say we were in a

4690
02:38:54,079 --> 02:38:58,398
travel type setting

4691
02:38:56,079 --> 02:39:00,478
my positive emotional states in your

4692
02:38:58,398 --> 02:39:02,559
positive emotional states

4693
02:39:00,478 --> 02:39:04,318
would most of the time be correlated

4694
02:39:02,559 --> 02:39:06,639
your negative emotional states in mine

4695
02:39:04,318 --> 02:39:07,840
and so you start laughing i start

4696
02:39:06,639 --> 02:39:11,439
laughing you start crying

4697
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:13,680
my eyes might tear up and

4698
02:39:11,439 --> 02:39:16,479
we would call that the compassion

4699
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:19,439
compersion axis i would this is

4700
02:39:16,478 --> 02:39:20,959
a model i i find useful so compassion is

4701
02:39:19,439 --> 02:39:22,800
when you're feeling something negative i

4702
02:39:20,959 --> 02:39:24,239
feel some pain i feel some empathy

4703
02:39:22,799 --> 02:39:25,679
something in relationship

4704
02:39:24,239 --> 02:39:27,840
compersion is when you do well i'm

4705
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:29,840
stoked for you right like

4706
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:31,120
i actually feel happiness i like

4707
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:33,120
compersion

4708
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:35,040
yeah the fact that it's such a uncommon

4709
02:39:33,120 --> 02:39:35,920
word in english is actually a problem

4710
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:37,840
culturally

4711
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:39,600
um because i feel that often and i think

4712
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:41,040
that's a really good feeling to feel

4713
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:42,640
and maximize for actually that's

4714
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:43,359
actually the metric i'm going to say oh

4715
02:39:42,639 --> 02:39:45,920
wow

4716
02:39:43,359 --> 02:39:47,439
is the compassion compersion at axis is

4717
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:50,478
the thing i would optimize for

4718
02:39:47,439 --> 02:39:51,840
now there is a state where my

4719
02:39:50,478 --> 02:39:54,559
emotional states in your emotional

4720
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:57,920
states are just totally decoupled

4721
02:39:54,559 --> 02:39:59,760
and that is like sociopathy i don't want

4722
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:01,200
to hurt you but i don't care if i do or

4723
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:02,478
for you to do well or whatever

4724
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:03,920
but there's a worse state and it's

4725
02:40:02,478 --> 02:40:06,719
extremely common which is where they're

4726
02:40:03,920 --> 02:40:08,719
inversely coupled where

4727
02:40:06,719 --> 02:40:10,959
my positive emotions correspond to your

4728
02:40:08,719 --> 02:40:14,079
negative ones and vice versa

4729
02:40:10,959 --> 02:40:16,959
and that is the i i would call it the

4730
02:40:14,079 --> 02:40:18,799
jealousy sadism axis

4731
02:40:16,959 --> 02:40:20,559
the jealousy axis is when you're doing

4732
02:40:18,799 --> 02:40:24,000
really well i feel something bad

4733
02:40:20,559 --> 02:40:27,359
i feel taken away from less than upset

4734
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:30,398
envious whatever and

4735
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:32,960
that's so common

4736
02:40:30,398 --> 02:40:34,159
but i think of it as kind of a low-grade

4737
02:40:32,959 --> 02:40:37,199
psychopathology

4738
02:40:34,159 --> 02:40:38,318
that we've just normalized the idea that

4739
02:40:37,200 --> 02:40:40,000
i'm actually

4740
02:40:38,318 --> 02:40:41,760
upset at the happiness or fulfillment or

4741
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:43,120
success of another is like a profoundly

4742
02:40:41,760 --> 02:40:44,559
[ __ ] up thing

4743
02:40:43,120 --> 02:40:46,319
no we shouldn't shame it and repress it

4744
02:40:44,559 --> 02:40:47,680
so it gets worse we should study it

4745
02:40:46,318 --> 02:40:50,159
where does it come from and it comes

4746
02:40:47,680 --> 02:40:51,600
from our own insecurities and stuff

4747
02:40:50,159 --> 02:40:53,520
and but then the next part that

4748
02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:56,000
everybody knows is really [ __ ] up

4749
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:57,600
is just on the same axis it's the same

4750
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:59,840
inverted which is

4751
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:00,880
so the jealousy or the envy is the i

4752
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:03,040
feel badly when

4753
02:41:00,879 --> 02:41:05,358
you're doing well the sadism side is i

4754
02:41:03,040 --> 02:41:06,800
actually feel good when you lose

4755
02:41:05,359 --> 02:41:08,318
or when you're in pain i feel some

4756
02:41:06,799 --> 02:41:09,920
happiness that's associated you can see

4757
02:41:08,318 --> 02:41:11,920
when someone feels jealous

4758
02:41:09,920 --> 02:41:13,359
sometimes they feel jealous with a

4759
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:15,279
partner and then they feel

4760
02:41:13,359 --> 02:41:17,279
they want that partner to get it revenge

4761
02:41:15,279 --> 02:41:20,000
comes up or something

4762
02:41:17,279 --> 02:41:20,399
so sadism is really like jealousy is one

4763
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,639
step

4764
02:41:20,398 --> 02:41:24,478
on the path to sadism from the healthy

4765
02:41:22,639 --> 02:41:27,039
compassion conversion access so

4766
02:41:24,478 --> 02:41:28,079
i would like to see a society that is

4767
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:31,200
inversely

4768
02:41:28,079 --> 02:41:34,159
that is conditioning sadism and jealousy

4769
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:35,840
inversely right the lower that amount

4770
02:41:34,159 --> 02:41:37,279
and the more the compassion conversion

4771
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:38,880
and if i had to summarize that very

4772
02:41:37,279 --> 02:41:41,439
simply i'd say it would optimize for

4773
02:41:38,879 --> 02:41:41,438
conversion

4774
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,439
which is because notice that's not just

4775
02:41:44,398 --> 02:41:46,760
saying love

4776
02:41:45,439 --> 02:41:48,960
for you where i might be

4777
02:41:46,760 --> 02:41:51,359
self-sacrificing and miserable and

4778
02:41:48,959 --> 02:41:52,639
i love people but i kill myself which i

4779
02:41:51,359 --> 02:41:53,760
don't think anybody thinks a great idea

4780
02:41:52,639 --> 02:41:55,358
or happiness where i might be

4781
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:56,800
sociopathically happy where i'm

4782
02:41:55,359 --> 02:41:58,559
causing problems all over the place or

4783
02:41:56,799 --> 02:42:01,039
even sadistically happy

4784
02:41:58,559 --> 02:42:02,159
but it's a coupling right that i'm

4785
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:03,920
actually feeling happiness in

4786
02:42:02,159 --> 02:42:05,279
relationship to yours and even in causal

4787
02:42:03,920 --> 02:42:07,200
relationship where i

4788
02:42:05,279 --> 02:42:09,439
my own agentic desire to get happier

4789
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:11,040
wants to support you too

4790
02:42:09,439 --> 02:42:13,600
that's actually speaking of another

4791
02:42:11,040 --> 02:42:16,160
pickup line uh

4792
02:42:13,600 --> 02:42:17,600
that's quite honestly what i this is a

4793
02:42:16,159 --> 02:42:19,039
guy who's single this is

4794
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:20,800
this is going to come out very

4795
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:22,560
ridiculous because it's like oh yeah

4796
02:42:20,799 --> 02:42:26,318
where's your girlfriend bro

4797
02:42:22,559 --> 02:42:27,519
but that's what i look for in a

4798
02:42:26,318 --> 02:42:31,760
relationship

4799
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:34,479
because it's like it's so much it's so

4800
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:36,639
it's such an amazing life where you

4801
02:42:34,478 --> 02:42:37,679
actually get joy from another person's

4802
02:42:36,639 --> 02:42:40,000
success

4803
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:41,439
and they get joy from your success and

4804
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,920
then it becomes like

4805
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:45,920
you don't actually need to succeed much

4806
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:49,520
for that to have a like a

4807
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:52,159
a a like a cycle of just like happiness

4808
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:53,040
that just increases like exponentially

4809
02:42:52,159 --> 02:42:55,279
it's weird

4810
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:56,800
so like just be just enjoying the the

4811
02:42:55,279 --> 02:42:57,920
happiness of others the success of

4812
02:42:56,799 --> 02:43:00,559
others

4813
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:01,840
so this this is like the uh let's call

4814
02:43:00,559 --> 02:43:04,000
this because the first person that

4815
02:43:01,840 --> 02:43:06,000
drilled this into my head is rogan

4816
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:08,398
joe rogan here's the embodiment of that

4817
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:11,600
because i saw somebody who was uh

4818
02:43:08,398 --> 02:43:15,519
successful rich

4819
02:43:11,600 --> 02:43:16,880
and non-stop truly i mean you could tell

4820
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:19,680
when somebody's full of [ __ ]

4821
02:43:16,879 --> 02:43:21,759
somebody's not really genuinely enjoying

4822
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:23,200
the success of his friends

4823
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:25,279
that that was weird to me that was

4824
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:26,159
interesting and i mean the way you're

4825
02:43:25,279 --> 02:43:28,640
kind of

4826
02:43:26,159 --> 02:43:29,920
speaking to it the reason joe stood out

4827
02:43:28,639 --> 02:43:32,398
to me

4828
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:35,279
is i guess i haven't witnessed genuine

4829
02:43:32,398 --> 02:43:38,478
expression of that often in this culture

4830
02:43:35,279 --> 02:43:39,680
of just real joy for others

4831
02:43:38,478 --> 02:43:43,119
i mean part of that has to do there

4832
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:45,120
hasn't been many channels where you can

4833
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:46,160
watch or listen to people being their

4834
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:47,520
authentic cells

4835
02:43:46,159 --> 02:43:49,600
so i'm sure there's a bunch of people

4836
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:50,560
who live life with compersion they

4837
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:53,680
probably

4838
02:43:50,559 --> 02:43:56,318
don't seek public attention also but the

4839
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:57,920
that that was yeah if if there was any

4840
02:43:56,318 --> 02:43:59,680
word that could express what what i've

4841
02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:01,680
learned from joan white he's been a

4842
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:04,639
a really inspiring figure is that

4843
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:08,318
compersion and i wish our world

4844
02:44:04,639 --> 02:44:12,000
was uh had a lot more of that

4845
02:44:08,318 --> 02:44:14,398
because then it me i mean my own

4846
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:15,920
so sorry to go on a small tangent but

4847
02:44:14,398 --> 02:44:17,599
like

4848
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:19,040
you're speaking how society should

4849
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:21,279
function

4850
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:23,359
but i feel like if you optimize for that

4851
02:44:21,279 --> 02:44:26,399
metric in your own personal life

4852
02:44:23,359 --> 02:44:28,159
you're going to uh live a

4853
02:44:26,398 --> 02:44:29,840
truly fulfilling life i don't know what

4854
02:44:28,159 --> 02:44:31,200
the right word to use

4855
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:32,960
but that's a really good way to live

4856
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:36,000
life you will also

4857
02:44:32,959 --> 02:44:37,438
learn what gets in the way of it right

4858
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:39,359
and how to work with it that if you

4859
02:44:37,439 --> 02:44:41,520
wanted to help try to build systems at

4860
02:44:39,359 --> 02:44:43,279
scale or apply facebook or exponential

4861
02:44:41,520 --> 02:44:45,680
technologies to do that you would have

4862
02:44:43,279 --> 02:44:48,479
more actual depth of real knowledge of

4863
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:48,479
what that takes

4864
02:44:48,559 --> 02:44:52,000
and this is you know as you mentioned

4865
02:44:50,239 --> 02:44:53,199
that there's this virtuous cycle between

4866
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,799
when you get stoked on other people

4867
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:56,240
doing well and then they have a similar

4868
02:44:54,799 --> 02:44:59,519
relationship to you and everyone is in

4869
02:44:56,239 --> 02:44:59,520
the process of building each other up

4870
02:44:59,600 --> 02:45:03,279
and this is what i would say the healthy

4871
02:45:01,840 --> 02:45:06,159
version of competition is

4872
02:45:03,279 --> 02:45:07,359
versus the unhealthy version the healthy

4873
02:45:06,159 --> 02:45:09,760
version right the

4874
02:45:07,359 --> 02:45:11,840
the root i believe it's a latin word

4875
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:14,159
that means to strive together

4876
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:16,000
and it's that impulse of becoming where

4877
02:45:14,159 --> 02:45:17,840
i want to become more but i recognize

4878
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:19,200
that there's actually a hormesis there's

4879
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:21,760
a challenge that is needed

4880
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:22,560
for me to be able to do that but that

4881
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:23,840
means that

4882
02:45:22,559 --> 02:45:25,359
yes there's an impulse where i'm trying

4883
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:27,600
to get ahead maybe i'm even trying to

4884
02:45:25,359 --> 02:45:29,439
win but i actually want a good opponent

4885
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:31,040
and i want them to get ahead too because

4886
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:32,639
that is where my ongoing becoming

4887
02:45:31,040 --> 02:45:34,319
happens and the win itself will get

4888
02:45:32,639 --> 02:45:36,318
boring very quickly

4889
02:45:34,318 --> 02:45:38,318
the ongoing becoming is where there's

4890
02:45:36,318 --> 02:45:39,600
aliveness and for the ongoing becoming

4891
02:45:38,318 --> 02:45:41,278
they need to have it too

4892
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:42,960
and that's the stride together the so in

4893
02:45:41,279 --> 02:45:44,159
the healthy competition i'm stoked when

4894
02:45:42,959 --> 02:45:46,959
they're doing really well

4895
02:45:44,159 --> 02:45:48,719
because my becoming is supported by it

4896
02:45:46,959 --> 02:45:51,039
now this is actually a very nice segue

4897
02:45:48,719 --> 02:45:51,039
into

4898
02:45:52,159 --> 02:45:56,478
a model i like about what a meaningful

4899
02:45:55,279 --> 02:45:59,279
human life is

4900
02:45:56,478 --> 02:45:59,278
if you want to go there

4901
02:45:59,760 --> 02:46:05,359
let's go there well i have

4902
02:46:03,279 --> 02:46:07,359
i have three things i'm going elsewhere

4903
02:46:05,359 --> 02:46:09,680
with but if we were first

4904
02:46:07,359 --> 02:46:12,159
let us take a short stroll through the

4905
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:16,159
park of the meaning of life

4906
02:46:12,159 --> 02:46:20,079
daniel what is a meaningful life

4907
02:46:16,159 --> 02:46:22,398
i think the semantics end up mattering

4908
02:46:20,079 --> 02:46:24,719
because a lot of people

4909
02:46:22,398 --> 02:46:25,599
will take the word meaning and the word

4910
02:46:24,719 --> 02:46:28,719
purpose

4911
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:29,920
almost interchangeably and they'll talk

4912
02:46:28,719 --> 02:46:31,358
they'll think kind of what is the

4913
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:32,559
meaning of my life what is the meaning

4914
02:46:31,359 --> 02:46:34,720
of human life what is the meaning of

4915
02:46:32,559 --> 02:46:37,119
life what's the meaning of the universe

4916
02:46:34,719 --> 02:46:38,559
and what what is the meaning of

4917
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:39,040
existence rather than non-existent so

4918
02:46:38,559 --> 02:46:40,239
there's

4919
02:46:39,040 --> 02:46:42,880
a lot of kind of existential

4920
02:46:40,239 --> 02:46:44,719
considerations there and i think there's

4921
02:46:42,879 --> 02:46:47,119
some cognitive mistakes that are very

4922
02:46:44,719 --> 02:46:50,000
easy like taking

4923
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:51,920
the idea of purpose which is like a goal

4924
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:53,760
which is a utilitarian concept the

4925
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:55,279
purpose of one thing is defined in

4926
02:46:53,760 --> 02:46:57,040
relationship to other things that have

4927
02:46:55,279 --> 02:47:00,159
assumed value

4928
02:46:57,040 --> 02:47:00,720
um and to say what is the purpose of

4929
02:47:00,159 --> 02:47:02,879
everything

4930
02:47:00,719 --> 02:47:04,478
well it's a purpose is too small of a

4931
02:47:02,879 --> 02:47:05,920
question it's fundamentally a relative

4932
02:47:04,478 --> 02:47:07,519
question within everything what is the

4933
02:47:05,920 --> 02:47:08,799
purpose of one thing relative to another

4934
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:10,239
what is the purpose of everything and

4935
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:10,959
there's nothing outside of it with which

4936
02:47:10,239 --> 02:47:13,279
to say it

4937
02:47:10,959 --> 02:47:14,478
you actually just got to the limits of

4938
02:47:13,279 --> 02:47:16,640
the utility of the

4939
02:47:14,478 --> 02:47:18,159
concept of purpose it doesn't mean it's

4940
02:47:16,639 --> 02:47:19,519
purposeless in the sense of something

4941
02:47:18,159 --> 02:47:21,200
inside of it being purposeless it means

4942
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:24,319
the concept is too small

4943
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:26,399
which is why you end up getting to you

4944
02:47:24,318 --> 02:47:28,799
know like in taoism talking about

4945
02:47:26,398 --> 02:47:30,799
the nature of it rather the there's a

4946
02:47:28,799 --> 02:47:32,719
fundamental what

4947
02:47:30,799 --> 02:47:35,039
where the why can't go deeper is the

4948
02:47:32,719 --> 02:47:38,159
nature of it

4949
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:38,800
but i'm gonna try to speak to a much

4950
02:47:38,159 --> 02:47:40,318
simpler

4951
02:47:38,799 --> 02:47:42,239
part which is when people think about

4952
02:47:40,318 --> 02:47:44,398
what is a meaningful human life

4953
02:47:42,239 --> 02:47:45,680
and kind of if we were to optimize for

4954
02:47:44,398 --> 02:47:46,478
something at the level of individual

4955
02:47:45,680 --> 02:47:49,279
life

4956
02:47:46,478 --> 02:47:50,559
but also how does optimizing for this at

4957
02:47:49,279 --> 02:47:53,680
the level of the individual life

4958
02:47:50,559 --> 02:47:56,159
lead to the best

4959
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:57,359
society for insofar as people living

4960
02:47:56,159 --> 02:47:59,760
that way affects others

4961
02:47:57,359 --> 02:48:00,880
and long-term the world as a whole and

4962
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:03,120
how would we then

4963
02:48:00,879 --> 02:48:06,000
make a civilization that was trying to

4964
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:06,000
think about these things

4965
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:10,319
because you can see that there are a lot

4966
02:48:08,239 --> 02:48:13,680
of dialectics where

4967
02:48:10,318 --> 02:48:16,719
there's value on two sides individualism

4968
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:16,720
and collectivism or

4969
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:21,760
the ability to accept things and the

4970
02:48:19,439 --> 02:48:25,520
ability to push harder and whatever

4971
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:27,680
and there's failure modes on both sides

4972
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:29,120
and so when you're starting to say okay

4973
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:30,559
individual happiness you're like wait

4974
02:48:29,120 --> 02:48:32,000
[ __ ] sadists can be happy while hurting

4975
02:48:30,559 --> 02:48:33,840
people it's not individual happiness

4976
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:35,840
it's love but wait some people can

4977
02:48:33,840 --> 02:48:36,719
self-sacrifice out of love in a way that

4978
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:38,478
actually ends up just creating

4979
02:48:36,719 --> 02:48:41,760
codependency for everybody

4980
02:48:38,478 --> 02:48:45,840
um or okay so so how do we think about

4981
02:48:41,760 --> 02:48:45,840
all those things together

4982
02:48:46,079 --> 02:48:52,318
one like this kind of came to me as a

4983
02:48:50,239 --> 02:48:53,680
a simple way that i kind of relate to it

4984
02:48:52,318 --> 02:48:56,000
is

4985
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:57,279
that a meaningful life involves the mode

4986
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,719
of being

4987
02:48:57,279 --> 02:49:01,680
the mode of doing and the mode of

4988
02:48:58,719 --> 02:49:06,239
becoming and it involves a virtuous

4989
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:08,960
relationship between those three and

4990
02:49:06,239 --> 02:49:10,478
that any of those modes on their own

4991
02:49:08,959 --> 02:49:12,318
also have failure modes that are not a

4992
02:49:10,478 --> 02:49:14,079
meaningful life

4993
02:49:12,318 --> 02:49:16,559
the mode of being the way i would

4994
02:49:14,079 --> 02:49:20,239
describe it

4995
02:49:16,559 --> 02:49:21,039
if if we're talking about the essence of

4996
02:49:20,239 --> 02:49:23,760
it

4997
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:25,760
is about taking in and appreciating the

4998
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:28,318
beauty of life that is now

4999
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:28,960
it's a mode that is in the moment and

5000
02:49:28,318 --> 02:49:32,719
that is

5001
02:49:28,959 --> 02:49:34,079
largely about being with what is

5002
02:49:32,719 --> 02:49:35,278
it's fundamentally grounded in the

5003
02:49:34,079 --> 02:49:37,120
nature of experience and the

5004
02:49:35,279 --> 02:49:39,200
meaningfulness of experience

5005
02:49:37,120 --> 02:49:41,760
the prima facie meaningfulness of when

5006
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:43,120
i'm having this experience

5007
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:45,439
i'm not actually asking what the meaning

5008
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:47,520
of life is i'm actually full of it i'm

5009
02:49:45,439 --> 02:49:50,398
full of experiencing it the momentary

5010
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:50,399
experience yes

5011
02:49:50,639 --> 02:49:56,398
so taking in the beauty of life doing

5012
02:49:54,639 --> 02:49:57,840
is adding to the beauty of life i'm

5013
02:49:56,398 --> 02:49:59,199
going to produce some art i'm going to

5014
02:49:57,840 --> 02:50:00,719
produce some technology that will make

5015
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:01,120
life easier more beautiful for somebody

5016
02:50:00,719 --> 02:50:03,840
else

5017
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:03,840
i'm going to

5018
02:50:04,318 --> 02:50:08,239
do some science that will end up leading

5019
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:09,840
to better insights or others people's

5020
02:50:08,239 --> 02:50:11,119
ability to appreciate the beauty of life

5021
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:12,079
more because they understand more about

5022
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:13,760
it or whatever it is

5023
02:50:12,079 --> 02:50:16,559
or protect it right i'm going to protect

5024
02:50:13,760 --> 02:50:17,920
it in some way but that's adding to

5025
02:50:16,559 --> 02:50:20,719
or being in service of the beauty of

5026
02:50:17,920 --> 02:50:22,960
life through our doing and becoming

5027
02:50:20,719 --> 02:50:25,119
is getting better at both of those being

5028
02:50:22,959 --> 02:50:26,639
able to deepen our being which is to be

5029
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:27,680
able to take in the beauty of life more

5030
02:50:26,639 --> 02:50:30,799
profoundly

5031
02:50:27,680 --> 02:50:32,639
be more moved by it touched by it

5032
02:50:30,799 --> 02:50:33,920
and increasing our capacity with doing

5033
02:50:32,639 --> 02:50:37,439
to add to the beauty of life

5034
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:40,639
more and

5035
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:42,239
so i hold that a meaningful life has to

5036
02:50:40,639 --> 02:50:44,959
be all three of those

5037
02:50:42,239 --> 02:50:46,318
and where they're not in conflict with

5038
02:50:44,959 --> 02:50:48,559
each other

5039
02:50:46,318 --> 02:50:50,398
ultimately it grounds in being it

5040
02:50:48,559 --> 02:50:51,840
grounds in the intrinsic meaningfulness

5041
02:50:50,398 --> 02:50:53,840
of experience

5042
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:55,040
and then my doing is ultimately

5043
02:50:53,840 --> 02:50:57,439
something that will

5044
02:50:55,040 --> 02:51:00,000
be able to increase the possibility of

5045
02:50:57,439 --> 02:51:02,960
the quality of experience for others

5046
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:05,200
and my becoming is a deepening on those

5047
02:51:02,959 --> 02:51:08,719
so it grounds an experience and also the

5048
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:09,980
evolutionary possibility of experience

5049
02:51:08,719 --> 02:51:11,840
and the point is to

5050
02:51:09,979 --> 02:51:15,039
[Music]

5051
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:18,079
oscillate between these never getting

5052
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:19,920
stuck on any one yeah or i suppose

5053
02:51:18,079 --> 02:51:21,920
in parallel well you can't really

5054
02:51:19,920 --> 02:51:25,439
attention is a thing

5055
02:51:21,920 --> 02:51:25,439
you can only allocate attention

5056
02:51:26,719 --> 02:51:30,879
i want moments where i am absorbed in

5057
02:51:30,079 --> 02:51:33,760
the sunset and

5058
02:51:30,879 --> 02:51:35,199
i'm not thinking about what to do next

5059
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:37,279
and then

5060
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:39,359
the fullness of that can make it to

5061
02:51:37,279 --> 02:51:40,560
where my doing doesn't come from what's

5062
02:51:39,359 --> 02:51:43,279
in it for me

5063
02:51:40,559 --> 02:51:45,039
because i actually feel overwhelmingly

5064
02:51:43,279 --> 02:51:48,159
full already

5065
02:51:45,040 --> 02:51:49,680
and then it's like how can i how can i

5066
02:51:48,159 --> 02:51:51,680
make life better for other people that

5067
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:53,520
don't have as much opportunities i had

5068
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:56,318
how can i add something wonderful how

5069
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:59,680
can i just be in the creative process

5070
02:51:56,318 --> 02:52:01,359
and so i think where the doing comes

5071
02:51:59,680 --> 02:52:02,720
from matters and if the doing comes from

5072
02:52:01,359 --> 02:52:04,318
a fullness of being

5073
02:52:02,719 --> 02:52:07,199
it's inherently going to be paying

5074
02:52:04,318 --> 02:52:09,039
attention to externalities

5075
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:10,640
or it's more oriented to do that than if

5076
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:12,160
it comes from some emptiness that is

5077
02:52:10,639 --> 02:52:14,000
trying to get full in some way that is

5078
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:15,439
willing to cause sacrifices other places

5079
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:18,318
and where a chunk of its attention is

5080
02:52:15,439 --> 02:52:20,318
internally focused

5081
02:52:18,318 --> 02:52:21,840
and so when buddha said desire is the

5082
02:52:20,318 --> 02:52:24,639
cause of all suffering then

5083
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:26,398
later the vow of the bodhisattva which

5084
02:52:24,639 --> 02:52:29,278
was to show up for all sentient beings

5085
02:52:26,398 --> 02:52:32,159
and universe forever is a pretty intense

5086
02:52:29,279 --> 02:52:32,159
thing like desire

5087
02:52:32,799 --> 02:52:35,679
i would say there is a kind of desire if

5088
02:52:34,398 --> 02:52:37,439
we think of desire as a basis for

5089
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:39,040
movement like a flow or a gradient

5090
02:52:37,439 --> 02:52:40,318
there's a kind of desire that comes from

5091
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:42,880
something missing inside

5092
02:52:40,318 --> 02:52:44,398
seeking fulfillment of that in the world

5093
02:52:42,879 --> 02:52:46,719
that ends up being the cause of

5094
02:52:44,398 --> 02:52:48,318
actions that perpetuate suffering but

5095
02:52:46,719 --> 02:52:50,000
there's also not just

5096
02:52:48,318 --> 02:52:52,239
non-desire there's a kind of desire that

5097
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:53,920
comes from feeling full

5098
02:52:52,239 --> 02:52:57,359
at the beauty of life and wanting to add

5099
02:52:53,920 --> 02:52:59,359
to it that is a flow this direction

5100
02:52:57,359 --> 02:53:01,120
and i don't think that is the cause of

5101
02:52:59,359 --> 02:53:03,040
suffering i think that is

5102
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:04,560
you know and the western traditions

5103
02:53:03,040 --> 02:53:05,120
right the eastern traditions focused on

5104
02:53:04,559 --> 02:53:06,879
that

5105
02:53:05,120 --> 02:53:08,720
and kind of unconditional happiness

5106
02:53:06,879 --> 02:53:09,039
outside of them in the moment outside of

5107
02:53:08,719 --> 02:53:10,639
time

5108
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:12,319
western tradition said no actually

5109
02:53:10,639 --> 02:53:13,519
desire is the source of creativity and

5110
02:53:12,318 --> 02:53:14,959
we're here to be

5111
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:16,479
made in the image and likeness of the

5112
02:53:14,959 --> 02:53:17,438
creator we're here to be fundamentally

5113
02:53:16,478 --> 02:53:20,478
creative

5114
02:53:17,439 --> 02:53:20,960
but creating from where and in service

5115
02:53:20,478 --> 02:53:22,559
of what

5116
02:53:20,959 --> 02:53:24,079
creating from a sense of connection to

5117
02:53:22,559 --> 02:53:25,359
everything and wholeness in service of

5118
02:53:24,079 --> 02:53:28,000
the well-being of all of it

5119
02:53:25,359 --> 02:53:28,000
is very different

5120
02:53:28,639 --> 02:53:34,239
which is back to that compassion

5121
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:37,200
conversion axis being doing becoming

5122
02:53:34,239 --> 02:53:37,199
is pretty powerful

5123
02:53:37,600 --> 02:53:43,680
also could potentially be algorithmized

5124
02:53:40,478 --> 02:53:43,679
into a robot just saying

5125
02:53:44,799 --> 02:53:47,679
where does um

5126
02:53:49,359 --> 02:53:56,559
where does death come to that

5127
02:53:53,680 --> 02:53:58,639
so being is forgetting i mean the the

5128
02:53:56,559 --> 02:54:00,398
concept of time completely

5129
02:53:58,639 --> 02:54:03,519
there's a there's a sense the doing and

5130
02:54:00,398 --> 02:54:06,799
becoming that has a deadline and

5131
02:54:03,520 --> 02:54:08,239
built in the urgency

5132
02:54:06,799 --> 02:54:11,278
built in do you think death is

5133
02:54:08,239 --> 02:54:11,279
fundamental to this

5134
02:54:11,439 --> 02:54:15,279
to a meaningful life uh

5135
02:54:15,760 --> 02:54:22,639
acknowledging or um

5136
02:54:20,318 --> 02:54:23,760
feeling the terror of death like ernest

5137
02:54:22,639 --> 02:54:25,920
becker

5138
02:54:23,760 --> 02:54:28,079
or just acknowledging the uncertainty

5139
02:54:25,920 --> 02:54:30,079
the mystery the

5140
02:54:28,079 --> 02:54:31,120
the melancholy nature of the fact that

5141
02:54:30,079 --> 02:54:33,600
the right ends

5142
02:54:31,120 --> 02:54:35,200
is that part of this equation or it's

5143
02:54:33,600 --> 02:54:37,600
not necessary okay

5144
02:54:35,200 --> 02:54:40,159
look at how it could be related i've

5145
02:54:37,600 --> 02:54:43,520
experienced fear of death

5146
02:54:40,159 --> 02:54:43,520
i've also experienced

5147
02:54:44,159 --> 02:54:47,520
times where i thought i was gonna die it

5148
02:54:46,478 --> 02:54:51,119
felt extremely

5149
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:55,279
peaceful and beautiful and

5150
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:58,640
um it's funny because

5151
02:54:55,279 --> 02:54:59,680
if we we can be afraid of death because

5152
02:54:58,639 --> 02:55:01,439
we're afraid of hell or bad

5153
02:54:59,680 --> 02:55:02,880
reincarnation or the bardo or some kind

5154
02:55:01,439 --> 02:55:04,398
of idea of the afterlife we have where

5155
02:55:02,879 --> 02:55:05,199
we're projecting some kind of sentient

5156
02:55:04,398 --> 02:55:06,478
suffering

5157
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:09,439
but if we're afraid of just

5158
02:55:06,478 --> 02:55:09,438
non-experience

5159
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:14,398
i notice that every time i stay up late

5160
02:55:12,398 --> 02:55:16,239
enough that i'm really tired

5161
02:55:14,398 --> 02:55:17,599
i'm longing for deep deep sleep and

5162
02:55:16,239 --> 02:55:19,199
non-experience

5163
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:20,960
right like i'm actually longing for

5164
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:23,920
experience to stop

5165
02:55:20,959 --> 02:55:24,719
and it's not morbid it's not a bummer

5166
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:27,760
it's

5167
02:55:24,719 --> 02:55:28,239
and and i don't mind falling asleep and

5168
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:30,000
i

5169
02:55:28,239 --> 02:55:31,359
sometimes when i wake up want to go back

5170
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:33,120
into it and

5171
02:55:31,359 --> 02:55:34,800
then when it's done i'm happy to come

5172
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:37,120
out of it so

5173
02:55:34,799 --> 02:55:37,119
um

5174
02:55:38,639 --> 02:55:42,318
when we think about death and having

5175
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:45,040
finite time here

5176
02:55:42,318 --> 02:55:46,559
and we could talk about if we live for a

5177
02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:47,840
thousand years instead of a hundred or

5178
02:55:46,559 --> 02:55:49,519
something like that it'd still be fine

5179
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:51,279
night time

5180
02:55:49,520 --> 02:55:52,720
the one bummer with the age we die is

5181
02:55:51,279 --> 02:55:55,279
that i generally find that people

5182
02:55:52,719 --> 02:55:58,159
mostly start to emotionally mature just

5183
02:55:55,279 --> 02:56:00,399
shortly before they die

5184
02:55:58,159 --> 02:56:00,398
but

5185
02:56:02,239 --> 02:56:04,559
there's

5186
02:56:05,760 --> 02:56:10,840
if i get to live forever i i can just

5187
02:56:08,719 --> 02:56:13,840
stay focused on what's in it for me

5188
02:56:10,840 --> 02:56:13,840
forever

5189
02:56:14,559 --> 02:56:19,119
and if life continues and consciousness

5190
02:56:18,159 --> 02:56:20,879
and sentience and

5191
02:56:19,120 --> 02:56:23,359
people appreciating beauty and adding to

5192
02:56:20,879 --> 02:56:24,398
it and becoming continues my life

5193
02:56:23,359 --> 02:56:26,239
doesn't but my life

5194
02:56:24,398 --> 02:56:28,000
can have effects that continue well

5195
02:56:26,239 --> 02:56:30,159
beyond it

5196
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:32,000
then life with a capital l starts

5197
02:56:30,159 --> 02:56:33,520
mattering more to me than my life

5198
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:35,279
my life gets to be a part of an in

5199
02:56:33,520 --> 02:56:37,600
service too

5200
02:56:35,279 --> 02:56:38,880
and the whole thing about when old men

5201
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:40,318
plant trees the shade of which they'll

5202
02:56:38,879 --> 02:56:43,519
never

5203
02:56:40,318 --> 02:56:45,519
get to be in um i remember

5204
02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:47,760
the first time i read this poem by hafez

5205
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:49,920
the sufi poet

5206
02:56:47,760 --> 02:56:51,040
written in like the 13th century or

5207
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:54,478
something like that

5208
02:56:51,040 --> 02:56:56,720
and he talked about that if you're

5209
02:56:54,478 --> 02:56:58,398
lonely to think about him and he was

5210
02:56:56,719 --> 02:57:00,959
kind of leaning his spirit

5211
02:56:58,398 --> 02:57:01,760
um into yours across the distance of a

5212
02:57:00,959 --> 02:57:04,398
millennium

5213
02:57:01,760 --> 02:57:04,880
and would come for you with these poems

5214
02:57:04,398 --> 02:57:06,559
and now

5215
02:57:04,879 --> 02:57:07,759
he's thinking about people millennium

5216
02:57:06,559 --> 02:57:09,519
from now and caring about their

5217
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:11,040
experience and what they'd be suffering

5218
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:12,800
if they'd be lonely and could he offer

5219
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:15,920
something that could touch them

5220
02:57:12,799 --> 02:57:18,398
and it's just [ __ ] beautiful and

5221
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:19,840
so like the most beautiful parts of

5222
02:57:18,398 --> 02:57:22,639
humans have to do with something that

5223
02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:25,680
transcends what's in it for me

5224
02:57:22,639 --> 02:57:27,439
and death forces you to that so not

5225
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:29,680
not only does death create the urgency

5226
02:57:27,439 --> 02:57:33,520
it uh

5227
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:34,720
urgency of doing it you're very right it

5228
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:36,960
does have a sense

5229
02:57:34,719 --> 02:57:38,318
in which it uh incentivizes the

5230
02:57:36,959 --> 02:57:41,438
compersion

5231
02:57:38,318 --> 02:57:41,439
and the compassion

5232
02:57:42,079 --> 02:57:45,840
and the widening you remember einstein

5233
02:57:44,318 --> 02:57:47,439
had that quote something to the effect

5234
02:57:45,840 --> 02:57:48,719
of it's an optical delusion of

5235
02:57:47,439 --> 02:57:50,000
consciousness to believe there are

5236
02:57:48,719 --> 02:57:52,318
separate things

5237
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:53,520
there's this one thing we call universe

5238
02:57:52,318 --> 02:57:56,079
and uh

5239
02:57:53,520 --> 02:57:57,439
something about us being inside of a

5240
02:57:56,079 --> 02:58:00,318
prison of perception

5241
02:57:57,439 --> 02:58:02,840
that can only you know see a very narrow

5242
02:58:00,318 --> 02:58:05,840
little bit of it

5243
02:58:02,840 --> 02:58:09,200
but this this might be just

5244
02:58:05,840 --> 02:58:10,960
some weird disposition of mine but

5245
02:58:09,200 --> 02:58:13,840
when i think about the future after i'm

5246
02:58:10,959 --> 02:58:17,278
dead and i think about

5247
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:19,040
consciousness i think about

5248
02:58:17,279 --> 02:58:20,640
young people falling in love for the

5249
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:22,080
first time in their their experience and

5250
02:58:20,639 --> 02:58:25,358
i think about people being awed by

5251
02:58:22,079 --> 02:58:25,359
sunsets and i think about

5252
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:30,000
all of it right i can't not feel

5253
02:58:28,559 --> 02:58:33,199
connected to that

5254
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:35,760
do you feel some sadness

5255
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:37,840
to the very high likelihood that you

5256
02:58:35,760 --> 02:58:38,960
will be forgotten completely by all of

5257
02:58:37,840 --> 02:58:42,559
human history

5258
02:58:38,959 --> 02:58:46,159
you daniel the name

5259
02:58:42,559 --> 02:58:49,840
that that which cannot be named

5260
02:58:46,159 --> 02:58:49,840
systems like to self-perpetuate

5261
02:58:50,639 --> 02:58:55,680
egos do that the idea that i might do

5262
02:58:53,920 --> 02:58:57,200
something meaningful that future people

5263
02:58:55,680 --> 02:59:00,398
appreciate of course there's like a

5264
02:58:57,200 --> 02:59:03,279
certain sweetness to that idea

5265
02:59:00,398 --> 02:59:04,159
but i know how many people did something

5266
02:59:03,279 --> 02:59:05,680
did things

5267
02:59:04,159 --> 02:59:07,279
that i wouldn't be here without that my

5268
02:59:05,680 --> 02:59:09,359
life would be less without whose names i

5269
02:59:07,279 --> 02:59:12,239
will never know

5270
02:59:09,359 --> 02:59:14,079
and i feel a gratitude to them i feel a

5271
02:59:12,239 --> 02:59:15,039
closeness i feel touched by that and i

5272
02:59:14,079 --> 02:59:17,840
think

5273
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:19,520
to the degree that the future people are

5274
02:59:17,840 --> 02:59:22,000
conscious enough

5275
02:59:19,520 --> 02:59:23,120
there is a you know a lot of traditions

5276
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,799
had this kind of

5277
02:59:23,120 --> 02:59:26,880
are we being good ancestors and respect

5278
02:59:24,799 --> 02:59:30,079
for the ancestors beyond the names

5279
02:59:26,879 --> 02:59:31,519
i think that's a very healthy idea but

5280
02:59:30,079 --> 02:59:34,639
let me return to a much

5281
02:59:31,520 --> 02:59:36,319
less beautiful and uh much less pleasant

5282
02:59:34,639 --> 02:59:40,478
conversation

5283
02:59:36,318 --> 02:59:40,478
you mentioned prison back to x-risk okay

5284
02:59:40,799 --> 02:59:47,199
and conditioning you mentioned something

5285
02:59:44,239 --> 02:59:47,199
about the state

5286
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:55,279
so what role let's talk about

5287
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:57,040
companies governments parents

5288
02:59:55,279 --> 02:59:58,560
all the mechanisms that can be a source

5289
02:59:57,040 --> 03:00:01,600
of conditioning

5290
02:59:58,559 --> 03:00:04,478
which flavor of ice cream do you like

5291
03:00:01,600 --> 03:00:06,239
do you think the state is the right

5292
03:00:04,478 --> 03:00:08,159
thing for the future so governments that

5293
03:00:06,239 --> 03:00:10,079
are elected democratic systems

5294
03:00:08,159 --> 03:00:11,439
that are representing representative

5295
03:00:10,079 --> 03:00:15,039
democracy

5296
03:00:11,439 --> 03:00:17,920
is there some kind of political system

5297
03:00:15,040 --> 03:00:20,560
of governance that you find appealing is

5298
03:00:17,920 --> 03:00:23,439
it parents

5299
03:00:20,559 --> 03:00:24,000
meaning a very close-knit tribes of

5300
03:00:23,439 --> 03:00:27,359
conditioning

5301
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:30,719
that's the most essential and then uh

5302
03:00:27,359 --> 03:00:33,760
you and michael malus would happily

5303
03:00:30,719 --> 03:00:35,679
agree that it's anarchy or the state

5304
03:00:33,760 --> 03:00:38,000
should be

5305
03:00:35,680 --> 03:00:39,359
dissolved or destroyed or burned to the

5306
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:44,639
ground if you're michael malus

5307
03:00:39,359 --> 03:00:47,279
giggling holding the torch

5308
03:00:44,639 --> 03:00:48,159
as the fire burns so which which is it

5309
03:00:47,279 --> 03:00:52,159
is the state

5310
03:00:48,159 --> 03:00:55,200
can the state be good or is the state

5311
03:00:52,159 --> 03:00:56,559
bad for the conditioning of a beautiful

5312
03:00:55,200 --> 03:00:58,720
world

5313
03:00:56,559 --> 03:01:00,398
a or b this is like an s you like tests

5314
03:00:58,719 --> 03:01:01,519
you like to give these uh simplified

5315
03:01:00,398 --> 03:01:04,959
good or bad things

5316
03:01:01,520 --> 03:01:06,720
um would i like the state

5317
03:01:04,959 --> 03:01:08,159
that we live in currently the united

5318
03:01:06,719 --> 03:01:10,079
states federal government to

5319
03:01:08,159 --> 03:01:11,439
stop existing today no i would really

5320
03:01:10,079 --> 03:01:14,000
not like that um

5321
03:01:11,439 --> 03:01:15,920
i think that would be not quite bad for

5322
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:19,439
the world in a lot of ways

5323
03:01:15,920 --> 03:01:22,000
uh do i think that it's a

5324
03:01:19,439 --> 03:01:23,120
optimal social system and maximally uh

5325
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,079
just and humane and

5326
03:01:23,120 --> 03:01:26,479
all those things and i wanted to

5327
03:01:24,079 --> 03:01:28,879
continue as is no also not that

5328
03:01:26,478 --> 03:01:30,879
um but i am much more interested in it

5329
03:01:28,879 --> 03:01:34,639
being able to evolve to a better thing

5330
03:01:30,879 --> 03:01:35,679
without going through um the catastrophe

5331
03:01:34,639 --> 03:01:38,318
phase that i think

5332
03:01:35,680 --> 03:01:40,159
it's just non-existence would give so

5333
03:01:38,318 --> 03:01:43,359
what size

5334
03:01:40,159 --> 03:01:45,520
a state is good in a sense like

5335
03:01:43,359 --> 03:01:46,960
do we should we as a human society as

5336
03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:48,800
this world becomes more globalized

5337
03:01:46,959 --> 03:01:50,318
should we be constantly striving to

5338
03:01:48,799 --> 03:01:53,119
reduce

5339
03:01:50,318 --> 03:01:54,879
the set you we can we can put on a map

5340
03:01:53,120 --> 03:01:58,560
like right now literally

5341
03:01:54,879 --> 03:01:59,599
like the the centers of power in the

5342
03:01:58,559 --> 03:02:02,000
world

5343
03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:03,279
some of them are tech companies some of

5344
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:05,200
them are governments

5345
03:02:03,279 --> 03:02:06,800
should we be trying to as much as

5346
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:09,040
possible decentralize

5347
03:02:06,799 --> 03:02:10,398
the power to where it's very difficult

5348
03:02:09,040 --> 03:02:13,760
to point on the map

5349
03:02:10,398 --> 03:02:16,799
the centers of power and that means

5350
03:02:13,760 --> 03:02:18,398
making the state however there's a bunch

5351
03:02:16,799 --> 03:02:19,679
of different ways to make the government

5352
03:02:18,398 --> 03:02:23,519
much smaller

5353
03:02:19,680 --> 03:02:26,639
that could be re reducing

5354
03:02:23,520 --> 03:02:28,720
in the united states reducing the

5355
03:02:26,639 --> 03:02:29,760
the funding for the government all those

5356
03:02:28,719 --> 03:02:31,599
kinds of things there's a set of

5357
03:02:29,760 --> 03:02:34,639
responsibilities

5358
03:02:31,600 --> 03:02:37,680
the the set of powers it could be

5359
03:02:34,639 --> 03:02:40,799
i mean this is far out but making

5360
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:41,840
more nations or maybe nations not in the

5361
03:02:40,799 --> 03:02:43,759
space that are

5362
03:02:41,840 --> 03:02:45,520
defined by geographic location but

5363
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:47,359
rather in the space of ideas

5364
03:02:45,520 --> 03:02:49,120
which is what anarchy is about so

5365
03:02:47,359 --> 03:02:51,279
anarchy is about forming collectives

5366
03:02:49,120 --> 03:02:53,359
based on their set of ideas

5367
03:02:51,279 --> 03:02:54,319
and doing so dynamically not based on

5368
03:02:53,359 --> 03:02:58,880
where you were born

5369
03:02:54,318 --> 03:03:01,039
and so on i think we can say that the

5370
03:02:58,879 --> 03:03:02,959
natural state of humans if we want to

5371
03:03:01,040 --> 03:03:06,160
describe such a thing

5372
03:03:02,959 --> 03:03:09,278
was to live in tribes

5373
03:03:06,159 --> 03:03:11,119
that were below the dunbar number

5374
03:03:09,279 --> 03:03:13,600
meaning that for a few hundred thousand

5375
03:03:11,120 --> 03:03:15,359
years of human history

5376
03:03:13,600 --> 03:03:16,640
all of the groups of humans mostly

5377
03:03:15,359 --> 03:03:17,760
stayed under that size

5378
03:03:16,639 --> 03:03:19,920
and whenever it would get up to that

5379
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:22,079
size it would end up cleaving and so it

5380
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:23,680
seems like there's a pretty strong

5381
03:03:22,079 --> 03:03:25,200
but there weren't individual humans out

5382
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:27,439
in the wild doing really well right so

5383
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:29,920
we were a group animal but with groups

5384
03:03:27,439 --> 03:03:31,760
that had a specific size so we could say

5385
03:03:29,920 --> 03:03:33,359
in a way humans were being domesticated

5386
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:34,880
by those groups they were learning how

5387
03:03:33,359 --> 03:03:35,439
to have certain rules to participate

5388
03:03:34,879 --> 03:03:36,959
with the group

5389
03:03:35,439 --> 03:03:39,439
without which you'd get kicked out but

5390
03:03:36,959 --> 03:03:40,159
that that's still the wild state of

5391
03:03:39,439 --> 03:03:42,318
people

5392
03:03:40,159 --> 03:03:43,520
and and maybe it's useful to do as a

5393
03:03:42,318 --> 03:03:45,199
side statement

5394
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:47,279
which i've recently looked at a bunch of

5395
03:03:45,200 --> 03:03:49,279
papers around dunbar's number

5396
03:03:47,279 --> 03:03:50,720
where the mean is actually 150. if you

5397
03:03:49,279 --> 03:03:53,600
actually look at the original papers

5398
03:03:50,719 --> 03:03:54,079
to range it's really a range so it's

5399
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:56,159
actually

5400
03:03:54,079 --> 03:03:57,840
some somewhere under a thousand so it's

5401
03:03:56,159 --> 03:03:58,879
a range from like two to five hundred or

5402
03:03:57,840 --> 03:04:01,279
whatever it is

5403
03:03:58,879 --> 03:04:03,119
but like you could argue that the uh i

5404
03:04:01,279 --> 03:04:06,159
think it actually is exactly two

5405
03:04:03,120 --> 03:04:08,160
uh two the range is two to five hundred

5406
03:04:06,159 --> 03:04:10,719
and twenty something like that

5407
03:04:08,159 --> 03:04:11,760
and this is the mean that's taken

5408
03:04:10,719 --> 03:04:14,398
crudely

5409
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:15,520
it's not a very good paper the the in

5410
03:04:14,398 --> 03:04:19,199
terms of the actual

5411
03:04:15,520 --> 03:04:21,040
numerical numerically speaking but

5412
03:04:19,200 --> 03:04:23,359
it'd be interesting if there's a bunch

5413
03:04:21,040 --> 03:04:25,040
of dunbar numbers

5414
03:04:23,359 --> 03:04:26,880
that could be computed for particular

5415
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:28,479
environments particular conditions so on

5416
03:04:26,879 --> 03:04:30,239
it is very true that they're likely to

5417
03:04:28,478 --> 03:04:32,478
be something small

5418
03:04:30,239 --> 03:04:34,559
you know under a million but it'd be

5419
03:04:32,478 --> 03:04:36,799
interesting if we can expand that number

5420
03:04:34,559 --> 03:04:38,398
in interesting ways that will change the

5421
03:04:36,799 --> 03:04:39,599
fabric of this conversation i just want

5422
03:04:38,398 --> 03:04:41,840
to kind of throw that in there

5423
03:04:39,600 --> 03:04:42,880
i don't know the if the 150 is baked in

5424
03:04:41,840 --> 03:04:44,478
some hollow in the heart

5425
03:04:42,879 --> 03:04:45,679
into the hardware we can talk about some

5426
03:04:44,478 --> 03:04:46,959
of the things that it probably has to do

5427
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:50,079
with

5428
03:04:46,959 --> 03:04:51,759
up to a certain number of people and

5429
03:04:50,079 --> 03:04:53,760
this is going to be variable based on

5430
03:04:51,760 --> 03:04:55,439
the social technologies that mediate it

5431
03:04:53,760 --> 03:04:57,809
to some degree we can talk about that

5432
03:04:55,439 --> 03:04:59,439
in a minute um

5433
03:04:57,809 --> 03:05:01,039
[Music]

5434
03:04:59,439 --> 03:05:02,960
up to a certain number of people

5435
03:05:01,040 --> 03:05:04,080
everybody can know everybody else pretty

5436
03:05:02,959 --> 03:05:06,719
intimately

5437
03:05:04,079 --> 03:05:09,680
so let's go ahead and just take 150 as a

5438
03:05:06,719 --> 03:05:09,679
as an average number

5439
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:15,200
everybody can know everyone intimately

5440
03:05:13,520 --> 03:05:18,239
enough that

5441
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:20,159
if your actions made anyone else do

5442
03:05:18,239 --> 03:05:21,760
poorly it's your extended family

5443
03:05:20,159 --> 03:05:23,200
and you're stuck living with them and

5444
03:05:21,760 --> 03:05:25,040
you know who they are and there's no

5445
03:05:23,200 --> 03:05:26,560
anonymous people there's no just them

5446
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:30,720
and over there

5447
03:05:26,559 --> 03:05:32,159
and that's one part of what leads to a

5448
03:05:30,719 --> 03:05:33,119
kind of tribal process where it's good

5449
03:05:32,159 --> 03:05:34,879
for the individual and good for the

5450
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:38,640
whole has a coupling

5451
03:05:34,879 --> 03:05:40,239
also below that scale everyone is

5452
03:05:38,639 --> 03:05:41,840
somewhat aware of what everybody else is

5453
03:05:40,239 --> 03:05:44,719
doing there's not

5454
03:05:41,840 --> 03:05:45,200
groups that are very siloed and as a

5455
03:05:44,719 --> 03:05:46,639
result

5456
03:05:45,200 --> 03:05:48,640
it's actually very hard to get away with

5457
03:05:46,639 --> 03:05:50,398
bad behavior there's a forced kind of

5458
03:05:48,639 --> 03:05:52,159
transparency

5459
03:05:50,398 --> 03:05:53,599
and so you don't need kind of like the

5460
03:05:52,159 --> 03:05:56,398
state

5461
03:05:53,600 --> 03:05:57,840
in in that way but lying to people

5462
03:05:56,398 --> 03:05:59,358
doesn't actually get you ahead

5463
03:05:57,840 --> 03:06:00,960
sociopathic behavior doesn't get you

5464
03:05:59,359 --> 03:06:04,239
ahead because it gets seen

5465
03:06:00,959 --> 03:06:05,599
and so there's a conditioning

5466
03:06:04,239 --> 03:06:07,039
environment where the

5467
03:06:05,600 --> 03:06:09,120
individuals behaving in a way that is

5468
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:11,760
aligned with the interest of the tribe

5469
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:12,319
is what gets conditioned when it gets to

5470
03:06:11,760 --> 03:06:15,359
be a much

5471
03:06:12,318 --> 03:06:17,600
larger system it becomes easier to

5472
03:06:15,359 --> 03:06:19,600
hide certain things from the group as a

5473
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:21,040
whole as well as to be less emotionally

5474
03:06:19,600 --> 03:06:23,760
bound to a bunch of anonymous

5475
03:06:21,040 --> 03:06:24,800
people i would say there's also a

5476
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:27,840
communication

5477
03:06:24,799 --> 03:06:29,119
protocol where up to about that number

5478
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:31,279
of people

5479
03:06:29,120 --> 03:06:33,120
we could all sit around a tribal council

5480
03:06:31,279 --> 03:06:34,880
and be part of a conversation around a

5481
03:06:33,120 --> 03:06:36,399
really big decision do we migrate do we

5482
03:06:34,879 --> 03:06:37,759
not migrate do we you know some

5483
03:06:36,398 --> 03:06:38,799
something like that do we get rid of

5484
03:06:37,760 --> 03:06:43,520
this person

5485
03:06:38,799 --> 03:06:45,840
and why why would i want to

5486
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:48,319
agree to be a part of a larger group

5487
03:06:45,840 --> 03:06:51,600
where everyone can't be part of that

5488
03:06:48,318 --> 03:06:53,760
council and so i am going to now be

5489
03:06:51,600 --> 03:06:55,120
subject to law that i have no say in if

5490
03:06:53,760 --> 03:06:56,639
i could be part of a smaller group that

5491
03:06:55,120 --> 03:06:58,319
could still survive and i get a say in

5492
03:06:56,639 --> 03:07:00,079
the law that i'm subject to so i think

5493
03:06:58,318 --> 03:07:01,840
the cleaving

5494
03:07:00,079 --> 03:07:03,600
and a way we can look at it beyond the

5495
03:07:01,840 --> 03:07:05,120
dunbar number two is we can look at that

5496
03:07:03,600 --> 03:07:07,120
a civilization has

5497
03:07:05,120 --> 03:07:08,800
binding energy that is holding them

5498
03:07:07,120 --> 03:07:10,000
together and has cleaving energy and if

5499
03:07:08,799 --> 03:07:11,438
the binding energy exceeds

5500
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:13,920
the cleaving energy that civilization

5501
03:07:11,439 --> 03:07:15,279
will last and so there are things that

5502
03:07:13,920 --> 03:07:16,719
we can do to decrease the cleaving

5503
03:07:15,279 --> 03:07:18,239
energy within the society things we can

5504
03:07:16,719 --> 03:07:20,159
do to increase the binding energy i

5505
03:07:18,239 --> 03:07:21,760
think naturally we saw that had certain

5506
03:07:20,159 --> 03:07:24,079
characteristics up to a certain size

5507
03:07:21,760 --> 03:07:26,000
kind of tribalism

5508
03:07:24,079 --> 03:07:28,239
that ended with a few things it ended

5509
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:31,279
with people having migrated enough that

5510
03:07:28,239 --> 03:07:33,039
when you started to get resource wars it

5511
03:07:31,279 --> 03:07:34,479
you couldn't just migrate away easily

5512
03:07:33,040 --> 03:07:35,200
and so tribal warfare became more

5513
03:07:34,478 --> 03:07:37,840
obligated

5514
03:07:35,200 --> 03:07:39,520
it involved the plow in the beginning of

5515
03:07:37,840 --> 03:07:41,279
real economic surplus there were so

5516
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:44,800
there were a few different kind of

5517
03:07:41,279 --> 03:07:44,800
um forcing functions

5518
03:07:45,279 --> 03:07:49,439
but we're talking about what size should

5519
03:07:47,279 --> 03:07:50,800
it be right what size should a society

5520
03:07:49,439 --> 03:07:53,200
be and i think

5521
03:07:50,799 --> 03:07:53,840
the idea like if we think about your

5522
03:07:53,200 --> 03:07:56,079
body for

5523
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:58,079
a moment as a self-organizing complex

5524
03:07:56,079 --> 03:08:00,318
system that is multi-scaled

5525
03:07:58,079 --> 03:08:02,799
we think about bodies of wonderland our

5526
03:08:00,318 --> 03:08:06,478
body is a wonderland yeah

5527
03:08:02,799 --> 03:08:07,438
uh you have that's a john mayer song i

5528
03:08:06,478 --> 03:08:10,239
apologize

5529
03:08:07,439 --> 03:08:12,159
but yes so uh if we think about our body

5530
03:08:10,239 --> 03:08:14,398
and the billions of cells that are in it

5531
03:08:12,159 --> 03:08:16,559
well you don't have like think about how

5532
03:08:14,398 --> 03:08:18,639
ridiculous it would be to try to have

5533
03:08:16,559 --> 03:08:21,359
all the tens of trillions of cells in it

5534
03:08:18,639 --> 03:08:24,478
with no internal organization structure

5535
03:08:21,359 --> 03:08:25,520
right just like a sea of protoplasm your

5536
03:08:24,478 --> 03:08:29,039
democracy

5537
03:08:25,520 --> 03:08:31,279
and so you have cells and tissues

5538
03:08:29,040 --> 03:08:32,960
and then you have tissues and organs and

5539
03:08:31,279 --> 03:08:33,680
organs and organ systems and so you have

5540
03:08:32,959 --> 03:08:35,679
these layers of

5541
03:08:33,680 --> 03:08:37,680
organization and then obviously the

5542
03:08:35,680 --> 03:08:41,840
individual and a tribe in a

5543
03:08:37,680 --> 03:08:43,439
ecosystem and each of the higher layers

5544
03:08:41,840 --> 03:08:45,120
are both based on the lower layers but

5545
03:08:43,439 --> 03:08:47,439
also influencing them

5546
03:08:45,120 --> 03:08:48,160
i think the future of civilization will

5547
03:08:47,439 --> 03:08:49,760
be similar

5548
03:08:48,159 --> 03:08:50,639
which is there's a level of governance

5549
03:08:49,760 --> 03:08:51,279
that happens at the level of the

5550
03:08:50,639 --> 03:08:54,398
individual

5551
03:08:51,279 --> 03:08:56,000
my own governance of my own choice

5552
03:08:54,398 --> 03:08:57,439
i think there's a level that happens at

5553
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:59,120
the level of a family

5554
03:08:57,439 --> 03:09:00,479
we're making decisions together we're

5555
03:08:59,120 --> 03:09:01,359
inter-influencing each other and

5556
03:09:00,478 --> 03:09:02,079
affecting each other taking

5557
03:09:01,359 --> 03:09:05,040
responsibility

5558
03:09:02,079 --> 03:09:06,478
for the idea of an extended family and

5559
03:09:05,040 --> 03:09:08,080
you can see that like for a lot of human

5560
03:09:06,478 --> 03:09:09,119
history we had an extended family we had

5561
03:09:08,079 --> 03:09:11,039
a local community

5562
03:09:09,120 --> 03:09:13,200
a local church or whatever it was we had

5563
03:09:11,040 --> 03:09:14,960
these intermediate structures

5564
03:09:13,200 --> 03:09:17,120
whereas right now this kind of like the

5565
03:09:14,959 --> 03:09:20,159
individual

5566
03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:22,319
producer consumer taxpayer voter and the

5567
03:09:20,159 --> 03:09:23,760
massive nation state global complex

5568
03:09:22,318 --> 03:09:25,359
and not that much in the way of

5569
03:09:23,760 --> 03:09:26,559
intermediate structures that we relate

5570
03:09:25,359 --> 03:09:28,238
with and not that much in the way of

5571
03:09:26,559 --> 03:09:32,559
real personal dynamics all

5572
03:09:28,238 --> 03:09:35,760
impersonalized made fungible and

5573
03:09:32,559 --> 03:09:38,478
so i think that we have to have

5574
03:09:35,760 --> 03:09:40,079
global governance meaning i think we

5575
03:09:38,478 --> 03:09:41,278
have to have governance at the scale we

5576
03:09:40,079 --> 03:09:43,120
affect stuff and if

5577
03:09:41,279 --> 03:09:44,640
if anybody is messing up the oceans that

5578
03:09:43,120 --> 03:09:46,479
matters for everybody so that

5579
03:09:44,639 --> 03:09:47,840
that can't only be national or only

5580
03:09:46,478 --> 03:09:49,358
local

5581
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:50,880
everyone is scared of the idea of global

5582
03:09:49,359 --> 03:09:52,960
governance because we think about some

5583
03:09:50,879 --> 03:09:55,039
top-down system of imposition that now

5584
03:09:52,959 --> 03:09:56,478
has no checks and balances on power i'm

5585
03:09:55,040 --> 03:09:57,600
scared of that same version so i'm not

5586
03:09:56,478 --> 03:09:59,438
talking about that kind of global

5587
03:09:57,600 --> 03:10:01,040
governance

5588
03:09:59,439 --> 03:10:02,800
um it's why i'm even using the word

5589
03:10:01,040 --> 03:10:04,960
governance as a process rather than

5590
03:10:02,799 --> 03:10:08,238
government as an imposed

5591
03:10:04,959 --> 03:10:09,679
uh phenomena and so i think we have to

5592
03:10:08,238 --> 03:10:11,439
have global governance but i think we

5593
03:10:09,680 --> 03:10:12,000
also have to have local governance and

5594
03:10:11,439 --> 03:10:15,200
there has to be

5595
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:16,799
relationships between them that each

5596
03:10:15,200 --> 03:10:18,800
where there are both checks and balances

5597
03:10:16,799 --> 03:10:20,879
in power flows of information

5598
03:10:18,799 --> 03:10:22,559
so i think governance at the level of

5599
03:10:20,879 --> 03:10:24,879
cities will be a bigger

5600
03:10:22,559 --> 03:10:26,398
deal in the future than governance at

5601
03:10:24,879 --> 03:10:26,879
the level of nation-states because i

5602
03:10:26,398 --> 03:10:29,358
think

5603
03:10:26,879 --> 03:10:30,159
nation-states are largely fictitious

5604
03:10:29,359 --> 03:10:32,880
things

5605
03:10:30,159 --> 03:10:34,159
that are defined by wars and agreements

5606
03:10:32,879 --> 03:10:36,478
to stop wars and like that

5607
03:10:34,159 --> 03:10:37,680
i think cities are based on real things

5608
03:10:36,478 --> 03:10:40,318
that will keep being real we're the

5609
03:10:37,680 --> 03:10:41,600
proximity of certain things together

5610
03:10:40,318 --> 03:10:43,519
the physical proximity of things

5611
03:10:41,600 --> 03:10:44,399
together gives increased value of those

5612
03:10:43,520 --> 03:10:46,399
things

5613
03:10:44,398 --> 03:10:48,719
so you look at like jeffrey west's work

5614
03:10:46,398 --> 03:10:50,719
on scale and finding that

5615
03:10:48,719 --> 03:10:52,318
companies and nation states and things

5616
03:10:50,719 --> 03:10:53,920
that have a kind of complicated

5617
03:10:52,318 --> 03:10:54,799
agreement structure get diminishing

5618
03:10:53,920 --> 03:10:56,960
return

5619
03:10:54,799 --> 03:10:58,559
of you of production per capita as the

5620
03:10:56,959 --> 03:11:00,000
total number of people increases beyond

5621
03:10:58,559 --> 03:11:00,559
about the tribal scale but the city

5622
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,879
actually gets

5623
03:11:00,559 --> 03:11:04,478
increasing productivity per capita but

5624
03:11:02,879 --> 03:11:05,920
it's not designed it's kind of this

5625
03:11:04,478 --> 03:11:07,679
organic thing right

5626
03:11:05,920 --> 03:11:09,680
so there should be governance at the

5627
03:11:07,680 --> 03:11:11,760
level of cities because people can sense

5628
03:11:09,680 --> 03:11:13,279
and actually have some agency there

5629
03:11:11,760 --> 03:11:14,960
probably neighborhoods and smaller

5630
03:11:13,279 --> 03:11:16,479
scales within it and also verticals

5631
03:11:14,959 --> 03:11:17,839
and some of it won't be geographic it'll

5632
03:11:16,478 --> 03:11:18,719
be network-based right networks of

5633
03:11:17,840 --> 03:11:20,478
affinities

5634
03:11:18,719 --> 03:11:22,079
so i don't think the future is one type

5635
03:11:20,478 --> 03:11:24,959
of governance

5636
03:11:22,079 --> 03:11:26,159
now what we can say more broadly is say

5637
03:11:24,959 --> 03:11:27,679
when we're talking about groups of

5638
03:11:26,159 --> 03:11:29,600
people that inter-affect each other

5639
03:11:27,680 --> 03:11:31,120
the idea of a civilization is that we

5640
03:11:29,600 --> 03:11:32,640
can figure out how to coordinate our

5641
03:11:31,120 --> 03:11:34,479
choice making

5642
03:11:32,639 --> 03:11:37,039
to not be at war with each other and

5643
03:11:34,478 --> 03:11:38,478
hopefully increase total

5644
03:11:37,040 --> 03:11:40,319
productive capacity that's good for

5645
03:11:38,478 --> 03:11:42,318
everybody division of labor and

5646
03:11:40,318 --> 03:11:45,039
specialty so we all get

5647
03:11:42,318 --> 03:11:45,519
more better stuff and whatever but it's

5648
03:11:45,040 --> 03:11:49,279
a

5649
03:11:45,520 --> 03:11:49,279
it's a coordination of our choice making

5650
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:53,279
i think we can look at civilizations

5651
03:11:51,520 --> 03:11:55,279
failing on the side

5652
03:11:53,279 --> 03:11:56,640
of not having enough coordination of

5653
03:11:55,279 --> 03:11:58,319
choice making so they fail on the side

5654
03:11:56,639 --> 03:12:00,639
of chaos and then they cleave and an

5655
03:11:58,318 --> 03:12:04,000
internal war comes about or whatever

5656
03:12:00,639 --> 03:12:06,639
or they can't make smart decisions and

5657
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:09,760
they overuse their resources or whatever

5658
03:12:06,639 --> 03:12:11,920
or it can fail on the side of trying to

5659
03:12:09,760 --> 03:12:14,398
get order

5660
03:12:11,920 --> 03:12:16,000
via imposition via force and so it fails

5661
03:12:14,398 --> 03:12:16,398
on the side of oppression which ends up

5662
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:19,600
being

5663
03:12:16,398 --> 03:12:21,760
for a while functional ish

5664
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:23,920
for the thing as a whole but miserable

5665
03:12:21,760 --> 03:12:25,680
for most people in it until it fails

5666
03:12:23,920 --> 03:12:27,120
either because of revolt or because it

5667
03:12:25,680 --> 03:12:27,920
can't innovate enough or something like

5668
03:12:27,120 --> 03:12:29,439
that

5669
03:12:27,920 --> 03:12:31,120
and so there's this like toggling

5670
03:12:29,439 --> 03:12:34,318
between

5671
03:12:31,120 --> 03:12:36,960
order via oppression and chaos and i

5672
03:12:34,318 --> 03:12:38,719
think the idea of democracy

5673
03:12:36,959 --> 03:12:40,639
not the way we've implemented it but the

5674
03:12:38,719 --> 03:12:42,478
idea of it whether we're talking about

5675
03:12:40,639 --> 03:12:45,358
a representative democracy or a direct

5676
03:12:42,478 --> 03:12:47,438
digital democracy liquid democracy uh

5677
03:12:45,359 --> 03:12:50,238
republic or whatever the idea of an open

5678
03:12:47,439 --> 03:12:53,200
society participatory governance

5679
03:12:50,238 --> 03:12:54,799
is can we have order that is emergent

5680
03:12:53,200 --> 03:12:58,079
rather than imposed

5681
03:12:54,799 --> 03:13:00,478
so that we aren't stuck with chaos and

5682
03:12:58,079 --> 03:13:03,279
infighting and inability to coordinate

5683
03:13:00,478 --> 03:13:06,959
and we're also not stuck with oppression

5684
03:13:03,279 --> 03:13:08,319
and what would it take to have emergent

5685
03:13:06,959 --> 03:13:10,000
order

5686
03:13:08,318 --> 03:13:12,840
this is the most kind of central

5687
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:15,680
question for me these days

5688
03:13:12,840 --> 03:13:17,200
because if

5689
03:13:15,680 --> 03:13:18,720
we look at what different nation states

5690
03:13:17,200 --> 03:13:20,560
are doing around the world and we see

5691
03:13:18,719 --> 03:13:23,760
nation states that are more

5692
03:13:20,559 --> 03:13:24,879
authoritarian that in some ways are

5693
03:13:23,760 --> 03:13:26,318
actually coordinating much more

5694
03:13:24,879 --> 03:13:30,398
effectively

5695
03:13:26,318 --> 03:13:32,318
so for instance we can see that

5696
03:13:30,398 --> 03:13:34,000
china has built high-speed rail not just

5697
03:13:32,318 --> 03:13:35,760
through its country but around the world

5698
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:38,079
and the us hasn't built any high-speed

5699
03:13:35,760 --> 03:13:39,760
rail yet you can see that it brought 300

5700
03:13:38,079 --> 03:13:40,398
million people out of poverty in a time

5701
03:13:39,760 --> 03:13:42,719
where

5702
03:13:40,398 --> 03:13:43,680
we've had increasing economic inequality

5703
03:13:42,719 --> 03:13:46,719
happening

5704
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:48,159
you can see like that

5705
03:13:46,719 --> 03:13:49,679
if there was a single country that could

5706
03:13:48,159 --> 03:13:50,959
make all of its own stuff if the global

5707
03:13:49,680 --> 03:13:52,800
supply chains failed

5708
03:13:50,959 --> 03:13:54,559
china would be the closest one to being

5709
03:13:52,799 --> 03:13:57,759
able to start to go closed

5710
03:13:54,559 --> 03:13:58,318
loop on fundamental things uh belt and

5711
03:13:57,760 --> 03:14:01,760
road

5712
03:13:58,318 --> 03:14:02,559
initiative supply chain on rare earth

5713
03:14:01,760 --> 03:14:04,639
metals

5714
03:14:02,559 --> 03:14:06,159
transistor manufacturing that is like oh

5715
03:14:04,639 --> 03:14:08,639
they're actually coordinating more

5716
03:14:06,159 --> 03:14:12,879
effectively in some important ways

5717
03:14:08,639 --> 03:14:17,199
in the last call it 30 years and

5718
03:14:12,879 --> 03:14:20,398
that's imposed order in post order and

5719
03:14:17,200 --> 03:14:24,479
we can see that if in the u.s

5720
03:14:20,398 --> 03:14:26,398
if no let's look at why real quick

5721
03:14:24,478 --> 03:14:27,920
we know why we created term limits so

5722
03:14:26,398 --> 03:14:29,439
that we wouldn't have

5723
03:14:27,920 --> 03:14:30,879
forever monarchs that's the thing we

5724
03:14:29,439 --> 03:14:32,479
were trying to get away from and that

5725
03:14:30,879 --> 03:14:34,159
there would be checks and balances on

5726
03:14:32,478 --> 03:14:36,559
power and that kind of thing

5727
03:14:34,159 --> 03:14:38,000
but that also has created a negative

5728
03:14:36,559 --> 03:14:40,398
second order effect which is nobody

5729
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:41,920
does long-term planning because somebody

5730
03:14:40,398 --> 03:14:42,959
comes in who's got four years they want

5731
03:14:41,920 --> 03:14:44,159
re-elected

5732
03:14:42,959 --> 03:14:46,000
they don't do anything that doesn't

5733
03:14:44,159 --> 03:14:47,119
create a return within four years they

5734
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:50,079
will end up getting them

5735
03:14:47,120 --> 03:14:51,359
elected re-elected and so the 30-year

5736
03:14:50,079 --> 03:14:53,039
industrial development to build

5737
03:14:51,359 --> 03:14:54,640
high-speed trains or

5738
03:14:53,040 --> 03:14:56,239
the new kind of fusion energy or

5739
03:14:54,639 --> 03:14:56,959
whatever it is just doesn't get invested

5740
03:14:56,238 --> 03:15:00,398
in

5741
03:14:56,959 --> 03:15:02,238
and then if you have left versus right

5742
03:15:00,398 --> 03:15:03,599
where whatever someone does for four

5743
03:15:02,238 --> 03:15:05,520
years then the other guy gets in and

5744
03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:07,120
undoes it for four years

5745
03:15:05,520 --> 03:15:08,479
and most of the energy goes into

5746
03:15:07,120 --> 03:15:10,720
campaigning against each other this

5747
03:15:08,478 --> 03:15:12,559
system is just dissipating as heat

5748
03:15:10,719 --> 03:15:14,159
right like it's just burning up as heat

5749
03:15:12,559 --> 03:15:15,760
and the system that has no term limits

5750
03:15:14,159 --> 03:15:17,920
and no internal friction in fighting

5751
03:15:15,760 --> 03:15:21,840
because they got rid of those people

5752
03:15:17,920 --> 03:15:21,840
can actually coordinate better but

5753
03:15:22,079 --> 03:15:25,279
uh i would argue it has its own fail

5754
03:15:24,238 --> 03:15:27,600
states eventually

5755
03:15:25,279 --> 03:15:28,720
and dystopic properties that are not the

5756
03:15:27,600 --> 03:15:31,120
thing we want

5757
03:15:28,719 --> 03:15:32,000
so the goal is to accomplish to create a

5758
03:15:31,120 --> 03:15:34,479
system that does

5759
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:36,238
long-term planning without the negative

5760
03:15:34,478 --> 03:15:38,799
effects of a monarch

5761
03:15:36,238 --> 03:15:41,359
or dictator that stays there for the

5762
03:15:38,799 --> 03:15:41,358
long term

5763
03:15:41,680 --> 03:15:43,920
and

5764
03:15:44,799 --> 03:15:50,318
accomplish that through uh not doing the

5765
03:15:48,478 --> 03:15:53,278
imposition

5766
03:15:50,318 --> 03:15:54,719
of a single leader but through uh

5767
03:15:53,279 --> 03:15:57,760
emergence so

5768
03:15:54,719 --> 03:16:00,000
it doesn't that perhaps

5769
03:15:57,760 --> 03:16:00,880
first of all the technology in itself

5770
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:03,279
seems to me

5771
03:16:00,879 --> 03:16:04,799
maybe disagree allow for different

5772
03:16:03,279 --> 03:16:07,439
possibilities here

5773
03:16:04,799 --> 03:16:08,159
which is make primary the system not the

5774
03:16:07,439 --> 03:16:13,600
humans

5775
03:16:08,159 --> 03:16:17,359
so the the the basic uh the medium

5776
03:16:13,600 --> 03:16:21,520
on which the democracy happens like

5777
03:16:17,359 --> 03:16:24,960
like a platform or where people can

5778
03:16:21,520 --> 03:16:28,640
make decisions do the choice making

5779
03:16:24,959 --> 03:16:28,639
the coordination of the choice making

5780
03:16:28,719 --> 03:16:32,559
where emerges some kind of order to

5781
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:35,439
where like something that applies at the

5782
03:16:32,559 --> 03:16:39,039
scale of the family the extended family

5783
03:16:35,439 --> 03:16:41,359
the city the the country

5784
03:16:39,040 --> 03:16:43,120
the the continent the whole world and

5785
03:16:41,359 --> 03:16:45,040
then does that so dynamically

5786
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:48,000
constantly changing based on the needs

5787
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:52,160
of the people sort of always evolving

5788
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:55,439
and uh it would all be owned by google

5789
03:16:52,159 --> 03:16:57,119
like doesn't doesn't this is there a way

5790
03:16:55,439 --> 03:16:58,880
to um

5791
03:16:57,120 --> 03:17:00,880
so first of all you're optimistic that

5792
03:16:58,879 --> 03:17:02,318
it you could basically create like

5793
03:17:00,879 --> 03:17:05,039
technology can save us

5794
03:17:02,318 --> 03:17:06,959
technology at creating platforms by

5795
03:17:05,040 --> 03:17:07,840
technology i mean like software network

5796
03:17:06,959 --> 03:17:11,199
platforms

5797
03:17:07,840 --> 03:17:13,200
that allows humans to deliberate

5798
03:17:11,200 --> 03:17:14,640
like make government together

5799
03:17:13,200 --> 03:17:16,960
dynamically

5800
03:17:14,639 --> 03:17:19,119
without the need for a leader that's on

5801
03:17:16,959 --> 03:17:22,000
a podium screaming stuff

5802
03:17:19,120 --> 03:17:23,120
that's one and two if you're optimistic

5803
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:25,359
about that

5804
03:17:23,120 --> 03:17:27,439
are you also optimistic about the ceos

5805
03:17:25,359 --> 03:17:31,040
of such platforms

5806
03:17:27,439 --> 03:17:34,398
the idea that technology is

5807
03:17:31,040 --> 03:17:36,640
values neutral values agnostic and

5808
03:17:34,398 --> 03:17:38,719
people can use it for constructive or

5809
03:17:36,639 --> 03:17:41,840
destructive purposes but it doesn't

5810
03:17:38,719 --> 03:17:43,358
predispose anything it's just it's just

5811
03:17:41,840 --> 03:17:46,159
silly and naive

5812
03:17:43,359 --> 03:17:47,840
technology elicits patterns of human

5813
03:17:46,159 --> 03:17:49,119
behavior because those who utilize it

5814
03:17:47,840 --> 03:17:50,639
and get ahead

5815
03:17:49,120 --> 03:17:52,560
end up behaving differently because of

5816
03:17:50,639 --> 03:17:53,439
their utilization of it and then other

5817
03:17:52,559 --> 03:17:54,879
people

5818
03:17:53,439 --> 03:17:56,559
then they end up shaping the world or

5819
03:17:54,879 --> 03:17:56,959
other people race to also get the power

5820
03:17:56,559 --> 03:17:59,119
of the

5821
03:17:56,959 --> 03:18:01,199
technology and so there's whole schools

5822
03:17:59,120 --> 03:18:03,120
of anthropology that look at the

5823
03:18:01,200 --> 03:18:05,760
effect on social systems and the minds

5824
03:18:03,120 --> 03:18:07,439
of people of the change in our tooling

5825
03:18:05,760 --> 03:18:08,960
marvin harris's work called cultural

5826
03:18:07,439 --> 03:18:09,520
materialism looked at this deeply

5827
03:18:08,959 --> 03:18:11,119
obviously

5828
03:18:09,520 --> 03:18:12,640
marshall mcluhan looked specifically at

5829
03:18:11,120 --> 03:18:14,800
the way that information technologies

5830
03:18:12,639 --> 03:18:15,840
changed the nature of our beliefs minds

5831
03:18:14,799 --> 03:18:18,719
values

5832
03:18:15,840 --> 03:18:18,719
social systems

5833
03:18:19,200 --> 03:18:22,800
i will not try to do this rigorously

5834
03:18:20,959 --> 03:18:24,318
because there are academics we'll

5835
03:18:22,799 --> 03:18:25,358
disagree on the subtle details but i'll

5836
03:18:24,318 --> 03:18:28,238
do it kind of like

5837
03:18:25,359 --> 03:18:30,399
illustratively you think about the

5838
03:18:28,238 --> 03:18:31,840
emergence of the plow the oxtron plow in

5839
03:18:30,398 --> 03:18:33,439
the beginning of agriculture that came

5840
03:18:31,840 --> 03:18:34,478
with it where before that you had hunter

5841
03:18:33,439 --> 03:18:36,398
gather

5842
03:18:34,478 --> 03:18:38,639
and then you had horticulture kind of a

5843
03:18:36,398 --> 03:18:41,760
digging stick but not

5844
03:18:38,639 --> 03:18:43,119
the plow well that the world changed a

5845
03:18:41,760 --> 03:18:45,279
lot with that right

5846
03:18:43,120 --> 03:18:45,279
and

5847
03:18:46,639 --> 03:18:51,439
a few of the changes that um at least

5848
03:18:49,600 --> 03:18:54,880
some theorists believe in

5849
03:18:51,439 --> 03:18:56,639
is when the oxtron plow started to

5850
03:18:54,879 --> 03:18:58,159
proliferate any culture that utilized it

5851
03:18:56,639 --> 03:18:59,920
was able to start to actually cultivate

5852
03:18:58,159 --> 03:19:01,119
grain because just with a digging stick

5853
03:18:59,920 --> 03:19:02,719
you couldn't get enough grain for it to

5854
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:03,920
matter grain was a storable caloric

5855
03:19:02,719 --> 03:19:05,438
surplus they could make it through the

5856
03:19:03,920 --> 03:19:07,040
famines they could grow their population

5857
03:19:05,439 --> 03:19:08,398
so the ones that used it got so much

5858
03:19:07,040 --> 03:19:09,040
ahead that it became obligate and

5859
03:19:08,398 --> 03:19:12,879
everybody

5860
03:19:09,040 --> 03:19:13,520
used it that corresponding with the use

5861
03:19:12,879 --> 03:19:15,519
of a plow

5862
03:19:13,520 --> 03:19:17,439
animism went away everywhere that it

5863
03:19:15,520 --> 03:19:19,120
existed because you can't talk about the

5864
03:19:17,439 --> 03:19:20,318
spirit of the buffalo while beating the

5865
03:19:19,120 --> 03:19:22,960
cow all day long to

5866
03:19:20,318 --> 03:19:24,719
pull a plow so the moment that we do

5867
03:19:22,959 --> 03:19:26,318
animal husbandry of that kind we have to

5868
03:19:24,719 --> 03:19:28,238
beat the cow all day you have to say

5869
03:19:26,318 --> 03:19:29,600
it's just a dumb animal man has dominion

5870
03:19:28,238 --> 03:19:31,600
over earth and the nature of even our

5871
03:19:29,600 --> 03:19:34,318
religious and spiritual ideas change

5872
03:19:31,600 --> 03:19:36,399
you went from women primarily using the

5873
03:19:34,318 --> 03:19:38,079
digging stick to do the horticulture

5874
03:19:36,398 --> 03:19:39,760
or gathering before that men doing the

5875
03:19:38,079 --> 03:19:41,439
hunting stuff to now men had to use the

5876
03:19:39,760 --> 03:19:42,639
plow because the upper body strength

5877
03:19:41,439 --> 03:19:44,000
actually really mattered women would

5878
03:19:42,639 --> 03:19:45,039
have miscarriages when they would do it

5879
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:47,200
when they were pregnant

5880
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:48,399
so all the caloric supply started to

5881
03:19:47,200 --> 03:19:49,200
come from men where it had been from

5882
03:19:48,398 --> 03:19:51,278
both before

5883
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:52,800
and the ratio of male female gods

5884
03:19:51,279 --> 03:19:54,000
changed to being mostly male gods

5885
03:19:52,799 --> 03:19:58,639
following that

5886
03:19:54,000 --> 03:20:00,238
um obviously we went from very s

5887
03:19:58,639 --> 03:20:02,559
that particular line of thought then

5888
03:20:00,238 --> 03:20:04,079
also says that feminism followed the

5889
03:20:02,559 --> 03:20:07,439
tractor

5890
03:20:04,079 --> 03:20:09,840
and that the rise of feminism um

5891
03:20:07,439 --> 03:20:11,520
in the west has started to follow women

5892
03:20:09,840 --> 03:20:14,478
being able to say we can do what men

5893
03:20:11,520 --> 03:20:16,079
can because the male upper body strength

5894
03:20:14,478 --> 03:20:18,719
wasn't differential once the internal

5895
03:20:16,079 --> 03:20:21,920
combustion engine was much stronger

5896
03:20:18,719 --> 03:20:22,318
and we can drive a tractor so i don't

5897
03:20:21,920 --> 03:20:24,478
think

5898
03:20:22,318 --> 03:20:26,238
to try to trace complex things to one

5899
03:20:24,478 --> 03:20:28,079
cause is a good idea so i think this is

5900
03:20:26,238 --> 03:20:29,119
a reductionist view but it has truth in

5901
03:20:28,079 --> 03:20:32,639
it

5902
03:20:29,120 --> 03:20:34,319
and so the idea that technology is

5903
03:20:32,639 --> 03:20:36,478
values agnostic is silly

5904
03:20:34,318 --> 03:20:38,559
technology codes patterns of behavior

5905
03:20:36,478 --> 03:20:40,318
that code rationalizing those patterns

5906
03:20:38,559 --> 03:20:42,079
of behavior and believing in them

5907
03:20:40,318 --> 03:20:43,760
the plow also is the beginning of the

5908
03:20:42,079 --> 03:20:45,840
anthropocene right it was the beginning

5909
03:20:43,760 --> 03:20:46,159
of us changing the environment radically

5910
03:20:45,840 --> 03:20:48,238
to

5911
03:20:46,159 --> 03:20:49,840
to clear-cut areas to just make them

5912
03:20:48,238 --> 03:20:51,680
useful for people which also meant the

5913
03:20:49,840 --> 03:20:53,520
change of the view of where the

5914
03:20:51,680 --> 03:20:56,238
the web of life were just a part of it

5915
03:20:53,520 --> 03:20:59,200
etc so all those types of things

5916
03:20:56,238 --> 03:21:00,000
um so that's brilliantly put but by the

5917
03:20:59,200 --> 03:21:03,120
way

5918
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:03,520
that was just brilliant but the question

5919
03:21:03,120 --> 03:21:06,479
is

5920
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:08,560
so it's not agnostic but so we have to

5921
03:21:06,478 --> 03:21:10,559
look at what the psychological effects

5922
03:21:08,559 --> 03:21:11,439
of specific tech applied certain ways

5923
03:21:10,559 --> 03:21:14,559
are

5924
03:21:11,439 --> 03:21:16,238
and be able to say it's not just doing

5925
03:21:14,559 --> 03:21:19,519
the first order thing you intended

5926
03:21:16,238 --> 03:21:20,398
it's doing like the effect on patriarchy

5927
03:21:19,520 --> 03:21:22,800
and animism

5928
03:21:20,398 --> 03:21:24,238
and the end of tribal culture in the

5929
03:21:22,799 --> 03:21:25,759
beginning of empire and the class

5930
03:21:24,238 --> 03:21:27,359
systems that came with that and

5931
03:21:25,760 --> 03:21:29,920
we can go on and on about what the plow

5932
03:21:27,359 --> 03:21:31,279
did um the beginning of surplus was

5933
03:21:29,920 --> 03:21:34,398
inheritance which then became the

5934
03:21:31,279 --> 03:21:36,000
capital model and like lots of things

5935
03:21:34,398 --> 03:21:38,879
so we have to say when we're looking at

5936
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:40,639
the tech how is what are the values

5937
03:21:38,879 --> 03:21:42,559
built into the way the tech is being

5938
03:21:40,639 --> 03:21:43,920
built that are not obvious

5939
03:21:42,559 --> 03:21:46,238
right so you always have to consider

5940
03:21:43,920 --> 03:21:47,680
externalities yes and the externalities

5941
03:21:46,238 --> 03:21:49,119
are not just physical to the environment

5942
03:21:47,680 --> 03:21:50,800
they're also to how the people are being

5943
03:21:49,120 --> 03:21:51,760
conditioned and how the relationality

5944
03:21:50,799 --> 03:21:53,920
between them as being conditioned

5945
03:21:51,760 --> 03:21:54,238
question i'm asking you so i personally

5946
03:21:53,920 --> 03:21:56,719
would

5947
03:21:54,238 --> 03:21:57,760
rather be led by a plow and a tractor

5948
03:21:56,719 --> 03:22:00,159
than stalin

5949
03:21:57,760 --> 03:22:02,398
okay that's the question i'm asking you

5950
03:22:00,159 --> 03:22:05,680
is uh

5951
03:22:02,398 --> 03:22:08,079
in creating an emergent government

5952
03:22:05,680 --> 03:22:09,760
or people where there's a democracy

5953
03:22:08,079 --> 03:22:13,279
that's dynamic that makes

5954
03:22:09,760 --> 03:22:17,359
choices that does governance at

5955
03:22:13,279 --> 03:22:20,238
at like a very kind of liquid

5956
03:22:17,359 --> 03:22:22,800
like uh there's a bunch of fine

5957
03:22:20,238 --> 03:22:26,000
resolution layers of abstraction

5958
03:22:22,799 --> 03:22:28,639
of governance happening at all scales

5959
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:30,559
right and doing so dynamically where no

5960
03:22:28,639 --> 03:22:32,000
one person has power at any one time

5961
03:22:30,559 --> 03:22:34,879
that can dominate

5962
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:35,520
and impose rule okay that's the stalin

5963
03:22:34,879 --> 03:22:38,639
version

5964
03:22:35,520 --> 03:22:41,279
i'm saying isn't there the

5965
03:22:38,639 --> 03:22:43,039
uh alter the isn't the alternative

5966
03:22:41,279 --> 03:22:46,399
that's emergent

5967
03:22:43,040 --> 03:22:49,680
empowered or made possible by

5968
03:22:46,398 --> 03:22:50,799
the plow and the tractor which is the

5969
03:22:49,680 --> 03:22:53,680
modern version of that

5970
03:22:50,799 --> 03:22:55,199
is like the internet the the digital

5971
03:22:53,680 --> 03:22:57,120
space where we can

5972
03:22:55,200 --> 03:22:58,560
the monetary system where you have the

5973
03:22:57,120 --> 03:23:01,359
cryptocurrency and so on

5974
03:22:58,559 --> 03:23:02,799
but you have much more importantly to me

5975
03:23:01,359 --> 03:23:04,720
at least is just basic social

5976
03:23:02,799 --> 03:23:06,238
interaction the mechanisms of human

5977
03:23:04,719 --> 03:23:08,000
transacting with each other in the space

5978
03:23:06,238 --> 03:23:10,879
of ideas isn't

5979
03:23:08,000 --> 03:23:12,000
so yes it's not agnostic definitely not

5980
03:23:10,879 --> 03:23:14,238
agnostic

5981
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:16,000
you've had a brilliant rant there the

5982
03:23:14,238 --> 03:23:17,600
tractor has effects

5983
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:19,279
but isn't that the way we achieve an

5984
03:23:17,600 --> 03:23:21,920
emergent system

5985
03:23:19,279 --> 03:23:24,479
of uh governance yes but i wouldn't say

5986
03:23:21,920 --> 03:23:24,478
we're on track

5987
03:23:26,478 --> 03:23:30,478
you haven't seen anything promising yeah

5988
03:23:29,279 --> 03:23:32,079
i haven't seen anything promising is

5989
03:23:30,478 --> 03:23:33,438
that to be on track requires

5990
03:23:32,079 --> 03:23:34,719
understanding and guiding some of the

5991
03:23:33,439 --> 03:23:36,318
things differently than is currently

5992
03:23:34,719 --> 03:23:38,639
happening and it's possible

5993
03:23:36,318 --> 03:23:40,799
that's actually what i really care about

5994
03:23:38,639 --> 03:23:40,799
so

5995
03:23:41,920 --> 03:23:45,120
you couldn't have had a stalin without

5996
03:23:44,159 --> 03:23:46,799
having certain

5997
03:23:45,120 --> 03:23:48,000
technologies emerge he couldn't have

5998
03:23:46,799 --> 03:23:50,398
ruled such a big area without

5999
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:53,680
transportation technologies without the

6000
03:23:50,398 --> 03:23:55,039
train without the uh communication tech

6001
03:23:53,680 --> 03:23:57,680
that made it possible

6002
03:23:55,040 --> 03:23:59,279
so when you say you'd rather have a

6003
03:23:57,680 --> 03:24:00,880
tractor or a plow than a stall and

6004
03:23:59,279 --> 03:24:02,560
there's a relationship between them that

6005
03:24:00,879 --> 03:24:06,959
is more recursive

6006
03:24:02,559 --> 03:24:09,920
which is new physical technologies

6007
03:24:06,959 --> 03:24:11,278
allow rulers to rule with more power

6008
03:24:09,920 --> 03:24:15,120
over larger distances

6009
03:24:11,279 --> 03:24:17,840
historically and

6010
03:24:15,120 --> 03:24:19,279
um but some things are more responsible

6011
03:24:17,840 --> 03:24:22,000
for that than others

6012
03:24:19,279 --> 03:24:23,600
like stalin also ate stuff for breakfast

6013
03:24:22,000 --> 03:24:25,840
but the thing he ate for breakfast is

6014
03:24:23,600 --> 03:24:26,559
less responsible for the starvation of

6015
03:24:25,840 --> 03:24:28,719
millions

6016
03:24:26,559 --> 03:24:30,000
than than the train the train is more

6017
03:24:28,719 --> 03:24:31,679
responsible for that

6018
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:33,840
and then the weapons of war are more

6019
03:24:31,680 --> 03:24:36,159
responsible so some technology

6020
03:24:33,840 --> 03:24:37,040
like let's not throw it all in the

6021
03:24:36,159 --> 03:24:39,680
you're saying like

6022
03:24:37,040 --> 03:24:40,080
technology has a responsibility here but

6023
03:24:39,680 --> 03:24:42,720
some

6024
03:24:40,079 --> 03:24:43,279
is better than others i'm saying that

6025
03:24:42,719 --> 03:24:45,358
farm

6026
03:24:43,279 --> 03:24:47,200
people's use of technology will change

6027
03:24:45,359 --> 03:24:48,720
their behavior so it has behavioral

6028
03:24:47,200 --> 03:24:50,319
dispositions built in

6029
03:24:48,719 --> 03:24:52,318
the change of the behavior will also

6030
03:24:50,318 --> 03:24:54,238
change the values in the society

6031
03:24:52,318 --> 03:24:55,439
it's very complicated right it will also

6032
03:24:54,238 --> 03:24:57,199
as a result

6033
03:24:55,439 --> 03:24:59,200
both make people who have different

6034
03:24:57,200 --> 03:25:00,159
kinds of predispositions with regard to

6035
03:24:59,200 --> 03:25:03,120
rulership

6036
03:25:00,159 --> 03:25:03,920
and different kinds of new capacities

6037
03:25:03,120 --> 03:25:06,560
and so

6038
03:25:03,920 --> 03:25:07,520
we have to think about these things it's

6039
03:25:06,559 --> 03:25:09,278
kind of well

6040
03:25:07,520 --> 03:25:10,560
understood that the printing press and

6041
03:25:09,279 --> 03:25:13,120
then in

6042
03:25:10,559 --> 03:25:13,760
early industrialism ended feudalism and

6043
03:25:13,120 --> 03:25:16,560
created

6044
03:25:13,760 --> 03:25:17,200
kind of nation states so one thing i

6045
03:25:16,559 --> 03:25:20,159
would say

6046
03:25:17,200 --> 03:25:22,720
as a long trend that we can look at is

6047
03:25:20,159 --> 03:25:23,920
that whenever there is a a step function

6048
03:25:22,719 --> 03:25:26,559
a major leap

6049
03:25:23,920 --> 03:25:28,159
in technology physical technology the

6050
03:25:26,559 --> 03:25:30,079
the underlying techno-industrial base

6051
03:25:28,159 --> 03:25:32,318
with which we do stuff

6052
03:25:30,079 --> 03:25:34,318
it ends up coding for it ends up

6053
03:25:32,318 --> 03:25:36,639
predisposing a whole bunch of human

6054
03:25:34,318 --> 03:25:38,639
behavioral patterns that the previous

6055
03:25:36,639 --> 03:25:40,238
social system what had not emerged to

6056
03:25:38,639 --> 03:25:42,000
try to solve

6057
03:25:40,238 --> 03:25:43,359
and so it usually ends up breaking the

6058
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:45,120
previous social systems

6059
03:25:43,359 --> 03:25:46,399
the way the plow broke the tribal system

6060
03:25:45,120 --> 03:25:47,920
the way that the industrial revolution

6061
03:25:46,398 --> 03:25:49,599
broke the feudal system

6062
03:25:47,920 --> 03:25:51,279
and then new social systems have to

6063
03:25:49,600 --> 03:25:53,840
emerge they can deal with that

6064
03:25:51,279 --> 03:25:55,200
the new powers the new dispositions

6065
03:25:53,840 --> 03:25:57,520
whatever with that tech

6066
03:25:55,200 --> 03:25:59,200
obviously the nuke broke nation-state

6067
03:25:57,520 --> 03:26:00,640
governance being adequate

6068
03:25:59,200 --> 03:26:03,279
and said we can't ever have that again

6069
03:26:00,639 --> 03:26:06,559
so then it created this in international

6070
03:26:03,279 --> 03:26:09,920
governance apparatus world

6071
03:26:06,559 --> 03:26:13,199
so i guess

6072
03:26:09,920 --> 03:26:17,279
what i'm saying is

6073
03:26:13,200 --> 03:26:20,399
that the solution

6074
03:26:17,279 --> 03:26:22,319
is not exponential tech

6075
03:26:20,398 --> 03:26:24,478
following the current path of what the

6076
03:26:22,318 --> 03:26:28,000
market incentivizes exponential tech to

6077
03:26:24,478 --> 03:26:32,318
do market being a previous social tech

6078
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:35,439
i would say that

6079
03:26:32,318 --> 03:26:35,439
exponential tech

6080
03:26:35,920 --> 03:26:41,200
if we look at different types of social

6081
03:26:37,840 --> 03:26:43,680
tech so let's just briefly look at

6082
03:26:41,200 --> 03:26:46,159
that democracy tried to do the emergent

6083
03:26:43,680 --> 03:26:49,600
order thing

6084
03:26:46,159 --> 03:26:54,159
right at least that's the story and

6085
03:26:49,600 --> 03:26:57,120
which is and this is why if you look

6086
03:26:54,159 --> 03:26:59,119
this important um part to build first

6087
03:26:57,120 --> 03:27:01,600
it's kind of doing it it's just doing it

6088
03:26:59,120 --> 03:27:03,359
poorly you're saying i mean that's it is

6089
03:27:01,600 --> 03:27:04,800
emergent order in some sense i mean

6090
03:27:03,359 --> 03:27:05,279
that's the hope of democracy versus

6091
03:27:04,799 --> 03:27:07,519
other

6092
03:27:05,279 --> 03:27:09,279
forms of government correct i mean i i

6093
03:27:07,520 --> 03:27:10,800
said at least the story because

6094
03:27:09,279 --> 03:27:12,560
obviously it didn't do it for women and

6095
03:27:10,799 --> 03:27:14,318
slaves early on it doesn't die for all

6096
03:27:12,559 --> 03:27:18,238
classes equally et cetera

6097
03:27:14,318 --> 03:27:20,879
but the the idea of democracy is that

6098
03:27:18,238 --> 03:27:22,559
is participatory governance and so you

6099
03:27:20,879 --> 03:27:23,278
notice that the modern democracies

6100
03:27:22,559 --> 03:27:26,238
emerged

6101
03:27:23,279 --> 03:27:27,600
out of the european enlightenment and

6102
03:27:26,238 --> 03:27:29,680
specifically

6103
03:27:27,600 --> 03:27:31,200
because the idea that a lot of people

6104
03:27:29,680 --> 03:27:32,639
some huge number not a tribal number

6105
03:27:31,200 --> 03:27:34,079
huge number of anonymous people who

6106
03:27:32,639 --> 03:27:36,159
don't know each other are not

6107
03:27:34,079 --> 03:27:37,200
bonded to each other who believe

6108
03:27:36,159 --> 03:27:38,159
different things who grew up in

6109
03:27:37,200 --> 03:27:39,600
different ways can

6110
03:27:38,159 --> 03:27:41,760
all work together to make collective

6111
03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:42,800
decisions well that affect everybody

6112
03:27:41,760 --> 03:27:44,159
and where some of them will make

6113
03:27:42,799 --> 03:27:45,358
compromises and the thing that matters

6114
03:27:44,159 --> 03:27:46,238
to them for what matters to other

6115
03:27:45,359 --> 03:27:48,479
strangers

6116
03:27:46,238 --> 03:27:50,559
that's actually wild like it's a wild

6117
03:27:48,478 --> 03:27:52,398
idea that that would even be possible

6118
03:27:50,559 --> 03:27:54,398
and it was kind of the result of this

6119
03:27:52,398 --> 03:27:58,079
high enlightenment idea

6120
03:27:54,398 --> 03:28:00,000
that we could all do the philosophy of

6121
03:27:58,079 --> 03:28:01,279
science

6122
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:04,159
and we could all do the hegelian

6123
03:28:01,279 --> 03:28:05,040
dialectic those ideas had emerged right

6124
03:28:04,159 --> 03:28:08,799
and it was

6125
03:28:05,040 --> 03:28:10,560
that we we could all

6126
03:28:08,799 --> 03:28:12,079
so our choice making because we said a

6127
03:28:10,559 --> 03:28:13,760
society is trying to coordinate choice

6128
03:28:12,079 --> 03:28:15,600
making the emergent order is the order

6129
03:28:13,760 --> 03:28:16,880
of our of the choices that we're making

6130
03:28:15,600 --> 03:28:18,159
not just the level of the individuals

6131
03:28:16,879 --> 03:28:21,358
but what groups of individuals

6132
03:28:18,159 --> 03:28:23,439
corporations nations states whatever do

6133
03:28:21,359 --> 03:28:25,040
our choices are based on our choice

6134
03:28:23,439 --> 03:28:26,238
making is based on our sense making and

6135
03:28:25,040 --> 03:28:27,600
our meaning making

6136
03:28:26,238 --> 03:28:29,279
our sense making is what do we believe

6137
03:28:27,600 --> 03:28:30,640
is happening in the world

6138
03:28:29,279 --> 03:28:31,760
and what do we believe the effects of a

6139
03:28:30,639 --> 03:28:33,119
particular thing would be our meaning

6140
03:28:31,760 --> 03:28:34,318
making us what do we care about

6141
03:28:33,120 --> 03:28:35,680
right our values generation what do we

6142
03:28:34,318 --> 03:28:37,039
care about that we're trying to move the

6143
03:28:35,680 --> 03:28:38,720
world in the direction of

6144
03:28:37,040 --> 03:28:40,880
if you ultimately are trying to move the

6145
03:28:38,719 --> 03:28:42,159
world in a direction that is really

6146
03:28:40,879 --> 03:28:44,398
really different than the direction i'm

6147
03:28:42,159 --> 03:28:46,398
trying to we have very different values

6148
03:28:44,398 --> 03:28:47,760
we're gonna have a hard time and if you

6149
03:28:46,398 --> 03:28:49,439
think the world is a very different

6150
03:28:47,760 --> 03:28:52,719
world right if you

6151
03:28:49,439 --> 03:28:54,159
think that systemic racism is rampant

6152
03:28:52,719 --> 03:28:55,760
everywhere one of the worst problems and

6153
03:28:54,159 --> 03:28:58,000
i think it's not even a thing

6154
03:28:55,760 --> 03:28:59,600
if you think climate change is almost

6155
03:28:58,000 --> 03:29:00,000
existential and i think it's not even a

6156
03:28:59,600 --> 03:29:01,040
thing

6157
03:29:00,000 --> 03:29:03,840
we're gonna have a really hard time

6158
03:29:01,040 --> 03:29:05,520
coordinating and so we have to be able

6159
03:29:03,840 --> 03:29:07,600
to have shared sense-making

6160
03:29:05,520 --> 03:29:09,200
of can we come to understand just what

6161
03:29:07,600 --> 03:29:11,520
is happening

6162
03:29:09,200 --> 03:29:13,040
together and then can we do shared

6163
03:29:11,520 --> 03:29:14,800
values generation okay maybe i'm

6164
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:16,160
emphasizing a particular value more than

6165
03:29:14,799 --> 03:29:17,519
you but i can see how

6166
03:29:16,159 --> 03:29:18,879
i can take your perspective and i can

6167
03:29:17,520 --> 03:29:20,079
see how the thing that you value is

6168
03:29:18,879 --> 03:29:21,839
worth valuing

6169
03:29:20,079 --> 03:29:23,840
and i can see how it's affected by this

6170
03:29:21,840 --> 03:29:25,279
thing so can we take all the values and

6171
03:29:23,840 --> 03:29:27,040
try to come up with a proposition that

6172
03:29:25,279 --> 03:29:28,560
benefits all of them better

6173
03:29:27,040 --> 03:29:30,319
than the proposition i created just to

6174
03:29:28,559 --> 03:29:31,199
benefit these ones it harms the ones

6175
03:29:30,318 --> 03:29:32,559
that you

6176
03:29:31,200 --> 03:29:35,359
care about which is why you're opposing

6177
03:29:32,559 --> 03:29:36,959
my proposition we don't even try in the

6178
03:29:35,359 --> 03:29:38,000
process of crafting a proposition

6179
03:29:36,959 --> 03:29:40,318
currently

6180
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:41,920
to see and this is a reason that the

6181
03:29:40,318 --> 03:29:43,278
proposition when we vote on it gets half

6182
03:29:41,920 --> 03:29:45,920
the votes almost all the time

6183
03:29:43,279 --> 03:29:47,200
it almost never gets 90 of the votes is

6184
03:29:45,920 --> 03:29:48,000
because it benefits some things and

6185
03:29:47,200 --> 03:29:49,680
harms other things

6186
03:29:48,000 --> 03:29:52,159
we can say all theory of trade-offs but

6187
03:29:49,680 --> 03:29:54,000
we didn't even try to say could we

6188
03:29:52,159 --> 03:29:55,680
see what everybody cares about and see

6189
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:58,639
if there is a better solution

6190
03:29:55,680 --> 03:29:59,040
so how do we fix that try i i wonder is

6191
03:29:58,639 --> 03:30:00,719
it

6192
03:29:59,040 --> 03:30:02,640
is it as simple as the social technology

6193
03:30:00,719 --> 03:30:05,840
of education well no

6194
03:30:02,639 --> 03:30:07,920
it's that the proposition crafting and

6195
03:30:05,840 --> 03:30:10,238
refinement process has to be

6196
03:30:07,920 --> 03:30:11,680
key to a democracy or participatory

6197
03:30:10,238 --> 03:30:14,238
governance and it's not currently

6198
03:30:11,680 --> 03:30:15,680
but it's this isn't that the humans

6199
03:30:14,238 --> 03:30:18,879
creating that situation

6200
03:30:15,680 --> 03:30:19,840
so so one way there's two ways to fix

6201
03:30:18,879 --> 03:30:21,519
this

6202
03:30:19,840 --> 03:30:23,520
one is to fix the individual humans

6203
03:30:21,520 --> 03:30:25,200
which is the education early in life

6204
03:30:23,520 --> 03:30:26,560
and the second is to create somehow

6205
03:30:25,200 --> 03:30:30,239
systems that yeah

6206
03:30:26,559 --> 03:30:32,318
both so i understand the education part

6207
03:30:30,238 --> 03:30:34,079
but creating systems that's why that's

6208
03:30:32,318 --> 03:30:34,959
why i mentioned the technologies is

6209
03:30:34,079 --> 03:30:36,559
creating

6210
03:30:34,959 --> 03:30:38,318
social networks essentially yes that's

6211
03:30:36,559 --> 03:30:39,439
actually necessary yeah okay so let's go

6212
03:30:38,318 --> 03:30:41,760
to the first part and then we'll come to

6213
03:30:39,439 --> 03:30:44,318
the second part

6214
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:45,279
so democracy emerged as an enlightenment

6215
03:30:44,318 --> 03:30:48,879
era idea

6216
03:30:45,279 --> 03:30:50,399
that we could all do a dialectic

6217
03:30:48,879 --> 03:30:52,398
and come to understand what other people

6218
03:30:50,398 --> 03:30:55,760
valued and so that we could

6219
03:30:52,398 --> 03:30:57,519
actually come up with a cooperative

6220
03:30:55,760 --> 03:30:59,040
solution rather than just

6221
03:30:57,520 --> 03:31:01,200
[ __ ] you we're gonna get our thing in

6222
03:30:59,040 --> 03:31:02,080
war right and that we could sense make

6223
03:31:01,200 --> 03:31:03,200
together we could all apply the

6224
03:31:02,079 --> 03:31:04,959
philosophy of science

6225
03:31:03,200 --> 03:31:06,239
and you weren't gonna stick to your guns

6226
03:31:04,959 --> 03:31:07,599
on what the speed of sound is if we

6227
03:31:06,238 --> 03:31:08,079
measured it and we found out what it was

6228
03:31:07,600 --> 03:31:09,680
and

6229
03:31:08,079 --> 03:31:11,680
there's a unifying element to the

6230
03:31:09,680 --> 03:31:14,559
objectivity in that way

6231
03:31:11,680 --> 03:31:16,159
and so this is why um i believe

6232
03:31:14,559 --> 03:31:17,519
jefferson said if you could give me a

6233
03:31:16,159 --> 03:31:18,398
perfect newspaper and a broken

6234
03:31:17,520 --> 03:31:20,000
government or

6235
03:31:18,398 --> 03:31:21,358
i'm paraphrasing or a broken government

6236
03:31:20,000 --> 03:31:22,639
perfect newspaper i wouldn't hesitate to

6237
03:31:21,359 --> 03:31:24,159
take the perfect newspaper because if

6238
03:31:22,639 --> 03:31:25,760
the people understand what's going on

6239
03:31:24,159 --> 03:31:27,200
they can make build a new government

6240
03:31:25,760 --> 03:31:29,520
if they don't understand what's going on

6241
03:31:27,200 --> 03:31:33,600
they can't possibly make good choices

6242
03:31:29,520 --> 03:31:35,680
and washington i'm paraphrasing again

6243
03:31:33,600 --> 03:31:36,640
first president said the number one aim

6244
03:31:35,680 --> 03:31:38,800
of the federal government

6245
03:31:36,639 --> 03:31:40,159
should be the comprehensive education of

6246
03:31:38,799 --> 03:31:40,959
every citizen in the science of

6247
03:31:40,159 --> 03:31:42,318
government

6248
03:31:40,959 --> 03:31:43,599
science of government was the term of

6249
03:31:42,318 --> 03:31:46,639
art think about what that means right

6250
03:31:43,600 --> 03:31:46,640
science of government would be

6251
03:31:46,959 --> 03:31:51,119
game theory coordination theory history

6252
03:31:49,120 --> 03:31:53,600
wouldn't call game theory yet

6253
03:31:51,120 --> 03:31:55,120
history sociology economics right all

6254
03:31:53,600 --> 03:31:57,120
the things that lead to how we

6255
03:31:55,120 --> 03:31:59,760
understand human coordination

6256
03:31:57,120 --> 03:32:00,239
i think it's so profound that he didn't

6257
03:31:59,760 --> 03:32:01,600
say

6258
03:32:00,238 --> 03:32:04,079
the number one aim of the federal

6259
03:32:01,600 --> 03:32:05,520
government is rule of law

6260
03:32:04,079 --> 03:32:07,920
and he didn't say it's protecting the

6261
03:32:05,520 --> 03:32:09,600
border from enemies because if the

6262
03:32:07,920 --> 03:32:10,799
number one aim was to protect the border

6263
03:32:09,600 --> 03:32:12,000
from enemies

6264
03:32:10,799 --> 03:32:14,238
it could do that as military

6265
03:32:12,000 --> 03:32:16,478
dictatorship quite effectively

6266
03:32:14,238 --> 03:32:18,079
and if the goal was rule of law it could

6267
03:32:16,478 --> 03:32:21,760
do it as a dictatorship

6268
03:32:18,079 --> 03:32:22,000
as a police state and so if the number

6269
03:32:21,760 --> 03:32:23,520
one

6270
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:25,040
goal is anything other than the

6271
03:32:23,520 --> 03:32:26,319
comprehensive education of all the

6272
03:32:25,040 --> 03:32:28,080
citizens and the science of government

6273
03:32:26,318 --> 03:32:30,478
it won't stay a democracy long

6274
03:32:28,079 --> 03:32:31,680
you can see so both education and the

6275
03:32:30,478 --> 03:32:33,599
fourth estate

6276
03:32:31,680 --> 03:32:34,880
the fourth estate being the so education

6277
03:32:33,600 --> 03:32:36,000
can i make sense of the world am i

6278
03:32:34,879 --> 03:32:37,438
trained to make sense of the world the

6279
03:32:36,000 --> 03:32:39,040
fourth estate is what's actually going

6280
03:32:37,439 --> 03:32:41,359
on currently the news do i have

6281
03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:43,120
good unbiased information about it those

6282
03:32:41,359 --> 03:32:44,800
are both considered prerequisite

6283
03:32:43,120 --> 03:32:46,399
institutions for democracy to even be a

6284
03:32:44,799 --> 03:32:48,079
possibility

6285
03:32:46,398 --> 03:32:50,478
and then at the scale it was initially

6286
03:32:48,079 --> 03:32:51,840
suggested here the town hall was the key

6287
03:32:50,478 --> 03:32:54,079
phenomena

6288
03:32:51,840 --> 03:32:55,439
where there wasn't a special interest

6289
03:32:54,079 --> 03:32:56,799
group crafted a proposition and the

6290
03:32:55,439 --> 03:32:58,398
first thing i ever

6291
03:32:56,799 --> 03:33:00,079
saw was the proposition to know anything

6292
03:32:58,398 --> 03:33:01,519
about and i got to vote yes or no

6293
03:33:00,079 --> 03:33:02,879
it was in the town hall we all got to

6294
03:33:01,520 --> 03:33:04,079
talk about it and the proposition could

6295
03:33:02,879 --> 03:33:06,079
get crafted in real

6296
03:33:04,079 --> 03:33:07,279
time through the conversation which is

6297
03:33:06,079 --> 03:33:08,799
why there is that

6298
03:33:07,279 --> 03:33:10,720
founding father statement that that

6299
03:33:08,799 --> 03:33:12,559
voting is the death of democracy

6300
03:33:10,719 --> 03:33:14,559
voting fundamentally is polarizing the

6301
03:33:12,559 --> 03:33:15,278
population in some kind of sublimated

6302
03:33:14,559 --> 03:33:17,278
war

6303
03:33:15,279 --> 03:33:18,880
but and we'll do that as the last step

6304
03:33:17,279 --> 03:33:20,640
but what we want to do first is to say

6305
03:33:18,879 --> 03:33:22,559
how does the thing that you care about

6306
03:33:20,639 --> 03:33:24,559
that seems damaged by this proposition

6307
03:33:22,559 --> 03:33:26,238
how could that turn into a solution to

6308
03:33:24,559 --> 03:33:27,600
make this proposition better

6309
03:33:26,238 --> 03:33:28,559
where this proposition still tends to

6310
03:33:27,600 --> 03:33:30,079
the thing it's trying to tend to

6311
03:33:28,559 --> 03:33:30,879
antennas to that better can we work on

6312
03:33:30,079 --> 03:33:32,799
this together

6313
03:33:30,879 --> 03:33:34,478
in and in a town hall we could have that

6314
03:33:32,799 --> 03:33:35,759
as the scale increased we lost the

6315
03:33:34,478 --> 03:33:37,199
ability to do that

6316
03:33:35,760 --> 03:33:38,960
now as you mentioned the internet could

6317
03:33:37,200 --> 03:33:40,560
change that the fact that

6318
03:33:38,959 --> 03:33:42,000
we had representatives that had to ride

6319
03:33:40,559 --> 03:33:44,639
a horse from one town hall to the other

6320
03:33:42,000 --> 03:33:47,040
one to see what the colony would do

6321
03:33:44,639 --> 03:33:48,318
that we stopped having this kind of

6322
03:33:47,040 --> 03:33:50,960
developmental

6323
03:33:48,318 --> 03:33:52,238
um propositional development process

6324
03:33:50,959 --> 03:33:53,759
when the town hall ended the fact that

6325
03:33:52,238 --> 03:33:56,639
we have not used the internet to

6326
03:33:53,760 --> 03:33:56,639
recreate this is

6327
03:33:56,959 --> 03:34:00,799
somewhere between insane and

6328
03:34:02,079 --> 03:34:07,120
aligned with class interests i would

6329
03:34:05,200 --> 03:34:08,640
push back to say that the internet has

6330
03:34:07,120 --> 03:34:09,600
those things it just says a lot of other

6331
03:34:08,639 --> 03:34:11,519
things

6332
03:34:09,600 --> 03:34:12,880
i feel like the internet has places

6333
03:34:11,520 --> 03:34:16,000
where that encourage

6334
03:34:12,879 --> 03:34:18,478
synthesis of competing ideas

6335
03:34:16,000 --> 03:34:19,680
and sense making which is what we're

6336
03:34:18,478 --> 03:34:21,920
talking about

6337
03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:22,880
it's just that it's also flooded with a

6338
03:34:21,920 --> 03:34:24,799
bunch of other

6339
03:34:22,879 --> 03:34:26,318
systems that perhaps are out competing

6340
03:34:24,799 --> 03:34:28,079
it under current incentives

6341
03:34:26,318 --> 03:34:29,760
perhaps has to do with capitalism in the

6342
03:34:28,079 --> 03:34:33,200
market

6343
03:34:29,760 --> 03:34:34,559
linux is awesome right and wikipedia and

6344
03:34:33,200 --> 03:34:36,000
places where you have

6345
03:34:34,559 --> 03:34:37,840
and they have problems but places where

6346
03:34:36,000 --> 03:34:39,359
you have open source

6347
03:34:37,840 --> 03:34:41,520
sharing of information betting of

6348
03:34:39,359 --> 03:34:44,559
information towards collective building

6349
03:34:41,520 --> 03:34:46,000
is that building something like like

6350
03:34:44,559 --> 03:34:47,760
how much has that affected our court

6351
03:34:46,000 --> 03:34:49,840
systems or

6352
03:34:47,760 --> 03:34:51,600
our policing systems or our military

6353
03:34:49,840 --> 03:34:54,639
systems or first of all i think a lot

6354
03:34:51,600 --> 03:34:56,079
but not not enough i i i think that's

6355
03:34:54,639 --> 03:34:58,238
something i told you offline yesterday

6356
03:34:56,079 --> 03:34:59,840
is uh

6357
03:34:58,238 --> 03:35:01,359
perhaps that's a whole nother discussion

6358
03:34:59,840 --> 03:35:04,000
but i i don't think we're

6359
03:35:01,359 --> 03:35:04,559
quite quantifying the impact on the

6360
03:35:04,000 --> 03:35:07,760
world

6361
03:35:04,559 --> 03:35:10,398
of the positive impact of wikipedia

6362
03:35:07,760 --> 03:35:12,800
you said the policing the i mean i just

6363
03:35:10,398 --> 03:35:16,799
i just think the amount of um

6364
03:35:12,799 --> 03:35:21,358
empathy that could like knowledge

6365
03:35:16,799 --> 03:35:25,119
i think can't help but lead to

6366
03:35:21,359 --> 03:35:27,040
empathy just knowing okay

6367
03:35:25,120 --> 03:35:28,560
just knowing okay i'll i'll give you

6368
03:35:27,040 --> 03:35:30,319
some pieces of information

6369
03:35:28,559 --> 03:35:32,478
knowing how many people died in various

6370
03:35:30,318 --> 03:35:33,840
awards that already that delta

6371
03:35:32,478 --> 03:35:36,238
when you have millions of people have

6372
03:35:33,840 --> 03:35:38,559
that knowledge it's like it's a little

6373
03:35:36,238 --> 03:35:41,680
like slap in the face like oh

6374
03:35:38,559 --> 03:35:42,238
like my boyfriend or girlfriend breaking

6375
03:35:41,680 --> 03:35:44,720
up with me

6376
03:35:42,238 --> 03:35:46,398
is not such a big deal when millions of

6377
03:35:44,719 --> 03:35:48,238
people were tortured

6378
03:35:46,398 --> 03:35:49,599
you know like just a little bit and when

6379
03:35:48,238 --> 03:35:51,840
a lot of people know that because of

6380
03:35:49,600 --> 03:35:54,238
wikipedia

6381
03:35:51,840 --> 03:35:56,000
or the effect there's second order

6382
03:35:54,238 --> 03:35:57,600
effect of wikipedia which is

6383
03:35:56,000 --> 03:35:59,279
it's not that necessarily people read

6384
03:35:57,600 --> 03:36:02,318
wikipedia it's like

6385
03:35:59,279 --> 03:36:05,600
youtubers who don't really

6386
03:36:02,318 --> 03:36:07,519
know stuff that well will

6387
03:36:05,600 --> 03:36:09,520
thoroughly read a wikipedia article and

6388
03:36:07,520 --> 03:36:11,200
create a compelling video describing

6389
03:36:09,520 --> 03:36:13,040
that wikipedia article that then

6390
03:36:11,200 --> 03:36:14,239
millions of people watch and they

6391
03:36:13,040 --> 03:36:16,319
understand that

6392
03:36:14,238 --> 03:36:17,840
holy [ __ ] a lot of there was such first

6393
03:36:16,318 --> 03:36:19,439
of all there was such a thing as world

6394
03:36:17,840 --> 03:36:21,840
war ii in world war one

6395
03:36:19,439 --> 03:36:22,479
okay like they can at least like learn

6396
03:36:21,840 --> 03:36:24,559
about it

6397
03:36:22,478 --> 03:36:26,478
they can learn about this was like

6398
03:36:24,559 --> 03:36:27,439
recent they can learn about slavery they

6399
03:36:26,478 --> 03:36:30,079
can learn about

6400
03:36:27,439 --> 03:36:31,120
all kinds of injustices in the world and

6401
03:36:30,079 --> 03:36:34,559
that i think has

6402
03:36:31,120 --> 03:36:37,840
a lot of effects to our to the way

6403
03:36:34,559 --> 03:36:39,119
whether you're a police officer a a

6404
03:36:37,840 --> 03:36:42,318
lawyer a judge

6405
03:36:39,120 --> 03:36:46,239
in the jury or just a regular

6406
03:36:42,318 --> 03:36:49,199
civilian citizen the way you approach

6407
03:36:46,238 --> 03:36:50,000
the the uh every other communication you

6408
03:36:49,200 --> 03:36:51,920
engage in

6409
03:36:50,000 --> 03:36:53,760
even if the system of that communication

6410
03:36:51,920 --> 03:36:55,680
is very much flawed so i think there's a

6411
03:36:53,760 --> 03:36:57,279
huge positive effect on wikipedia

6412
03:36:55,680 --> 03:36:58,960
that's my case for wikipedia so you

6413
03:36:57,279 --> 03:37:01,520
should donate to wikipedia i

6414
03:36:58,959 --> 03:37:02,000
i'm a huge fan but there's very few

6415
03:37:01,520 --> 03:37:05,359
systems

6416
03:37:02,000 --> 03:37:08,478
like it which is sad to me so i think

6417
03:37:05,359 --> 03:37:11,840
it's it would be a useful exercise

6418
03:37:08,478 --> 03:37:15,358
for any uh listener of the show

6419
03:37:11,840 --> 03:37:16,000
to really try to run the dialectical

6420
03:37:15,359 --> 03:37:20,559
synthesis

6421
03:37:16,000 --> 03:37:23,680
process with regard to a topic like this

6422
03:37:20,559 --> 03:37:23,680
and take the

6423
03:37:24,719 --> 03:37:28,159
techno concern perspective with regard

6424
03:37:27,040 --> 03:37:30,399
to

6425
03:37:28,159 --> 03:37:31,520
information tech that folks like tristan

6426
03:37:30,398 --> 03:37:33,680
harris

6427
03:37:31,520 --> 03:37:35,200
take and say what are all of the things

6428
03:37:33,680 --> 03:37:37,520
that are getting worse

6429
03:37:35,200 --> 03:37:39,200
and what and are any of them following

6430
03:37:37,520 --> 03:37:42,238
an exponential curve and how much worse

6431
03:37:39,200 --> 03:37:42,239
how quickly could that be

6432
03:37:42,318 --> 03:37:46,719
and then and do that fully without

6433
03:37:45,040 --> 03:37:48,000
mitigating it

6434
03:37:46,719 --> 03:37:49,278
then take the techno-optimist

6435
03:37:48,000 --> 03:37:50,159
perspective and see what things are

6436
03:37:49,279 --> 03:37:53,279
getting better

6437
03:37:50,159 --> 03:37:54,719
in a way that kurzweil or diamandis or

6438
03:37:53,279 --> 03:37:57,359
someone might do

6439
03:37:54,719 --> 03:37:58,398
and try to take that perspective fully

6440
03:37:57,359 --> 03:37:59,200
and say are some of those things

6441
03:37:58,398 --> 03:38:00,639
exponential

6442
03:37:59,200 --> 03:38:02,960
what could that portend and then try to

6443
03:38:00,639 --> 03:38:06,000
hold all that at the same time

6444
03:38:02,959 --> 03:38:09,519
and i think there are

6445
03:38:06,000 --> 03:38:10,398
ways in which depending upon the metrics

6446
03:38:09,520 --> 03:38:12,640
we're looking at

6447
03:38:10,398 --> 03:38:14,559
things are getting worse on exponential

6448
03:38:12,639 --> 03:38:16,238
curves and better on exponential curves

6449
03:38:14,559 --> 03:38:17,478
for different metrics at the same time

6450
03:38:16,238 --> 03:38:18,879
which which i hold is the

6451
03:38:17,478 --> 03:38:21,278
destabilization

6452
03:38:18,879 --> 03:38:22,799
of previous system and either an

6453
03:38:21,279 --> 03:38:24,840
emergence to a better system or

6454
03:38:22,799 --> 03:38:26,799
collapse to a lower order are both

6455
03:38:24,840 --> 03:38:30,318
possible

6456
03:38:26,799 --> 03:38:31,920
and so i want my optimism not to be

6457
03:38:30,318 --> 03:38:33,760
about my assessment

6458
03:38:31,920 --> 03:38:35,199
i want my assessment to be just as

6459
03:38:33,760 --> 03:38:38,000
[ __ ] clear as it can be

6460
03:38:35,199 --> 03:38:39,279
i want my optimism to be what inspires

6461
03:38:38,000 --> 03:38:42,238
the solution

6462
03:38:39,279 --> 03:38:42,560
process on that clear assessment so i

6463
03:38:42,238 --> 03:38:44,559
never

6464
03:38:42,559 --> 03:38:46,159
i never want to apply optimism in the

6465
03:38:44,559 --> 03:38:48,639
sense making right i want to just

6466
03:38:46,159 --> 03:38:50,079
try to be clear if anything i want to

6467
03:38:48,639 --> 03:38:52,398
make sure that the

6468
03:38:50,079 --> 03:38:54,559
challenges are really well understood

6469
03:38:52,398 --> 03:38:56,238
but that's in service of an optimism

6470
03:38:54,559 --> 03:38:57,680
that

6471
03:38:56,238 --> 03:38:59,039
there are good potentials even if i

6472
03:38:57,680 --> 03:39:00,159
don't know what they are that are worth

6473
03:38:59,040 --> 03:39:02,800
seeking

6474
03:39:00,159 --> 03:39:04,159
right there's kind of a there is a some

6475
03:39:02,799 --> 03:39:05,599
sense of optimism that's required to

6476
03:39:04,159 --> 03:39:07,279
even try to innovate really hard

6477
03:39:05,600 --> 03:39:09,359
problems

6478
03:39:07,279 --> 03:39:11,040
but then i want to take my pessimism and

6479
03:39:09,359 --> 03:39:12,640
red team my own optimism

6480
03:39:11,040 --> 03:39:14,399
to see is that solution not going to

6481
03:39:12,639 --> 03:39:16,799
work does it have second order effects

6482
03:39:14,398 --> 03:39:17,840
and then knock it not get upset by that

6483
03:39:16,799 --> 03:39:19,438
because i

6484
03:39:17,840 --> 03:39:21,600
then come back to how to make it better

6485
03:39:19,439 --> 03:39:23,120
so just a relationship between optimism

6486
03:39:21,600 --> 03:39:23,600
and pessimism and the dialectic of how

6487
03:39:23,120 --> 03:39:26,960
they

6488
03:39:23,600 --> 03:39:29,279
how they can work so when i of course

6489
03:39:26,959 --> 03:39:30,959
we can say that wikipedia is a pretty

6490
03:39:29,279 --> 03:39:34,159
awesome example of

6491
03:39:30,959 --> 03:39:35,759
a thing we can look at the places where

6492
03:39:34,159 --> 03:39:38,559
it has limits or

6493
03:39:35,760 --> 03:39:38,559
has failed where

6494
03:39:38,799 --> 03:39:42,959
on a celebrity topic or corporate

6495
03:39:41,199 --> 03:39:43,840
interest topic you can pay wikipedia

6496
03:39:42,959 --> 03:39:45,919
editors to

6497
03:39:43,840 --> 03:39:47,680
edit more frequently and various things

6498
03:39:45,920 --> 03:39:48,960
like that but you can also see where

6499
03:39:47,680 --> 03:39:51,120
there's a lot of information

6500
03:39:48,959 --> 03:39:52,639
that was kind of decentrally created

6501
03:39:51,120 --> 03:39:54,079
that is good information that is more

6502
03:39:52,639 --> 03:39:55,599
easily accessible to people than

6503
03:39:54,079 --> 03:39:56,799
everybody buying their own encyclopedia

6504
03:39:55,600 --> 03:39:57,600
britannica or walking down to the

6505
03:39:56,799 --> 03:39:59,198
library

6506
03:39:57,600 --> 03:40:00,720
and they can be updated in real time

6507
03:39:59,199 --> 03:40:04,000
faster

6508
03:40:00,719 --> 03:40:06,398
and i think you're very right

6509
03:40:04,000 --> 03:40:08,000
that the business model is a big

6510
03:40:06,398 --> 03:40:10,559
difference

6511
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:11,279
because wikipedia is not a for-profit

6512
03:40:10,559 --> 03:40:14,639
corporation

6513
03:40:11,279 --> 03:40:15,920
it is a it's tending to the information

6514
03:40:14,639 --> 03:40:17,760
commons and it doesn't have

6515
03:40:15,920 --> 03:40:19,439
an agenda other than tending to the

6516
03:40:17,760 --> 03:40:23,040
information commons

6517
03:40:19,439 --> 03:40:24,800
and i think the two masters issue is a

6518
03:40:23,040 --> 03:40:29,120
tricky one when i'm trying to optimize

6519
03:40:24,799 --> 03:40:31,039
for very different kinds of things um

6520
03:40:29,120 --> 03:40:32,479
where i have to sacrifice one for the

6521
03:40:31,040 --> 03:40:34,160
other and i can't find synergistic

6522
03:40:32,478 --> 03:40:36,159
satisfiers which one

6523
03:40:34,159 --> 03:40:37,680
and if i have a fiduciary responsibility

6524
03:40:36,159 --> 03:40:40,159
to shareholder

6525
03:40:37,680 --> 03:40:40,800
uh profit maximization and you know what

6526
03:40:40,159 --> 03:40:43,840
what does that

6527
03:40:40,799 --> 03:40:47,039
end up creating i think

6528
03:40:43,840 --> 03:40:50,000
the ad model that silicon valley took

6529
03:40:47,040 --> 03:40:51,359
um i think jaren lanier i don't know if

6530
03:40:50,000 --> 03:40:53,279
you've had him on the show but he has

6531
03:40:51,359 --> 03:40:56,640
interesting assessment of

6532
03:40:53,279 --> 03:40:57,439
the nature of the ad model um silicon

6533
03:40:56,639 --> 03:41:00,238
valley

6534
03:40:57,439 --> 03:41:02,159
wanting to support capitalism and

6535
03:41:00,238 --> 03:41:04,238
entrepreneurs to make things but

6536
03:41:02,159 --> 03:41:05,199
uh also the belief that information

6537
03:41:04,238 --> 03:41:07,520
should be free

6538
03:41:05,199 --> 03:41:09,040
and also the network dynamics with the

6539
03:41:07,520 --> 03:41:11,520
more people you got on you got

6540
03:41:09,040 --> 03:41:12,720
increased value per user per capita as

6541
03:41:11,520 --> 03:41:14,880
more people got on so you didn't want to

6542
03:41:12,719 --> 03:41:17,599
do anything to slow the rate of adoption

6543
03:41:14,879 --> 03:41:19,358
um some places actually you know paypal

6544
03:41:17,600 --> 03:41:20,399
paying people money to join the network

6545
03:41:19,359 --> 03:41:22,479
because the

6546
03:41:20,398 --> 03:41:24,159
uh value of the network would be there'd

6547
03:41:22,478 --> 03:41:25,599
be a metcalf-like dynamic proportional

6548
03:41:24,159 --> 03:41:26,478
to the square of the total number of

6549
03:41:25,600 --> 03:41:29,600
users

6550
03:41:26,478 --> 03:41:30,559
so um the ad model made sense of how do

6551
03:41:29,600 --> 03:41:32,640
we

6552
03:41:30,559 --> 03:41:34,079
make it free but also be a business get

6553
03:41:32,639 --> 03:41:36,000
everybody on

6554
03:41:34,079 --> 03:41:37,439
but not really thinking about what it

6555
03:41:36,000 --> 03:41:38,959
would mean to

6556
03:41:37,439 --> 03:41:40,398
and this is now the whole idea that if

6557
03:41:38,959 --> 03:41:43,358
you aren't paying for the product you

6558
03:41:40,398 --> 03:41:44,959
are the product um

6559
03:41:43,359 --> 03:41:46,720
if if they have a fiduciary

6560
03:41:44,959 --> 03:41:48,879
responsibility to their shareholder

6561
03:41:46,719 --> 03:41:52,079
maximize profit their customer is the

6562
03:41:48,879 --> 03:41:53,278
advertiser the user who it's being built

6563
03:41:52,079 --> 03:41:54,879
for is to

6564
03:41:53,279 --> 03:41:56,479
do behavioral mod for them for

6565
03:41:54,879 --> 03:41:58,719
advertisers

6566
03:41:56,478 --> 03:42:00,639
that's a whole different thing than that

6567
03:41:58,719 --> 03:42:02,238
same type of tech could have been if

6568
03:42:00,639 --> 03:42:04,079
applied with a different business model

6569
03:42:02,238 --> 03:42:07,359
or a different purpose

6570
03:42:04,079 --> 03:42:11,039
um i think there's

6571
03:42:07,359 --> 03:42:13,279
because facebook and

6572
03:42:11,040 --> 03:42:14,640
google and other information and

6573
03:42:13,279 --> 03:42:16,238
communication platforms end up

6574
03:42:14,639 --> 03:42:18,079
harvesting data about

6575
03:42:16,238 --> 03:42:19,279
user behavior that allows them to model

6576
03:42:18,079 --> 03:42:21,439
who the people are

6577
03:42:19,279 --> 03:42:22,720
in a way that gives them more sometimes

6578
03:42:21,439 --> 03:42:27,439
specific information

6579
03:42:22,719 --> 03:42:27,438
and behavioral information then

6580
03:42:27,600 --> 03:42:31,199
even a therapist or a doctor or a lawyer

6581
03:42:29,760 --> 03:42:32,800
or a priest might have in a different

6582
03:42:31,199 --> 03:42:35,120
setting they basically are

6583
03:42:32,799 --> 03:42:38,000
accessing privileged information there

6584
03:42:35,120 --> 03:42:40,960
should be a fiduciary responsibility

6585
03:42:38,000 --> 03:42:44,000
and in normal fiduciary law if there's

6586
03:42:40,959 --> 03:42:46,719
this principal agent thing if you are a

6587
03:42:44,000 --> 03:42:48,238
uh principal and i'm an agent on your

6588
03:42:46,719 --> 03:42:49,679
behalf i don't have a game theoretic

6589
03:42:48,238 --> 03:42:51,439
relationship with you right if you're

6590
03:42:49,680 --> 03:42:52,960
sharing something with me and i'm the

6591
03:42:51,439 --> 03:42:54,639
priest or i'm the therapist i'm never

6592
03:42:52,959 --> 03:42:56,079
going to use that information to try to

6593
03:42:54,639 --> 03:42:58,959
sell you a used car or

6594
03:42:56,079 --> 03:43:00,159
whatever the thing is but facebook is

6595
03:42:58,959 --> 03:43:01,278
gathering

6596
03:43:00,159 --> 03:43:03,359
massive amounts of privileged

6597
03:43:01,279 --> 03:43:04,640
information and using it to modify

6598
03:43:03,359 --> 03:43:05,199
people's behavior for a behavior that

6599
03:43:04,639 --> 03:43:07,039
they

6600
03:43:05,199 --> 03:43:08,479
didn't sign up for wanting the behavior

6601
03:43:07,040 --> 03:43:11,520
but what the corporation did

6602
03:43:08,478 --> 03:43:14,159
so i think this is an example of the

6603
03:43:11,520 --> 03:43:15,760
physical tech evolving in the context of

6604
03:43:14,159 --> 03:43:18,079
the previous social tech

6605
03:43:15,760 --> 03:43:19,840
where it's being shaped in particular

6606
03:43:18,079 --> 03:43:21,359
ways and here unlike wikipedia that

6607
03:43:19,840 --> 03:43:24,799
evolved for the

6608
03:43:21,359 --> 03:43:26,559
the information commons this evolved for

6609
03:43:24,799 --> 03:43:27,920
fulfilling particular agenda purpose

6610
03:43:26,559 --> 03:43:29,119
most people when they're on facebook

6611
03:43:27,920 --> 03:43:31,199
think it's just a tool that they're

6612
03:43:29,120 --> 03:43:33,279
using they don't realize it's an agent

6613
03:43:31,199 --> 03:43:34,560
right it is a corporation with a profit

6614
03:43:33,279 --> 03:43:36,800
motive and

6615
03:43:34,559 --> 03:43:38,318
um and as i'm interacting with it it has

6616
03:43:36,799 --> 03:43:39,679
a goal for me different than my goal for

6617
03:43:38,318 --> 03:43:41,039
myself

6618
03:43:39,680 --> 03:43:42,720
and i might want to be on for a short

6619
03:43:41,040 --> 03:43:43,439
period of time its goal is maximize time

6620
03:43:42,719 --> 03:43:46,719
on site

6621
03:43:43,439 --> 03:43:48,479
and so there is a rivalry that is take

6622
03:43:46,719 --> 03:43:49,760
but where there should be a fiduciary

6623
03:43:48,478 --> 03:43:53,039
contract

6624
03:43:49,760 --> 03:43:54,880
i think that's actually a huge deal and

6625
03:43:53,040 --> 03:43:58,479
i think if we said could we apply

6626
03:43:54,879 --> 03:43:58,478
facebook like technology

6627
03:44:00,840 --> 03:44:06,079
to

6628
03:44:02,238 --> 03:44:07,119
develop people's citizenry capacity

6629
03:44:06,079 --> 03:44:08,719
right to develop

6630
03:44:07,120 --> 03:44:10,479
their personal health and well-being and

6631
03:44:08,719 --> 03:44:13,278
habits as well as their

6632
03:44:10,478 --> 03:44:15,679
um cognitive understanding the

6633
03:44:13,279 --> 03:44:19,120
complexity with which they can process

6634
03:44:15,680 --> 03:44:19,120
the health of their relationships

6635
03:44:19,840 --> 03:44:23,439
that would be amazing to start to

6636
03:44:21,439 --> 03:44:25,199
explore and this is now the thesis that

6637
03:44:23,439 --> 03:44:28,880
we started to discuss

6638
03:44:25,199 --> 03:44:30,880
before is every time there is a major

6639
03:44:28,879 --> 03:44:33,679
step function in the physical tech

6640
03:44:30,879 --> 03:44:36,559
it obsoletes the previous social tech

6641
03:44:33,680 --> 03:44:38,238
and the new social tech has to emerge

6642
03:44:36,559 --> 03:44:39,680
what i would say is that when we look at

6643
03:44:38,238 --> 03:44:40,478
the nation-state level of the world

6644
03:44:39,680 --> 03:44:43,520
today

6645
03:44:40,478 --> 03:44:44,959
the more top-down authoritarian nation

6646
03:44:43,520 --> 03:44:46,560
states are

6647
03:44:44,959 --> 03:44:48,478
as the exponential text started to

6648
03:44:46,559 --> 03:44:49,840
emerge the digital technology started to

6649
03:44:48,478 --> 03:44:51,679
emerge

6650
03:44:49,840 --> 03:44:53,359
they were in a position for better

6651
03:44:51,680 --> 03:44:55,680
long-term planning

6652
03:44:53,359 --> 03:44:57,439
and better coordination and so the

6653
03:44:55,680 --> 03:44:58,479
authoritarian state started applying the

6654
03:44:57,439 --> 03:45:00,000
exponential tech

6655
03:44:58,478 --> 03:45:01,679
intentionally to make more effective

6656
03:45:00,000 --> 03:45:03,040
authoritarian states

6657
03:45:01,680 --> 03:45:05,359
and that's everything from like an

6658
03:45:03,040 --> 03:45:08,080
internet of things surveillance system

6659
03:45:05,359 --> 03:45:10,000
going into machine learning systems to

6660
03:45:08,079 --> 03:45:11,439
the sesame credit system to all those

6661
03:45:10,000 --> 03:45:13,680
types of things

6662
03:45:11,439 --> 03:45:16,079
and so they're upgrading their social

6663
03:45:13,680 --> 03:45:18,479
tech using the exponential tech

6664
03:45:16,079 --> 03:45:19,760
otherwise within a nation state like the

6665
03:45:18,478 --> 03:45:23,039
us but

6666
03:45:19,760 --> 03:45:24,639
democratic open societies the sus the

6667
03:45:23,040 --> 03:45:26,640
countries the states are not

6668
03:45:24,639 --> 03:45:28,238
directing the technology in a way that

6669
03:45:26,639 --> 03:45:29,840
makes a better open society meaning

6670
03:45:28,238 --> 03:45:31,680
better emergent order

6671
03:45:29,840 --> 03:45:33,520
they're saying well the corporations are

6672
03:45:31,680 --> 03:45:35,040
doing that and the state is doing

6673
03:45:33,520 --> 03:45:36,720
the relatively little thing it would do

6674
03:45:35,040 --> 03:45:38,160
aligned with the previous corporate law

6675
03:45:36,719 --> 03:45:39,760
that no longer is relevant because there

6676
03:45:38,159 --> 03:45:42,079
wasn't fiduciary responsibility for

6677
03:45:39,760 --> 03:45:43,840
things like that there wasn't anti-trust

6678
03:45:42,079 --> 03:45:45,680
because this creates functional

6679
03:45:43,840 --> 03:45:46,880
monopolies because of network dynamics

6680
03:45:45,680 --> 03:45:49,520
right where youtube has

6681
03:45:46,879 --> 03:45:51,198
more users than vimeo and every other

6682
03:45:49,520 --> 03:45:52,800
video player together amazon has a

6683
03:45:51,199 --> 03:45:54,399
bigger percentage of market share than

6684
03:45:52,799 --> 03:45:57,519
all of the other markets together

6685
03:45:54,398 --> 03:45:59,439
you get one big dog per vertical

6686
03:45:57,520 --> 03:46:00,800
because of network effect which is a

6687
03:45:59,439 --> 03:46:02,159
kind of organic monopoly that the

6688
03:46:00,799 --> 03:46:02,799
previous anti-trust law didn't even have

6689
03:46:02,159 --> 03:46:05,680
a place

6690
03:46:02,799 --> 03:46:07,278
that wasn't a thing anti-monopoly was

6691
03:46:05,680 --> 03:46:09,359
only something that emerged in the space

6692
03:46:07,279 --> 03:46:12,560
of government contracts

6693
03:46:09,359 --> 03:46:14,880
so um so what we see is the new

6694
03:46:12,559 --> 03:46:16,719
exponential technology is being directed

6695
03:46:14,879 --> 03:46:18,159
by authoritarian nation states to make

6696
03:46:16,719 --> 03:46:19,599
better authoritarian nation states and

6697
03:46:18,159 --> 03:46:20,879
by corporations to make more powerful

6698
03:46:19,600 --> 03:46:23,199
corporations

6699
03:46:20,879 --> 03:46:24,719
the more powerful corporations when we

6700
03:46:23,199 --> 03:46:26,399
think about the scottish enlightenment

6701
03:46:24,719 --> 03:46:27,920
when the idea of markets was being

6702
03:46:26,398 --> 03:46:28,799
advanced the modern kind of ideas of

6703
03:46:27,920 --> 03:46:33,120
markets

6704
03:46:28,799 --> 03:46:34,478
the biggest corporation was tiny

6705
03:46:33,120 --> 03:46:36,479
compared to what the biggest corporation

6706
03:46:34,478 --> 03:46:38,639
today is so the asymmetry of it relative

6707
03:46:36,478 --> 03:46:40,799
to people was tiny

6708
03:46:38,639 --> 03:46:42,879
and the asymmetry now in terms of the

6709
03:46:40,799 --> 03:46:44,879
total technology it employs total amount

6710
03:46:42,879 --> 03:46:45,599
of money total amount of information

6711
03:46:44,879 --> 03:46:49,679
processing

6712
03:46:45,600 --> 03:46:51,520
is so many orders of magnitude and

6713
03:46:49,680 --> 03:46:53,279
rather than there be demand for an

6714
03:46:51,520 --> 03:46:55,760
authentic thing

6715
03:46:53,279 --> 03:46:57,279
that creates a basis for supply as

6716
03:46:55,760 --> 03:46:58,960
supply started to get way more

6717
03:46:57,279 --> 03:47:00,000
coordinated and powerful and the demand

6718
03:46:58,959 --> 03:47:01,599
wasn't coordinated because you don't

6719
03:47:00,000 --> 03:47:02,639
have a labor union of all the customers

6720
03:47:01,600 --> 03:47:04,000
working together

6721
03:47:02,639 --> 03:47:06,079
but you do have a coordination on the

6722
03:47:04,000 --> 03:47:07,760
supply side supply started to recognize

6723
03:47:06,079 --> 03:47:09,199
that it could manufacture demand

6724
03:47:07,760 --> 03:47:10,398
it could make people want [ __ ] that they

6725
03:47:09,199 --> 03:47:11,760
didn't want before that maybe wouldn't

6726
03:47:10,398 --> 03:47:13,519
increase their happiness

6727
03:47:11,760 --> 03:47:14,960
in a meaningful way might increase

6728
03:47:13,520 --> 03:47:16,960
addiction addiction is a very good way

6729
03:47:14,959 --> 03:47:20,079
to manufacture demand

6730
03:47:16,959 --> 03:47:21,278
and so as soon as manufactured demand

6731
03:47:20,079 --> 03:47:23,439
started

6732
03:47:21,279 --> 03:47:24,800
through this is the cool thing and you

6733
03:47:23,439 --> 03:47:25,760
have to have it for status or whatever

6734
03:47:24,799 --> 03:47:27,759
it is

6735
03:47:25,760 --> 03:47:29,920
the intelligence of the market was

6736
03:47:27,760 --> 03:47:31,120
breaking now it's no longer collective

6737
03:47:29,920 --> 03:47:32,079
intelligence system that is up

6738
03:47:31,120 --> 03:47:33,600
regulating

6739
03:47:32,079 --> 03:47:35,520
real desire for things that are really

6740
03:47:33,600 --> 03:47:37,279
meaningful you're able to hijack

6741
03:47:35,520 --> 03:47:38,560
the lower angels of our nature rather

6742
03:47:37,279 --> 03:47:39,120
than the higher ones the addictive

6743
03:47:38,559 --> 03:47:41,119
patterns

6744
03:47:39,120 --> 03:47:42,399
drive those and have people watch it

6745
03:47:41,120 --> 03:47:44,000
that doesn't actually make them happier

6746
03:47:42,398 --> 03:47:47,439
make the world better

6747
03:47:44,000 --> 03:47:49,840
and so we really also have to we have to

6748
03:47:47,439 --> 03:47:51,520
update our theory of markets because

6749
03:47:49,840 --> 03:47:53,439
behavioral econ showed that homo

6750
03:47:51,520 --> 03:47:54,479
economicus the rational actor is not

6751
03:47:53,439 --> 03:47:56,318
really a thing

6752
03:47:54,478 --> 03:47:57,920
but particularly at greater and greater

6753
03:47:56,318 --> 03:47:59,600
scale can't really be a thing

6754
03:47:57,920 --> 03:48:01,199
voluntarism isn't a thing where if my

6755
03:47:59,600 --> 03:48:03,199
corp if my company doesn't want to

6756
03:48:01,199 --> 03:48:04,319
advertise on facebook i just will lose

6757
03:48:03,199 --> 03:48:06,239
to the companies that do because that's

6758
03:48:04,318 --> 03:48:08,318
where all the [ __ ] attention is

6759
03:48:06,238 --> 03:48:09,680
and so then i can say it's voluntary but

6760
03:48:08,318 --> 03:48:11,760
it's not really if there's a functional

6761
03:48:09,680 --> 03:48:13,439
monopoly

6762
03:48:11,760 --> 03:48:16,238
same if i'm going to sell on amazon or

6763
03:48:13,439 --> 03:48:18,318
things like that so

6764
03:48:16,238 --> 03:48:19,600
what i would say is these corporations

6765
03:48:18,318 --> 03:48:22,000
are becoming

6766
03:48:19,600 --> 03:48:23,359
more powerful than nation states in some

6767
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:25,760
ways

6768
03:48:23,359 --> 03:48:25,760
and

6769
03:48:27,279 --> 03:48:33,760
they are also debasing the integrity

6770
03:48:31,439 --> 03:48:35,760
of the nation states the open societies

6771
03:48:33,760 --> 03:48:38,398
so the democracies are getting weaker

6772
03:48:35,760 --> 03:48:39,600
as a result of exponential tech and the

6773
03:48:38,398 --> 03:48:41,119
kind of new

6774
03:48:39,600 --> 03:48:43,120
tech companies that are kind of a new

6775
03:48:41,120 --> 03:48:44,640
feudalism tech feudalism because

6776
03:48:43,120 --> 03:48:46,000
it's not a democracy inside of a tech

6777
03:48:44,639 --> 03:48:47,840
company or the supply and demand

6778
03:48:46,000 --> 03:48:49,520
relationship

6779
03:48:47,840 --> 03:48:52,880
when you have manufactured demand and

6780
03:48:49,520 --> 03:48:54,640
kind of monopoly type functions

6781
03:48:52,879 --> 03:48:56,000
and so we have basically a new feudalism

6782
03:48:54,639 --> 03:48:57,760
controlling exponential tech and

6783
03:48:56,000 --> 03:49:00,799
authoritarian nation states controlling

6784
03:48:57,760 --> 03:49:03,520
it and those attractors are both shitty

6785
03:49:00,799 --> 03:49:05,198
and so i'm interested in the application

6786
03:49:03,520 --> 03:49:07,520
of exponential tech

6787
03:49:05,199 --> 03:49:10,319
to making better social tech that makes

6788
03:49:07,520 --> 03:49:12,399
emergent order possible and

6789
03:49:10,318 --> 03:49:14,398
where then that emergent order can bind

6790
03:49:12,398 --> 03:49:17,439
and direct the exponential tech

6791
03:49:14,398 --> 03:49:18,959
in fundamentally healthy not x-risk

6792
03:49:17,439 --> 03:49:21,040
oriented directions

6793
03:49:18,959 --> 03:49:22,559
i think the relationship of social tech

6794
03:49:21,040 --> 03:49:24,080
and physical tech can make it

6795
03:49:22,559 --> 03:49:25,760
i think we can actually use the physical

6796
03:49:24,079 --> 03:49:26,238
tech to make better social tech but it's

6797
03:49:25,760 --> 03:49:28,880
not

6798
03:49:26,238 --> 03:49:30,000
given that we do if we don't make better

6799
03:49:28,879 --> 03:49:31,759
social tech

6800
03:49:30,000 --> 03:49:33,199
then i think the physical tech empowers

6801
03:49:31,760 --> 03:49:34,880
really shitty social tech that it's not

6802
03:49:33,199 --> 03:49:36,560
a world that we want

6803
03:49:34,879 --> 03:49:39,039
i don't know if it's a road we want to

6804
03:49:36,559 --> 03:49:40,398
go down but i tend to believe that the

6805
03:49:39,040 --> 03:49:42,080
market will create

6806
03:49:40,398 --> 03:49:43,840
exactly the thing you're talking about

6807
03:49:42,079 --> 03:49:44,478
which i feel like there's a lot of money

6808
03:49:43,840 --> 03:49:48,799
to be made

6809
03:49:44,478 --> 03:49:52,318
in creating a

6810
03:49:48,799 --> 03:49:54,559
social tech that creates a better

6811
03:49:52,318 --> 03:49:57,600
citizen

6812
03:49:54,559 --> 03:50:00,639
it creates a better human being

6813
03:49:57,600 --> 03:50:03,520
the this this uh the the your

6814
03:50:00,639 --> 03:50:05,439
description of facebook and so on

6815
03:50:03,520 --> 03:50:08,479
which is a system that creates addiction

6816
03:50:05,439 --> 03:50:12,479
which manufacturers demand

6817
03:50:08,478 --> 03:50:14,559
is not obviously inherently

6818
03:50:12,478 --> 03:50:16,559
the consequence of the markets like i

6819
03:50:14,559 --> 03:50:17,198
feel like that's the the first stage of

6820
03:50:16,559 --> 03:50:19,039
us

6821
03:50:17,199 --> 03:50:20,399
like baby deer trying to figure out how

6822
03:50:19,040 --> 03:50:22,479
to use the internet

6823
03:50:20,398 --> 03:50:24,959
i feel like there's much more money to

6824
03:50:22,478 --> 03:50:28,318
be made with something that

6825
03:50:24,959 --> 03:50:32,159
creates compersion

6826
03:50:28,318 --> 03:50:34,318
and love honestly i mean i i really

6827
03:50:32,159 --> 03:50:36,079
from we can have this i can make the

6828
03:50:34,318 --> 03:50:38,159
business case for it i don't know

6829
03:50:36,079 --> 03:50:39,840
i don't think we want to really have

6830
03:50:38,159 --> 03:50:41,600
that discussion but don't do you have

6831
03:50:39,840 --> 03:50:44,079
some hope that that's the case and

6832
03:50:41,600 --> 03:50:45,920
what i guess if not then how do we fix

6833
03:50:44,079 --> 03:50:46,559
the system of markets that work so well

6834
03:50:45,920 --> 03:50:49,199
for

6835
03:50:46,559 --> 03:50:51,039
the united states for so long like i

6836
03:50:49,199 --> 03:50:52,800
said every social tech worked for a

6837
03:50:51,040 --> 03:50:54,479
while like tribalism worked

6838
03:50:52,799 --> 03:50:55,840
well for two or three hundred thousand

6839
03:50:54,478 --> 03:50:57,920
years i think

6840
03:50:55,840 --> 03:50:59,359
social tech has to keep evolving the

6841
03:50:57,920 --> 03:51:01,279
social technologies

6842
03:50:59,359 --> 03:51:02,399
with which we organize and coordinate

6843
03:51:01,279 --> 03:51:03,920
our behavior

6844
03:51:02,398 --> 03:51:05,599
have to keep evolving as our physical

6845
03:51:03,920 --> 03:51:08,318
tech does

6846
03:51:05,600 --> 03:51:10,720
so i think the thing that we call

6847
03:51:08,318 --> 03:51:12,318
markets

6848
03:51:10,719 --> 03:51:14,840
of course we can try to say oh even

6849
03:51:12,318 --> 03:51:18,000
biology runs on markets and

6850
03:51:14,840 --> 03:51:20,478
but the thing that we call markets

6851
03:51:18,000 --> 03:51:23,439
the underlying theory homo economicus

6852
03:51:20,478 --> 03:51:26,478
demand driving supply that thing broke

6853
03:51:23,439 --> 03:51:28,559
it broke with scale in particular um

6854
03:51:26,478 --> 03:51:30,238
and a few other things so it needs

6855
03:51:28,559 --> 03:51:33,760
updated in a really fundamental

6856
03:51:30,238 --> 03:51:36,398
way um i think there's something even

6857
03:51:33,760 --> 03:51:38,478
deeper than making money happening

6858
03:51:36,398 --> 03:51:40,879
that it in some ways will obsolete money

6859
03:51:38,478 --> 03:51:40,879
making

6860
03:51:41,520 --> 03:51:45,840
i think capitalism is not about business

6861
03:51:46,318 --> 03:51:50,159
so if you think about business i'm going

6862
03:51:48,478 --> 03:51:51,278
to produce a good or a service that

6863
03:51:50,159 --> 03:51:53,600
people want and

6864
03:51:51,279 --> 03:51:55,120
bring it to the market so that people

6865
03:51:53,600 --> 03:51:57,040
get access to that good or service

6866
03:51:55,120 --> 03:51:59,279
that's the world of business

6867
03:51:57,040 --> 03:52:00,160
but that's not capitalism capitalism is

6868
03:51:59,279 --> 03:52:02,880
the

6869
03:52:00,159 --> 03:52:04,398
management and allocation of capital

6870
03:52:02,879 --> 03:52:06,318
which

6871
03:52:04,398 --> 03:52:07,760
financial services was a tiny percentage

6872
03:52:06,318 --> 03:52:09,119
of the total market has become a huge

6873
03:52:07,760 --> 03:52:10,238
percentage of the total market it's a

6874
03:52:09,120 --> 03:52:12,640
different creature

6875
03:52:10,238 --> 03:52:14,079
so if i was in business and i was

6876
03:52:12,639 --> 03:52:15,599
producing a good or service and i was

6877
03:52:14,079 --> 03:52:17,520
saving up enough money that i started to

6878
03:52:15,600 --> 03:52:18,880
be able to invest that money and gain

6879
03:52:17,520 --> 03:52:20,238
interest or

6880
03:52:18,879 --> 03:52:22,639
do things like that i could start

6881
03:52:20,238 --> 03:52:24,559
realizing i'm making more money

6882
03:52:22,639 --> 03:52:26,639
on my money than i'm making on producing

6883
03:52:24,559 --> 03:52:28,079
the goods and services so i stop even

6884
03:52:26,639 --> 03:52:29,599
paying attention to goods and services

6885
03:52:28,079 --> 03:52:31,520
and start paying attention to

6886
03:52:29,600 --> 03:52:33,920
making money on money and how do i

6887
03:52:31,520 --> 03:52:36,079
utilize capital to create more capital

6888
03:52:33,920 --> 03:52:37,359
and capital gives me more optionality

6889
03:52:36,079 --> 03:52:38,639
because i can buy anything with it than

6890
03:52:37,359 --> 03:52:41,840
a particular good or service that only

6891
03:52:38,639 --> 03:52:41,840
some people want

6892
03:52:42,079 --> 03:52:44,799
capitalism

6893
03:52:46,159 --> 03:52:49,359
more capital ended up meaning more

6894
03:52:47,840 --> 03:52:50,880
control

6895
03:52:49,359 --> 03:52:54,159
i could put more people under my

6896
03:52:50,879 --> 03:52:56,478
employment i could buy larger pieces of

6897
03:52:54,159 --> 03:52:58,000
land novel access to resource mines and

6898
03:52:56,478 --> 03:52:59,760
put more technology under my employment

6899
03:52:58,000 --> 03:53:02,238
so it meant increased agency and also

6900
03:52:59,760 --> 03:53:04,478
increased control

6901
03:53:02,238 --> 03:53:06,959
i think attentionalism is even more

6902
03:53:04,478 --> 03:53:06,959
powerful

6903
03:53:07,520 --> 03:53:13,199
so rather than enslave people

6904
03:53:11,520 --> 03:53:14,560
where the people kind of always want to

6905
03:53:13,199 --> 03:53:16,720
get away and put in

6906
03:53:14,559 --> 03:53:18,559
the least work they can there's a way in

6907
03:53:16,719 --> 03:53:20,238
which economic servitude was just more

6908
03:53:18,559 --> 03:53:23,198
profitable than slavery

6909
03:53:20,238 --> 03:53:24,478
right have the people work even harder

6910
03:53:23,199 --> 03:53:25,439
voluntarily because they want to get

6911
03:53:24,478 --> 03:53:27,760
ahead

6912
03:53:25,439 --> 03:53:29,220
and nobody has to be there to whip them

6913
03:53:27,760 --> 03:53:30,478
or control them or whatever

6914
03:53:29,219 --> 03:53:33,358
[Music]

6915
03:53:30,478 --> 03:53:34,639
this is a a cynical take but a

6916
03:53:33,359 --> 03:53:39,279
meaningful take

6917
03:53:34,639 --> 03:53:40,719
um so people

6918
03:53:39,279 --> 03:53:42,960
so capital ends up being a way to

6919
03:53:40,719 --> 03:53:47,198
influence human behavior right

6920
03:53:42,959 --> 03:53:49,358
and yet where people still feel free

6921
03:53:47,199 --> 03:53:50,239
in some meaningful way they they're not

6922
03:53:49,359 --> 03:53:51,840
feeling like

6923
03:53:50,238 --> 03:53:53,439
uh they're going to be punished by the

6924
03:53:51,840 --> 03:53:54,639
state if they don't do something it's

6925
03:53:53,439 --> 03:53:56,639
like punished by the market

6926
03:53:54,639 --> 03:53:58,238
via homelessness or something but the

6927
03:53:56,639 --> 03:54:00,959
market is this invisible thing i can't

6928
03:53:58,238 --> 03:54:04,318
put an agent on so it feels like free

6929
03:54:00,959 --> 03:54:08,000
and so if

6930
03:54:04,318 --> 03:54:10,559
if you want to affect people's behavior

6931
03:54:08,000 --> 03:54:11,680
and still have them feel free capital

6932
03:54:10,559 --> 03:54:13,760
ends up being a way to

6933
03:54:11,680 --> 03:54:15,680
do that but i think affecting their

6934
03:54:13,760 --> 03:54:18,318
attention is even deeper

6935
03:54:15,680 --> 03:54:18,800
because if i can affect their attention

6936
03:54:18,318 --> 03:54:21,278
i can

6937
03:54:18,799 --> 03:54:22,719
both affect what they want and what they

6938
03:54:21,279 --> 03:54:24,159
believe and what they feel

6939
03:54:22,719 --> 03:54:25,679
and we statistically know this very

6940
03:54:24,159 --> 03:54:26,398
clearly facebook has done studies that

6941
03:54:25,680 --> 03:54:28,720
based on

6942
03:54:26,398 --> 03:54:31,039
changing the feed it can change beliefs

6943
03:54:28,719 --> 03:54:34,799
emotional dispositions et cetera

6944
03:54:31,040 --> 03:54:37,120
and so i think there's a way that the

6945
03:54:34,799 --> 03:54:38,959
the harvest and directing of attention

6946
03:54:37,120 --> 03:54:40,319
is even a more powerful system than

6947
03:54:38,959 --> 03:54:42,159
capitalism it is

6948
03:54:40,318 --> 03:54:43,920
effective in capitalism to generate

6949
03:54:42,159 --> 03:54:46,478
capital but i think it also generates

6950
03:54:43,920 --> 03:54:50,559
influence beyond what capital can do

6951
03:54:46,478 --> 03:54:54,799
and so do we want to have

6952
03:54:50,559 --> 03:54:56,478
some groups utilizing

6953
03:54:54,799 --> 03:54:59,039
that type of tech to direct other

6954
03:54:56,478 --> 03:55:02,879
people's attention if so

6955
03:54:59,040 --> 03:55:04,720
um towards what

6956
03:55:02,879 --> 03:55:06,238
towards what metrics of what a good

6957
03:55:04,719 --> 03:55:06,959
civilization and good human life would

6958
03:55:06,238 --> 03:55:09,840
be

6959
03:55:06,959 --> 03:55:11,759
what's the oversight process what is the

6960
03:55:09,840 --> 03:55:13,840
transparency i can i can

6961
03:55:11,760 --> 03:55:17,199
answer all the things you're mentioning

6962
03:55:13,840 --> 03:55:19,840
uh i i can build i guarantee you if i

6963
03:55:17,199 --> 03:55:21,600
i'm not such a lazy ass uh i'll be part

6964
03:55:19,840 --> 03:55:24,719
of the many people doing this

6965
03:55:21,600 --> 03:55:26,318
as transparency and control like to

6966
03:55:24,719 --> 03:55:28,799
giving control to individual people okay

6967
03:55:26,318 --> 03:55:32,398
so maybe

6968
03:55:28,799 --> 03:55:35,278
the corporation has

6969
03:55:32,398 --> 03:55:37,119
coordination on its goals that all of

6970
03:55:35,279 --> 03:55:38,960
its customers or users together don't

6971
03:55:37,120 --> 03:55:40,640
have so there's some asymmetry where

6972
03:55:38,959 --> 03:55:43,198
it's

6973
03:55:40,639 --> 03:55:44,398
uh asymmetry of its goals but maybe i

6974
03:55:43,199 --> 03:55:47,359
could actually help

6975
03:55:44,398 --> 03:55:49,039
all of the customers to coordinate

6976
03:55:47,359 --> 03:55:51,760
almost like a labor union or whatever by

6977
03:55:49,040 --> 03:55:54,239
informing and educating them adequately

6978
03:55:51,760 --> 03:55:56,800
about the effects the externalities on

6979
03:55:54,238 --> 03:55:58,398
them this is not toxic waste going into

6980
03:55:56,799 --> 03:56:00,000
the ocean of the atmosphere it's their

6981
03:55:58,398 --> 03:56:01,599
their minds their beings their families

6982
03:56:00,000 --> 03:56:04,478
their relationships

6983
03:56:01,600 --> 03:56:04,880
um such that they will in group change

6984
03:56:04,478 --> 03:56:08,079
their

6985
03:56:04,879 --> 03:56:11,920
behavior and um i think

6986
03:56:08,079 --> 03:56:14,159
the idea one way of saying what you're

6987
03:56:11,920 --> 03:56:15,600
saying i think is that you think that

6988
03:56:14,159 --> 03:56:19,279
you can rescue

6989
03:56:15,600 --> 03:56:21,520
homo economicus from

6990
03:56:19,279 --> 03:56:23,120
uh the rational actor that will pursue

6991
03:56:21,520 --> 03:56:24,800
all the goods and services and choose

6992
03:56:23,120 --> 03:56:25,439
the best one at the best price the kind

6993
03:56:24,799 --> 03:56:27,119
of rand

6994
03:56:25,439 --> 03:56:29,359
one misses hayek that you can rescue

6995
03:56:27,120 --> 03:56:30,640
that from dan ariely and behavioral econ

6996
03:56:29,359 --> 03:56:31,920
that says that's actually not how people

6997
03:56:30,639 --> 03:56:32,879
make choices they make it based on

6998
03:56:31,920 --> 03:56:34,559
status hacking

6999
03:56:32,879 --> 03:56:36,000
largely whether it's good for them or

7000
03:56:34,559 --> 03:56:38,879
not in the long term

7001
03:56:36,000 --> 03:56:39,520
and the large asymmetric corporation can

7002
03:56:38,879 --> 03:56:41,119
run

7003
03:56:39,520 --> 03:56:43,040
propaganda in narrative warfare that

7004
03:56:41,120 --> 03:56:45,120
hits people's status buttons and their

7005
03:56:43,040 --> 03:56:46,560
limbic hijacks and their lots of other

7006
03:56:45,120 --> 03:56:48,000
things in ways that

7007
03:56:46,559 --> 03:56:50,559
they can't even perceive that are

7008
03:56:48,000 --> 03:56:52,238
happening um they're not paying

7009
03:56:50,559 --> 03:56:54,079
attention to that this site is employing

7010
03:56:52,238 --> 03:56:56,478
psychologists and split testing and

7011
03:56:54,079 --> 03:56:58,159
whatever else

7012
03:56:56,478 --> 03:56:59,840
so you're saying i think we can recover

7013
03:56:58,159 --> 03:57:01,199
homo economics

7014
03:56:59,840 --> 03:57:04,000
and not just through a singles like

7015
03:57:01,199 --> 03:57:06,079
mechanism technology there's there's the

7016
03:57:04,000 --> 03:57:07,040
uh not to keep mentioning the guy but

7017
03:57:06,079 --> 03:57:10,238
platforms like

7018
03:57:07,040 --> 03:57:13,359
joe rogan and so on that that make

7019
03:57:10,238 --> 03:57:16,719
help make viral the ways

7020
03:57:13,359 --> 03:57:20,000
that the education of negative

7021
03:57:16,719 --> 03:57:23,519
externalities can become viral

7022
03:57:20,000 --> 03:57:27,920
in this world so interestingly

7023
03:57:23,520 --> 03:57:30,079
i actually agree with you that

7024
03:57:27,920 --> 03:57:31,279
got them that we four and a half hours

7025
03:57:30,079 --> 03:57:33,520
in

7026
03:57:31,279 --> 03:57:34,319
that we can tech can do some good all

7027
03:57:33,520 --> 03:57:35,760
right

7028
03:57:34,318 --> 03:57:38,000
well see what you're talking about is

7029
03:57:35,760 --> 03:57:39,600
the application of tech here broadcast

7030
03:57:38,000 --> 03:57:41,520
tech where you can speak to a lot of

7031
03:57:39,600 --> 03:57:42,559
people and that's not going to be

7032
03:57:41,520 --> 03:57:44,159
strong enough because the different

7033
03:57:42,559 --> 03:57:45,519
people need spoken too differently which

7034
03:57:44,159 --> 03:57:47,039
means it has to be different voices that

7035
03:57:45,520 --> 03:57:48,000
get amplified to those audiences more

7036
03:57:47,040 --> 03:57:49,199
like facebook's tech

7037
03:57:48,000 --> 03:57:51,439
but nonetheless we'll start with

7038
03:57:49,199 --> 03:57:52,560
broadcast tech plants the first seed and

7039
03:57:51,439 --> 03:57:54,479
then the word of mouth

7040
03:57:52,559 --> 03:57:56,959
is a powerful thing you need to do the

7041
03:57:54,478 --> 03:57:59,438
first broadcast shotgun and then

7042
03:57:56,959 --> 03:58:01,519
it like lands so catapulted whatever i

7043
03:57:59,439 --> 03:58:03,040
don't know what the right weapon is

7044
03:58:01,520 --> 03:58:05,040
but then it just spreads to word of

7045
03:58:03,040 --> 03:58:06,800
mouth through all kinds of tech

7046
03:58:05,040 --> 03:58:07,680
including facebook so let's come back to

7047
03:58:06,799 --> 03:58:10,238
the fundamental

7048
03:58:07,680 --> 03:58:12,880
thing the fundamental thing is we want

7049
03:58:10,238 --> 03:58:15,600
to kind of order at various scales

7050
03:58:12,879 --> 03:58:16,000
from the conflicting parts of our self

7051
03:58:15,600 --> 03:58:19,760
actually

7052
03:58:16,000 --> 03:58:23,359
having more harmony than they might have

7053
03:58:19,760 --> 03:58:26,318
to uh family extended family local

7054
03:58:23,359 --> 03:58:28,840
all the way up to global we want

7055
03:58:26,318 --> 03:58:30,799
emergent order where our

7056
03:58:28,840 --> 03:58:34,000
choices have

7057
03:58:30,799 --> 03:58:36,159
more alignment right we want

7058
03:58:34,000 --> 03:58:38,000
that to be emergent rather than imposed

7059
03:58:36,159 --> 03:58:39,039
or rather than we want fundamentally

7060
03:58:38,000 --> 03:58:41,199
different things or make totally

7061
03:58:39,040 --> 03:58:42,880
different sense of the world where

7062
03:58:41,199 --> 03:58:44,479
warfare of some kind becomes the only

7063
03:58:42,879 --> 03:58:46,879
solution

7064
03:58:44,478 --> 03:58:48,879
emerging order requires us in our choice

7065
03:58:46,879 --> 03:58:51,920
making requires us being able to

7066
03:58:48,879 --> 03:58:54,879
have related sense making and related

7067
03:58:51,920 --> 03:58:58,000
meaning making processes

7068
03:58:54,879 --> 03:58:59,839
can we apply digital

7069
03:58:58,000 --> 03:59:01,359
technologies and exponential tech in

7070
03:58:59,840 --> 03:59:03,040
general to try to

7071
03:59:01,359 --> 03:59:04,800
increase the capacity to do that where

7072
03:59:03,040 --> 03:59:06,319
the technology called a town hall the

7073
03:59:04,799 --> 03:59:08,398
social tech that we all get together and

7074
03:59:06,318 --> 03:59:10,719
talk obviously is very scale limited

7075
03:59:08,398 --> 03:59:12,879
and it's also oriented to geography

7076
03:59:10,719 --> 03:59:14,318
rather than networks of aligned interest

7077
03:59:12,879 --> 03:59:16,079
can we build new better versions of

7078
03:59:14,318 --> 03:59:19,439
those types of things

7079
03:59:16,079 --> 03:59:21,680
and going back to the idea that a

7080
03:59:19,439 --> 03:59:23,840
democracy or participatory governance

7081
03:59:21,680 --> 03:59:25,439
depends upon comprehensive education in

7082
03:59:23,840 --> 03:59:27,040
the science of government which includes

7083
03:59:25,439 --> 03:59:28,880
being able to understand things like

7084
03:59:27,040 --> 03:59:30,479
asymmetric information warfare on the

7085
03:59:28,879 --> 03:59:30,799
side of governments and how the people

7086
03:59:30,478 --> 03:59:34,159
can

7087
03:59:30,799 --> 03:59:35,759
organize adequately can you utilize some

7088
03:59:34,159 --> 03:59:38,238
of the technologies now

7089
03:59:35,760 --> 03:59:40,000
to be able to support increased

7090
03:59:38,238 --> 03:59:42,238
comprehensive education

7091
03:59:40,000 --> 03:59:43,120
of the people and maybe comprehensive

7092
03:59:42,238 --> 03:59:45,198
informedness

7093
03:59:43,120 --> 03:59:46,720
so both fixing the decay in both

7094
03:59:45,199 --> 03:59:48,159
education and the fourth estate that

7095
03:59:46,719 --> 03:59:50,238
have happened so the people can start

7096
03:59:48,159 --> 03:59:53,359
self-organizing to then

7097
03:59:50,238 --> 03:59:54,000
influence the corporations the nation

7098
03:59:53,359 --> 03:59:55,840
states

7099
03:59:54,000 --> 03:59:57,199
to do different things and or build new

7100
03:59:55,840 --> 03:59:58,478
ones themselves

7101
03:59:57,199 --> 04:00:00,560
yeah fundamentally that's the thing that

7102
03:59:58,478 --> 04:00:02,318
has to happen we

7103
04:00:00,559 --> 04:00:04,000
the exponential tech gives us a novel

7104
04:00:02,318 --> 04:00:04,799
problem landscape that the world never

7105
04:00:04,000 --> 04:00:06,159
had

7106
04:00:04,799 --> 04:00:08,159
the nuke gave us a novel problem

7107
04:00:06,159 --> 04:00:11,119
landscape and so that required

7108
04:00:08,159 --> 04:00:12,719
this whole bretton woods world the

7109
04:00:11,120 --> 04:00:13,359
exponential tech gives us novel problem

7110
04:00:12,719 --> 04:00:15,278
landscape

7111
04:00:13,359 --> 04:00:16,399
our existing problem-solving processes

7112
04:00:15,279 --> 04:00:18,640
aren't doing a good job

7113
04:00:16,398 --> 04:00:20,639
we have had more countries get nukes we

7114
04:00:18,639 --> 04:00:22,079
haven't nuclear d proliferation we

7115
04:00:20,639 --> 04:00:24,398
haven't achieved any of the un's

7116
04:00:22,079 --> 04:00:25,600
sustainable development goals

7117
04:00:24,398 --> 04:00:27,519
we haven't kept any of the new

7118
04:00:25,600 --> 04:00:29,120
categories of tech for making arms races

7119
04:00:27,520 --> 04:00:32,079
so our global coordination is not

7120
04:00:29,120 --> 04:00:34,000
adequate to the problem landscape

7121
04:00:32,079 --> 04:00:36,159
so we need fundamentally better problem

7122
04:00:34,000 --> 04:00:37,600
solving processes a market or a state is

7123
04:00:36,159 --> 04:00:38,639
a problem-solving process we need better

7124
04:00:37,600 --> 04:00:40,479
ones it can do

7125
04:00:38,639 --> 04:00:42,398
the speed and scale of the current

7126
04:00:40,478 --> 04:00:43,198
issues right now speed is one of the

7127
04:00:42,398 --> 04:00:46,079
other big things

7128
04:00:43,199 --> 04:00:47,199
is that by the time we regulated ddt out

7129
04:00:46,079 --> 04:00:48,879
of existence or

7130
04:00:47,199 --> 04:00:50,720
cigarettes not for people under 18

7131
04:00:48,879 --> 04:00:51,039
they'd already killed so many people and

7132
04:00:50,719 --> 04:00:54,398
we

7133
04:00:51,040 --> 04:00:55,760
let the market do the thing but as elon

7134
04:00:54,398 --> 04:00:58,159
has made the point that won't work for

7135
04:00:55,760 --> 04:01:00,639
ai by the time we recognize

7136
04:00:58,159 --> 04:01:01,920
afterwards that we have an autopoetic ai

7137
04:01:00,639 --> 04:01:03,358
that's a problem you won't be able to

7138
04:01:01,920 --> 04:01:04,559
reverse it that there's a number of

7139
04:01:03,359 --> 04:01:05,760
things that

7140
04:01:04,559 --> 04:01:07,680
when you're dealing with tech that is

7141
04:01:05,760 --> 04:01:09,199
either self-replicating

7142
04:01:07,680 --> 04:01:11,359
and disintermediates humans to keep

7143
04:01:09,199 --> 04:01:13,840
going doesn't need humans to keep going

7144
04:01:11,359 --> 04:01:15,439
or you have tech that just has

7145
04:01:13,840 --> 04:01:17,600
exponentially fast effects

7146
04:01:15,439 --> 04:01:18,720
your regulation has to come early it

7147
04:01:17,600 --> 04:01:21,600
can't come

7148
04:01:18,719 --> 04:01:22,719
after the effects have happened the

7149
04:01:21,600 --> 04:01:24,000
negative effects have happened

7150
04:01:22,719 --> 04:01:26,398
if because the negative x could be too

7151
04:01:24,000 --> 04:01:29,040
big too quickly so we basically need new

7152
04:01:26,398 --> 04:01:31,840
problem solving processes that do

7153
04:01:29,040 --> 04:01:32,960
better at being able to internalize

7154
04:01:31,840 --> 04:01:34,238
externality

7155
04:01:32,959 --> 04:01:36,318
solve the problems on the right time

7156
04:01:34,238 --> 04:01:39,680
scale and the right geographic

7157
04:01:36,318 --> 04:01:41,680
scale and those new processes to not be

7158
04:01:39,680 --> 04:01:43,279
imposed have to emerge from people

7159
04:01:41,680 --> 04:01:45,680
wanting them

7160
04:01:43,279 --> 04:01:47,279
and being able to participate in their

7161
04:01:45,680 --> 04:01:48,960
development which is what i would call

7162
04:01:47,279 --> 04:01:50,720
kind of a new cultural enlightenment or

7163
04:01:48,959 --> 04:01:52,959
renaissance that has to happen

7164
04:01:50,719 --> 04:01:54,159
where people start understanding the new

7165
04:01:52,959 --> 04:01:57,198
power

7166
04:01:54,159 --> 04:01:59,600
that exponential tech offers the way

7167
04:01:57,199 --> 04:02:01,040
that it is actually damaging

7168
04:01:59,600 --> 04:02:02,800
current governance structures that we

7169
04:02:01,040 --> 04:02:04,880
care about

7170
04:02:02,799 --> 04:02:07,119
and creating an x-risk landscape but

7171
04:02:04,879 --> 04:02:10,398
could also be redirected

7172
04:02:07,120 --> 04:02:12,319
towards more protopic purposes and then

7173
04:02:10,398 --> 04:02:14,000
saying how do we rebuild new social

7174
04:02:12,318 --> 04:02:15,198
institutions what are adequate social

7175
04:02:14,000 --> 04:02:17,359
institutions where we can do

7176
04:02:15,199 --> 04:02:18,640
participatory governance at scale and

7177
04:02:17,359 --> 04:02:20,880
time

7178
04:02:18,639 --> 04:02:22,719
and how can the people actually

7179
04:02:20,879 --> 04:02:25,519
participate to build those things

7180
04:02:22,719 --> 04:02:29,358
i the the solution that i see working

7181
04:02:25,520 --> 04:02:32,479
requires a process like that

7182
04:02:29,359 --> 04:02:35,920
and the result maximizes love so

7183
04:02:32,478 --> 04:02:38,159
again elon musk that love is the answer

7184
04:02:35,920 --> 04:02:40,000
let me take it back from the scale of

7185
04:02:38,159 --> 04:02:41,840
societies

7186
04:02:40,000 --> 04:02:44,318
to the scale that's far far more

7187
04:02:41,840 --> 04:02:48,000
important which is the uh

7188
04:02:44,318 --> 04:02:49,920
scale of uh family you've written a blog

7189
04:02:48,000 --> 04:02:51,760
post about your dad

7190
04:02:49,920 --> 04:02:54,840
we have uh various flavors of

7191
04:02:51,760 --> 04:02:57,760
relationships with our

7192
04:02:54,840 --> 04:03:00,880
fathers uh what have you learned

7193
04:02:57,760 --> 04:03:04,079
about life from your dad

7194
04:03:00,879 --> 04:03:04,639
well people can read the blog post and

7195
04:03:04,079 --> 04:03:06,238
see

7196
04:03:04,639 --> 04:03:08,639
a lot of individual things that i

7197
04:03:06,238 --> 04:03:10,478
learned that i really appreciated

7198
04:03:08,639 --> 04:03:12,799
if i was to kind of summarize at a high

7199
04:03:10,478 --> 04:03:12,799
level

7200
04:03:13,760 --> 04:03:21,520
um i had a really incredible dad like

7201
04:03:17,920 --> 04:03:22,960
very very unusually uh positive set of

7202
04:03:21,520 --> 04:03:24,960
experiences

7203
04:03:22,959 --> 04:03:26,478
he was committed we were homeschooled

7204
04:03:24,959 --> 04:03:27,519
and he was committed to work from home

7205
04:03:26,478 --> 04:03:29,358
to be available

7206
04:03:27,520 --> 04:03:32,079
and like prioritize fathering in a

7207
04:03:29,359 --> 04:03:32,079
really deep way

7208
04:03:35,359 --> 04:03:40,960
and you know as a super gifted super

7209
04:03:38,719 --> 04:03:42,398
loving very unique man he also had his

7210
04:03:40,959 --> 04:03:43,919
unique issues that were part of what

7211
04:03:42,398 --> 04:03:45,519
crafted the unique brilliance and those

7212
04:03:43,920 --> 04:03:48,799
things often go together

7213
04:03:45,520 --> 04:03:50,720
and i say that because i think i had

7214
04:03:48,799 --> 04:03:52,000
i had some unusual gifts and also some

7215
04:03:50,719 --> 04:03:55,039
unusual difficulties

7216
04:03:52,000 --> 04:03:56,639
and i think it's useful for everybody to

7217
04:03:55,040 --> 04:03:57,760
know their path probably has both of

7218
04:03:56,639 --> 04:04:01,519
those

7219
04:03:57,760 --> 04:04:01,520
um but uh

7220
04:04:01,600 --> 04:04:05,520
if i was to say kind of at the essence

7221
04:04:03,439 --> 04:04:08,800
of one of the things my dad taught me

7222
04:04:05,520 --> 04:04:11,439
across a lot of lessons was like

7223
04:04:08,799 --> 04:04:13,278
a the intersection of self-empowerment

7224
04:04:11,439 --> 04:04:17,439
ideas and practices that

7225
04:04:13,279 --> 04:04:19,439
self-empower towards collective good

7226
04:04:17,439 --> 04:04:20,639
uh towards some virtuous purpose beyond

7227
04:04:19,439 --> 04:04:23,199
the self

7228
04:04:20,639 --> 04:04:24,879
and he both said that a million

7229
04:04:23,199 --> 04:04:26,159
different ways taught it in a million

7230
04:04:24,879 --> 04:04:27,679
different ways when we were doing

7231
04:04:26,159 --> 04:04:28,959
construction and he was teaching me how

7232
04:04:27,680 --> 04:04:32,238
to

7233
04:04:28,959 --> 04:04:33,919
build a house we were putting the wires

7234
04:04:32,238 --> 04:04:34,799
to the walls before the drywall went on

7235
04:04:33,920 --> 04:04:36,398
he made sure that

7236
04:04:34,799 --> 04:04:38,079
the way that we put the wires through

7237
04:04:36,398 --> 04:04:41,198
was beautiful like the

7238
04:04:38,079 --> 04:04:42,719
the that the

7239
04:04:41,199 --> 04:04:44,239
height of the holes was similar that we

7240
04:04:42,719 --> 04:04:44,719
twisted the wires in a particular way

7241
04:04:44,238 --> 04:04:46,000
that

7242
04:04:44,719 --> 04:04:48,478
and it's like no one's ever going to see

7243
04:04:46,000 --> 04:04:50,000
it and he's like if a job's worth doing

7244
04:04:48,478 --> 04:04:51,840
it's worth doing well and excellence is

7245
04:04:50,000 --> 04:04:53,279
its own reward and those types of ideas

7246
04:04:51,840 --> 04:04:54,960
and if there was a really shitty job to

7247
04:04:53,279 --> 04:04:56,479
do he'd say see the job do the job stay

7248
04:04:54,959 --> 04:04:58,879
out of the misery just don't indulge any

7249
04:04:56,478 --> 04:05:01,358
negativity do the things that need done

7250
04:04:58,879 --> 04:05:03,198
and so there's like a there's an

7251
04:05:01,359 --> 04:05:06,960
empowerment and a nobility

7252
04:05:03,199 --> 04:05:10,399
together um and

7253
04:05:06,959 --> 04:05:11,839
yeah extraordinarily fortunate

7254
04:05:10,398 --> 04:05:14,639
is there ways you think you could have

7255
04:05:11,840 --> 04:05:14,639
been a better son

7256
04:05:14,719 --> 04:05:19,278
is there things you regret it's an

7257
04:05:17,680 --> 04:05:22,559
interesting question

7258
04:05:19,279 --> 04:05:24,560
let me first say just as a bit of a

7259
04:05:22,559 --> 04:05:27,519
criticism

7260
04:05:24,559 --> 04:05:28,478
that uh what kind of man do you think

7261
04:05:27,520 --> 04:05:31,040
you are

7262
04:05:28,478 --> 04:05:33,278
not wearing a suit and tie a real man

7263
04:05:31,040 --> 04:05:33,279
should

7264
04:05:33,680 --> 04:05:38,238
exactly uh i agree with your dad at that

7265
04:05:36,079 --> 04:05:39,680
point you mentioned offline that uh he

7266
04:05:38,238 --> 04:05:44,079
suggested

7267
04:05:39,680 --> 04:05:46,000
a real man should wear a suit and tie

7268
04:05:44,079 --> 04:05:48,318
but outside of that is there ways you

7269
04:05:46,000 --> 04:05:50,079
could have been a better son

7270
04:05:48,318 --> 04:05:52,398
maybe next time on your show i'll wear a

7271
04:05:50,079 --> 04:05:56,719
suit and tie

7272
04:05:52,398 --> 04:05:56,719
my dad would be happy about that um

7273
04:05:56,840 --> 04:05:59,840
please

7274
04:06:12,398 --> 04:06:16,719
i can answer the question later in life

7275
04:06:14,799 --> 04:06:18,959
not early

7276
04:06:16,719 --> 04:06:20,238
um i had just a huge amount of respect

7277
04:06:18,959 --> 04:06:21,839
and reverence for my dad when i was

7278
04:06:20,238 --> 04:06:23,039
young so i was asking myself that

7279
04:06:21,840 --> 04:06:25,840
question

7280
04:06:23,040 --> 04:06:26,720
a lot so i learned a lot of things i

7281
04:06:25,840 --> 04:06:30,960
knew that i

7282
04:06:26,719 --> 04:06:30,959
wasn't seeking to apply um

7283
04:06:32,079 --> 04:06:37,920
there was a phase when i went through my

7284
04:06:34,559 --> 04:06:40,639
kind of individuation differentiation

7285
04:06:37,920 --> 04:06:42,478
where i had to make him excessively

7286
04:06:40,639 --> 04:06:47,358
wrong about too many things

7287
04:06:42,478 --> 04:06:49,599
um i don't think i had to but i did and

7288
04:06:47,359 --> 04:06:51,439
he had a lot of kind of non-standard

7289
04:06:49,600 --> 04:06:54,960
model beliefs about things

7290
04:06:51,439 --> 04:06:57,120
whether early

7291
04:06:54,959 --> 04:06:58,719
uh kind of ancient civilizations or

7292
04:06:57,120 --> 04:07:01,040
ideas on evolutionary theory or

7293
04:06:58,719 --> 04:07:04,799
alternate models of physics and

7294
04:07:01,040 --> 04:07:06,560
and um and

7295
04:07:04,799 --> 04:07:09,278
they weren't irrational but they didn't

7296
04:07:06,559 --> 04:07:13,039
all have the standard of

7297
04:07:09,279 --> 04:07:16,159
epistemic proof that i would need and

7298
04:07:13,040 --> 04:07:17,120
i went through and some of them were

7299
04:07:16,159 --> 04:07:20,559
kind of spiritual

7300
04:07:17,120 --> 04:07:23,040
ideas as well i went through a phase in

7301
04:07:20,559 --> 04:07:25,359
my early 20s

7302
04:07:23,040 --> 04:07:25,359
where

7303
04:07:26,079 --> 04:07:30,639
i kind of had the the attitude that

7304
04:07:29,040 --> 04:07:32,560
dawkins

7305
04:07:30,639 --> 04:07:36,000
or christopher hitchens has that can

7306
04:07:32,559 --> 04:07:38,238
kind of be um

7307
04:07:36,000 --> 04:07:39,439
like excessively certain and

7308
04:07:38,238 --> 04:07:42,158
sanctimonious

7309
04:07:39,439 --> 04:07:44,158
uh applying their reductionist

7310
04:07:42,158 --> 04:07:47,199
philosophy of science to everything and

7311
04:07:44,158 --> 04:07:51,840
um kind of brutally dismissive

7312
04:07:47,199 --> 04:07:51,840
uh i'm embarrassed by that phase

7313
04:07:52,639 --> 04:07:55,920
not to say anything about those men in

7314
04:07:54,158 --> 04:07:59,039
their path but

7315
04:07:55,920 --> 04:08:03,120
for myself and so during that time

7316
04:07:59,040 --> 04:08:04,479
i was more dismissive of my dad's

7317
04:08:03,120 --> 04:08:06,640
epistemology

7318
04:08:04,478 --> 04:08:07,760
than i would have liked to have been i

7319
04:08:06,639 --> 04:08:09,439
gotta correct that later

7320
04:08:07,760 --> 04:08:11,840
apologize for it but that's the first

7321
04:08:09,439 --> 04:08:14,639
thought that came to mind

7322
04:08:11,840 --> 04:08:14,960
you've written the following i've had

7323
04:08:14,639 --> 04:08:18,959
the

7324
04:08:14,959 --> 04:08:22,158
experience countless times making love

7325
04:08:18,959 --> 04:08:25,759
watching a sunset listening to music

7326
04:08:22,158 --> 04:08:26,559
feeling the breeze that i would sign up

7327
04:08:25,760 --> 04:08:29,920
for this

7328
04:08:26,559 --> 04:08:30,879
whole life and all of its pains just to

7329
04:08:29,920 --> 04:08:34,158
experience

7330
04:08:30,879 --> 04:08:37,039
this exact moment this is a kind of

7331
04:08:34,158 --> 04:08:38,959
worldless knowing

7332
04:08:37,040 --> 04:08:41,439
it's the most important and real truth i

7333
04:08:38,959 --> 04:08:44,478
know that experience itself

7334
04:08:41,439 --> 04:08:47,840
is infinitely meaningful and pain

7335
04:08:44,478 --> 04:08:50,478
is temporary and seen clearly

7336
04:08:47,840 --> 04:08:52,000
even the suffering is filled with beauty

7337
04:08:50,478 --> 04:08:54,639
i have experienced

7338
04:08:52,000 --> 04:08:56,158
countless lives worth of moments worthy

7339
04:08:54,639 --> 04:09:00,318
of life

7340
04:08:56,158 --> 04:09:02,158
such an unreasonable fortune

7341
04:09:00,318 --> 04:09:03,519
a few words of gratitude from you

7342
04:09:02,158 --> 04:09:06,000
beautifully written

7343
04:09:03,520 --> 04:09:06,640
is there some beautiful moments now you

7344
04:09:06,000 --> 04:09:09,040
have uh

7345
04:09:06,639 --> 04:09:10,238
experienced countless lives worth of

7346
04:09:09,040 --> 04:09:14,319
those moments

7347
04:09:10,238 --> 04:09:16,398
was there some things that um if you

7348
04:09:14,318 --> 04:09:18,879
could uh

7349
04:09:16,398 --> 04:09:20,879
in your darker moments you can go to to

7350
04:09:18,879 --> 04:09:22,478
relive to remind yourself that the whole

7351
04:09:20,879 --> 04:09:24,478
ride is worthwhile

7352
04:09:22,478 --> 04:09:27,278
maybe skip the making love part we don't

7353
04:09:24,478 --> 04:09:27,278
i know about that

7354
04:09:27,680 --> 04:09:36,559
i mean i i feel i feel unreasonably

7355
04:09:31,840 --> 04:09:40,840
fortunate that

7356
04:09:36,559 --> 04:09:44,478
it is a such a humongous list

7357
04:09:40,840 --> 04:09:47,040
because i mean i feel fortunate to have

7358
04:09:44,478 --> 04:09:48,478
like had exposure to practices and

7359
04:09:47,040 --> 04:09:49,840
philosophies and way of seeing things

7360
04:09:48,478 --> 04:09:51,438
that makes me see things that way

7361
04:09:49,840 --> 04:09:53,040
so i can take responsibility for seeing

7362
04:09:51,439 --> 04:09:55,120
things in that way

7363
04:09:53,040 --> 04:09:56,560
and not taking for granted really

7364
04:09:55,120 --> 04:09:57,760
wonderful things but i can't take

7365
04:09:56,559 --> 04:09:59,119
credit for being exposed to the

7366
04:09:57,760 --> 04:10:00,719
philosophies that even gave me that

7367
04:09:59,120 --> 04:10:04,800
possibility

7368
04:10:00,719 --> 04:10:08,719
um you know it's not just

7369
04:10:04,799 --> 04:10:10,238
with my wife it's with

7370
04:10:08,719 --> 04:10:11,760
every person who i really love when

7371
04:10:10,238 --> 04:10:14,238
we're talking i look at their face

7372
04:10:11,760 --> 04:10:15,120
i in the context of a conversation feel

7373
04:10:14,238 --> 04:10:18,000
overwhelmed by

7374
04:10:15,120 --> 04:10:19,439
how lucky i am to get to know them and

7375
04:10:18,000 --> 04:10:20,639
like that there's never been someone

7376
04:10:19,439 --> 04:10:22,158
like them in all of history

7377
04:10:20,639 --> 04:10:23,439
and there never will be again and they

7378
04:10:22,158 --> 04:10:24,879
might be gone tomorrow i might be gone

7379
04:10:23,439 --> 04:10:25,439
tomorrow and like i get this moment with

7380
04:10:24,879 --> 04:10:27,278
them

7381
04:10:25,439 --> 04:10:29,199
and when you take in the uniqueness of

7382
04:10:27,279 --> 04:10:32,319
that fully and the beauty of it it's

7383
04:10:29,199 --> 04:10:32,319
overwhelmingly beautiful

7384
04:10:33,439 --> 04:10:40,398
and i remember the first time

7385
04:10:36,478 --> 04:10:43,599
i did a big dose of mushrooms and

7386
04:10:40,398 --> 04:10:45,840
i was looking at a tree for a long time

7387
04:10:43,600 --> 04:10:47,279
and i was just crying with overwhelming

7388
04:10:45,840 --> 04:10:48,639
how beautiful the tree was and it was a

7389
04:10:47,279 --> 04:10:50,319
tree outside the front of my house that

7390
04:10:48,639 --> 04:10:53,358
i'd walk by a million times and never

7391
04:10:50,318 --> 04:10:53,840
looked at like this and it wasn't the

7392
04:10:53,359 --> 04:10:56,880
dose

7393
04:10:53,840 --> 04:10:58,960
of mushrooms where i was hallucinating

7394
04:10:56,879 --> 04:11:00,000
like where the tree was purple yeah like

7395
04:10:58,959 --> 04:11:01,599
the tree still looked like

7396
04:11:00,000 --> 04:11:03,120
if i had to describe it says green it

7397
04:11:01,600 --> 04:11:06,318
has leaves looks like this

7398
04:11:03,120 --> 04:11:08,479
but it's way [ __ ] more beautiful like

7399
04:11:06,318 --> 04:11:09,840
like capturing than it normally was and

7400
04:11:08,478 --> 04:11:11,840
i'm like why is it so beautiful if i

7401
04:11:09,840 --> 04:11:13,359
would describe it the same way

7402
04:11:11,840 --> 04:11:14,880
and i realized i had no thoughts taking

7403
04:11:13,359 --> 04:11:16,880
me anywhere else

7404
04:11:14,879 --> 04:11:18,398
yeah like what it seemed like the

7405
04:11:16,879 --> 04:11:19,679
mushrooms were doing was just actually

7406
04:11:18,398 --> 04:11:21,198
shutting the narrative off that would

7407
04:11:19,680 --> 04:11:22,559
have me be distracted so i could really

7408
04:11:21,199 --> 04:11:23,760
see the tree

7409
04:11:22,559 --> 04:11:24,879
and then i'm like [ __ ] when i get off

7410
04:11:23,760 --> 04:11:26,079
these mushrooms i'm going to practice

7411
04:11:24,879 --> 04:11:27,519
seeing the tree

7412
04:11:26,079 --> 04:11:29,600
because it's always that beautiful and i

7413
04:11:27,520 --> 04:11:31,040
just miss it and so i

7414
04:11:29,600 --> 04:11:33,359
practice being with it and quieting the

7415
04:11:31,040 --> 04:11:35,120
rest of the mind and then being like wow

7416
04:11:33,359 --> 04:11:37,120
and and if it's not mushrooms like

7417
04:11:35,120 --> 04:11:39,120
people have peak experiences

7418
04:11:37,120 --> 04:11:41,680
where they'll see life and how

7419
04:11:39,120 --> 04:11:44,079
incredible it is it's always there

7420
04:11:41,680 --> 04:11:46,158
it's funny that i had this exact same

7421
04:11:44,079 --> 04:11:48,719
experience

7422
04:11:46,158 --> 04:11:50,879
on quite a lot of mushrooms just sitting

7423
04:11:48,719 --> 04:11:52,719
alone and looking at a tree and exactly

7424
04:11:50,879 --> 04:11:55,119
as you described it

7425
04:11:52,719 --> 04:11:55,920
appreciating the undistorted beauty of

7426
04:11:55,120 --> 04:11:59,199
it

7427
04:11:55,920 --> 04:12:01,120
and it's funny to me that here's two

7428
04:11:59,199 --> 04:12:02,319
humans very different with very

7429
04:12:01,120 --> 04:12:04,399
different journeys

7430
04:12:02,318 --> 04:12:07,760
or at some moment in time both looking

7431
04:12:04,398 --> 04:12:10,000
at a tree like idiots for hours

7432
04:12:07,760 --> 04:12:12,000
and just in awe and and happy to be

7433
04:12:10,000 --> 04:12:14,318
alive in the end

7434
04:12:12,000 --> 04:12:15,680
even just that moment alone is is worth

7435
04:12:14,318 --> 04:12:19,198
living for but you did say

7436
04:12:15,680 --> 04:12:20,880
humans and uh we have a moment together

7437
04:12:19,199 --> 04:12:24,319
as two humans

7438
04:12:20,879 --> 04:12:25,759
and you mentioned shots well i have to

7439
04:12:24,318 --> 04:12:28,639
ask what uh what

7440
04:12:25,760 --> 04:12:30,559
what are we looking at when i went to go

7441
04:12:28,639 --> 04:12:32,318
get a smoothie before coming here i got

7442
04:12:30,559 --> 04:12:34,799
you a keto smoothie that you didn't want

7443
04:12:32,318 --> 04:12:36,719
because you're not just keto but fasting

7444
04:12:34,799 --> 04:12:38,079
but i saw the thing with you and your

7445
04:12:36,719 --> 04:12:39,920
dad where you did uh

7446
04:12:38,079 --> 04:12:41,120
shots together yeah and this place

7447
04:12:39,920 --> 04:12:44,719
happened to have shots

7448
04:12:41,120 --> 04:12:46,800
of um ginger turmeric cayenne

7449
04:12:44,719 --> 04:12:48,398
juice of some kind and so i was some

7450
04:12:46,799 --> 04:12:49,840
himalayan i didn't necessarily plan it

7451
04:12:48,398 --> 04:12:52,238
for being on the show

7452
04:12:49,840 --> 04:12:53,680
i just brought it wow but we can we can

7453
04:12:52,238 --> 04:12:55,439
do it that way i think we should we

7454
04:12:53,680 --> 04:12:58,960
shall uh

7455
04:12:55,439 --> 04:13:01,760

7456
04:12:58,959 --> 04:13:03,198
it's a huge host what do we toast to we

7457
04:13:01,760 --> 04:13:05,439
toast to this moment

7458
04:13:03,199 --> 04:13:06,800
this this this unique moment that we get

7459
04:13:05,439 --> 04:13:08,238
to share together

7460
04:13:06,799 --> 04:13:10,238
i'm very grateful to be here in this

7461
04:13:08,238 --> 04:13:11,600
moment with you and uh

04:13:10,238 --> 04:13:14,719
yeah i'm grateful that you invited me

7463
04:13:11,600 --> 04:13:17,520
here we met for the first time

7464
04:13:14,719 --> 04:13:18,719
and i will never be the same for the

7465
04:13:17,520 --> 04:13:21,279
good and the bad

7466
04:13:18,719 --> 04:13:21,278
the i am

7467
04:13:22,719 --> 04:13:26,318
that is really interesting that feels

7468
04:13:24,639 --> 04:13:29,920
way healthier than the vodka

7469
04:13:26,318 --> 04:13:31,840
my dad and i were drinking so i feel

7470
04:13:29,920 --> 04:13:33,520
like a better man already daniel this is

7471
04:13:31,840 --> 04:13:34,000
one of the best conversations i've ever

7472
04:13:33,520 --> 04:13:36,880
had

7473
04:13:34,000 --> 04:13:37,840
i can't wait to have many more likewise

7474
04:13:36,879 --> 04:13:39,119
this is uh

7475
04:13:37,840 --> 04:13:40,880
it's been an amazing experience thank

7476
04:13:39,120 --> 04:13:42,000
you for wasting all your time today i

7477
04:13:40,879 --> 04:13:44,799
want to say

7478
04:13:42,000 --> 04:13:46,318
in terms of what you're mentioning about

7479
04:13:44,799 --> 04:13:49,278
like the

7480
04:13:46,318 --> 04:13:49,840
that you work in machine learning and

7481
04:13:49,279 --> 04:13:52,479
the

7482
04:13:49,840 --> 04:13:53,680
optimism that wants to look at the

7483
04:13:52,478 --> 04:13:55,599
issues but wants to

7484
04:13:53,680 --> 04:13:57,680
look at how this increased technological

7485
04:13:55,600 --> 04:13:59,920
power could be applied to solving them

7486
04:13:57,680 --> 04:14:01,600
and that even thinking about the

7487
04:13:59,920 --> 04:14:03,760
broadcast of like

7488
04:14:01,600 --> 04:14:05,359
can i help people understand the issues

7489
04:14:03,760 --> 04:14:07,520
better and help organize them

7490
04:14:05,359 --> 04:14:09,279
like fundamentally you're you're

7491
04:14:07,520 --> 04:14:12,479
oriented like wikipedia

7492
04:14:09,279 --> 04:14:13,840
what i see to really try to tend to the

7493
04:14:12,478 --> 04:14:15,760
information commons

7494
04:14:13,840 --> 04:14:17,760
without another agentic interest

7495
04:14:15,760 --> 04:14:21,279
distorting it

7496
04:14:17,760 --> 04:14:23,279
and for you to be able to get guys like

7497
04:14:21,279 --> 04:14:25,279
lee smallin and roger penrose and like

7498
04:14:23,279 --> 04:14:28,000
the the greatest thinkers of

7499
04:14:25,279 --> 04:14:28,800
that are alive and you know have them on

7500
04:14:28,000 --> 04:14:30,238
the show

7501
04:14:28,799 --> 04:14:31,679
and most people would never be exposed

7502
04:14:30,238 --> 04:14:33,680
to them and talk about it in a way that

7503
04:14:31,680 --> 04:14:35,600
people can understand

7504
04:14:33,680 --> 04:14:36,720
uh i think it's an incredible service i

7505
04:14:35,600 --> 04:14:39,199
think you're doing great work

7506
04:14:36,719 --> 04:14:41,119
