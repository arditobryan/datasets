00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,720
jordan ellenberg a mathematician

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,040
at university of wisconsin and an author

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:09,439
who

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,480
masterfully reveals the beauty and power

6
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,759
of mathematics

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,480
in his 2014 book how not to be wrong

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,960
in his new book just released recently

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,600
called

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,480
shape the hidden geometry of information

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,359
biology

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,359
strategy democracy and everything else

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,480
quick mention of our sponsors

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,640
secret sauce expressvpn blinkist

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,039
and indeed check them out in the

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,960
description to support this podcast

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,320
as a side note let me say that geometry

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,280
is what made me fall in love with

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,920
mathematics

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,760
when i was young it first showed me that

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,480
something definitive could be stated

22
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,439
about this

23
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,159
world through intuitive visual proofs

24
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,320
somehow

25
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,279
that convinced me that math is not just

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,238
abstract numbers

27
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,359
devoid of life but a part of life part

28
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,238
of this world

29
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,479
part of our search for meaning this is

30
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,358
the lex friedman podcast and here is my

31
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,718
conversation

32
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,760
with jordan ellenberg if the brain is a

33
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,560
cake

34
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,438
it is well let's just let's go with me

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,359
on this okay okay

36
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:15,279
we'll pause it so for noam chomsky

37
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,959
language the universal grammar

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,879
the framework from which language

39
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,039
springs is like

40
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,280
most of the cake the delicious chocolate

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,680
center and then the rest of

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,799
cognition that we think of is built on

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
top

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,479
extra layers maybe the icing on the cake

45
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,078
maybe just

46
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,159
maybe consciousness is just like a

47
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,078
cherry on top

48
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,920
where do you put in this cake

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,959
mathematical thinking

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,680
is it as fundamental as language in the

51
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,559
chomsky

52
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,479
view is it more fundamental in language

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,399
is it echoes of the same kind of

54
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,759
abstract framework that he's thinking

55
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,159
about in terms of language that they're

56
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,879
all

57
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,240
like really tightly interconnected

58
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,920
that's a really interesting

59
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,158
question you're getting me to reflect on

60
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,960
this question of whether the feeling of

61
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,680
producing mathematical output if you

62
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,919
want

63
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,960
is like the process of you know uttering

64
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,038
language or producing linguistic output

65
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,478
i think it feels something like that and

66
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,839
it's certainly the case

67
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,640
let me put it this way it's hard to

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,280
imagine doing mathematics in a

69
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,598
completely non-linguistic way

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,800
it's hard to imagine doing mathematics

71
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,318
without

72
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,319
talking about mathematics and sort of

73
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:26,000
thinking in propositions but you know

74
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,679
maybe it's just because that's the way i

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,520
do mathematics so maybe i can't imagine

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,719
it any other way right it's a

77
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,599
well what about visualizing shapes

78
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,080
visualizing concepts to which language

79
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,199
is not

80
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,480
obviously attachable ah that's a really

81
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,839
interesting question and

82
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,518
you know one thing it reminds me of is

83
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
one thing i talk about uh

84
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,439
in the book is dissection proofs these

85
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,399
very beautiful proofs of geometric

86
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,479
propositions

87
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,840
um there's a very famous one by bhaskara

88
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,799
of the the pythagorean theorem

89
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,319
proofs which are purely visual proofs

90
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,560
where you show that

91
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,679
two quantities are the same by taking

92
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,400
the same pieces

93
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,360
and putting them together one way uh and

94
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,280
making one shape

95
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,560
and putting them together another way

96
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,080
and making a different shape and then

97
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,519
observing those two shapes must have the

98
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,400
same area because they were built out of

99
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,800
the same

100
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,599
pieces um you know there's a there's a

101
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
famous

102
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,518
story and it's a little bit disputed

103
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,119
about how accurate this is but that in

104
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,560
bhaskara's manuscript he sort of gives

105
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
this proof just gives the diagram and

106
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,759
then the

107
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,039
the entire uh verbal content of the

108
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,399
proof is he just writes under it

109
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,798
behold like that's it it's like

110
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,080
um there's some dispute about exactly

111
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,519
how accurate that is but

112
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
so then that's an interesting question

113
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,759
um if your proof

114
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,360
is a diagram if your proof is a picture

115
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,959
or even if your proof is like a movie of

116
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,080
the same pieces like coming together in

117
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,200
two different formations to make two

118
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,239
different things is that

119
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,878
language i'm not sure i have a good

120
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,599
answer what do you think i think it is

121
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:55,840
i think the process of manipulating

122
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,798
the visual elements is the same as the

123
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,360
process of

124
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,000
manipulating the elements of language

125
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,159
and i think

126
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,639
probably the manipulating the

127
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,158
aggregation the stitching stuff together

128
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,318
is the important part it's not the

129
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,479
actual specific elements it's more

130
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,719
more like to me language is a process

131
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:16,719
and math is a process it's not a

132
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:20,720
it's not just specific symbols it's uh

133
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,600
it's in action it's it's ultimately

134
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,600
created through action through change

135
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,160
and uh so you're constantly evolving

136
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
ideas

137
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,840
of course we kind of attach there's a

138
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,918
certain destination you arrive to that

139
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,599
you attach to and you call that a proof

140
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,519
but that's not that doesn't need to end

141
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,879
there it's just at the end of the

142
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,359
chapter and then it goes on

143
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,279
and on and on in that kind of way but i

144
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,080
got to ask you about geometry and it's a

145
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,478
prominent

146
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:48,478
topic in your new book shape so for me

147
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,639
geometry is the thing just like as

148
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,199
you're saying made me fall in love with

149
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,040
mathematics when i was young

150
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,720
so being able to prove something

151
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,840
visually

152
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,479
just did something to my brain that

153
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,879
it had this it planted this hopeful seed

154
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,079
that

155
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,199
you can understand the world like

156
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,879
perfectly

157
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,319
maybe it's an ocd thing but from a

158
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,639
mathematics perspective

159
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,399
like humans are messy the world is messy

160
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,400
biology is messy

161
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,439
your parents are yelling or making you

162
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,519
do stuff but

163
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,199
you know you can cut through all that bs

164
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,240
and truly understand the world through

165
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,199
mathematics and

166
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,918
nothing like geometry did that for me

167
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,160
for you

168
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,839
you did not immediately fall in love

169
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,960
with geometry so

170
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,918
uh how do you how do you think about

171
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,638
geometry

172
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,758
why is it a special field in mathematics

173
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,280
and

174
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,439
how did you fall in love with it if you

175
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,079
have wow you've given me like a lot to

176
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,360
say and

177
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,599
certainly the experience that you

178
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,680
describe is so

179
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,120
typical but there's two versions of it

180
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
um you know one thing i say in the book

181
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,959
is that geometry is the cilantro of math

182
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,039
people are not neutral about it there's

183
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,478
people who are like who like you

184
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,318
are like the rest of it i could take or

185
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,318
leave but then at this one moment

186
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,680
it made sense this class made sense why

187
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,280
wasn't it all like that there's other

188
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
people i can tell you because they come

189
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,638
and talk to me all the time

190
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,000
who are like i understood all the stuff

191
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,199
we were trying to figure out what x was

192
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,720
there's some mystery or trying to solve

193
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,160
it x is a number i figured it out but

194
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,800
then there was this geometry like what

195
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,000
was that

196
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,439
what happened that year like i didn't

197
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,038
get it i was like lost the whole year

198
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,079
and i didn't understand like why we even

199
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,399
spent the time doing that

200
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,079
so um but what everybody agrees on is

201
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,758
that it's somehow different

202
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,599
right there's something special about it

203
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,720
um

204
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,400
we're gonna walk around in circles a

205
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,280
little bit but we'll get there you asked

206
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,560
me

207
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,079
um how i fell in love with math i have a

208
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,079
story about this

209
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:39,439
um when i was a

210
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,839
small child i don't know maybe like i

211
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,519
was six or seven i don't know um

212
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,038
i'm from the 70s i think you're from a

213
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,000
different decade than that but you know

214
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,478
in the 70s we

215
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,038
had them you had a cool wooden box

216
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:50,478
around your

217
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:52,478
stereo that was the look everything was

218
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,439
dark wood uh and the box had a bunch of

219
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,560
holes in it

220
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,279
to lift the sound out yeah um and the

221
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,519
holes

222
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,038
were in this rectangular array a six by

223
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,038
eight array

224
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,800
um of holes and i was just kind of like

225
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,918
you know zoning out in the living room

226
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
as kids do

227
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,758
looking at this six by eight rectangular

228
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,840
array of holes

229
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,360
and if you like just by kind of like

230
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,959
focusing in and out just by kind of

231
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,560
looking at this box looking at this

232
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,680
rectangle

233
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,680
i was like well there's six rows of

234
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,240
eight holes each

235
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,519
but there's also eight columns of six

236
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,038
holes each

237
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,519
whoa so eight sixes and six eighths it's

238
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:30,478
just like the

239
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,478
section bruce you were just talking

240
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,240
about but it's the same holes it's the

241
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:35,918
same 48 holes that's how many there are

242
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,079
no matter of whether you count them

243
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,439
as rows or count them as columns and

244
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,240
this was like

245
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,598
unbelievable to me am i allowed to cost

246
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,199
on your podcast i don't know if that's

247
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,120
uh we fcc regulated

248
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,478
okay it was [ __ ] unbelievable okay

249
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,519
that's the last time get it in this

250
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,680
story merits it

251
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,159
so two different perspectives and the

252
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,079
same physical reality

253
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,240
exactly and it's just as you say um

254
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,079
you know i knew that 6 times 8 was the

255
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,478
same as 8 times 6 when i knew my times

256
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,159
table like i knew that that was a fact

257
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,318
but did i really know it until that

258
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,840
moment that's the question

259
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,439
right i knew that i sort of knew that

260
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,198
the times table was symmetric

261
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,560
but i didn't know why that was the case

262
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,000
until that moment and in that moment i

263
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,519
could see like oh i didn't have to have

264
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,879
somebody tell me that

265
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,120
that's information that you can just

266
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,560
directly access that's a really amazing

267
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,598
moment and as math teachers that's

268
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,240
something that we're really trying to

269
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,240
bring

270
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,478
to our students and i was one of those

271
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,280
who did not love the kind of euclidean

272
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:31,918
geometry

273
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,439
ninth grade class of like prove that an

274
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,038
isosceles triangle has

275
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
equal angles at the base like this kind

276
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:38,399
of thing it didn't vibe with me the way

277
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,560
that algebra and numbers did

278
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,240
um but if you go back to that moment

279
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,598
from my adult perspective looking back

280
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,519
at what happened with that rectangle i

281
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,200
think that is a very geometric moment in

282
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,480
fact that moment

283
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,959
exactly encapsulates the

284
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,000
the intertwining of algebra and geometry

285
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,559
this algebraic

286
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,240
fact that well in the instance 8 times 6

287
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,838
is equal to 6 times 8 but

288
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,519
in general that whatever two numbers you

289
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,800
have you multiply them one way and it's

290
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,639
the same as if you multiply them in the

291
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,639
other order

292
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,480
it attaches it to this geometric fact

293
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,319
about a rectangle which in some sense

294
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,440
makes it true so you know who knows

295
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,120
maybe i was always faded to be an

296
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,760
algebraic geometer which is what i am as

297
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,240
a

298
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,200
as a researcher so that's the kind of

299
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,159
transformation

300
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,519
and you talk about symmetry in your book

301
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,879
what the heck is symmetry

302
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,879
what the heck is these kinds of

303
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,320
transformation on objects that uh once

304
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,278
you transform them they seem to be

305
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,040
similar

306
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,480
uh what do you make of it what's its use

307
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:35,199
in mathematics or

308
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,800
maybe broadly in understanding our world

309
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,720
well it's an absolutely fundamental

310
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,958
concept and it starts with the word

311
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,839
symmetry in the way that we usually use

312
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,958
it when we're just like

313
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,560
talking english and not talking

314
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,799
mathematics right sort of something is

315
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,719
when we say something is symmetrical

316
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,000
we usually means it has what's called an

317
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,680
axis of symmetry maybe

318
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,679
like the left half of it looks the same

319
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,278
as the right half that would be like a

320
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:56,879
left-right axis of symmetry or maybe the

321
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,399
top half looks like the bottom half

322
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,759
or both right maybe there's sort of a

323
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,039
four-fold symmetry where the top looks

324
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,958
like the bottom and the left looks like

325
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,480
the right

326
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,199
or more and that can take you in a lot

327
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,360
of different directions the abstract

328
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,879
study of what the possible combinations

329
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,639
of symmetries there are a subject which

330
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,799
is called group theory was actually

331
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,480
um one of my first loves in mathematics

332
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,679
what i thought about a lot when i was

333
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,159
in college but the notion of symmetry is

334
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,919
actually

335
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,360
much more general than the things that

336
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,879
we would call symmetry if we were

337
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,240
looking at like a classical

338
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,120
building or a painting or or something

339
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,320
like that

340
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,440
um you know nowadays in

341
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,640
in math um

342
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,440
we could use a symmetry to to refer to

343
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,519
any kind of transformation of an image

344
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,360
or a space or an object

345
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,919
you know so what i talk about in in the

346
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,480
book is

347
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,679
take a figure and stretch it vertically

348
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,159
make it twice as

349
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,199
make it twice as big vertically and make

350
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,000
it

351
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,000
half as wide

352
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,199
that i would call a symmetry it's not a

353
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,600
symmetry in the classical sense

354
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
but it's a well-defined transformation

355
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,920
that

356
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,839
has an input and an output i give you

357
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,360
some shape um

358
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,640
and it gets kind of i call this in the

359
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,079
book of scronch i just made it had to

360
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,120
make up some sort of funny sounding

361
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,519
name for it because it doesn't really

362
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,360
have um

363
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,799
a name um and just as you can sort of

364
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,680
study which kinds of objects are

365
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:25,519
symmetrical

366
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,439
under the operations of switching left

367
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,519
and right or switching top and bottom

368
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,200
or rotating 40 degrees or what have you

369
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,879
you could study what kinds of things are

370
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,480
preserved by

371
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,240
this kind of scratch symmetry and this

372
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,320
kind of

373
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,399
more general idea of what a symmetry can

374
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,680
be um

375
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,200
let me put it this way um a fundamental

376
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,958
mathematical idea

377
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,120
in some sense i might even say the idea

378
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,479
that dominates contemporary mathematics

379
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,399
or by contemporary by the way i mean

380
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,759
like the last like 150 years we're on a

381
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,039
very long time scale

382
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,600
in math i don't mean like yesterday i

383
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,519
mean like a century or so

384
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,720
up till now is this idea that's a

385
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,919
fundamental question of

386
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,959
when do we consider two things to be the

387
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,919
same

388
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,799
that might seem like a complete

389
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,439
triviality it's not for instance

390
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,799
if i have a triangle and i have a

391
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,079
triangle of the exact same dimensions

392
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,359
but it's over here

393
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,479
um are those the same or different well

394
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
you might say like well look there's two

395
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
different things this one's over here

396
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,079
this one's over there

397
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
on the other hand if you prove a theorem

398
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,519
about this one

399
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,200
it's probably still true about this one

400
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,639
if it has like all the same side lanes

401
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,278
and angles and like looks exactly the

402
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,720
same

403
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,639
the term of art if you want it you would

404
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,240
say they're congruent

405
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,000
but one way of saying it is there's a

406
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,560
symmetry called translation which just

407
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,639
means

408
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,078
move everything three inches to the left

409
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,480
and we want

410
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,278
all of our theories to be translation

411
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
invariant

412
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,720
what that means is that if you prove a

413
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,319
theorem about a thing if it's over here

414
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,879
and then you move it three inches to the

415
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,120
left it would be kind of weird if all of

416
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,439
your theorems like didn't still

417
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
work so this question of like what are

418
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,760
the symmetries

419
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,518
and which things that you want to study

420
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,639
or invariant under those symmetries is

421
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,919
absolutely fundamental but this is

422
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,278
getting a little abstract right

423
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,240
it's not at all abstract i think this

424
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,078
this this is completely central

425
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,600
to everything i think about in terms of

426
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:12,239
artificial intelligence i don't know if

427
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,399
you know about

428
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
the mnist dataset with handwritten

429
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,159
digits yeah

430
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,799
and uh you know i don't smoke much weed

431
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,240
or any really but it certainly feels

432
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,240
like it when i look at eminence and

433
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,600
think about this stuff which is like

434
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,560
what's the difference between one and

435
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,839
two and why are all the twos

436
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,399
similar to each other what kind of

437
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,839
transformations

438
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,120
are within the category of what makes a

439
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,720
thing the same

440
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
and what kind of transformations are

441
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,120
those that make it different

442
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,639
and symmetries core to that in fact our

443
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,519
whatever the hell our brain is doing

444
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,000
it's really good at constructing these

445
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,959
arbitrary and sometimes novel which is

446
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,919
really important

447
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,439
when you look at like the iq test or

448
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:01,198
they feel novel

449
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,000
uh ideas of symmetry of like what like

450
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,958
playing with objects we're able to see

451
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,360
things that are the same and not

452
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,719
and uh construct almost like little

453
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,720
geometric

454
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,800
theories of what makes things the same

455
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,079
and not and how to make

456
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,958
uh programs do that in ai is a total

457
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,039
open question

458
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:25,919
and so i kind of stared and wonder

459
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,879
how what kind of symmetries are enough

460
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,319
to solve

461
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,159
the mnist handwritten digit recognition

462
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,760
problem and write that down

463
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,278
and exactly and what's so fascinating

464
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,120
about the work in that direction

465
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,360
from the point of view of a

466
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,919
mathematician like me and a geometer

467
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,360
um is that the kind of groups and of

468
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,240
symmetries the types of symmetries that

469
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,159
we know of

470
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,440
um are not sufficient right so in other

471
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,719
words like

472
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,199
we're just going to keep on going with

473
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,920
the weeds on this

474
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,359
the deeper the better you know a kind of

475
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,078
symmetry that we understand very well is

476
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,839
rotation

477
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,759
yeah right so here's what would be easy

478
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,079
if if if humans

479
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,000
if we recognize the digit as a one if it

480
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,439
was like literally a rotation by some

481
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,799
number of degrees of some

482
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,320
fixed one in some typeface like palatino

483
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,759
or something

484
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,120
that would be very easy to understand

485
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,159
right it would be very easy to like

486
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,679
write a program that

487
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,278
could detect whether something was a

488
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:20,799
rotation

489
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,240
of a fixed net digit one um whatever

490
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,679
we're doing when you recognize the digit

491
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
one and distinguish it from the digit

492
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,638
two

493
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,920
it's not that it's not just

494
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,720
incorporating

495
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,439
uh one of the types of symmetries that

496
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,639
we

497
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,120
understand now i would say that

498
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,759
i would be shocked if there was some

499
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,600
kind of

500
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,600
classical symmetry type formulation that

501
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,600
captured what we're doing when we tell

502
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
the difference between a two and a three

503
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,199
to be honest i think i think what we're

504
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,639
doing is actually more

505
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,519
complicated than that i feel like it

506
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,240
must be they're so simple these numbers

507
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,240
i mean they're

508
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,480
really geometric objects like we can

509
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,399
draw out one two three

510
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,560
it does seem like it's it should be

511
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,480
formalizable that's why it's so

512
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,159
strange you think it's formalizable when

513
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,519
something stops being a two and starts

514
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,120
being a three right you can imagine

515
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,039
something continuously deforming from

516
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,278
being a two to a three

517
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:17,519
yeah but that's there is a moment

518
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,639
i have uh myself have written programs

519
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,679
that literally morph

520
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,839
twos and threes and so on and you watch

521
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,838
and there is moments that you notice

522
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,800
depending on the trajectory of that

523
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,079
transformation

524
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,639
that morphing that

525
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,439
it uh it is a three and a two there's a

526
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,039
hard line

527
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,040
wait so if you ask people if you show

528
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,559
them this morph if you ask a bunch of

529
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,120
people do they all agree about where the

530
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,159
transformation

531
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,320
i'm questioning because i would be

532
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,600
surprised i think so oh my god okay we

533
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,480
have an empirical but here's the problem

534
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,519
dude

535
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,560
here's the problem that if i just showed

536
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,360
that moment that i agreed on

537
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,679
well that's not fair no but say i said

538
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,959
so

539
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,799
i want to move away from the agreement

540
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,638
because that's a fascinating uh actually

541
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,599
question that i want to

542
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,360
backtrack from because i just

543
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,400
dogmatically said uh because

544
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,360
i could be very very wrong but the

545
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,839
morphing really helps that like the

546
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,359
change

547
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,599
because i mean partially because our

548
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,038
perception systems see this it's all

549
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,918
probably tied in there

550
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,679
somehow the change from one to the other

551
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,600
like seeing the video of it

552
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
allows you to pinpoint the place where

553
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,480
two becomes a three much better

554
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,198
if i just showed you one picture i think

555
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,319
uh

556
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,038
you you might you might really

557
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,079
really struggle you might call a seven

558
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:37,440
like

559
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:39,359
i i think there's something uh also that

560
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,600
we don't often think about which is

561
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,119
it's not just about the static image

562
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,439
it's the transformation

563
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,519
of the image or it's not a static shape

564
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,320
it's the transformation of the shape

565
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,519
there's something in the movement that's

566
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,599
seems to be

567
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,440
not just about our perception system but

568
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,079
fundamental to our cognition like how we

569
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,880
think stuff

570
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,079
about stuff yeah and it's so and and you

571
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,400
know that's part of geometry

572
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,240
too and in fact again another insight of

573
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,000
modern geometry is this idea that

574
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,519
you know maybe we would naively think

575
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
we're going to study

576
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,519
i don't know let's you know like

577
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,960
poincare we're going to study the

578
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,319
three-body problem we're going to study

579
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,400
sort of like three

580
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,759
objects in space moving around subject

581
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,519
only to the force of each other's

582
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,640
gravity which sounds very simple right

583
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,679
and if you don't know about this problem

584
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,799
you're probably like okay so you just

585
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,798
like put it in your computer and see

586
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,798
what they do well guess what that's like

587
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,240
a problem that poincare won a huge prize

588
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,359
for like making the first real progress

589
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,519
on in the 1880s

590
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,479
and we still don't know that much about

591
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,759
it

592
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,160
um 150 years later i mean it's a

593
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,200
humongous mystery you just open the door

594
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,679
and we're going to

595
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,880
walk right in before we return to uh

596
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,759
symmetry

597
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,440
what's the uh who's ponca and what's uh

598
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,480
what's this conjecture that he came up

599
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,880
with

600
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
oh why is this such a hard problem okay

601
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,240
so poincare

602
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,599
he ends up being a major figure in the

603
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,038
book and i don't i didn't even really

604
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,000
intend for him to be such a big figure

605
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,279
but he's so

606
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,200
he's um he's first and foremost a

607
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,558
geometer right so he's a mathematician

608
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,080
who kind of comes up

609
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:08,319
in late 19th century france

610
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,759
um at a time when french math was really

611
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,000
starting to flower actually i learned a

612
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,279
lot

613
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,960
i mean you know in math we're not really

614
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,639
trained on our own history when we get a

615
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,120
phd in math one about math so i learned

616
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,160
a lot

617
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,759
there's this whole kind of moment where

618
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,080
france has just been

619
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,440
beaten in the franco-prussian war and

620
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,480
they're like oh my god what did we do

621
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,640
wrong and they were like

622
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,000
we got to get strong in math like the

623
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,520
germans we have to be like more like the

624
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
germans so this never happens to us

625
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:31,839
again so it's very much

626
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,360
it's like the sputnik moment you know

627
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,319
like what happens in america in the 50s

628
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,519
and 60s

629
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,200
uh with the soviet union this is

630
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,480
happening to france and they're trying

631
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,720
to kind of like

632
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,759
instantly like modernize that that's

633
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,200
fascinating

634
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,519
the humans and mathematics are

635
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,720
intricately connected to the history

636
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:51,759
of humans the cold war is

637
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,079
uh i think fundamental to the way people

638
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,119
saw

639
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,000
science and math in the soviet union i

640
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,519
don't know if that was true in the

641
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,400
united states but certainly was in the

642
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,599
soviet union

643
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,960
it definitely was and i would love to

644
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,439
hear more about how it was in the soviet

645
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,679
union

646
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,880
i mean there's uh and we'll talk about

647
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,840
the the olympia

648
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,679
i just remember that there was this

649
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:14,319
feeling

650
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:17,679
like the world hung in a balance

651
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:20,240
and you could save the world

652
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,280
with the tools of science and

653
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,558
mathematics

654
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:27,678
was like the super power

655
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:30,558
that fuels science and so like

656
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,798
people were seen as you know people in

657
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,960
america often idolize athletes

658
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,879
but ultimately the best athletes in the

659
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,919
world

660
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,480
they just throw a ball into a basket

661
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,840
so like there's not what people really

662
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,120
enjoy about sports

663
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,480
and i love sports is like excellence at

664
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,158
the highest level

665
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,400
but when you take that with mathematics

666
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,159
and science people also enjoyed

667
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,280
excellence in science and mathematics

668
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,760
and the soviet union

669
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,720
but there's an extra sense that that

670
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,480
excellence would

671
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:06,640
lead to a better world so

672
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,400
that created uh all the usual things you

673
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,440
you think about with the olympics which

674
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,400
is like

675
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,320
extreme competitiveness right but it

676
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,320
also created this sense that

677
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,079
in the modern era in america somebody

678
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,000
like elon musk

679
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,359
whatever you think of them like jeff

680
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,519
bezos those folks

681
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,399
they inspire the possibility that one

682
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,319
person

683
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,519
or a group of smart people can change

684
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,279
the world like

685
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,639
not just be good at what they do but

686
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,038
actually change the world

687
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,080
mathematics is at the core of that uh

688
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,480
and i don't know

689
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,079
there's a romanticism around it too like

690
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,640
when you read uh books about

691
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,480
in america people romanticize certain

692
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,200
things like baseball for example

693
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,000
there's like these beautiful poetic uh

694
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,480
writing about

695
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
the game of baseball the same was the

696
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,599
feeling with mathematics

697
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,119
and science in the soviet union and it

698
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,158
was it was in the air

699
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,079
everybody was forced to take high-level

700
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,039
mathematics courses like they you took a

701
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,038
lot of math

702
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,119
you took a lot of science and a lot of

703
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,839
like really rigorous literature

704
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,479
like they the the level of education in

705
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,720
russia

706
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,960
this could be true in china i'm not sure

707
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,000
uh in a lot of countries

708
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,120
is uh in um whatever that's called

709
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,919
it's k-12 in america but like young

710
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,798
people education the level they were

711
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,919
challenged

712
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:27,918
to to learn at is incredible it's like

713
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,080
america falls far behind i would say

714
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,280
america then quickly catches up and then

715
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,759
exceeds everybody else

716
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,279
at the like the as you start approaching

717
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,640
the end of high school to college

718
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,200
like the university system in the united

719
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:43,520
states arguably is the best in the world

720
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,600
but like what what we uh challenge

721
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,798
everybody it's not just like the good

722
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,879
the ace students but

723
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,079
everybody to learn in in the soviet

724
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,520
union was fascinating

725
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,279
i think i'm gonna pick up on something

726
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:53,839
you said i think you would love a book

727
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,879
called

728
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,839
duel at dawn by amir alexander which

729
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,919
i think some of the things you're

730
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,678
responding to what i wrote i think i

731
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,960
first got turned on to by amir's work

732
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,280
he's a historian of math

733
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,960
and he writes about the story of every

734
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,720
east galwa which is a story that's well

735
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,000
known to all mathematicians this kind of

736
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,240
like

737
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,798
very very romantic figure who

738
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,839
he really sort of like begins the

739
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:19,119
development of this

740
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,279
well this theory of groups that i

741
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:24,079
mentioned earlier this general

742
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:26,000
theory of symmetries um and then dies in

743
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,038
a duel in his early 20s like all this

744
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,038
stuff

745
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,480
mostly unpublished it's a very very

746
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:33,919
romantic story that we all

747
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,519
learn um and much of it is true but

748
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,400
alexander really lays out just how much

749
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:40,480
the way people

750
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,320
thought about math in those times in the

751
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,400
early 19th century

752
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,599
was wound up with as you say romanticism

753
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,919
i mean that's when the romantic

754
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:48,879
movement takes place and he really

755
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,440
outlines how

756
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,960
people were were predisposed to think

757
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,240
about mathematics in that way because

758
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,600
they thought about poetry that way and

759
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,599
they thought about music that way

760
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,199
it was the mood of the era to think

761
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,798
about we're reaching for the

762
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,440
transcendent we're sort of reaching for

763
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:03,759
sort of direct

764
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,519
contact with the divine and so part of

765
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,919
the reason that we think of gawa that

766
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,000
way

767
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,240
was because gawa himself was a creature

768
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,759
of that era and he romanticized himself

769
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,440
yeah i mean now now you know he like

770
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,000
wrote lots of letters and like he was

771
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,278
kind of like

772
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,159
i mean in modern terms we would say he

773
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,679
was extremely emo like that's

774
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,520
like just we wrote all these letters

775
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,640
about his like floored feelings and like

776
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,158
the fire within him about the

777
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,360
mathematics and you know so he

778
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,520
so it's just as you say that

779
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,959
the math history touches human history

780
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,278
they're never separate because

781
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,000
math is made of people yeah i mean

782
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:35,759
that's what it's

783
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,200
it's it's people who do it and we're

784
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:38,240
human beings doing it and we do it

785
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,159
within whatever

786
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,440
community we're in and we do it affected

787
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,120
by uh

788
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,480
the morals of the society around us so

789
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,879
the french the germans and the

790
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,519
pancreatic yes okay so back to ponca ray

791
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,120
so

792
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,639
um he's you know it's funny this book is

793
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,199
filled with kind of you know

794
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,440
mathematical characters who

795
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,440
often are kind of peevish or get into

796
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,080
feuds or sort of have like

797
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,200
weird enthusiasms um because those

798
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,158
people are fun to write about and they

799
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,960
sort of like say

800
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,640
very salty things poincare is actually

801
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,440
none of this as far as i can tell

802
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,038
he was an extremely normal dude he

803
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,720
didn't get into fights with people

804
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,879
and everybody liked him and he was like

805
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,558
pretty personally modest and he had

806
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,640
very regular habits you know what i mean

807
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,319
he did math for like

808
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,840
four hours in the morning and four hours

809
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:26,798
in the evening and that was it like he

810
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,000
had his

811
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,599
schedule um i actually i was like i

812
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,960
still am feeling like

813
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,480
somebody's going to tell me now the book

814
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,880
is out like oh didn't you know about

815
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,278
this like incredibly sordid episode

816
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,919
as far as i could tell a completely

817
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,440
normal guy

818
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:46,400
but um he just kind of

819
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,960
in many ways creates uh the geometric

820
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,960
world

821
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,640
in which we live and and you know his

822
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,840
first really big success

823
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,120
uh is this prize paper he writes for

824
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:59,759
this prize offered by the king of sweden

825
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,959
for the study of the three-body problem

826
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,240
um

827
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,038
the study of what we can say about yeah

828
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,599
three

829
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,798
astronomical objects moving and what you

830
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,558
might think would be this very simple

831
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,200
way nothing's going on except

832
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,879
gravity uh releasing the three-body

833
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,000
problem why is it a problem

834
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,919
so the problem is to understand um when

835
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,200
this motion is stable and when it's not

836
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,120
so stable meaning they would sort of

837
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,278
like end up in some kind of periodic

838
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,639
orbital or i guess it would mean sorry

839
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,079
stable would mean they never sort of fly

840
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,360
off far apart from each other and

841
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,000
unstable would mean like eventually they

842
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,000
fly apart

843
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,359
so understanding two bodies is much

844
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,400
easier yeah

845
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,918
third uh two bodies this is what

846
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,840
newton knew two bodies they sort of

847
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,520
orbit each other and some kind of uh

848
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,959
uh either in an ellipse which is the

849
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:46,319
stable case you know that's what

850
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,960
the planets do that we know um

851
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,319
or uh one travels on a hyperbola around

852
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,000
the other that's the unstable case it

853
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,599
sort of like zooms in from far away sort

854
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,640
of like whips around the

855
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,158
heavier thing and like zooms out um

856
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,000
those are basically the two options so

857
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,720
it's a very simple and easy to classify

858
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,558
story

859
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,079
with three bodies just the small switch

860
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:05,759
from two to three uh

861
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,119
it's a complete zoo it's the first

862
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,319
example what we would say now is it's

863
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,839
the first example of what's called

864
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,678
chaotic dynamics

865
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,879
where the stable solutions and the

866
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,240
unstable solutions

867
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,559
they're kind of like wound in among each

868
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,079
other and a very very very tiny change

869
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,519
in the initial conditions can

870
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,839
make the long-term behavior of the

871
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,119
system completely different so poincare

872
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,398
was the first to recognize that that

873
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,558
phenomenon even

874
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:31,439
uh even existed what about the uh

875
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,759
conjecture that carries his name right

876
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,038
so

877
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:38,240
he also um

878
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:41,359
was one of the pioneers of taking

879
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,159
geometry um which until that point

880
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,678
had been largely the study of two and

881
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,399
three-dimensional objects because that's

882
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,919
like

883
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:49,599
what we see right that's those are the

884
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,640
objects we interact with

885
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,798
um he developed that subject we now

886
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,320
called topology he called it analysis

887
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,839
situs he was a very

888
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,519
well-spoken guy with a lot of slogans

889
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:00,798
but that name did not

890
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,679
you can see why that name did not catch

891
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:06,240
on so now it's called topology now

892
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,159
um sorry what was it called before

893
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,440
analysis situs

894
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,120
which i guess sort of roughly means like

895
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,720
the analysis of location or something

896
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:15,839
like that like um

897
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,960
it's a latin phrase

898
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:21,038
partly because he understood that even

899
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,120
to understand stuff that's going on

900
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,240
in our physical world you have to study

901
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,439
higher dimensional spaces

902
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,120
how does this how does this work and

903
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,640
this is kind of like where my brain went

904
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,558
to it because you were talking about

905
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,919
not just where things are but what their

906
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,918
path is how they're moving when we were

907
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,840
talking about the path from two to three

908
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,520
um he understood that if you want to

909
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,959
study three the three bodies

910
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:43,759
moving in space well each

911
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,360
uh each body it has a location where it

912
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,720
is so it has an x coordinate a y

913
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,319
coordinate and a z coordinate right i

914
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,278
can specify a point in space by giving

915
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,278
you three numbers

916
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,278
but it also at each moment has a

917
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,278
velocity

918
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,398
so it turns out that really to

919
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:58,480
understand what's going on

920
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:59,519
you can't think of it as a point or you

921
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,038
could but it's

922
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,119
better not to think of it as a point in

923
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,480
three-dimensional space that's moving

924
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,759
it's better to think of it as a point in

925
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,278
six dimensional space where the

926
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,440
coordinates are where is it

927
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,880
and what's its velocity right now that's

928
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,480
a higher dimensional space called

929
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,840
phase space and if you haven't thought

930
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,798
about this before i admit that it's a

931
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:18,158
little bit

932
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,158
mind-bending but

933
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,640
what he needed then was a geometry that

934
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,079
was flexible enough

935
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,399
not just to talk about two-dimensional

936
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,759
spaces or three-dimensional spaces but

937
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,439
any dimensional space so the sort of

938
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,798
famous first line of this paper where he

939
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,600
introduces analysis

940
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,558
is is no one doubts nowadays that the

941
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,639
geometry of

942
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,158
n-dimensional space is an actually

943
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,600
existing thing right i think that

944
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,440
maybe that had been controversial and

945
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,959
he's saying like look let's face it just

946
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,159
because it's not physical

947
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,000
doesn't mean it's not there it doesn't

948
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,000
mean we shouldn't stop

949
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,679
interesting he wasn't jumping to the

950
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,480
physical the physical interpretation

951
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,880
like it does

952
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,558
it can be real even if it's not

953
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,880
perceivable to human

954
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,599
cognition i think i think that's right i

955
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,360
think

956
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,199
don't get me wrong poincare never strays

957
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,000
far from physics he's always motivated

958
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,120
by physics

959
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,679
but the physics drove him to need to

960
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:07,678
think about

961
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,278
spaces of higher dimension and so he

962
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,480
needed a formalism that was rich enough

963
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,240
to enable him to do that

964
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,679
and once you do that that formalism is

965
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,480
also going to include things that are

966
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,759
not physical

967
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,599
and then you have two choices you can be

968
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:18,960
like oh well that stuff's trash

969
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,199
or but and this is more the

970
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,679
mathematicians frame of mind

971
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,519
if you have a formalistic framework that

972
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,038
like seems really good and sort of seems

973
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,038
to be like very elegant and work well

974
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,398
and it includes all the physical stuff

975
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:31,440
maybe we should think about all of it

976
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:32,959
like maybe we should think about it

977
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,840
thinking maybe there's some gold to be

978
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,480
mined there

979
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,158
um and indeed like you know guess what

980
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,440
like before long there's relativity and

981
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,039
there's space time and like all of a

982
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,720
sudden it's like oh yeah maybe it's a

983
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,398
good idea we already have this geometric

984
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,360
apparatus like set up for like how to

985
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:47,678
think about

986
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,959
four-dimensional spaces like turns out

987
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,519
they're real after all

988
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,640
you know this is a a story much told

989
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,558
right in mathematics not just in this

990
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,240
context but in many i'd love to dig in a

991
00:30:54,558 --> 00:31:00,720
little deeper on that actually because

992
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,480
i have some uh intuitions to work out

993
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,159
okay my brain well i'm not a

994
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,519
mathematical physicist so we can work

995
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,399
them out together

996
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,079
good we'll uh we'll we'll together walk

997
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:13,599
along the path of curiosity

998
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:16,639
but pancreatic uh conjecture

999
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,199
what is it the point conjecture is about

1000
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,720
curved

1001
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,319
three-dimensional spaces so i was on my

1002
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,960
way there i promise

1003
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:27,439
um the idea is that we perceive

1004
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,038
ourselves as living in

1005
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,240
we don't say a three-dimensional space

1006
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,679
we just say three-dimensional space you

1007
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,880
know you can go up and down you can go

1008
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,159
left and right you can go forward and

1009
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,360
back there's three dimensions in which

1010
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,399
you can move

1011
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:41,599
in poincare's theory there are many

1012
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:44,719
possible three-dimensional spaces

1013
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,079
in the same way that going down one

1014
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,319
dimension to sort of

1015
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,599
capture our intuition a little bit more

1016
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,599
we know there are lots of different

1017
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,240
two-dimensional surfaces right there's

1018
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,000
a balloon and that looks one way and a

1019
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,880
doughnut looks another way and a mobius

1020
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,079
strip

1021
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,360
looks a third way those are all like

1022
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:00,240
two-dimensional surfaces that we can

1023
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,798
kind of really

1024
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,399
uh get a global view of because we live

1025
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:05,679
in three-dimensional space so we can see

1026
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:07,038
a two-dimensional surface sort of

1027
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,080
sitting in our three-dimensional space

1028
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:12,079
well to see a three-dimensional space

1029
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,359
whole we'd have to kind of have

1030
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,639
four-dimensional eyes right which we

1031
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:16,079
don't so we have to use our mathematical

1032
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,919
lines we have to envision

1033
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:21,918
um the poincare conjecture

1034
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,759
uh says that there's a very simple way

1035
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,720
to determine whether a three-dimensional

1036
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,759
space

1037
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,798
um is the standard one the one that

1038
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,440
we're used to

1039
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,038
um and essentially it's that it's what's

1040
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,720
called fundamental group

1041
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:35,839
has nothing interesting in it and not

1042
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,120
that i can actually say without saying

1043
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,798
what the fundamental group is i can tell

1044
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,158
you what the criterion is

1045
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:41,519
this would be oh look i can even use a

1046
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,039
visual aid so for the people watching

1047
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,919
this on youtube you'll just see this for

1048
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:45,359
the people

1049
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,360
uh on the podcast you'll have to

1050
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,158
visualize it so lex has been nice enough

1051
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:49,519
to like

1052
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,600
give me a surface with some interesting

1053
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,240
topology it's a mug right here in front

1054
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,639
of me

1055
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,079
a mug yes i might say it's a genus one

1056
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,480
surface but we could also say it's a mug

1057
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:02,000
same thing

1058
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,599
so if i were to draw a little circle

1059
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,759
on this mug oh which way should i draw

1060
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,199
it so it's visible like here okay

1061
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,200
yeah if i draw a little circle on this

1062
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,919
mug imagine this to be a loop of string

1063
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,038
i could pull that loop of string closed

1064
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,880
on the surface of

1065
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,319
the mug right that's definitely

1066
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,240
something i could do i could shrink it

1067
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,079
shrink and shrink it until it's a point

1068
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,679
on the other hand if i draw a loop that

1069
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,278
goes around the handle

1070
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,399
i can kind of judge it up here and i can

1071
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:25,759
judge it down there and i can sort of

1072
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,439
slide it up and down the handle but i

1073
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:28,720
can't pull it closed can't i it's

1074
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,159
trapped

1075
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,319
not without breaking the surface of the

1076
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,840
mug right now without like going inside

1077
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:37,839
so um the condition of being what's

1078
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:40,398
called simply connected this is

1079
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,639
one of punk ray's inventions says that

1080
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,000
any loop of string can be pulled shut so

1081
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,440
it's a feature that the mug

1082
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
simply does not have this is a

1083
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,000
non-simply connected

1084
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,599
mug and a simply connected mug would be

1085
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,359
a cup right you would burn your hand

1086
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:54,798
when you drank coffee out of it

1087
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:56,558
so you're saying the universe is not a

1088
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:59,359
mug

1089
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:00,960
well i can't speak to the universe but

1090
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:04,479
what i can say is that

1091
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,079
um regular old space

1092
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,679
is not a mug regular old space if you

1093
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,440
like sort of actually physically have

1094
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,200
like a loop of string

1095
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,480
you can always close your shot you're

1096
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,759
going to pull a [ __ ]

1097
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,960
but you know what if your piece of

1098
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,599
string was the size of the universe like

1099
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,039
what if your poi

1100
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,960
your piece of string was like billions

1101
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,000
of light years long like like how do you

1102
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,519
actually know

1103
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,760
i mean that's still an open question of

1104
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:26,398
the shape of the universe exactly

1105
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,879
whether it's uh i think there's a lot

1106
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,719
there is

1107
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,398
ideas of it being a tourist i mean

1108
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,439
there's there's some trippy ideas and

1109
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,358
they're not

1110
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,800
like weird out there controversial

1111
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:38,078
there's a legitimate

1112
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,599
at the center of uh cosmology debate

1113
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,720
i mean i think i think somebody who

1114
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,399
thinks that there's like some kind of

1115
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,759
dodecahedral symmetry or i mean i

1116
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,118
remember reading something crazy about

1117
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,879
somebody saying that they saw the

1118
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,838
signature of that and the

1119
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,358
cosmic noise or what have you i mean to

1120
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,918
make the flat earthers happy

1121
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,440
i do believe that the current main

1122
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,639
belief is

1123
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,320
it's fl it's flat it's flat-ish

1124
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,239
or something like that the shape of the

1125
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,760
universe is flat-ish i don't know what

1126
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,799
the heck that means i think that

1127
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,560
i think that has like a very i mean how

1128
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,680
are you even supposed to think about

1129
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:14,000
the shape of a thing that doesn't have

1130
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,759
anything outside of it

1131
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,599
i mean ah but that's exactly what

1132
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,200
topology does topology is what's called

1133
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,400
an intrinsic theory

1134
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,480
that's what's so great about it this

1135
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,880
question about the mug

1136
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,679
you could answer it without ever leaving

1137
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,240
the mug

1138
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,000
right because it's a question about a

1139
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,358
loop drawn on the surface of the mug and

1140
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,320
what happens if it never leaves that

1141
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:34,480
surface so it's like

1142
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,838
always there see but that's the the

1143
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,599
difference between

1144
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:43,039
then topology and say if you're like uh

1145
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,960
trying to visualize a mug that you can't

1146
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,480
visualize a mug while living inside the

1147
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,838
mug

1148
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,519
well that's true that visualization is

1149
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:50,799
harder but in some sense no you're right

1150
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,838
but if the tools of mathematics are

1151
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,839
there

1152
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,199
i i i don't want to fight but i think

1153
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:56,960
the tools and mathematics are exactly

1154
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:58,000
there to enable you to think about what

1155
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,838
you cannot visualize

1156
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,039
in this way let me give let's go always

1157
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:02,000
to make things easier go downward

1158
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,800
dimension

1159
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,679
um let's think about we live on a circle

1160
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,720
okay

1161
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:09,838
you can tell whether you live on a

1162
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:11,759
circle

1163
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,279
or a line segment because if you live in

1164
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,640
a circle if you walk a long way in one

1165
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,079
direction you find yourself back where

1166
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,199
you started and if you live in a line

1167
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,640
segment

1168
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,559
you walk for a long enough one direction

1169
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,920
you come to the end of the world or if

1170
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,519
you live on a line

1171
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,200
like a whole line an infinite line then

1172
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,880
you walk in

1173
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:27,759
one direction for a long time and like

1174
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,039
well then there's not a sort of

1175
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,400
terminating algorithm to figure out

1176
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,759
whether you live on a line or a circle

1177
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,480
but at least you sort of

1178
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,520
um at least you don't discover that you

1179
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,119
live on a circle

1180
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,880
so all of those are intrinsic things

1181
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,000
right all of those are things that you

1182
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,240
can figure out about your

1183
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,679
world without leaving your world on the

1184
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,598
other hand ready now we're going to go

1185
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,639
from intrinsic to extrinsic why did i

1186
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,000
not know we were going to talk about

1187
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,960
this but why not

1188
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,400
why not if you can't tell whether you

1189
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,519
live in a circle

1190
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,960
or a not like imagine like a knot

1191
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,480
floating in three-dimensional space the

1192
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,199
person who lives on that knot to them

1193
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,800
it's a circle

1194
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,239
yeah they walk a long way they come back

1195
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,079
to where they started now we with our

1196
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,598
three-dimensional eyes can be like

1197
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,200
oh this one's just a plain circle and

1198
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,240
this one's knotted up but that's an

1199
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:09,679
that's a

1200
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:10,879
that has to do with how they sit in

1201
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:12,239
three-dimensional space it doesn't have

1202
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,960
to do with intrinsic features of those

1203
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,959
people's world

1204
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,000
we can ask you one ape to another does

1205
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,679
it make you

1206
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,838
how does it make you feel that you don't

1207
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:22,960
know if you live in a circle

1208
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:28,400
or on a knot in a knot

1209
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,400
in inside the string that forms the knot

1210
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,279
i'm going to even know how to say i'm

1211
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,159
going to be honest with you i don't know

1212
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,800
if like

1213
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,279
i i fear you won't like this answer but

1214
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,119
it

1215
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,280
does not bother me at all it does i

1216
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,358
don't lose one minute of sleep over it

1217
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,240
so like does it bother you that if we

1218
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:46,239
look at like a mobius strip

1219
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:47,439
that you don't have an obvious way of

1220
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:49,759
knowing

1221
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,599
whether you are inside of cylinder if

1222
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,440
you live on a surface of a cylinder

1223
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,680
or you live on the surface of a mobius

1224
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,559
strip

1225
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,078
no i think you can tell if you live if

1226
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,078
which one because

1227
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,200
if what you do is you like tell your

1228
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,079
friend hey stay right here i'm just

1229
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,838
gonna go for a walk

1230
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,200
and then you like walk for a long time

1231
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:08,320
in one direction and then you come back

1232
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:09,598
and you see your friend again and if

1233
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,039
your friend is reversed then you know

1234
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,039
you live on a mobius strip well

1235
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,159
no because you won't see your friend

1236
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,440
right okay

1237
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:19,759
fair fair point fair point on that and

1238
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,200
you have to believe the story is about

1239
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,240
no i don't even know

1240
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:26,159
i i i would would you even know would

1241
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,598
you really oh no you're i know your

1242
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:28,000
point is right let me try to think of it

1243
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,838
better

1244
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,480
let's see if i can do this may not be

1245
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,880
correct to talk about

1246
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,079
cognitive beings living on a mobius

1247
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,358
strip because

1248
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,720
there's a lot of things taken for

1249
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,719
granted there and we're constantly

1250
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:43,519
imagining actual like

1251
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:44,078
three-dimensional creatures like how it

1252
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,599
actually

1253
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,280
feels like to uh to live on a mobius

1254
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,440
strip is tricky to

1255
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,880
internalize i think that on what's

1256
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,320
called the real projective plane which

1257
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,440
is kind of even more sort of like messed

1258
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,039
up version of the

1259
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,880
mobius strip but with very similar

1260
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:02,079
features this feature of kind of like

1261
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,320
only having one side that has the

1262
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,280
feature that there's a loop of string

1263
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,760
which can't be pulled closed but if you

1264
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,760
loop

1265
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,119
it around twice along the same path that

1266
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,240
you can pull closed

1267
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,920
that's extremely weird yeah

1268
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:18,559
um but that would be a way you could

1269
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,320
know without leaving your world that

1270
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:21,838
something very funny is going on you

1271
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,599
know what's extremely weird

1272
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,639
maybe we can comment on hopefully it's

1273
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,119
not too much of a tangent is

1274
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,159
i remember thinking about this this

1275
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,720
might be right

1276
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,199
this might be wrong but if you're if we

1277
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,319
now

1278
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:38,559
talk about a sphere and you're living

1279
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,440
inside a sphere

1280
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:45,279
that you're going to see everywhere

1281
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,280
around you the back of your own head

1282
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:51,039
that i was because like i was

1283
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,400
this is very counterintuitive to me to

1284
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,960
think about maybe it's wrong

1285
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,320
but because i was thinking like earth

1286
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,240
you know your 3d

1287
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,800
thing on sitting on a sphere but if

1288
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:02,479
you're living inside the sphere

1289
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,318
like you're going to see if you look

1290
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,719
straight you're always going to see

1291
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,159
yourself all the way around so

1292
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,959
everywhere you look there's going to be

1293
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,440
the back of your

1294
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,800
head i think somehow this depends on

1295
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,079
something of like how the physics of

1296
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,599
light works in this scenario which i'm

1297
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,599
sort of finding it hard to bend my

1298
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,280
that's true the c is doing a lot of like

1299
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,318
saying you see something's doing a lot

1300
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,680
of work

1301
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,000
people have thought about this i mean

1302
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:26,078
this this metaphor of like what if we're

1303
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,358
like little creatures in some sort of

1304
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,039
smaller world like how could we

1305
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:30,799
apprehend what's outside that metaphor

1306
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,719
just comes back and back and actually i

1307
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,318
didn't even realize like how frequent it

1308
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,239
is it comes up in the book a lot

1309
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:37,119
i know it from a book called flatland i

1310
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,199
don't know if you ever read this when

1311
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:41,440
you were a kid

1312
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,039
an adult you know this this uh sort of

1313
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,159
sort of comic novel from the 19th

1314
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,358
century about

1315
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:49,118
an entire two-dimensional world

1316
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:50,480
uh it's narrated by a square that's the

1317
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,440
main character

1318
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,559
and um the kind of strangeness that

1319
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,079
befalls him when

1320
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,239
you know one day he's in his house and

1321
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,680
suddenly there's like a little circle

1322
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:01,439
there and there with him

1323
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:02,960
and then the circle but then the circle

1324
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,280
like starts getting bigger

1325
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,400
and bigger and bigger and he's like what

1326
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,400
the hell is going on it's like a horror

1327
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,240
movie like for two-dimensional people

1328
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,400
and of course what's happening is that a

1329
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,679
sphere is entering his world and as the

1330
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,680
sphere kind of like

1331
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,118
moves farther and farther into the plane

1332
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:18,318
it's cross-section the part of it that

1333
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,838
he can see

1334
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:21,519
to him it looks like there's like this

1335
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:23,759
kind of bizarre being that's like

1336
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,960
getting larger and larger and larger

1337
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,000
um until it's exactly sort of halfway

1338
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,199
through and then they have this kind of

1339
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,318
like philosophical argument where the

1340
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,598
sphere is like i'm a sphere i'm from the

1341
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:32,639
third dimension the square is like what

1342
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,200
are you talking about there's no such

1343
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:35,679
thing

1344
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,519
and they have this kind of like sterile

1345
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:39,598
argument where the square is not

1346
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:40,800
able to kind of like follow the

1347
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,318
mathematical reasoning of the sphere

1348
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,240
until the sphere just kind of grabs him

1349
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,559
and like jerks him out of the plane

1350
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:49,598
and pulls him up and it's like now like

1351
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:51,519
now do you see like now do you see your

1352
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,640
whole world that you didn't understand

1353
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,679
before so do you think

1354
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,480
that kind of process is possible for us

1355
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,919
humans

1356
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,599
so we live in the three-dimensional

1357
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,358
world maybe with the time component

1358
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,920
four-dimensional

1359
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:08,078
and then math allows us to uh to go

1360
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,280
high into high dimensions comfortably

1361
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,920
and explore the world from those

1362
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,920
perspectives

1363
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,838
like is it possible

1364
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,318
that the universe is uh many more

1365
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,318
dimensions

1366
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:25,440
than the ones we experience as human

1367
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,719
beings so

1368
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,760
if you look at uh the you know

1369
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:32,480
especially in physics

1370
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,079
theories of everything uh physics

1371
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,400
theories that try to unify

1372
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,280
general relativity and quantum field

1373
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,639
theory

1374
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,200
they seem to go to high dimensions

1375
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:44,480
to work stuff out through the tools of

1376
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,439
mathematics

1377
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,000
is it possible so like the two options

1378
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,358
are one

1379
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,079
is just a nice way to analyze a universe

1380
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:56,159
but the reality is is as exactly we

1381
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,280
perceive it it is three-dimensional

1382
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,559
or are we just seeing are we those

1383
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,240
flatland creatures

1384
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:03,679
they're just seeing a tiny slice of

1385
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:07,039
reality

1386
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:09,358
and the actual reality is many many

1387
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,719
many more dimensions than the three

1388
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,480
dimensions we perceive

1389
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,719
oh i certainly think that's possible um

1390
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,039
now how would you figure out whether it

1391
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:22,399
was true or not is another question

1392
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:23,838
um i suppose what you would do as with

1393
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,039
anything else that you can't directly

1394
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:29,358
perceive

1395
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:31,279
is you would try to understand

1396
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,119
what effect the presence of those extra

1397
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,519
dimensions

1398
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,400
out there would have on the things we

1399
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,199
can

1400
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,318
perceive like what else can you do right

1401
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,118
and in some sense

1402
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,559
if the answer is they would have no

1403
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,000
effect

1404
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,199
then maybe it becomes like a little bit

1405
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,639
of a sterile question because what

1406
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,480
question are you even

1407
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,358
asking right you can kind of posit

1408
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,719
however many entities that

1409
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:58,159
is it possible to intuit how to mess

1410
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,598
with the other dimensions

1411
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:01,440
while living in a three-dimensional

1412
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,800
world i mean that seems like a very

1413
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,440
challenging thing to do

1414
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,800
we the the reason flatland could be

1415
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,280
written

1416
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,160
is because it's coming from a

1417
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,519
three-dimensional

1418
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,480
writer yes but but what happens in the

1419
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:15,039
book i didn't even tell you the whole

1420
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,119
plot

1421
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,400
what happens is the square is so excited

1422
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,400
and so

1423
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,079
filled with intellectual joy by the way

1424
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,639
maybe to give the story some context

1425
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,480
you ask like is it possible for us

1426
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:28,480
humans to have this experience of being

1427
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,240
transcendent transcendentally jerked out

1428
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,880
of our world so we can sort of truly see

1429
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:32,639
it from above

1430
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,000
well edwin abbott who wrote the book

1431
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,078
certainly thought so because

1432
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,838
edward abbott was a minister so the

1433
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,318
whole christian subtext to this book i

1434
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:42,318
had completely not grasped

1435
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:43,679
reading this as a kid that it means a

1436
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:44,719
very different thing right if sort of a

1437
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,799
theologian

1438
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,639
is saying like oh what if a higher being

1439
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,079
could like pull you out of

1440
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:51,440
this earthly world you live in so that

1441
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,800
you can sort of see the truth and like

1442
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,960
really see it

1443
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,560
uh from above as it were so that's one

1444
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,079
of the things that's going on for him

1445
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,400
and it's a testament to his skill as a

1446
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,318
writer that his story just works whether

1447
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,519
that's the framework you're coming to it

1448
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,639
from

1449
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:08,239
or not um but what happens in this book

1450
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:09,519
and this part now looking at it through

1451
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,559
a christian lens that becomes

1452
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,920
a bit subversive is the square is so

1453
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,719
excited about

1454
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,000
what he's learned from the sphere and

1455
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:19,279
the sphere explains them like what a

1456
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,559
cube would be oh it's like you but

1457
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,160
three-dimensional and the square is very

1458
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,400
exciting and the square is like

1459
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:26,078
okay i get it now so like now that you

1460
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,280
explained to me how just by reason i can

1461
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,960
figure out what a cube would be like

1462
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,240
like a three-dimensional version of me

1463
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,679
like let's figure out what a

1464
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,559
four-dimensional version of me would be

1465
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,159
like

1466
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:35,279
and then this fear is like what the hell

1467
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:36,799
are you talking about there's no fourth

1468
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,000
dimension that's ridiculous like

1469
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,760
there's three dimensions like that's how

1470
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,960
many there are i can see like i mean so

1471
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,359
it's the sort of comic moment where the

1472
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,039
sphere is completely unable to

1473
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,279
uh conceptualize that there could

1474
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,039
actually be yet another

1475
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,560
dimension so yeah that takes the

1476
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,440
religious allegory to like a very weird

1477
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,039
place that i don't really like

1478
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,519
understand theologically but

1479
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:57,039
that's a nice way to talk about religion

1480
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,159
and myth

1481
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,759
in general as perhaps us trying to

1482
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:03,759
struggle with us meaning human

1483
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,960
civilization trying to struggle

1484
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,000
with ideas that are beyond our cognitive

1485
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,519
capabilities but it's in fact not beyond

1486
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,199
our capability it may be beyond our

1487
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,719
cognitive capabilities

1488
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:18,559
to visualize a four-dimensional cube a

1489
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:19,679
tesseract as some like to call it or a

1490
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:20,719
five-dimensional cube or a

1491
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,039
six-dimensional cube

1492
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:23,919
but it is not beyond our cognitive

1493
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,719
capabilities

1494
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,000
to figure out how many corners a

1495
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:29,519
six-dimensional cube would have

1496
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,519
that's what's so cool about us whether

1497
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,039
we can visualize it or not we can still

1498
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:33,280
talk about it we can still reason about

1499
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,079
it

1500
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,280
we can still figure things out about it

1501
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,560
that's amazing

1502
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,519
yeah if we go back to this first of all

1503
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,838
to the mug

1504
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,679
but to the example you give in the book

1505
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:49,679
of the straw

1506
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:52,639
uh how many holes does a straw have

1507
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:54,000
and you listener may uh try to answer

1508
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:55,279
that in your own head

1509
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,679
yeah i'm gonna take a drink while

1510
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,800
everybody thinks about it a slow

1511
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:03,838
sip is it uh

1512
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:05,599
zero one or two or more

1513
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:06,880
more than that maybe maybe you get very

1514
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,318
creative but

1515
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,079
uh it's kind of interesting to uh each

1516
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:14,318
uh dissecting each answer as you do in

1517
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,519
the book is quite brilliant people

1518
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:18,159
should definitely check it out

1519
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:19,119
but if you could try to answer it now

1520
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:22,078
like think about

1521
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,280
all the options and why they may or may

1522
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,720
not be right

1523
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,040
yeah and it's one of it's one of these

1524
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:28,399
questions where people on first hearing

1525
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:29,838
it think it's a triviality and they're

1526
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,039
like well the answer is obvious and then

1527
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:32,639
what happens if you ever ask a group of

1528
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,239
people this something

1529
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:35,358
wonderfully comic happens which is that

1530
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:36,399
everyone's like well it's completely

1531
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:38,159
obvious

1532
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,760
and then each person realizes that half

1533
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:40,558
the person the other people in the room

1534
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,559
have a different

1535
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,319
obvious answer for the way that they

1536
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,240
have and then people get really heated

1537
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:47,920
people are like i can't believe that you

1538
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:49,519
think it has two holes or like i can't

1539
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,880
believe that you think it has one

1540
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,400
and then you know you really like people

1541
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,318
really learn something about each other

1542
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,318
and people get heated

1543
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:57,679
i mean can we go through the possible

1544
00:47:56,318 --> 00:48:01,199
options here

1545
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:04,558
is it zero one two three ten

1546
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:06,719
sure so i think you know most people

1547
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,680
the zero holders are rare they would say

1548
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:08,879
like well look

1549
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,558
you can make a straw by taking a

1550
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,318
rectangular piece of plastic and closing

1551
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,119
it up the rectangular piece of plastic

1552
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:16,000
doesn't have a hole in it uh i didn't

1553
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,400
poke a hole in it

1554
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,639
when i yeah so how can i have a hole

1555
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,079
like it's just one thing okay

1556
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,759
most people don't see it that way that's

1557
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,280
like uh um

1558
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,880
is there any truth to that kind of

1559
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,400
conception yeah i think that would be

1560
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:34,000
somebody whose account

1561
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:36,079
i mean

1562
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,599
what i would say is you could say the

1563
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,880
same thing

1564
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,119
um about a bagel you could say i can

1565
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,640
make a bagel by taking like a long

1566
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,559
cylinder of dough which doesn't have a

1567
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:47,679
hole and then smooshing the ends

1568
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,599
together

1569
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:50,879
now it's a bagel so if you're really

1570
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,318
committed you can be like okay bagel

1571
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,599
doesn't have a hole either but like

1572
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:55,119
who are you if you say a bagel doesn't

1573
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,480
have a hole i mean i don't know yeah so

1574
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,920
that's almost like an engineering

1575
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,159
definition of it

1576
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,358
okay fair enough so what's what about

1577
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:05,440
the other options

1578
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:08,480
um so you know one whole people

1579
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,760
would say um i like how these are like

1580
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,318
groups of people

1581
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,880
like where we've planted our foot yes

1582
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,159
one hole

1583
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,200
there's books written about each belief

1584
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:18,318
you know would say look there's like a

1585
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:20,078
hole and it goes all the way through the

1586
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:21,279
straw right there it's one region of

1587
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,200
space that's the hole

1588
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,160
yeah and there's one and two whole

1589
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,480
people would say like well look there's

1590
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:29,199
a hole in the top in the hole

1591
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,400
at the bottom um i think a common thing

1592
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,919
you see

1593
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,880
when people um

1594
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,039
argue about this they would take

1595
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,000
something like this a bottle of water

1596
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:41,199
i'm holding maybe i'll open it and they

1597
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,400
say well how many holes are there in

1598
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:43,358
this and you say like well there's one

1599
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,680
there's one hole

1600
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:47,679
at the top okay what if i like poke a

1601
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:50,799
hole here so that all the water

1602
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:52,639
spills out well now it's a straw

1603
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,318
yeah so if you're a one hole or i say to

1604
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,799
you like well how many holes are

1605
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:58,318
in it now there was a there was one hole

1606
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,119
in it before and i poked a new hole in

1607
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:01,199
it

1608
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,559
and then you think there's still one

1609
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,439
hole even though there was

1610
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,760
one hole and i made one more clearly not

1611
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,039
this

1612
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,240
is two holes yeah um and yet if you're a

1613
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,838
two hole the one holder will say like

1614
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,118
okay where does one hole begin in the

1615
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:16,159
other whole end

1616
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,920
yeah like what's it like and um

1617
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,358
and in the in the book i sort of you

1618
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,400
know in math there's two things we do

1619
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:21,519
when we're faced with a problem that's

1620
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,318
confusing us

1621
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:25,599
um we can make the problem simpler

1622
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:26,318
that's what we were doing a minute ago

1623
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,440
and we were talking about high

1624
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:28,000
dimensional space and i was like let's

1625
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,760
talk about like

1626
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,280
circles and line segments let's go down

1627
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,280
a dimension to make it easier

1628
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,960
uh the other big move we have is to make

1629
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,480
the problem harder

1630
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,000
and try to sort of really like face up

1631
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,280
to what are the complications so

1632
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,880
you know what i do in the book is say

1633
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,720
like let's stop talking about straws for

1634
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,119
a minute and talk about pants

1635
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,078
how many holes are there in a pair of

1636
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,519
pants

1637
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,280
so i think most people who say there's

1638
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,838
two holes in the straw would say there's

1639
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,359
three holes in a pair of pants

1640
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:54,880
i guess i mean i guess we're filming

1641
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:56,400
only from here i could take up no i'm

1642
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,760
not gonna do it

1643
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,519
you'll just have to imagine the pants

1644
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,559
sorry yeah um

1645
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:04,480
lex if you want it no okay no

1646
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,240
uh that's gonna be in the direction

1647
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,639
that's the patreon-only footage

1648
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,078
there you go so many people would say

1649
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:11,358
there's three holes in the pair of pants

1650
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,839
but you know for instance my daughter

1651
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:13,838
when i asked

1652
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:15,920
by the way talking to kids about this is

1653
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:19,679
super fun i highly recommend it

1654
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,519
um what did she say she said well

1655
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,199
yeah i feel a pair of pants like just

1656
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:24,880
has two holes because yes there's the

1657
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:26,558
waist but that's just the two leg holes

1658
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,838
stuck together

1659
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,240
whoa okay two leg holes yeah okay right

1660
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:32,400
i mean that's

1661
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:34,399
she's a one caller for the straw so

1662
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,240
she's a one-holer for the straw too

1663
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:41,519
and um and that really does

1664
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:43,598
capture something it captures this fact

1665
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,039
which is central to the theory of what's

1666
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,640
called homology which is like a central

1667
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:49,599
part of modern topology that

1668
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:50,960
um holes whatever we may mean by them

1669
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,400
there are somehow things which have an

1670
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,880
arithmetic to them they're things which

1671
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,000
can be

1672
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,119
added like the waste like waste equals

1673
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,880
leg plus leg

1674
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,640
is kind of an equation but it's not an

1675
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,079
equation about numbers it's an equation

1676
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,318
about some kind of

1677
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,760
geometric some kind of topological thing

1678
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,800
which is very strange and so

1679
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,559
you know when i come down um

1680
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,160
you know like a rabbi i like to kind of

1681
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,880
like come up with these answers and

1682
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,639
somehow like

1683
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,119
dodge the original question and say like

1684
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:20,558
you're both right my children okay so

1685
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,880
yeah uh so for this for the

1686
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,839
for the straw i think what a modern

1687
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,920
mathematician would say is like

1688
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,440
the first version would be to say like

1689
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,200
well they're two holes but they're

1690
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,639
really both the same hole

1691
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:34,639
well that's not quite right a better way

1692
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,519
to say it is there's two holes

1693
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:38,960
but one is the negative of the other now

1694
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:40,880
what can that mean

1695
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,720
um one way of thinking about what it

1696
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,559
means is that if you sip something like

1697
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:48,000
a milkshake through the straw

1698
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,760
no matter what the amount of milkshake

1699
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,318
that's flowing in one end

1700
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,200
that same amount is flowing out the

1701
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:54,558
other end

1702
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,118
so they're not independent from each

1703
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,079
other there's some relationship

1704
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,280
between them in the same way that if you

1705
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:05,039
somehow could like

1706
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:07,200
suck a milkshake through a pair of pants

1707
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:08,719
the amount of milkshake just go with me

1708
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,399
on this not experimenting

1709
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,480
mom right there the amount of milkshake

1710
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,280
that's coming in the left leg of the

1711
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,639
pants

1712
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,559
plus the amount of milkshake that's

1713
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:19,759
coming in the right leg of the pants

1714
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,599
is the same that's coming out the uh the

1715
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,200
waist of the pants so just so you know i

1716
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,838
fasted for 72 hours

1717
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,279
yester uh the last three days so i just

1718
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:28,078
broke the fast with a little bit of food

1719
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,640
yesterday so

1720
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,800
this is like this sounds uh food

1721
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:33,118
analogies or metaphors for this podcast

1722
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,039
work

1723
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,800
wonderfully because i can intensely

1724
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,318
picture it is that your weekly routine

1725
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,440
or just in preparation for talking about

1726
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:43,039
geometry for three hours

1727
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,880
exactly this it's hardship

1728
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,558
to purify the mind no it's for the first

1729
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,039
time i just wanted to try the experience

1730
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,720
oh wow

1731
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:53,039
and just to uh to pause to do things

1732
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,919
that are out of the ordinary to pause

1733
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:56,719
and to uh reflect on how grateful i am

1734
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,880
to be just

1735
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:00,078
alive and be able to do all the cool

1736
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,119
[ __ ] that i get to do so

1737
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:05,760
did you drink water yes yes yes yes yes

1738
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,039
water and salt so like electrolytes and

1739
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,920
all those kinds of things

1740
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,558
but anyway so the inflow on the top of

1741
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,200
the pants

1742
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,640
equals to the outflow on the bottom of

1743
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:17,919
the pants

1744
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:19,759
exactly so this idea that

1745
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,680
i mean i think you know poincare really

1746
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,720
have these i this idea this sort of

1747
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:24,480
modern idea

1748
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:26,639
i mean building on stuff other people

1749
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,800
did uh betty is an important one

1750
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,239
of this kind of modern notion of

1751
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,400
relations between holes but the idea

1752
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,000
that holes really had an arithmetic

1753
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,720
the really modern view was really emmy

1754
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,599
nerder's idea so she kind of comes in

1755
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:42,480
and sort of truly puts the subject

1756
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,160
uh on its modern footing that we have

1757
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,199
that we have now so

1758
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,199
you know it's always a challenge you

1759
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,000
know in the book i'm not gonna say i

1760
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:49,679
give like

1761
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,880
a course so that you read this chapter

1762
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:51,358
and then you're like oh it's just like i

1763
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,358
took like

1764
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,400
a semester of algebraic apology it's not

1765
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:55,440
like this and it's always a you know

1766
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,000
it's always a challenge

1767
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,159
writing about math because there are

1768
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,760
some things

1769
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:03,679
that you can really do on the page and

1770
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,200
the math is there and there's other

1771
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,558
things which

1772
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,399
it's too much in a book like this like

1773
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,559
do them all the page you can only

1774
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,480
say something about them if that makes

1775
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,920
sense um

1776
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,039
so you know in the book i try to do some

1777
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,599
of both i try to do i try to

1778
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:20,639
topics that are you can't really

1779
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,960
compress

1780
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,078
and really truly say exactly what they

1781
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,280
are

1782
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,720
in this amount of space um

1783
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,160
i try to say something interesting about

1784
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:31,679
them something meaningful about them so

1785
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:34,719
that readers can get the flavor

1786
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:36,480
um and then in other places i really try

1787
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:38,399
to get up close and personal

1788
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,480
and really do the math and have it take

1789
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,000
place on the page

1790
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,760
to some degree be able to give inklings

1791
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,798
of the beauty of the subject

1792
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,640
yeah i mean there's you know there's a

1793
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:50,159
lot of books that are like i don't quite

1794
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:53,519
know how to express this well i'm still

1795
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:54,239
laboring to do it but um there's a lot

1796
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:57,280
of books that

1797
00:55:54,239 --> 00:56:00,639
are about stuff

1798
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,559
but i want my books to not only be about

1799
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:04,400
stuff but to actually have some stuff

1800
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,920
there on the page in the book for people

1801
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,280
to interact with directly and not just

1802
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,000
sort of hear me talk about distant

1803
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,480
features about

1804
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,358
just different distant features of it

1805
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,318
right so

1806
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:15,119
not be talking just about ideas but the

1807
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:17,358
actually be

1808
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,640
expressing the idea is there you know

1809
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:21,598
somebody in the

1810
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:22,719
maybe you can comment there's a guy his

1811
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,599
youtube channel is

1812
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,480
three blue one brown grant sanderson he

1813
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,200
does that

1814
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,280
masterfully well absolutely of uh

1815
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:33,199
visualizing of expressing a particular

1816
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,359
idea and then talking about it as well

1817
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:36,960
back and forth uh what do you what do

1818
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:39,279
you think about grant

1819
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,199
it's fantastic i mean the flowering of

1820
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,798
math youtube is like such a wonderful

1821
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:45,439
thing because

1822
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:46,960
you know math teaching there's so many

1823
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,960
different venues

1824
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,720
through which we can teach people math

1825
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,240
there's the traditional one right

1826
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:55,439
well where i'm in a classroom with

1827
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:57,598
you know depending on the class it could

1828
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,440
be 30 people it could be 100 people

1829
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,640
it could god help maybe 500 people if

1830
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,760
it's like the big calculus lecture or

1831
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:02,639
whatever it may be

1832
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,839
and there's sort of some but there's

1833
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:04,879
some set of people of that order of

1834
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:06,078
magnitude

1835
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,240
and i'm with them for we have a long

1836
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,760
time i'm with them for a whole semester

1837
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:11,039
and i can ask them to do homework and we

1838
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,319
talk together we have office hours that

1839
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:13,599
they have one-on-one questions multiply

1840
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:14,400
that's like a very high level of

1841
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,318
engagement

1842
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,920
but how many people am i actually

1843
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:21,279
hitting at a time like not

1844
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,240
that many right um and you can

1845
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,040
and there's kind of an inverse

1846
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:27,199
relationship where the

1847
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:28,639
more and g the fewer people you're

1848
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:30,719
talking to the more engagement you can

1849
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:33,598
ask for the ultimate of course is like

1850
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:35,598
the mentorship relation of like a phd

1851
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,519
advisor and a graduate student where

1852
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:38,960
you spend a lot of one-on-one time

1853
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:42,318
together for like you know

1854
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,599
three to five years and the ultimate

1855
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:48,159
high level of engagement

1856
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:50,240
to one person um you know books

1857
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:52,000
i can this can get to a lot more people

1858
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:55,679
that are ever gonna sit in my

1859
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,838
classroom and you spend like uh

1860
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:59,679
however many hours it takes to read a

1861
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,920
book uh somebody like three blue one

1862
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:04,639
brown or numberphile or um

1863
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,838
people like vi heart i mean youtube

1864
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:08,000
let's face it

1865
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:09,279
has bigger reach than a book like

1866
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,358
there's youtube videos that have many

1867
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,920
many many more views than like

1868
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:15,838
you know any hardback book like not

1869
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,960
written by a kardashian or an obama is

1870
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:20,318
gonna sell right so that's

1871
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:23,199
i mean um any

1872
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:24,318
and and then you know those are you know

1873
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,759
some of them are like

1874
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:27,039
longer 20 minutes long some of them are

1875
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,319
five minutes long but they're you know

1876
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:29,759
they're shorter and even so

1877
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:31,519
look look like eugenia chang is a

1878
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,760
wonderful category theorist in chicago i

1879
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:33,519
mean

1880
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,799
she was on i think the daily show or i

1881
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,318
mean she was on you know

1882
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:37,679
she has 30 seconds but then there's like

1883
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:40,239
30 seconds to sort of say something

1884
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:41,919
about math mathematics to like untold

1885
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:43,279
millions of people so everywhere along

1886
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,760
this curve isn't

1887
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,440
is important one thing i feel like is

1888
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,280
great right now is that people are just

1889
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,400
broadcasting on all the channels because

1890
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,640
we each have

1891
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,920
our skills right somehow along the way

1892
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:54,400
like i learned how to write books i had

1893
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,760
this

1894
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,119
kind of weird life as a writer where i

1895
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,640
sort of spent a lot of time like

1896
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,079
thinking about how to put

1897
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:01,759
english words together into sentences

1898
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,559
and sentences together into paragraphs

1899
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,000
like

1900
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,720
at length which is this kind of like

1901
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,159
weird specialized scale

1902
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:10,798
and that's one thing but like sort of

1903
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:13,199
being able to make like you know winning

1904
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,239
good-looking eye-catching videos is like

1905
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:15,519
a totally

1906
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:16,879
different skill and you know probably

1907
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:18,000
you know somewhere out there there's

1908
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,680
probably sort of some

1909
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,119
like heavy metal band that's like

1910
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,879
teaching math through

1911
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,240
heavy metal and like using their skills

1912
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,400
to do that i hope there is

1913
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:28,639
at any rate through music and so on yeah

1914
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,599
but there is something to the process

1915
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:33,598
i mean grant does this especially well

1916
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,519
which is

1917
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,039
in order to be able to visualize

1918
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:38,719
something now he writes

1919
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:40,239
programs so it's programmatic

1920
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:42,879
visualization so like the

1921
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:43,679
the things he is basically mostly

1922
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,798
through his uh

1923
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,199
madam library in python everything is

1924
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:52,318
drawn

1925
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:54,480
through python you have to um

1926
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:56,400
you have to truly understand the topic

1927
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,880
to be able to

1928
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:02,000
to visualize it in that way and not just

1929
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,720
understand it but really kind of

1930
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,559
think in a very novel way it's funny

1931
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:07,199
because i i've spoken with him a couple

1932
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,839
times

1933
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:11,919
i've spoken to him a lot offline as well

1934
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:15,599
he really doesn't think

1935
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,519
he's doing anything new meaning like

1936
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:20,400
he sees himself as very different from

1937
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:24,000
maybe like a researcher

1938
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:26,318
but it feels to me

1939
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,920
like he's creating something totally new

1940
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:29,279
like that act of understanding

1941
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,240
visualizing

1942
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,920
is as powerful or has the same kind of

1943
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:36,639
inkling of power as does

1944
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,039
the process of proving something you

1945
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:38,639
know

1946
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:40,400
it just it doesn't have that clear

1947
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:43,199
destination but it's

1948
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,880
it's pulling out an insight and creating

1949
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:47,439
multiple sets of perspective

1950
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,358
that arrive at that insight and to be

1951
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,920
honest it's something that i think we

1952
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:53,440
haven't

1953
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:55,039
quite figured out how to value

1954
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,480
inside academic mathematics in the same

1955
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:57,279
way and this is a bit older that i think

1956
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,358
we haven't quite

1957
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,960
figured out how to value the development

1958
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:02,558
of computational infrastructure you know

1959
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,720
we all have computers as our partners

1960
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:07,839
now and people

1961
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:09,358
build computers that sort of assist and

1962
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:11,119
participate in our mathematics they

1963
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:13,039
build those systems and that's

1964
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,559
a kind of mathematics too but not in the

1965
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:16,400
traditional form of

1966
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:19,280
proving theorems and writing papers but

1967
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,760
i think it's coming look i mean i think

1968
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,440
you know for example the institute for

1969
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,480
computational experimental mathematics

1970
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,280
at brown which is like a

1971
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,719
you know it's a nsf-funded math

1972
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,240
institute very much part of sort of

1973
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:32,480
traditional math academia they did an

1974
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,838
entire theme semester about visualizing

1975
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,119
mathematics looking at the same kind of

1976
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:37,759
thing that they would do for like

1977
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,960
an up-and-coming research topic like

1978
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,599
that's pretty cool so i think there

1979
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,199
really is

1980
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:44,798
buy-in from uh the mathematics community

1981
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,798
to recognize that this kind of stuff is

1982
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,960
important and counts as part of

1983
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:50,400
mathematics like part of what we're

1984
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,679
actually here to do

1985
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,318
yeah i'm hoping to see more and more of

1986
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:55,519
that from like mit faculty from faculty

1987
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:57,599
from all the

1988
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:59,280
the top universities in the world let me

1989
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,440
ask you this weird question about the

1990
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,960
fields medal which is the nobel prize in

1991
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,559
mathematics

1992
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,720
do you think since we're talking about

1993
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,319
computers there will one

1994
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:13,199
day come a time

1995
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:15,838
when a computer an ai system will win a

1996
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:15,838
field medal

1997
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,880
no of course that's what a human would

1998
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:22,558
say why not

1999
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,838
it's is that like you're that that's

2000
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,319
like my captcha that's like the proof

2001
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:26,318
that i'm a human

2002
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:30,719
how does he want me to answer is there

2003
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,920
something interesting to be said about

2004
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:34,639
that

2005
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,519
yeah i mean i am tremendously interested

2006
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:37,838
in

2007
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,038
what ai can do in pure mathematics i

2008
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:40,558
mean it's of course

2009
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,839
it's a parochial interest right you're

2010
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,359
like why am i interested in like how it

2011
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,119
can like help feed the world or help

2012
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:45,598
solve like there's problems i'm like can

2013
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,838
i do

2014
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:49,519
more math like what can i do we all have

2015
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:51,920
our interests right um

2016
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:52,798
but i think it is a really interesting

2017
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,559
conceptual

2018
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:59,119
question and here too i think

2019
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:00,960
um it's important to be kind of

2020
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:02,798
historical because it's certainly true

2021
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,720
that there's lots of things that we used

2022
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:07,358
to call research and mathematics

2023
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:08,959
that we would now call computation yeah

2024
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:10,000
tasks that we've now offloaded to

2025
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,480
machines like

2026
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,559
you know in 1890 somebody could be like

2027
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,199
here's my phd thesis i

2028
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:19,200
computed all the invariants of this

2029
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:20,798
polynomial ring under the action of some

2030
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,719
finite group doesn't matter what those

2031
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:23,920
words mean just it's like something that

2032
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,159
in 1890

2033
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,440
would take a person a year to do and

2034
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:28,879
would be a valuable thing that you might

2035
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,000
want to know and it's still a valuable

2036
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,720
thing that you might want to know but

2037
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,798
now you type a few lines of code in

2038
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:37,919
macaulay or sage

2039
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:39,599
or magma and you just have it so we

2040
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,880
don't think of that as

2041
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,280
math anymore even though it's the same

2042
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,880
thing what's macaulay sage and magma

2043
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,319
oh those are computer algebra programs

2044
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,920
so those are like sort of bespoke

2045
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:49,519
systems that lots of mathematicians use

2046
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,039
that's similar to maple and

2047
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:52,798
yeah oh yeah so similar to maple and

2048
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,480
mathematica yeah okay but a little more

2049
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:56,559
specialized but yeah

2050
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,159
it's programs that work with symbols and

2051
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,640
allow you to do can you do proofs can

2052
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:00,480
you do

2053
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:02,318
kind of kind of little little leaps and

2054
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,679
proofs they're not really built for that

2055
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:05,838
that's a whole other

2056
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:07,279
story but these tools are part of the

2057
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:08,719
process of mathematics now

2058
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,480
right they are now for most

2059
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,480
mathematicians i would say part of the

2060
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,318
process of mathematics and so

2061
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,318
um you know there's a story i tell in

2062
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:17,358
the book which i'm fascinated by which

2063
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:21,599
is

2064
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:24,480
you know so far attempts

2065
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,079
to get ais to prove interesting theorems

2066
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,240
have not

2067
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,079
done so well doesn't mean they can it's

2068
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:32,318
actually a paper i just saw which

2069
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:34,480
has a very nice use of a neuron that

2070
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:35,838
defined counter examples to conjecture

2071
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,798
somebody said like well maybe this is

2072
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:38,239
always that

2073
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:40,000
yeah and you can be like well let me

2074
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:43,118
sort of train an ai to sort of try

2075
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,798
to find things where that's not true and

2076
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:48,000
it actually succeeded now in this case

2077
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:51,358
if you look at the things that it found

2078
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,039
you say like okay i mean

2079
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:54,639
these are not famous conjectures yes

2080
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,839
okay so like somebody wrote this down

2081
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:59,679
maybe this is so

2082
01:04:55,838 --> 01:05:00,719
um looking at what the ai came up with

2083
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:03,199
you're like

2084
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:04,480
you know i bet if like five grad

2085
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,439
students had thought about that problem

2086
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,880
they wouldn't

2087
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,240
i mean when you see it you're like okay

2088
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:09,599
that is one of the things you might try

2089
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:11,919
if you sort of like

2090
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:14,160
put some work into it still it's pretty

2091
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,400
awesome right but the story i tell

2092
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:18,078
in the book which i'm fascinated by is

2093
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,400
um

2094
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,280
there is there's okay we're gonna go

2095
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,720
back to knots

2096
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,798
it's cool there's a knot called the

2097
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:25,759
conway knot after john conway maybe

2098
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:28,000
we'll talk about a very interesting

2099
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,440
character also he has a small tangent

2100
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,838
somebody i was supposed to talk to and

2101
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,000
unfortunately he passed away and

2102
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:35,519
he's he's somebody i find is an

2103
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,079
incredible mathematician incredible

2104
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:37,838
human being

2105
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,519
oh and i am sorry that you didn't get a

2106
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:40,719
chance because having had the chance to

2107
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:41,679
talk to him a lot when i was you know

2108
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:44,399
when i was a postdoc

2109
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:45,679
um yeah you missed out there's no way to

2110
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,559
sugarcoat it i'm sorry that you didn't

2111
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:50,078
get that chance

2112
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:52,400
yeah it is what it is so knots

2113
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,839
yeah so there was a question and again

2114
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,960
it doesn't matter the technicalities of

2115
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:56,719
the question but it's a question of

2116
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,639
whether the knot is slice it has to do

2117
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,318
with um

2118
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:01,679
something about what kinds of

2119
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:03,279
three-dimensional surfaces in four

2120
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:04,719
dimensions can be bounded by this knot

2121
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,599
but never mind what it means it's some

2122
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:07,759
question

2123
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,880
uh and it's actually very hard to

2124
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,640
compute whether or not

2125
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:15,200
is slice or not um

2126
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:16,798
and in particular the question of the

2127
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:19,038
conway knot

2128
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:20,480
whether it was slice or not was

2129
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:24,079
particularly

2130
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:26,079
vexed um until it was solved just a few

2131
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:27,200
years ago by lisa picarillo who actually

2132
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:28,640
now that i think of it was here in

2133
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,239
austin i believe she was a grad student

2134
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:31,358
at ut austin at the time i didn't even

2135
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,118
realize there was an austin connection

2136
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:34,880
to this story until i started

2137
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,640
telling it she is in fact i think she's

2138
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,000
now at mit so she's basically following

2139
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:39,679
you around

2140
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,798
if i remember correctly the reverse

2141
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:42,000
there's a lot of really interesting

2142
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:43,920
richness to this

2143
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,440
story one thing about it is her paper

2144
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,680
was rather

2145
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:49,200
was very short it was very short and

2146
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,639
simple nine pages of which two were

2147
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,118
pictures

2148
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:54,400
uh very short for like a paper solving a

2149
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:55,519
major conjecture

2150
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,119
and it really makes you think about what

2151
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:58,639
we mean by difficulty in mathematics

2152
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:00,000
like do you say oh actually the problem

2153
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,920
wasn't difficult because you could solve

2154
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,679
it so simply or do you say like well no

2155
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,400
evidently it was difficult because like

2156
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:05,919
the world's top

2157
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,200
topologist many you know worked on it

2158
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,400
for 20 years and nobody could solve it

2159
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:09,838
so therefore it is difficult

2160
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,000
or is it that we need sort of some new

2161
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:13,599
category of things that about which

2162
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,599
it's difficult to figure out that

2163
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,920
they're not difficult

2164
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,280
i mean this is the computer science

2165
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,639
formulation but

2166
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:24,559
the sort of the the journey to arrive

2167
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:26,558
at the simple answer may be difficult

2168
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,119
but once you have the answer

2169
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,640
it will then appear simple and i mean

2170
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,920
there might be a large category

2171
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:37,358
i hope there's a large uh set

2172
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:40,559
of such solutions

2173
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:42,239
because um you know

2174
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,760
once we stand at the end of the

2175
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:45,279
scientific process that we're at the

2176
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,839
very beginning

2177
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,119
of or at least it feels like i hope

2178
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:50,000
there's just simple answers to

2179
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,440
everything

2180
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,119
that we'll look and it'll be simple laws

2181
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,559
that govern the universe

2182
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,200
simple explanation of what is

2183
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:02,240
consciousness of what is

2184
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:05,439
love is mortality fundamental to life

2185
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:07,519
what's the meaning of life uh

2186
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:10,159
are are humans special or we're just

2187
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:13,119
another sort of reflection of uh

2188
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:14,399
and all that is beautiful uh in the

2189
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:16,560
universe in terms of like

2190
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,239
life forms all of it is life and just

2191
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,839
has different

2192
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:22,079
when taken from a different perspective

2193
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:23,679
is all life can seem more valuable or

2194
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:24,158
not but really it's all part of the same

2195
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,000
thing

2196
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:28,238
all those will have a nice like two

2197
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,319
equations maybe one equation

2198
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:32,639
why do you think you want those

2199
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:35,839
questions to have simple answers

2200
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:37,359
i think just like symmetry and the

2201
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:39,920
breaking of symmetry is beautiful

2202
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,279
somehow there's something beautiful

2203
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,079
about simplicity

2204
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:45,040
i think it so it's static it's aesthetic

2205
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:47,920
yeah i

2206
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:50,798
or but it's aesthetic in the way that uh

2207
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,838
happiness is an aesthetic

2208
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:56,560
like uh why is that so joyful that a

2209
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:59,679
simple explanation

2210
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,159
that governs a large number of cases is

2211
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:05,440
really appealing

2212
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:07,278
even when it's not like obviously we

2213
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:09,678
get a huge amount of trouble with that

2214
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:11,520
because oftentimes

2215
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,520
it doesn't have to be connected with

2216
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,600
reality or even that explanation could

2217
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:18,239
be exceptionally harmful

2218
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,798
most of like the world's history that

2219
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,959
has

2220
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:22,880
that was governed by hate and violence

2221
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,920
had a very simple explanation at the

2222
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,319
court

2223
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,000
that was used to cause the violence and

2224
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,640
the hatred so like we get into trouble

2225
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,960
with that

2226
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,480
but why is that so appealing and in this

2227
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,399
nice forms

2228
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:36,479
in mathematics like you look at the

2229
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:38,559
einstein papers

2230
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,479
why are those so beautiful and why is

2231
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,839
the andrew wiles proof of the farm

2232
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,599
ozilized theorem

2233
01:09:41,838 --> 01:09:45,600
not quite so beautiful like what's

2234
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,400
beautiful about that story

2235
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,159
is the human struggle of like the human

2236
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:53,119
story of perseverance

2237
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:54,000
of the drama of not knowing if the proof

2238
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:55,679
is correct and

2239
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,198
ups and downs and all those kinds of

2240
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,560
things that's the interesting part but

2241
01:09:57,198 --> 01:09:59,839
the fact that the proof is huge and

2242
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,360
nobody understands well

2243
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,279
from my outsider's perspective nobody

2244
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:06,079
understands what the heck it is

2245
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:06,639
uh is is not as beautiful as it could

2246
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:08,880
have been

2247
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,079
i wish it was what fermat originally

2248
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,679
said which is

2249
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:15,439
you know it's it's not

2250
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,119
it's not small enough to fit in the

2251
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:19,279
margins of this page

2252
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:21,039
but maybe if he had like a full page or

2253
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:22,880
maybe a couple post-it notes he would

2254
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:25,359
have enough to do the proof

2255
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,600
what do you make of if we could take

2256
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:28,880
another of a multitude of tangents

2257
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,719
what do you make of fermat's last

2258
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,039
theorem because the statement there's a

2259
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,158
few

2260
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:35,920
theorems there's a few problems that are

2261
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:37,679
deemed by the world throughout its

2262
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,000
history to be exceptionally difficult

2263
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,800
and

2264
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,399
that one in particular is uh really

2265
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,360
simple to formulate

2266
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:46,158
and really hard to come up with a proof

2267
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:49,359
for

2268
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:51,839
and it was like taunted as simple

2269
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:53,920
uh by from himself there's something

2270
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:57,199
interesting to be said about

2271
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,158
that x to the n plus y to the n equals z

2272
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:01,359
to the n for n

2273
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:02,479
of three or greater is there a solution

2274
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:03,920
to this

2275
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:06,158
and then how do you go about proving

2276
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,640
that like how would you

2277
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:09,439
uh try to prove that and what do you

2278
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,960
learn from

2279
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:12,960
the proof that eventually emerged by

2280
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,359
andrew wiles yeah so right to sort of

2281
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,480
give

2282
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:16,399
let me just say the background because i

2283
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:18,319
don't know if everybody listening knows

2284
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:21,920
the story so you know fermat

2285
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:23,039
uh was an early number theorist not

2286
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,520
really sort of an early mathematician

2287
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:25,198
those

2288
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,280
special adjacent didn't really exist

2289
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:28,799
back then

2290
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:31,359
he comes up in the book actually in the

2291
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,880
context of um a different theorem of his

2292
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:34,079
that has to do with testing whether a

2293
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,319
number is prime

2294
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:38,238
or not so i write about he was one of

2295
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:39,679
the ones who was salty and like he would

2296
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:41,198
exchange these letters where

2297
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:42,880
he and his correspondence would like try

2298
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:44,238
to top each other and

2299
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,239
vex each other with questions and stuff

2300
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:49,678
like this but this particular thing

2301
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:54,158
um it's called fermazl's theorem because

2302
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:56,640
it's a note he wrote uh in

2303
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:58,719
in his uh in his copy of the description

2304
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,800
arithmetic eye like he wrote

2305
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,840
here's an equation it has no solutions i

2306
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:03,360
can prove it but

2307
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,199
the proof's like a little too long to

2308
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:06,479
fit in this in the margin of this

2309
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:08,479
book he was just like writing a note to

2310
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:09,678
himself now let me just say historically

2311
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:12,000
we know that vermont did not have a

2312
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:12,640
proof of this theorem for a long time

2313
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,479
people like

2314
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,079
you know people were like this

2315
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:17,119
mysterious proof that was lost a very

2316
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:21,279
romantic story right

2317
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:23,359
but fairmont later

2318
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:24,399
he did prove special cases of this

2319
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:26,079
theorem and

2320
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:28,238
wrote about it to talk to people about

2321
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:29,679
the problem uh it's very clear from the

2322
01:12:28,238 --> 01:12:31,198
way that he wrote where he can solve

2323
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,000
certain examples of this type of

2324
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:34,960
equation

2325
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,679
that he did not know how to do the whole

2326
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,719
thing

2327
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:40,960
he may have had a deep

2328
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,640
simple intuition about this how to solve

2329
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,760
the whole thing that he had at that

2330
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,000
moment

2331
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,000
without ever being able to come up with

2332
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,719
a complete proof and that intuition may

2333
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,439
be lost to time

2334
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:55,520
maybe but i think we so but you're right

2335
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:57,678
that is unknowable but i think what we

2336
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,280
can know is that later he certainly did

2337
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,039
not think that he had a proof that he

2338
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:04,000
was concealing from people he

2339
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:05,359
yes uh he thought he didn't know how to

2340
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,399
prove it and i also think he didn't know

2341
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:09,439
how to prove it

2342
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:10,238
now i understand the appeal of saying

2343
01:13:09,439 --> 01:13:12,079
like

2344
01:13:10,238 --> 01:13:14,559
wouldn't it be cool if this very simple

2345
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:16,479
equation there was like a very simple

2346
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,760
clever wonderful proof that you could do

2347
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:18,879
in a page or two and

2348
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,400
that would be great but you know what

2349
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,000
there's lots of equations like that that

2350
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:22,799
are solved by very clever methods like

2351
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,079
that including

2352
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,279
the special cases that female wrote

2353
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:26,880
about the method of descent which is

2354
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:30,960
like very wonderful and important

2355
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:32,480
but in the end those are

2356
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,079
nice things that like you know you teach

2357
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:36,399
in an undergraduate class

2358
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:38,158
um and it is what it is but they're not

2359
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:41,039
big

2360
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:42,319
um on the other hand work on the fermat

2361
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:42,719
problem that's what we like to call it

2362
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:44,319
because

2363
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,640
it's not really his theorem because we

2364
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:49,599
don't think he proved it so i mean

2365
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,960
work on the vermont problem developed

2366
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,000
this like incredible

2367
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:56,000
richness of number theory that we now

2368
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,158
live in today like and not by the way

2369
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,279
just wilds andrew wiles being

2370
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:01,599
the first new together with richard

2371
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:02,800
taylor finally proved this theorem

2372
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,960
but you know how you have this whole

2373
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,400
moment that people try to prove this

2374
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,239
theorem and they fail

2375
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:10,319
and there's a famous false proof by

2376
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:12,879
lemay from the 19th century

2377
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:14,399
where kumar in understanding what

2378
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,880
mistake lemay had made

2379
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:18,479
in this incorrect proof basically

2380
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,880
understands something incredible which

2381
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:20,959
is that

2382
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,520
you know a thing we know about numbers

2383
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:25,119
is that um

2384
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,800
you can factor them and you can factor

2385
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:28,640
them uniquely

2386
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,079
there's only one way to break a number

2387
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,560
up into primes

2388
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:34,719
like if we think of a number like 12 12

2389
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:38,320
is two times three

2390
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:39,679
times two i had to think about it right

2391
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:41,439
or it's two times two times three of

2392
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,119
course you can reorder them right

2393
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:44,639
but there's no other way to do it

2394
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:45,920
there's no universe in which 12 is

2395
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,360
something times five

2396
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,119
or in which there's like four threes in

2397
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:49,920
it nope 12 is like two twos and a three

2398
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:51,359
like that

2399
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,440
is what it is and that's such a

2400
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:55,519
fundamental feature

2401
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:56,879
of arithmetic that we almost think of it

2402
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,080
like god's law you know what i mean it

2403
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,079
has to be that way

2404
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:01,359
that's a really powerful idea it's it's

2405
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:03,679
so cool

2406
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:05,759
that every number is uniquely made up of

2407
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:08,800
other numbers

2408
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,800
and like made up meaning like there's

2409
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,840
these like basic atoms

2410
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,760
that form molecules that for that

2411
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,880
get built on top of each other i love it

2412
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:20,320
i mean when i teach you know

2413
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:22,239
undergraduate number theory it's like

2414
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:23,439
it's the first really deep theorem that

2415
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:25,359
you prove

2416
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:27,839
what's amazing is you know the fact that

2417
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:30,158
you can factor a number into primes

2418
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,360
is much easier essentially euclid knew

2419
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:32,238
it although he didn't quite put it in

2420
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:34,399
that

2421
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:36,799
in that way the fact that you can do it

2422
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:38,879
at all what's deep is the fact that

2423
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,560
there's only one way to do it that or

2424
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,400
however you sort of chop the number up

2425
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:46,880
you end up with the same set of

2426
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:49,920
prime factors um and indeed what people

2427
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:52,560
finally understood uh at the end of the

2428
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,520
19th century is that if you work in

2429
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,120
number systems

2430
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,760
slightly more general than the ones

2431
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:57,760
we're used to

2432
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:04,158
which it turns out are relevant for ma

2433
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:07,279
all of a sudden this stops being true

2434
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:08,479
things get i mean things get more

2435
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:09,679
complicated and now

2436
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:10,879
because you were praising simplicity

2437
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,560
before you were like it's so beautiful

2438
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,719
unique factorization

2439
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,159
uh it's so great like so when i tell you

2440
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,239
that in more general number

2441
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:19,599
systems there is no unique factorization

2442
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:21,279
maybe you're like that's bad i'm like no

2443
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,280
that's good because there's like a whole

2444
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:24,319
new world of phenomena to study that you

2445
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,759
just can't see

2446
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:27,920
through the lens of the numbers that

2447
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:31,039
we're used to so i'm

2448
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,399
i'm for complication i'm highly in favor

2449
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:34,000
of complication

2450
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:35,839
and every complication is like an

2451
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,439
opportunity for new things to study

2452
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:41,119
and is that the big uh kind of uh one of

2453
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:43,119
the big insights for you from uh

2454
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:45,359
andrew wiles is proof is there

2455
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:48,079
interesting insights about

2456
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,960
the process they use to prove that sort

2457
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:51,439
of

2458
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,560
resonates with you as a mathematician is

2459
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:54,238
there an interesting concept that

2460
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,400
emerged from it

2461
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:58,000
is there interesting human aspects to

2462
01:16:56,399 --> 01:16:59,359
the proof

2463
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,439
whether there's interesting human

2464
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:02,719
aspects to the proof itself is an

2465
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:04,960
interesting question

2466
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:06,800
certainly it has a huge amount of

2467
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,640
richness sort of at its heart

2468
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,640
is an argument of on of what's called

2469
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:14,320
deformation theory

2470
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:18,159
um which was in part

2471
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:19,759
created by my my phd advisor barry mazar

2472
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:21,839
can you speak to what deformation theory

2473
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,440
is i can speak to what it's like

2474
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,960
sure how about that what does it rhyme

2475
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:27,198
with right

2476
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,319
well the reason that barry called it

2477
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:29,759
deformation theory

2478
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:31,759
i think he's the one who gave it the

2479
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,320
name um i hope i'm not wrong and saying

2480
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,640
this one dave

2481
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:36,319
in your book you have calling different

2482
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,400
things by the same name

2483
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:40,319
as one of the things in the beautiful

2484
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:42,079
map that opens the book

2485
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:43,359
yes and this is a perfect example so

2486
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:45,600
this is another phrase of

2487
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:46,960
poincare this like incredible generator

2488
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,320
of slogans and aphorisms he said

2489
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,760
mathematics is the art of calling

2490
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:52,238
different things by the same name

2491
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,440
that very thing that very thing we do

2492
01:17:52,238 --> 01:17:54,559
right when we're like this triangle and

2493
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:55,678
this triangle come on they're the same

2494
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,320
triangle they're just in a different

2495
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,760
place right

2496
01:17:56,319 --> 01:18:01,439
so in the same way um it came to be

2497
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:06,640
understood that

2498
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:06,639
the kinds of objects that you study uh

2499
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:10,079
when you study when you study for

2500
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:12,238
maslow's theorem

2501
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:14,319
and let's not even be too careful about

2502
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:14,959
what these objects are i can tell you

2503
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:16,639
there are gal

2504
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,319
representations in modular forms but

2505
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,920
saying those words

2506
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:21,679
is not going to mean so much but

2507
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,560
whatever they are they're things that

2508
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:26,319
can be

2509
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:28,880
deformed moved around a little bit and

2510
01:18:26,319 --> 01:18:30,238
um i think the inside of what andrew and

2511
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,359
and then andrew and richard were able to

2512
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:33,678
do

2513
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:35,198
was to say something like this um

2514
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:36,800
deformation means

2515
01:18:35,198 --> 01:18:38,319
moving something just a tiny bit like an

2516
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,719
infinitesimal amount

2517
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:42,559
um if you really are good at

2518
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,960
understanding which ways a thing can

2519
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,600
move

2520
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,800
in a tiny tiny tiny infinitesimal amount

2521
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,560
in certain directions

2522
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,719
maybe you can piece that information

2523
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,400
together to understand the whole global

2524
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:54,000
space in which it can move

2525
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:56,079
and essentially their argument comes

2526
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,319
down to showing that two of those

2527
01:18:56,079 --> 01:19:00,079
big global spaces are actually the same

2528
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:02,399
the fabled r equals t

2529
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:03,519
part of uh part of their proof which is

2530
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:06,839
at the heart of it

2531
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:09,760
um and it involves this very

2532
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:10,480
careful uh principle like that but that

2533
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,000
being said

2534
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:15,279
what i just said it's probably not what

2535
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,760
you're thinking because what you're

2536
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:17,359
thinking

2537
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,800
when you think oh i have a point in

2538
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:20,839
space and i move it around like a little

2539
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:23,199
tiny bit

2540
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:27,039
um you're using

2541
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:28,238
um your notion of distance that's you

2542
01:19:27,039 --> 01:19:29,198
know from calculus

2543
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:31,519
we know what it means for like two

2544
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:32,879
points on the real line to be close

2545
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,760
together

2546
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,039
so i get another thing that comes up in

2547
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,119
the book a lot

2548
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:42,960
is this fact that the notion of distance

2549
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:44,559
is not given to us by god we could mean

2550
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,920
a lot of different things by distance

2551
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,199
and just in the english language we do

2552
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,880
that all the time we talk about somebody

2553
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:50,158
being a close relative

2554
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,640
it doesn't mean they live next door to

2555
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:54,158
you right it means something else

2556
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,840
there's a different notion of distance

2557
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:57,439
we have in mind and there are lots of

2558
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:59,440
notions of distances

2559
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,960
that you could use you know in the

2560
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:02,879
natural language processing community

2561
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,119
and ai there might be some notion of

2562
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:07,119
semantic distance or lexical distance

2563
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,800
between two words how much do they tend

2564
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:10,238
to arise in the same context that's

2565
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,440
incredibly important

2566
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:13,919
for um you know doing autocomplete and

2567
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:15,279
like

2568
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,319
machine translation and stuff like that

2569
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:17,279
and it doesn't have anything to do with

2570
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:18,479
are they next to each other in the

2571
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:19,198
dictionary right it's a different kind

2572
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:21,678
of distance

2573
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:22,319
okay ready in this kind of number theory

2574
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:24,639
there was a

2575
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:26,079
crazy distance called the periodic

2576
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:27,119
distance i didn't write about this that

2577
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:28,319
much in the book because even though i

2578
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:29,679
love it it's a big part of my research

2579
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:30,319
life it gets a little bit into the weeds

2580
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:31,440
but

2581
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:33,599
your listeners are going to hear about

2582
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:35,919
it now please where

2583
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,600
you know what a normal person says when

2584
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,279
they say two numbers are close

2585
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,880
they say like you know their difference

2586
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:42,399
is like a small number like seven and

2587
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,319
eight are close because their difference

2588
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:47,039
is one and one's pretty small

2589
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:48,399
um if we were to be what's called a two

2590
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:50,960
attic number theorist

2591
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:51,839
we'd say oh two numbers are close if

2592
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,520
their difference

2593
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:58,840
is a multiple of a large power of two

2594
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:02,320
so like so like one and

2595
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:04,960
49 are close because their difference is

2596
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:06,559
48 and 48 is a multiple of 16 which is a

2597
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,639
pretty large power of two

2598
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,600
whereas whereas one and two are pretty

2599
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:12,000
far away

2600
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,520
because the difference between them is

2601
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,359
one which is not even a multiple of a

2602
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,960
power of 2 at all it's odd

2603
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:18,719
you want to know what's really far from

2604
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:22,560
1 like

2605
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:24,560
1 and 1 64. because their difference is

2606
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,360
a negative power of 2

2607
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:28,480
2 to the minus 6. so those points are

2608
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:32,079
quite quite fast

2609
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:35,039
the power of a large n would be too

2610
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:37,039
cool if that's the difference between

2611
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:39,519
two numbers and they're close

2612
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:40,158
yeah so two to a large power is this

2613
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,639
multiplication

2614
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:43,198
very small number and two to a negative

2615
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:45,600
power

2616
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:46,879
is a very big number that's two attic

2617
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,960
okay uh

2618
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,639
i can't even visualize that it takes

2619
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,000
practice it takes practice if you've

2620
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:54,000
ever heard of the cantor set it looks

2621
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,319
kind of like that

2622
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,119
so it is crazy that this is good for

2623
01:21:56,319 --> 01:21:58,238
anything right

2624
01:21:57,119 --> 01:21:59,599
i mean this just sounds like a

2625
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:00,479
definition that someone would make up to

2626
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,600
torment you

2627
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:07,519
but what's amazing is there's a general

2628
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:08,880
theory of distance where you say any

2629
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,719
definition you make that satisfies

2630
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,920
certain axioms deserves to be called a

2631
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:14,000
distance and this

2632
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:16,158
see i'm starting to interrupt uh my

2633
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,639
brain you broke my brain now awesome

2634
01:22:16,158 --> 01:22:20,238
uh 10 seconds ago uh because i'm also

2635
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:23,039
starting to map

2636
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:24,079
for the two added case to binary numbers

2637
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:25,439
and sure you know because

2638
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:26,719
because we romanticized those sauce

2639
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:27,919
trunks oh that's exactly the right way

2640
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:29,679
to think of it i was trying to

2641
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:31,760
mess with number you know i was trying

2642
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,960
to see okay which ones are close

2643
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:35,520
and then i'm starting to visualize

2644
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,439
different binary numbers and how they

2645
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:39,520
which ones are close to each other and

2646
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:41,119
uh i'm not sure well i think there's

2647
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,480
no it's very similar that's exactly the

2648
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:44,399
way to think of it it's almost like

2649
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:46,319
binary numbers written in reverse

2650
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:47,759
right because in a in a binary expansion

2651
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:49,679
two numbers are closed a number that's

2652
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,639
small is like point zero zero zero zero

2653
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,760
something

2654
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,520
something that's the decimal and it

2655
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,639
starts with a lot of zeros in the two

2656
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,840
attic metric

2657
01:22:54,639 --> 01:23:00,480
a binary number is very small if it

2658
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,520
ends with a lot of zeros and then the

2659
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:03,039
decimal point

2660
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,480
got you so it is kind of like binary

2661
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:04,960
numbers written backwards is actually i

2662
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,279
should have

2663
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,760
that's what i should have said lex

2664
01:23:07,279 --> 01:23:11,599
that's a very good metaphor

2665
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:14,079
okay but so why is that why is that

2666
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:17,440
interesting except for the fact that uh

2667
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:19,600
it's it's it's a beautiful kind of uh

2668
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:20,879
framework different kind of framework

2669
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,560
which you think about distances

2670
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,400
and you're talking about not just the

2671
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,400
two attic but the generalization of that

2672
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,679
yeah the mep and so so that because

2673
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:29,279
that's the kind of deformation that

2674
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:32,079
comes up

2675
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:33,439
in wiles is in wiles as proof that

2676
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:34,399
defamation we're moving something a

2677
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,519
little bit

2678
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:39,039
means a little bit in this to addiction

2679
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:40,239
okay no i mean it's such i mean i could

2680
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:42,000
just get excited to talk about it and i

2681
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:44,559
just taught this like in the fall

2682
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,520
semester that um but it like

2683
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:49,360
reformulating

2684
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:51,840
why is uh

2685
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:53,839
so you pick a different uh measure of

2686
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,079
distance

2687
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,960
over which you can talk about very tiny

2688
01:23:56,079 --> 01:23:59,679
changes

2689
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,239
and then use that to then prove things

2690
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,359
about

2691
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:06,479
the entire thing yes although you know

2692
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:08,000
honestly what i would say

2693
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:09,519
i mean it's true that we use it to prove

2694
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,479
things but i would say we use it to

2695
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,760
understand things

2696
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:13,678
and then because we understand things

2697
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,719
better then we can prove things but you

2698
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,399
know the goal is always the

2699
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,319
understanding the goal is not

2700
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:20,079
so much to prove things the goal is not

2701
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:21,119
to know what's true or false i mean this

2702
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:22,559
is something i write about in the book

2703
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:24,960
near the end and it's something that

2704
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,400
it's a wonderful wonderful essay by by

2705
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,679
bill thurston

2706
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:29,119
kind of one of the great geometers of

2707
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,319
our time who unfortunately passed away a

2708
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:33,198
few years ago

2709
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:34,719
um called on proof and progress in

2710
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:36,000
mathematics and he writes very

2711
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:37,920
wonderfully about how

2712
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,679
you know we're not it's not a theorem

2713
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:41,119
factory where we have a

2714
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:43,039
production quota i mean the point of

2715
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:44,238
mathematics is to help humans understand

2716
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:46,399
things

2717
01:24:44,238 --> 01:24:47,599
and the way we test that is that we're

2718
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:48,960
proving new theorems along the way

2719
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,920
that's the benchmark but that's not the

2720
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,679
goal

2721
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:53,440
yeah but just as a as a kind of

2722
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:55,600
absolutely but as a tool

2723
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:57,359
it's kind of interesting to approach a

2724
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,480
problem by saying

2725
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:03,599
how can i change the distance function

2726
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:05,519
like what the the nature of distance

2727
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,960
because that might start to lead to

2728
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,120
insights

2729
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,520
for deeper understanding like if i were

2730
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:14,800
to try to describe

2731
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,440
human society by a distance two people

2732
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,920
are close

2733
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:19,599
if they love each other right and then

2734
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:22,399
and then start to uh

2735
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,239
and do a full analysis on the everybody

2736
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:26,638
that lives on earth currently the seven

2737
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:28,079
billion people you know and

2738
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,800
from that perspective as opposed to the

2739
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:32,479
geographic perspective of distance

2740
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,480
and then maybe there could be a bunch of

2741
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:37,759
insights about the source of

2742
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:40,399
uh violence the source of uh maybe

2743
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,800
entrepreneurial success or invention or

2744
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:44,799
economic success or different systems

2745
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,239
of communism capitalism start to i mean

2746
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,880
that's i guess what

2747
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:51,279
economics tries to do but really saying

2748
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,880
okay let's think outside the box about

2749
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,439
totally new distance functions that

2750
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:57,440
could unlock something

2751
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:59,519
profound about the space yeah because

2752
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:01,119
think about it okay here's

2753
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,719
i mean now we're gonna talk about ai

2754
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:03,679
which you know a lot more about than i

2755
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:05,119
do so

2756
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:06,480
just you know start laughing

2757
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:08,158
uproariously if i say something that's

2758
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:09,119
completely wrong we both know very

2759
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:11,439
little

2760
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:12,479
relative to what we will know centuries

2761
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:15,119
from now

2762
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:16,479
that is that is a really good humble way

2763
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:17,760
to think about it i like it okay so

2764
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:20,158
let's just go for it

2765
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,880
um okay so i think you'll agree with

2766
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:23,119
this that

2767
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,480
in some sense what's good about ai is

2768
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:26,319
that

2769
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,238
we can't test any case in advance the

2770
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:29,679
whole point of ai is to make our one

2771
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:31,359
point of it i guess is to make

2772
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:34,000
good predictions about cases we haven't

2773
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:35,839
yet seen and in some sense that's always

2774
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,840
going to involve some notion of distance

2775
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:40,000
because it's always going to involve

2776
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:41,360
somehow taking a case we haven't seen

2777
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,520
and saying

2778
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:45,198
what cases that we have seen is it close

2779
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,159
to is it like is it somehow an

2780
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:49,439
interpolation

2781
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:50,879
between now when we do that in order to

2782
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:52,000
talk about things being like other

2783
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,079
things

2784
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
implicitly or explicitly we're invoking

2785
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:56,960
some notion of distance and boy we

2786
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,399
better get it right

2787
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,840
yeah right if you try to do natural

2788
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:01,759
language processing and your idea about

2789
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,039
of distance between words is

2790
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,159
how close they are in the dictionary

2791
01:27:03,039 --> 01:27:05,519
when you write them in alphabetical

2792
01:27:04,158 --> 01:27:08,479
order you are going to get

2793
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,560
pretty bad translations right no the

2794
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:12,479
notion of distance has to come from

2795
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,760
somewhere else yeah that that's

2796
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:15,198
essentially what neural networks are

2797
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,679
doing this what word and bettings are

2798
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:17,678
doing is

2799
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,279
yes coming up with uh in the case of

2800
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:20,480
word embeddings literally like literally

2801
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:21,840
what they are doing is learning a

2802
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:24,638
distance but those are super

2803
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,159
complicated distance functions and it's

2804
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:30,000
almost nice to think

2805
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:31,039
maybe there's a nice transformation

2806
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,600
that's simple

2807
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:34,399
uh sorry this there's a nice formulation

2808
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:38,480
of the distance

2809
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:41,759
again with the simple so you don't

2810
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:43,599
let me ask you about this from an

2811
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,520
understanding perspective there's the

2812
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,719
richard feynman maybe attributed to him

2813
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:51,520
but maybe many others

2814
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:53,039
is this idea that if you can't explain

2815
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:55,760
something simply that you don't

2816
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:55,760
understand it

2817
01:27:56,238 --> 01:28:01,439
in how many cases how often

2818
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:04,479
is that true do you find there's some

2819
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:04,479
profound truth in that

2820
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:09,359
oh okay so you were about to ask is it

2821
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:10,319
true to which i would say flatly no but

2822
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:11,759
then you said

2823
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:13,439
you followed that up with is there some

2824
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,440
profound truth in it and i'm like

2825
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:16,129
okay sure so there's some truth in it

2826
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:20,879
but it's not true

2827
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:22,800
[Laughter]

2828
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,000
this is your mathematician answer the

2829
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,480
truth that is in it

2830
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,238
yeah is that learning to explain

2831
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:31,839
something helps you

2832
01:28:28,238 --> 01:28:32,479
understand it um but real things are not

2833
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:36,079
simple

2834
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:38,799
yeah a few things are most are not

2835
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:39,359
um and i don't to be honest i don't i

2836
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,560
mean i don't

2837
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:41,679
we don't really know whether feynman

2838
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,480
really said that right or something like

2839
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:44,399
that is sort of

2840
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:46,079
disputed but i don't think feynman could

2841
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:47,439
have literally believed that

2842
01:28:46,079 --> 01:28:49,519
whether or not he said it and you know

2843
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:50,000
he was the kind of guy i didn't know him

2844
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,320
but i'm

2845
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,800
reading his writing he liked to sort of

2846
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:56,000
say stuff like stuff that sounded good

2847
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,520
you know what i mean so it's it's

2848
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,359
totally strikes me as the kind of thing

2849
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,679
he could have said because he liked the

2850
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:02,880
way

2851
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:04,399
saying it made him feel but also knowing

2852
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,800
that he didn't like literally mean it

2853
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:08,638
well i definitely have

2854
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,079
have a lot of friends and i've talked to

2855
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:13,119
a lot of physicists and they do

2856
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:14,399
derive joy from believing that they can

2857
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:15,920
explain stuff simply

2858
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:17,759
or believing it's possible to explain

2859
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,199
style simply

2860
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,960
even when the explanation is not

2861
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:23,439
actually that simple like i've

2862
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,960
heard people think that the explanation

2863
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:26,079
is simple and they do the explanation

2864
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,639
and i think

2865
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:30,479
it is simple but it's not capturing the

2866
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:32,560
phenomena that we're discussing

2867
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:35,039
it's capturing it somehow maps in their

2868
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,719
mind but it's it's taking as a

2869
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:38,560
starting point as an assumption that

2870
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:39,920
there's a deep knowledge and a deep

2871
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,000
understanding that's

2872
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,679
that's actually very complicated and the

2873
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
simplicity is almost like a

2874
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,440
almost like a poem about the more

2875
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,679
complicated thing as opposed to

2876
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:53,439
a distillation and i love poems but a

2877
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:55,279
poem is not an explanation

2878
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:56,879
well some people might disagree with

2879
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:58,800
that but certainly from a mathematical

2880
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,600
perspective no poet would disagree with

2881
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,000
it

2882
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,600
no poet would disagree you don't think

2883
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,279
there's some things that can only be

2884
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,520
described

2885
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:08,319
imprecisely i said explanation i don't

2886
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,360
think any poem

2887
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:10,880
i don't think any poet would say their

2888
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:12,479
poem is an explanation they might say

2889
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,319
it's a description they might say it's

2890
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:15,919
sort of capturing sort of

2891
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:17,920
well some people might say the only

2892
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,560
truth is like music

2893
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:22,239
right that the the the not the only

2894
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,960
truth but some truth can only be

2895
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:26,399
expressed through art

2896
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,079
and i mean that's the whole thing we're

2897
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:30,238
talking about religion and myth and

2898
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:32,238
there's some things that uh are limited

2899
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:33,839
cognitive capabilities

2900
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:36,000
and the tools of mathematics or the

2901
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,279
tools of physics are just not going to

2902
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,198
allow us to capture

2903
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:41,679
like it's possible consciousness is one

2904
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:41,678
of those things

2905
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:45,920
yes that is definitely possible but i

2906
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:47,279
would even say

2907
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,639
look unconsciousness is a thing about

2908
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:49,039
which we're still in the dark as to

2909
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:50,960
where

2910
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:53,039
whether there's an explanation we would

2911
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,639
we would understand it as an explanation

2912
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,238
at all by the way okay i got to give

2913
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:57,199
yeah one more amazing poincare quote

2914
01:30:56,238 --> 01:30:58,959
because this guy just never stopped

2915
01:30:57,198 --> 01:31:01,919
coming out with great quotes that

2916
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,198
um you know paul erdish another fellow

2917
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,440
who appears in the book and by the way

2918
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:07,839
he thinks about this notion of distance

2919
01:31:05,439 --> 01:31:08,799
of like personal affinity kind of like

2920
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,319
what you're talking about that kind of

2921
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:11,760
social network and that

2922
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:14,158
notion of distance that comes from that

2923
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:15,520
so that's something that erdos did

2924
01:31:14,158 --> 01:31:16,638
well he thought about distances and

2925
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,600
networks i guess he didn't probably he

2926
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:18,639
didn't think about the social media that

2927
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,159
was fascinating and that's how it

2928
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:22,400
started that story of virtus number yeah

2929
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:22,399
okay

2930
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:25,678
but you know eredish was sort of famous

2931
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,639
for saying and this is sort of long

2932
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:29,279
lines we're saying

2933
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,319
he talked about the book capital t

2934
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:32,319
capital b

2935
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:34,238
the book and that's the book where god

2936
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:35,920
keeps the right proof of every

2937
01:31:34,238 --> 01:31:37,519
theorem so when he saw a proof he really

2938
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,079
liked it was like really elegant really

2939
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,360
simple

2940
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:41,198
like that's from the book that's like

2941
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:44,158
you found one of the ones that's in

2942
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:45,839
the book um he wasn't the religious guy

2943
01:31:44,158 --> 01:31:47,920
by the way he referred to god as the

2944
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,039
supreme fascist he was like uh

2945
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,399
but somehow he was like i don't really

2946
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:51,279
believe in god but i believe in god's

2947
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:55,279
book i mean it was uh

2948
01:31:51,279 --> 01:31:56,639
yeah um but poincare on the other hand

2949
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:58,238
um and by the way there are other

2950
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,760
members hilda hudson is one who comes up

2951
01:31:58,238 --> 01:32:02,638
in this book she also kind of

2952
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,679
saw math um she's one of the people who

2953
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:06,800
sort of develops

2954
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:08,319
um the disease model that we now use

2955
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,079
that we use to sort of track pandemics

2956
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:10,799
this sir model that sort of originally

2957
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:12,319
comes from

2958
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,480
her work with ronald ross but she was

2959
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:17,198
also super super super devout

2960
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:18,718
and she also sort of from the other side

2961
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:20,638
of the religious coin was like yeah math

2962
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,760
is how we communicate with god

2963
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:23,520
she has a great all these people are

2964
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,560
incredibly quotable she says you know

2965
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,560
math isn't

2966
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:28,159
the truth the things about mathematics

2967
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,280
is like they're not the most important

2968
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:30,479
of god thoughts

2969
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:32,479
but they're the only ones that we can

2970
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:33,839
know precisely

2971
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:35,039
so she's like this is the one place

2972
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,480
where we get to sort of see what god's

2973
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:38,719
thinking when we do

2974
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:40,399
mathematics again not a fan of poetry or

2975
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,119
music some people will say hendrix is

2976
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:43,119
like

2977
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:45,198
some some people say chapter one of that

2978
01:32:43,119 --> 01:32:48,800
book is mathematics and then chapter two

2979
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:51,519
is like classic rock right so

2980
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,800
like it's not clear that the i'm sorry

2981
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:54,400
you just sent me off on a tangent just

2982
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,920
imagining like eredish at a hendrick's

2983
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:57,599
concert like trying to sort of figure

2984
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,840
out if it was from

2985
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,600
the book or not but i was what i was

2986
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,880
coming to was justice it but one point

2987
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:07,440
said about this is he's like you know

2988
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,960
if like this has all worked out in the

2989
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:10,960
language of the divine and if a divine

2990
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:12,880
being like came down and

2991
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,800
told it to us we wouldn't be able to

2992
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,719
understand it so it doesn't matter

2993
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,000
so poincare was of the view that there

2994
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:19,279
were things that were sort of like

2995
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,119
inhumanly complex

2996
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:22,880
and that was how they really were our

2997
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:23,599
job is to figure out the things that are

2998
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,159
not like that

2999
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:29,280
that are not like that all this talk of

3000
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:31,599
primes got me hungry for primes

3001
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:33,198
you uh your blog post the beauty of

3002
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,440
bounding gaps a huge

3003
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:38,960
discovery about prime numbers and what

3004
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:40,799
it means for the future of math

3005
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:42,639
can you tell me about prior numbers what

3006
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,400
the heck are those what are twin primes

3007
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:47,199
what are prime gaps what are bounding

3008
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:47,759
gaps and primes what are all these

3009
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:50,559
things

3010
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,159
and what if anything or what exactly is

3011
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:55,679
beautiful about them

3012
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:57,599
yeah so you know prime numbers

3013
01:33:55,679 --> 01:34:00,079
are one of the things that number

3014
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:04,320
theorists study the most and have

3015
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:06,800
for millennia um they are numbers

3016
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:08,639
which can't be factored and then you say

3017
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,719
like like five and then you're like wait

3018
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:13,520
i can't factor five five is

3019
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:15,359
five times one okay not like that that

3020
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,120
is a factorization it absolutely is a

3021
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:18,880
way of expressing five as

3022
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:20,319
a product of two things but don't you

3023
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,520
agree there's like something trivial

3024
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:22,158
about it it's something you can do to

3025
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,920
any number

3026
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:25,359
it doesn't have content the way that if

3027
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,920
i say that 12 is 6

3028
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:29,599
times 2 or 35 is 7 times 5 i've really

3029
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,960
done something to it i've broken up so

3030
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,760
those are the kind of factorizations

3031
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,039
that count

3032
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,840
and a number that doesn't have a

3033
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:39,920
factorization like that is called prime

3034
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:41,920
except historical side note one

3035
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,920
which at some times in mathematical

3036
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,880
history has been deemed to be a prime

3037
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,639
but

3038
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,239
currently is not and i think that's for

3039
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,440
the best but i bring it up only because

3040
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:52,158
sometimes people think that

3041
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:53,519
you know these definitions are kind of

3042
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:56,638
if we think about them hard enough we

3043
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:58,159
can figure out which definition is true

3044
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:59,920
no there's just an artifact in

3045
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:03,279
mathematics so yeah one

3046
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:05,118
so which definition is best for us

3047
01:35:03,279 --> 01:35:06,719
for our purposes well those edge cases

3048
01:35:05,118 --> 01:35:09,439
are weird right so uh

3049
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:11,520
so so it can't you can't be it doesn't

3050
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:13,839
count when you use yourself

3051
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,880
as a number or one as part of the

3052
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:19,039
factorization

3053
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,039
or as the entirety of the factorization

3054
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:22,799
so the so you somehow get to the meat of

3055
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,520
the number

3056
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:27,279
by factorizing it and that's seems to

3057
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:28,960
get to the core of all of mathematics

3058
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:31,118
yeah you take any number and you

3059
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:32,880
factorize it until you can factorize no

3060
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:34,960
more and what you have left is some big

3061
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,199
pile of primes i mean by definition when

3062
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,960
you

3063
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:38,319
can't factor anymore when you when

3064
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,760
you're done you can't

3065
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:42,158
break the numbers up anymore what's left

3066
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,800
must be prime you know 12 breaks into

3067
01:35:42,158 --> 01:35:46,158
two

3068
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:48,079
and two and three um so these numbers

3069
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:51,439
are the atoms the building blocks

3070
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:52,800
of all numbers and there's a lot we know

3071
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:54,000
about them but there's much more we

3072
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,960
don't know them i'll tell you the first

3073
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,960
few there's 2

3074
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:00,079
3 5 7 11.

3075
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,439
by the way they're all going to be odd

3076
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:02,880
from the non because if they were even i

3077
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:04,638
could factor out 2 out of them

3078
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,319
but it's not all the odd numbers 9 isn't

3079
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:08,000
prime because it's 3 times 3

3080
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:10,319
15 isn't prime because it's 3 times 5

3081
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,679
but 13 is where were we 2 3 5

3082
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:16,000
7 11 13 17 19

3083
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:16,960
not 21 but 23 is etcetera etcetera okay

3084
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,560
so you could go on

3085
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:22,319
how high could you go if we were just

3086
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:23,920
sitting here by the way your own brain

3087
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:25,840
continuous without interruption would

3088
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:28,000
you be able to go over a hundred

3089
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,960
i think so there's always those ones

3090
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,639
that trip people up there's

3091
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:32,399
there's a famous one the groton deak

3092
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:33,840
prime 57 like sort of

3093
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:35,679
alexander groddendyk the great algebraic

3094
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:38,000
geometer was sort of giving

3095
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:40,399
some lecture involving a choice of a

3096
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,600
prime in general and somebody said like

3097
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:43,599
can't you just choose a problem he said

3098
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,639
okay 57 which is in fact not prime it's

3099
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,920
three times

3100
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:49,359
19. oh damn but it was like

3101
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:52,239
i promise you in some circles it's a

3102
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:55,679
funny story okay um

3103
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:57,839
but um there's a humor in it uh

3104
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:58,719
yes i would say over a hundred i

3105
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,000
definitely don't

3106
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:07,198
remember like 107 i think i'm not sure

3107
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:10,319
okay like so is there a category of uh

3108
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:13,678
like fake primes that that

3109
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:16,880
are easily mistaken to be prime like 57

3110
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:20,000
i wonder yeah so i would say

3111
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:22,000
57 and take a small 27 and 51

3112
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,679
are definitely like prime offenders oh i

3113
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,840
didn't do that on purpose

3114
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:28,079
well done didn't do it on purpose anyway

3115
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:30,639
they're definitely ones that people uh

3116
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:31,279
or 91 is another classic seven times 13.

3117
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:33,199
it really

3118
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:34,800
feels kind of prime doesn't it but it is

3119
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:36,960
not yeah

3120
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,800
um but there's also by the way but

3121
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,920
there's also an actual notion of

3122
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,960
pseudoprime which is

3123
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,719
which is the thing with the formal

3124
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,359
definition which is not a psychological

3125
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,960
thing

3126
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:47,439
it is a prime which passes a primality

3127
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,000
test

3128
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:50,638
devised by fermat which is a very good

3129
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,719
test which

3130
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:54,400
if if a number fails this test it's

3131
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,840
definitely not prime

3132
01:37:54,399 --> 01:37:57,439
and so there was some hope that oh maybe

3133
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:58,800
if a number passes the test then it

3134
01:37:57,439 --> 01:38:00,559
definitely is prime that would give a

3135
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,400
very simple criterion for formality

3136
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,840
unfortunately it's only perfect in one

3137
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:07,839
direction

3138
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:09,440
so there are numbers i want to say 341

3139
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,119
is the smallest

3140
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:13,279
uh which passed the test but are not

3141
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:14,399
prime 341 is this test easily

3142
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:17,359
explainable or no

3143
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:18,638
uh yes actually um ready let me give you

3144
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:19,920
the simplest version of it you can dress

3145
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:20,800
it up a little bit but here's the basic

3146
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:25,039
idea

3147
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:28,960
uh i take the number the mystery number

3148
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:28,960
i raised two to that power

3149
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:33,920
so let's say your mystery number is six

3150
01:38:32,399 --> 01:38:35,679
yeah are you sorry you asked me are you

3151
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,039
ready no i might you're breaking my

3152
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:38,639
brain again but yes

3153
01:38:37,039 --> 01:38:41,118
let's let's let's do it we're gonna do a

3154
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:43,359
live demonstration um

3155
01:38:41,118 --> 01:38:45,920
let's say your number is six so i'm

3156
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:47,039
going to raise 2 to the sixth power

3157
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:49,039
okay so if i were working out i'd be

3158
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:51,600
like that's 2 cubes squared so that's 8

3159
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:53,519
times 8 so that's 64.

3160
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,880
now we're going to divide by 6 but i

3161
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:57,119
don't actually care what the quotient is

3162
01:38:54,880 --> 01:39:00,400
only the remainder

3163
01:38:57,118 --> 01:39:02,799
so let's see 64 divided by 6

3164
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:05,279
is uh well it's it there's a quotient of

3165
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:07,039
10 but the remainder is 4.

3166
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:08,479
so you failed because the answer has to

3167
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:11,600
be 2.

3168
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:13,118
for any prime let's do it with five

3169
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:17,760
which is prime

3170
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:20,880
two to the fifth is 32 divide 32 by five

3171
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:22,880
uh and you get six with a remainder of

3172
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,800
two

3173
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:26,639
well the remainder of two here for seven

3174
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:29,440
two to the seventh is 128

3175
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:30,480
divide that by seven and let's see i

3176
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:34,399
think that's seven times

3177
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:34,399
14 is that right no

3178
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:41,359
seven times 18

3179
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:42,000
is 126 with a remainder of two right 128

3180
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:43,679
is

3181
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,399
a multiple of seven plus two so if that

3182
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,679
remainder is not two

3183
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:49,439
then that's definitely not that it's

3184
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:52,158
definitely not prime

3185
01:39:49,439 --> 01:39:53,198
and then if it is it's likely a prime

3186
01:39:52,158 --> 01:39:54,638
but not for sure

3187
01:39:53,198 --> 01:39:55,919
it's likely a prime but not for sure and

3188
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:57,118
there's actually a beautiful geometric

3189
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,158
proof which is in the book actually

3190
01:39:57,118 --> 01:39:59,039
that's like one of the most granular

3191
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:00,319
parts of the book because it's such a

3192
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:03,198
beautiful proof i couldn't not give it

3193
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:06,000
so you you draw a lot of like

3194
01:40:03,198 --> 01:40:07,439
opal and pearl necklaces and spin them

3195
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,079
that's kind of the geometric nature of

3196
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:10,238
the

3197
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:11,920
of this proof of fermat's little theorem

3198
01:40:10,238 --> 01:40:13,678
um

3199
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,800
so yeah so with pseudo primes there are

3200
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:15,920
primes that are kind of faking if they

3201
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,440
pass that test but there

3202
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:19,199
are numbers that are faking it that pass

3203
01:40:17,439 --> 01:40:22,960
that test but are not actually prime

3204
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:26,319
um but the point is

3205
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:29,920
um there are many many many

3206
01:40:26,319 --> 01:40:31,118
theorems about prime numbers um

3207
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,800
are there like there's a bunch of

3208
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:34,559
questions to ask is there an infinite

3209
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:36,560
number of primes

3210
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,840
can we say something about the gap

3211
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:39,280
between primes as the

3212
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,880
numbers grow larger and larger and

3213
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:42,719
larger and so on

3214
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:44,639
yeah it's a perfect example of your

3215
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:46,158
desire for simplicity in all things you

3216
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:48,319
know it would be really simple

3217
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:50,319
if there was only finitely many primes

3218
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:52,319
yes and then there would be this sim

3219
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:53,840
finite set of atoms that all numbers

3220
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:56,319
would be built up right

3221
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:58,719
that would be very simple and good in

3222
01:40:56,319 --> 01:40:59,840
certain ways but it's completely false

3223
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,960
and number theory would be totally

3224
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,840
different if that were the case it's

3225
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,000
just not true

3226
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:07,039
um in fact this is something else that

3227
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:09,920
euclid knew so this is a very very old

3228
01:41:07,039 --> 01:41:11,279
fact like much before long before we had

3229
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:12,000
anything like modern numbers that primes

3230
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:13,920
are infinite

3231
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,359
the primes that there are that write the

3232
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,800
there's an infinite number of primes

3233
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:19,198
so what about the gaps between the

3234
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:20,320
primes right so so one thing that people

3235
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:21,519
recognized

3236
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:23,920
and really thought about a lot is that

3237
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:25,840
the primes on average

3238
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,118
seem to get farther and farther apart as

3239
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,960
they get bigger and bigger in other

3240
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:30,639
words it's less and less common

3241
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,319
like i already told you of the first 10

3242
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:33,440
numbers two three five seven four of

3243
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:34,639
them are prime that's a lot forty

3244
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:37,039
percent

3245
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:38,400
if i looked at you know ten digit

3246
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:40,000
numbers

3247
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:41,920
no way would forty percent of those be

3248
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,520
prime being prime would be a lot rarer

3249
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:45,679
in some sense because there's a lot more

3250
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,040
things for them to be divisible by

3251
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:48,560
that's one way of thinking of it it's

3252
01:41:47,039 --> 01:41:50,000
it's a lot more possible for there to be

3253
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,920
a factorization because there's a lot of

3254
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,359
things you can try to factor out of it

3255
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:56,960
as the numbers get bigger and bigger

3256
01:41:53,359 --> 01:41:56,960
primarily gets rarer and rarer

3257
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:01,840
and the extent to which that's the case

3258
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:03,678
that's pretty well understood but then

3259
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:05,119
you can ask more fine-grained questions

3260
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:08,639
and here is one

3261
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:10,479
um a

3262
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:11,679
twin prime is a pair of primes that are

3263
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:14,799
two apart

3264
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:17,920
like three and five or like 11 and 13

3265
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:19,119
or like 17 and 19. and one thing we

3266
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,920
still don't know is

3267
01:42:19,118 --> 01:42:23,359
are there infinitely many of those we

3268
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,639
know on average they get farther and

3269
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:27,679
farther apart but that doesn't mean

3270
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:30,239
there couldn't be like occasional

3271
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:31,039
folks that come close together and

3272
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,079
indeed

3273
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:34,960
uh we think that there are and one

3274
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:37,679
interesting question

3275
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:38,639
i mean this is because i think you might

3276
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:40,880
say like well

3277
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:42,319
why how could one possibly have a right

3278
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:43,359
to have an opinion about something like

3279
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:45,039
that

3280
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:47,599
like what you know we don't have any way

3281
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:50,639
of describing a process that makes

3282
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:51,920
primes like sure you can like

3283
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,760
look at your computer and see a lot of

3284
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,880
them but the fact that there's a lot

3285
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:56,400
why is that evidence that there's

3286
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,760
infinitely many right maybe i can go on

3287
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:59,118
the computer and find 10 million well 10

3288
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:00,880
million 10 million is pretty far from

3289
01:42:59,118 --> 01:43:02,319
infinity right so how is that how is

3290
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:03,760
that evidence there's a lot of things

3291
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:04,559
there's like a lot more than 10 million

3292
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,920
atoms that doesn't mean there's

3293
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,280
infinitely many atoms in the universe

3294
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,719
right i mean on most people's physical

3295
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:10,079
theories there's probably not as i

3296
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:13,118
understand it

3297
01:43:10,079 --> 01:43:16,000
okay so why would we think this

3298
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:16,639
the answer is that we've that it turns

3299
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,600
out to be like

3300
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:21,760
incredibly productive and enlightening

3301
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,360
to think about primes

3302
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,880
as if they were random numbers as if

3303
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:26,319
they were randomly distributed

3304
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,239
according to a certain law now they're

3305
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:28,719
not they're not random there's no chance

3306
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:30,479
involved

3307
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:32,560
it's completely deterministic whether a

3308
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:34,238
number is prime or not and yet

3309
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:36,320
it just turns out to be phenomenally

3310
01:43:34,238 --> 01:43:39,439
useful useful in mathematics

3311
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:41,759
to say even if something is

3312
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:42,960
governed by a deterministic law let's

3313
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,079
just pretend it wasn't

3314
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:45,840
let's just pretend that they were

3315
01:43:44,079 --> 01:43:47,760
produced by some random process and see

3316
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:49,199
if the behavior is roughly the same

3317
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:50,400
and if it's not maybe change the random

3318
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:51,759
process maybe make the randomness a

3319
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:53,679
little bit different and tweak it and

3320
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:55,600
see if you can find a random process

3321
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:57,199
that matches the behavior we see and

3322
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:00,800
then maybe you predict that

3323
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:02,799
other behaviors um of the system are

3324
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,000
like that of the random process

3325
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,119
and so that's kind of like it's funny

3326
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,359
because i think when you talk to people

3327
01:44:05,118 --> 01:44:10,399
about the twin prime conjecture

3328
01:44:07,359 --> 01:44:11,359
people think you're saying wow there's

3329
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:13,519
like some deep

3330
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:15,519
structure there that like makes those

3331
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,920
primes be like close together again and

3332
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:17,600
again

3333
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,440
and no it's the opposite of deep

3334
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:20,880
structure what we say when we say we

3335
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:22,238
believe the twin prime conjecture is

3336
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,800
that we believe the primes are like sort

3337
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:24,718
of

3338
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,239
strewn around pretty randomly and if

3339
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:27,760
they were then by chance you would

3340
01:44:26,238 --> 01:44:29,039
expect there to be infinitely many twin

3341
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,320
primes and we're saying yep we expect

3342
01:44:29,039 --> 01:44:32,319
them to behave just like they would if

3343
01:44:30,319 --> 01:44:34,158
they were random dirt

3344
01:44:32,319 --> 01:44:35,920
the you know the fascinating parallel

3345
01:44:34,158 --> 01:44:37,519
here is uh

3346
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:39,840
i just got a chance to talk to sam

3347
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:42,400
harris and he uses the prime numbers

3348
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,119
as an example often i don't know if

3349
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:46,399
you're familiar

3350
01:44:43,118 --> 01:44:47,039
with who sam is he uses that as an

3351
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:50,238
example

3352
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:53,039
of there being no free will

3353
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:53,599
wait where did you get this well he just

3354
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:56,079
uses

3355
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:58,560
as an example of it might seem like this

3356
01:44:56,079 --> 01:45:01,920
is a random number generator

3357
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:02,560
but it's all like formally defined so if

3358
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:06,319
we keep

3359
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:08,560
getting more and more primes then

3360
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:10,719
like that might feel like a new

3361
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:12,080
discovery and that might feel like a new

3362
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,480
experience but it's not

3363
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:15,920
it was always written in the cards but

3364
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:17,279
it's funny that you say that because a

3365
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:20,800
lot of people think of like

3366
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:23,359
randomness uh the fundamental

3367
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,039
randomness within the nature of reality

3368
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:27,039
might be the source

3369
01:45:25,039 --> 01:45:29,039
of something that we experience as free

3370
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:30,399
will and you're saying it's like useful

3371
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:33,679
to look at prime numbers as

3372
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:36,079
um as a random process

3373
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:37,520
in order to prove stuff about them but

3374
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:38,719
fundamentally of course it's not a

3375
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,480
random process

3376
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:42,480
well not in order to prove some stuff

3377
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:44,079
about them so much as to figure out

3378
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:45,519
what we expect to be true and then try

3379
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:47,359
to prove that here's what you don't want

3380
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:49,119
to do try really hard to prove something

3381
01:45:47,359 --> 01:45:50,960
that's false that makes it really hard

3382
01:45:49,118 --> 01:45:52,158
to prove the thing if it's false

3383
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,158
so you certainly want to have some

3384
01:45:52,158 --> 01:45:55,519
heuristic ways of guessing making good

3385
01:45:54,158 --> 01:45:56,719
guesses about what's true so yeah

3386
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,639
here's what i would say let's you're

3387
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:59,679
going to be imaginary sam harris now yes

3388
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:01,039
like

3389
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:02,480
you are talking about prime numbers and

3390
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:03,840
you are like but prime numbers are

3391
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:05,359
completely deterministic

3392
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,880
and i'm saying like well but let's treat

3393
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:08,719
them like a random process

3394
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,760
and then you say but you're just saying

3395
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:10,960
something that's not true they're not a

3396
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,560
random process or deterministic and i'm

3397
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:13,840
like okay great you hold to your

3398
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,360
insistence that is honoring the process

3399
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:16,719
meanwhile i'm generating insight about

3400
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:17,920
the primes that you're not because i'm

3401
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:19,118
willing to sort of pretend that there's

3402
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,960
something that they're not in order to

3403
01:46:19,118 --> 01:46:23,039
understand what's going on yeah so it

3404
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,760
doesn't matter what the reality is what

3405
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:27,439
matters is

3406
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:29,840
what's uh what framework

3407
01:46:27,439 --> 01:46:30,719
of thought results in the maximum number

3408
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,480
of insights

3409
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:33,760
yeah because i feel look i'm sorry but i

3410
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:35,198
feel like you have more insights about

3411
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:37,600
people if you

3412
01:46:35,198 --> 01:46:39,519
think of them as like beings that have

3413
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:40,000
wants and needs and desires and do stuff

3414
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,000
on

3415
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,359
purpose even if that's not true you

3416
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,800
still understand better what's going on

3417
01:46:43,359 --> 01:46:45,920
by treating them in that way don't you

3418
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,400
find look when you work on machine

3419
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,920
learning

3420
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:49,599
don't you find yourself sort of talking

3421
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:51,359
about what the machine is what the

3422
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:53,199
machine is trying to do

3423
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:54,880
in a certain instance do you not find

3424
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:57,198
yourself drawn to that language

3425
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:58,880
well oh it knows this it's trying to do

3426
01:46:57,198 --> 01:47:01,039
that it's learning that

3427
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,920
i'm certainly drawn to that language to

3428
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:03,519
the point where i

3429
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:05,279
received quite a bit of criticisms for

3430
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:07,520
it because i you know like

3431
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:08,639
oh i'm on your side man so especially in

3432
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,800
robotics

3433
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:12,400
i don't know why but robotics people

3434
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:15,199
don't like to

3435
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:16,960
name their robots or they they certainly

3436
01:47:15,198 --> 01:47:18,638
don't like to gender their robots

3437
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:20,560
because the moment you gender a robot

3438
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:23,520
you start to anthropomorphize

3439
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:25,119
if you say he or she you start to you in

3440
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,760
your mind construct like a

3441
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:28,880
um like a life story in your mind you

3442
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,039
can't help it

3443
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:32,800
this like you create like a humorous

3444
01:47:31,039 --> 01:47:35,679
story to this person you start to

3445
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:37,199
understand this person this robot you

3446
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:38,480
start to project your own

3447
01:47:37,198 --> 01:47:40,000
but i think that's what we do to each

3448
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:41,439
other and i think that's actually really

3449
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,920
useful from the engineering

3450
01:47:41,439 --> 01:47:44,638
process especially for human robot

3451
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,719
interaction

3452
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:48,319
and yes for machine learning systems for

3453
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:49,840
helping you build an intuition about a

3454
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:52,960
particular problem

3455
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:55,520
it's almost like asking this question

3456
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,198
you know when a machine learning system

3457
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,760
fails in a particular edge case

3458
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:00,638
asking like what were you thinking about

3459
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,239
like

3460
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:04,480
like asking like almost like when you're

3461
01:48:02,238 --> 01:48:07,599
talking about to a child

3462
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:10,638
who just does something bad you're

3463
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:12,400
you want to understand like what was um

3464
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:13,840
how did they see the world maybe there's

3465
01:48:12,399 --> 01:48:15,679
a totally new maybe you're the one

3466
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:18,360
that's thinking about the world

3467
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:20,239
incorrectly and uh yeah that

3468
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:21,679
anthropomorphization process i think is

3469
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:22,000
ultimately good for insight and the same

3470
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:24,239
is

3471
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,679
i i i agree with you i tend to believe

3472
01:48:24,238 --> 01:48:27,599
about free will

3473
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:28,800
as well let me ask you a ridiculous

3474
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:32,079
question if it's okay

3475
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:34,639
of course i've just recently

3476
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:35,198
most people go on like rabbit hole like

3477
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:37,679
youtube

3478
01:48:35,198 --> 01:48:39,759
things and i went on a rabbit hole often

3479
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:44,639
do of wikipedia

3480
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:44,639
and i found a page on uh

3481
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:50,079
finitism ultra finitism

3482
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:51,039
and intuitionism or you need to i'm i

3483
01:48:50,079 --> 01:48:53,840
forget what it's called

3484
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:54,880
yeah intuitionism intuitionism that

3485
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,480
seemed pretty

3486
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:58,319
pretty interesting i have my to-do list

3487
01:48:56,479 --> 01:49:00,399
to actually like look into

3488
01:48:58,319 --> 01:49:02,079
like is there people who like formally

3489
01:49:00,399 --> 01:49:03,679
attract like real mathematicians are

3490
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:06,639
trying to argue for this

3491
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:08,158
but the belief there i think let's say

3492
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:11,760
find nitism that

3493
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:11,759
infinity is is fake

3494
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:16,639
meaning um infinity might be like a

3495
01:49:15,359 --> 01:49:18,079
useful hack

3496
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:20,639
for certain like a useful tool in

3497
01:49:18,079 --> 01:49:23,439
mathematics but it really

3498
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:24,880
gets us into trouble because there's no

3499
01:49:23,439 --> 01:49:28,000
infinity

3500
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:30,880
in the real world maybe i'm sort of

3501
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,719
not expressing that uh fully correctly

3502
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,239
but basically saying like there's things

3503
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:37,279
that are

3504
01:49:34,238 --> 01:49:38,319
in once you add into mathematics things

3505
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:41,039
that are not

3506
01:49:38,319 --> 01:49:42,158
provably within the physical world

3507
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:45,198
you're starting to

3508
01:49:42,158 --> 01:49:48,000
inject to corrupt your

3509
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:49,118
framework of reason what do you think

3510
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,560
about that

3511
01:49:49,118 --> 01:49:53,198
i mean i think okay so first of all i'm

3512
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,239
not an expert and

3513
01:49:53,198 --> 01:49:56,879
i couldn't even tell you what the

3514
01:49:54,238 --> 01:49:58,879
difference is between those three terms

3515
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:00,159
finetism ultrafinitism and intuitionism

3516
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,520
although i know they're related i tend

3517
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:02,559
to associate them with the netherlands

3518
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:04,400
in the 1930s

3519
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:06,239
okay i'll tell you can i just quickly

3520
01:50:04,399 --> 01:50:06,799
comment because i read the wikipedia

3521
01:50:06,238 --> 01:50:08,319
page

3522
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:10,560
the difference in ultra like the

3523
01:50:08,319 --> 01:50:11,840
ultimate sentence of the modern age can

3524
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:14,719
i just comment because i read the

3525
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:17,920
wikipedia page that sums up our moment

3526
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:19,679
bro i'm basically an expert ultra ultra

3527
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,239
finitism

3528
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:24,079
so financialism says that the only

3529
01:50:22,238 --> 01:50:25,359
infinity you're allowed to have is that

3530
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:28,238
the natural numbers are

3531
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:29,198
infinite so like those numbers are

3532
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:32,238
infinite

3533
01:50:29,198 --> 01:50:33,439
so like one two three four five the

3534
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:37,439
integers

3535
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:40,719
are internet the ultra financialism says

3536
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:41,359
nope even that infinity's fake that's

3537
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:43,279
fine

3538
01:50:41,359 --> 01:50:44,479
i bet ultra fanatism came second i bet

3539
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:46,079
it's like when there's like a hardcore

3540
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:47,279
scene and then one guy is like

3541
01:50:46,079 --> 01:50:48,559
oh now there's a lot of people in the

3542
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:50,158
scene i have to find a way to be more

3543
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:53,039
hardcore than the hardcore people

3544
01:50:50,158 --> 01:50:54,000
go back to the emo doc yeah okay so is

3545
01:50:53,039 --> 01:50:55,920
there any uh

3546
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,000
are you ever because i'm not often

3547
01:50:55,920 --> 01:51:00,960
uncomfortable with infinity

3548
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,359
like psychologically i i you know i have

3549
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:04,719
i have

3550
01:51:01,359 --> 01:51:07,118
trouble when that sneaks in there

3551
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:08,960
it's because it works so damn well i get

3552
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:11,759
a little suspicious

3553
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:12,560
um because it could be almost like a

3554
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,560
crutch

3555
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:17,440
or an oversimplification that's missing

3556
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:19,760
something profound about reality

3557
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:20,719
well so first of all okay if you say

3558
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:24,159
like

3559
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:25,520
is there like a serious way of doing

3560
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:28,879
mathematics that doesn't

3561
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:30,560
really treat infinity as a real

3562
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:31,599
thing or maybe it's kind of agnostic and

3563
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,199
it's like i'm not really gonna make a

3564
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:34,880
firm statement about whether it's a real

3565
01:51:33,198 --> 01:51:36,238
thing or not yeah that's called most of

3566
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,319
the history of mathematics

3567
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:40,079
right so it's only after cantor right

3568
01:51:38,319 --> 01:51:43,359
that we really are

3569
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:44,880
sort of okay we're gonna like have a

3570
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:45,598
notion of like the cardinality of an

3571
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:48,719
infinite set

3572
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:50,960
and like um do something that you might

3573
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:53,039
call like the modern theory of infinity

3574
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,639
um that said obviously everybody was

3575
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:55,920
drawn to this notion and no not

3576
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:57,359
everybody was comfortable with it look i

3577
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,039
mean this is what happens with newton

3578
01:51:57,359 --> 01:52:00,719
right i mean so

3579
01:51:59,039 --> 01:52:02,479
newton understands that to talk about

3580
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:03,520
tangents and to talk about instantaneous

3581
01:52:02,479 --> 01:52:05,839
velocity

3582
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:08,239
um he has to do something that we would

3583
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:10,639
now call taking a limit

3584
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:12,079
right the fabled dy for dx if you sort

3585
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:13,279
of go back to your calculus class for

3586
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:14,719
those who have taken calculus remember

3587
01:52:13,279 --> 01:52:17,920
this mysterious thing

3588
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:18,800
and you know what is it what is it well

3589
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:22,239
he'd say like

3590
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:23,840
well it's like you sort of um divide the

3591
01:52:22,238 --> 01:52:25,118
length of this line segment

3592
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:26,159
by the length of this other line segment

3593
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:27,359
and then you make them a little shorter

3594
01:52:26,158 --> 01:52:28,399
and you divide again and then you make

3595
01:52:27,359 --> 01:52:29,439
them a little shorter and you divide

3596
01:52:28,399 --> 01:52:30,638
again and then you just keep on doing

3597
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:32,399
that until they're like infinitely short

3598
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:34,639
and then you divide them again

3599
01:52:32,399 --> 01:52:36,238
these quantities that are like they're

3600
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:40,079
not zero

3601
01:52:36,238 --> 01:52:43,359
but they're also smaller than any

3602
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:46,319
actual number these infinite decimals

3603
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:47,920
well people were queasy about it and

3604
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:49,198
they weren't wrong to be queasy about it

3605
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:50,560
right from a modern perspective it was

3606
01:52:49,198 --> 01:52:52,079
not really well formed there's this very

3607
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:54,400
famous critique of newton

3608
01:52:52,079 --> 01:52:56,719
by bishop berkeley where he says like

3609
01:52:54,399 --> 01:52:59,279
what these things you define like

3610
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:00,560
you know they're not zero but they're

3611
01:52:59,279 --> 01:53:03,439
smaller than any number are they the

3612
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:06,639
ghosts of departed quantities

3613
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:09,919
that was this like ultra line

3614
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:11,279
and on the one hand he was right

3615
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:12,480
it wasn't really rigorously modern

3616
01:53:11,279 --> 01:53:14,158
standards on the other hand like newton

3617
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:15,359
was out there doing calculus

3618
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:17,359
and other people were not right it

3619
01:53:15,359 --> 01:53:19,198
worked and it worked

3620
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:20,559
i think i think a sort of intuitionist

3621
01:53:19,198 --> 01:53:23,439
few for instance

3622
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:24,000
i would say would express serious doubt

3623
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:25,118
and by

3624
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,880
it's not by the way it's not just

3625
01:53:25,118 --> 01:53:28,639
infinity it's like saying i think we

3626
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:32,079
would express serious doubt that like

3627
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:33,118
the real numbers exist now most people

3628
01:53:32,079 --> 01:53:36,719
are

3629
01:53:33,118 --> 01:53:38,479
comfortable with the real numbers

3630
01:53:36,719 --> 01:53:40,639
well computer scientists with floating

3631
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:43,279
point number i mean the

3632
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:44,639
floating point of arithmetic that is

3633
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:47,599
that's a great point actually

3634
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:49,199
i think in some sense this flavor of

3635
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:51,360
doing math saying

3636
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:53,279
we shouldn't talk about things that we

3637
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:54,158
cannot specify in a finite amount of

3638
01:53:53,279 --> 01:53:56,000
time there's something very

3639
01:53:54,158 --> 01:53:57,679
computational in flavor about that and

3640
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,238
it's probably not a coincidence that it

3641
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:02,719
becomes popular

3642
01:54:00,238 --> 01:54:04,399
in the 30s and 40s which is also like

3643
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:06,158
kind of like the dawn of

3644
01:54:04,399 --> 01:54:07,519
ideas about formal computation right you

3645
01:54:06,158 --> 01:54:09,519
probably know the timeline better than i

3646
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,280
do sorry what because popular the

3647
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:13,520
these ideas that maybe we should be

3648
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:14,079
doing math in this more restrictive way

3649
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:16,800
where

3650
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:19,599
even a thing that you know because look

3651
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:21,039
the origin of all this is like

3652
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:22,960
you know number represents a magnitude

3653
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:24,479
like the length of a line like so i mean

3654
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:27,039
the idea that

3655
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:28,000
there's a continuum there's sort of like

3656
01:54:27,039 --> 01:54:31,039
there's like

3657
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,158
um it's pretty old but that you know

3658
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:32,800
just cause something is old doesn't mean

3659
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:34,719
we can't

3660
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:36,079
reject it if we want to well a lot of

3661
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:37,359
the fundamental ideas in computer

3662
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:38,719
science when you talk about the

3663
01:54:37,359 --> 01:54:42,399
complexity

3664
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:42,960
of problems uh to touring himself they

3665
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:46,559
rely on

3666
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,439
an infinity as well the ideas that kind

3667
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:48,800
of challenge that

3668
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:50,879
the whole space of machine learning i

3669
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:52,159
would say challenges that

3670
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:53,760
it's almost like the engineering

3671
01:54:52,158 --> 01:54:56,319
approach to things like the floating

3672
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:59,119
point of arithmetic the other one that

3673
01:54:56,319 --> 01:55:00,639
back to john conway that challenges this

3674
01:54:59,118 --> 01:55:03,118
idea

3675
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:04,319
i mean maybe to tying the the ideas of

3676
01:55:03,118 --> 01:55:08,559
deformation theory

3677
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:11,439
and and uh

3678
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:13,920
limits to infinity is this idea of

3679
01:55:11,439 --> 01:55:16,719
cellular automata

3680
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:19,279
with uh john conway looking at the game

3681
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:21,359
of life stephen wolfram's work

3682
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:22,639
that i've been a big fan of for a while

3683
01:55:21,359 --> 01:55:23,679
of cellular autonomy i was i was

3684
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:25,359
wondering if you have

3685
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:26,719
if you have ever encountered these kinds

3686
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:27,920
of objects

3687
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:30,840
you ever looked at them as a

3688
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:32,079
mathematician where you have very simple

3689
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:35,599
rules

3690
01:55:32,079 --> 01:55:36,639
of tiny little objects that when taken

3691
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:38,400
as a whole create

3692
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:39,760
incredible complexities but are very

3693
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:42,079
difficult to analyze

3694
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:44,239
very difficult to make sense of even

3695
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:46,000
though the one individual object

3696
01:55:44,238 --> 01:55:47,439
one part it's like what you're saying

3697
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,880
about andrew wiles like you

3698
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:51,279
you can look at the deformation of a

3699
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:54,319
small piece to tell you about the hole

3700
01:55:51,279 --> 01:55:57,920
it feels like with cellular automata

3701
01:55:54,319 --> 01:55:59,439
or any kind of complex systems it's

3702
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:01,920
it's often very difficult to say

3703
01:55:59,439 --> 01:56:04,319
something about the whole thing

3704
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,039
even when you can precisely describe the

3705
01:56:04,319 --> 01:56:09,359
operation

3706
01:56:05,039 --> 01:56:10,960
of uh the sm the local neighborhoods

3707
01:56:09,359 --> 01:56:12,158
yeah i mean i love that subject i

3708
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:13,520
haven't really done research in it

3709
01:56:12,158 --> 01:56:15,118
myself i've played around with it i'll

3710
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,480
send you a fun blog post i wrote where i

3711
01:56:15,118 --> 01:56:17,679
made some cool

3712
01:56:16,479 --> 01:56:19,839
texture patterns from cellular

3713
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:21,840
autonomous um but

3714
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:22,960
um and those are really always

3715
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:24,480
compelling it's like

3716
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:26,079
you create simple rules and they create

3717
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:26,399
some beautiful textures it doesn't make

3718
01:56:26,079 --> 01:56:27,599
any

3719
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:29,039
actually did you see there was a great

3720
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:30,480
paper i don't know if you saw this like

3721
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:31,679
a machine learning paper

3722
01:56:30,479 --> 01:56:32,799
yes i don't know if you want to talk

3723
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:34,639
about where they were like learning the

3724
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:36,320
texture is like let's try to like

3725
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:37,760
reverse engineer and like learn a

3726
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:39,279
cellular automaton that can reduce

3727
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:42,960
texture that looks like this

3728
01:56:39,279 --> 01:56:44,479
from the images very cool and as you say

3729
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:45,840
the thing you said is i feel the same

3730
01:56:44,479 --> 01:56:47,678
way when i read machine learning paper

3731
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,360
is that what's especially interesting is

3732
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:50,800
the cases where it doesn't work

3733
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:52,559
like what does it do when it doesn't do

3734
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:54,320
the thing that you tried to train it

3735
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,000
yeah to do that's extremely interesting

3736
01:56:54,319 --> 01:56:58,000
yeah yeah that was a cool paper

3737
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,439
so yeah so let's start with the game of

3738
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,319
life let's start with

3739
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:03,519
um or let's start with john conway so

3740
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:05,519
conway

3741
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:07,119
so yeah so let's start with john conway

3742
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:08,719
again just i don't know

3743
01:57:07,118 --> 01:57:10,639
from my outsider's perspective there's

3744
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:12,239
not many mathematicians

3745
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:13,679
that stand out throughout the history of

3746
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:16,319
the 20th century

3747
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:18,000
he's one of them i feel like he's not

3748
01:57:16,319 --> 01:57:20,960
sufficiently recognized

3749
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,960
i think he's pretty recognized okay well

3750
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:24,319
i mean

3751
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:25,439
he was a full professor of princeton for

3752
01:57:24,319 --> 01:57:27,039
most of his life he was sort of

3753
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:29,039
certainly at the pinnacle of

3754
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:30,960
yeah but i found myself every time i

3755
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:34,000
talk about conway and how excited

3756
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:34,719
i am about him i have to constantly

3757
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,439
explain to

3758
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:38,079
people who he is and that's that's

3759
01:57:37,439 --> 01:57:40,238
always a

3760
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:41,439
sad sign to me but that's probably true

3761
01:57:40,238 --> 01:57:42,959
for a lot of mathematicians

3762
01:57:41,439 --> 01:57:44,479
i was about to say like i feel like you

3763
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,960
have a very elevated idea of how famous

3764
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:46,000
but

3765
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:47,039
this is what happens when you grow up in

3766
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,760
the soviet union you know you think the

3767
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:52,000
mathematicians are like very very famous

3768
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:53,280
yeah but i'm not actually so convinced

3769
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,560
at a tiny tangent that

3770
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:58,079
that shouldn't be so i mean there's uh

3771
01:57:56,560 --> 01:58:00,560
it's not obvious to me that that's one

3772
01:57:58,079 --> 01:58:02,238
of the like if if i were to analyze

3773
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:04,080
american society that uh

3774
01:58:02,238 --> 01:58:05,598
perhaps elevating mathematical and

3775
01:58:04,079 --> 01:58:06,000
scientific thinking to a little bit

3776
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:09,039
higher

3777
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,719
level would benefit the society well

3778
01:58:09,039 --> 01:58:12,399
both in discovering the beauty of what

3779
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:14,158
it is to be human

3780
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:16,079
and for actually creating cool

3781
01:58:14,158 --> 01:58:18,719
technology better iphones

3782
01:58:16,079 --> 01:58:20,238
but anyway john conway yeah and conway

3783
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:21,840
is such a perfect example of somebody

3784
01:58:20,238 --> 01:58:23,839
whose humanity was

3785
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:25,279
and his personality was like wound up

3786
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,639
with his mathematics right so it's not

3787
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:28,000
sometimes i think people

3788
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:29,920
who are outside the field think of

3789
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,679
mathematics as this kind of like

3790
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:33,359
cold thing that you do separate from

3791
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:35,199
your existence as a human being no way

3792
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:37,198
your personality is in there just as it

3793
01:58:35,198 --> 01:58:38,719
would be in like a novel you wrote or a

3794
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:40,399
painting you painted or just like the

3795
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:42,000
way you walk down the street like it's

3796
01:58:40,399 --> 01:58:43,598
in there it's you doing it

3797
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:46,079
and conway was certainly a singular

3798
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:49,920
personality um

3799
01:58:46,079 --> 01:58:52,559
i think anybody would say that

3800
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:54,158
he was playful like everything was a

3801
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:56,239
game to him

3802
01:58:54,158 --> 01:58:58,000
now what you might think i'm going to

3803
01:58:56,238 --> 01:59:00,799
say and it's true is that he sort of

3804
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,679
was very playful in his way of doing

3805
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,679
mathematics

3806
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:05,359
but it's also true it went both ways he

3807
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:07,118
also sort of made mathematics

3808
01:59:05,359 --> 01:59:09,039
out of games he like looked like he was

3809
01:59:07,118 --> 01:59:10,399
a constant inventor of games with like

3810
01:59:09,039 --> 01:59:12,000
crazy names and

3811
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:15,039
then he would sort of analyze those

3812
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,719
games mathematically um

3813
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:18,639
to the point that he and then later

3814
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:20,719
collaborating with knuth like

3815
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:22,239
you know created this number system the

3816
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:25,039
surreal numbers

3817
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:26,238
in which actually each number is a game

3818
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:27,439
there's a wonderful book about this

3819
01:59:26,238 --> 01:59:28,479
called i mean there are his own books

3820
01:59:27,439 --> 01:59:29,919
and then there's like a book that he

3821
01:59:28,479 --> 01:59:31,118
wrote with burleigh camping guy called

3822
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:35,760
winning ways

3823
01:59:31,118 --> 01:59:38,960
which is such a rich source of ideas

3824
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:41,280
um and he

3825
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:42,800
too kind of has his own crazy number

3826
01:59:41,279 --> 01:59:43,359
system in which by the way there are

3827
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:45,039
these

3828
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:46,639
infinitesimals the ghosts of departed

3829
01:59:45,039 --> 01:59:48,479
quantities they're in there

3830
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:50,719
now not as ghosts but as like certain

3831
01:59:48,479 --> 01:59:55,759
kind of two-player games

3832
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:57,679
um so

3833
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:58,960
you know he was a guy so i knew him when

3834
01:59:57,679 --> 02:00:02,079
i was a postdoc

3835
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:03,679
um and i knew him at princeton and our

3836
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:05,118
research overlapped in some ways now it

3837
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:06,639
was on stuff that he had worked on many

3838
02:00:05,118 --> 02:00:07,839
years before the stuff i was working on

3839
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:08,560
kind of connected with stuff in group

3840
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:13,840
theory which

3841
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:15,520
somehow seems to keep coming up um

3842
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:16,639
and so i often would like sort of ask

3843
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:17,920
him a question i would have come upon

3844
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:19,359
him in the common room and i would ask

3845
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:23,199
him a question about something

3846
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:24,319
and just any time you turned him on you

3847
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:25,039
know what i mean you sort of asked the

3848
02:00:24,319 --> 02:00:27,279
question

3849
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:28,079
it was just like turning a knob and

3850
02:00:27,279 --> 02:00:30,319
winding him up

3851
02:00:28,079 --> 02:00:32,639
and he would just go and you would get a

3852
02:00:30,319 --> 02:00:35,359
response that was like

3853
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:37,199
so rich and went so many places and

3854
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:38,559
taught you so much

3855
02:00:37,198 --> 02:00:40,719
and usually had nothing to do with your

3856
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:43,039
question yeah usually

3857
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:44,079
your question was just to prompt to him

3858
02:00:43,039 --> 02:00:44,719
you couldn't count on actually getting

3859
02:00:44,079 --> 02:00:47,279
the questions

3860
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:48,880
brilliant curious minds even at that age

3861
02:00:47,279 --> 02:00:52,238
yeah it was

3862
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:55,359
definitely a huge loss uh but

3863
02:00:52,238 --> 02:00:56,799
on his game of life which was i think he

3864
02:00:55,359 --> 02:00:59,198
developed in the 70s

3865
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:59,840
as almost like a side thing a fun little

3866
02:00:59,198 --> 02:01:04,238
experience

3867
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:07,679
of life is this um it's a very simple

3868
02:01:04,238 --> 02:01:08,959
algorithm it's not really a game per se

3869
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:10,319
in the sense of the kinds of games that

3870
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:11,520
he liked whereas people played against

3871
02:01:10,319 --> 02:01:14,639
each other and

3872
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:16,480
um but

3873
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:18,639
essentially it's a game that you play

3874
02:01:16,479 --> 02:01:19,919
with marking

3875
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:21,440
little squares on the sheet of graph

3876
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:23,199
paper and in the 70s i think he was like

3877
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:24,638
literally doing it with like a pen

3878
02:01:23,198 --> 02:01:26,158
on graph paper you have some

3879
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:27,359
configuration of squares some of the

3880
02:01:26,158 --> 02:01:29,039
squares in the graphic

3881
02:01:27,359 --> 02:01:31,198
are filled in some are not and then

3882
02:01:29,039 --> 02:01:34,639
there's a rule a single rule

3883
02:01:31,198 --> 02:01:36,879
that tells you um at the next stage

3884
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:38,000
which squares are filled in and which

3885
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,599
squares are not

3886
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:41,279
sometimes an empty square gets filled in

3887
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:42,880
that's called birth sometimes a

3888
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:44,639
square that's filled in gets erased

3889
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:46,400
that's called death and there's rules

3890
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:47,199
for which squares are born which squares

3891
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:50,799
die

3892
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:52,399
um it's um

3893
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:54,719
the rule is very simple you can write it

3894
02:01:52,399 --> 02:01:55,118
on one line and then the great miracle

3895
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:56,800
is

3896
02:01:55,118 --> 02:01:58,238
that you can start from some very

3897
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,760
innocent looking

3898
02:01:58,238 --> 02:02:04,000
little small set of boxes and

3899
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:05,119
get these results of incredible richness

3900
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,399
and of course nowadays you don't do it

3901
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:07,839
on paper nowadays you're doing a

3902
02:02:06,399 --> 02:02:09,759
computer there's actually a great

3903
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:11,520
ipad app called golly which i really

3904
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,760
like that has like

3905
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:15,040
conway's original rule and like gosh

3906
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:16,880
like hundreds of other

3907
02:02:15,039 --> 02:02:18,079
variants and it's lightning fast so you

3908
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:21,279
can just be like i want to see

3909
02:02:18,079 --> 02:02:22,559
10 000 generations of this rule play out

3910
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:24,479
like faster than your eye can even

3911
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,679
follow and it's like amazing so i highly

3912
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:28,000
recommend it if this is at all

3913
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:30,079
intriguing to you getting golly on your

3914
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:32,000
uh ios device and you can do this kind

3915
02:02:30,079 --> 02:02:34,000
of process which i really enjoy doing

3916
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,840
which is almost from like putting a

3917
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,560
darwin hat on or

3918
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:39,760
a biologist head-on and doing analysis

3919
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:41,760
of

3920
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:43,360
a higher level of abstraction like the

3921
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,480
organisms that spring up

3922
02:02:43,359 --> 02:02:46,158
because there's different kinds of

3923
02:02:44,479 --> 02:02:47,839
organisms like you can think of them as

3924
02:02:46,158 --> 02:02:48,559
species and they interact with each

3925
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:50,639
other

3926
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:52,000
they can uh there's gliders they shoot

3927
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:54,639
different there's like

3928
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,840
things that can travel around there's

3929
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:57,760
things that can

3930
02:02:55,840 --> 02:03:00,079
glider guns that can generate those

3931
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:01,920
gliders they they're

3932
02:03:00,079 --> 02:03:03,840
you can use the same kind of language as

3933
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,480
you would about describing a biological

3934
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:06,400
system

3935
02:03:04,479 --> 02:03:08,158
so it's a wonderful laboratory and it's

3936
02:03:06,399 --> 02:03:10,879
kind of a rebuke to someone who

3937
02:03:08,158 --> 02:03:12,399
doesn't think that like very very rich

3938
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:16,400
complex structure can

3939
02:03:12,399 --> 02:03:19,598
come from very simple underlying laws

3940
02:03:16,399 --> 02:03:20,960
like it definitely can now

3941
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:24,480
here's what's interesting if you just

3942
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:26,079
picked like some random rule

3943
02:03:24,479 --> 02:03:26,879
you wouldn't get interesting complexity

3944
02:03:26,079 --> 02:03:29,359
i think that's one of the most

3945
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:31,279
interesting things of these uh

3946
02:03:29,359 --> 02:03:32,639
one of these most interesting features

3947
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:33,759
of this whole subject that the rules

3948
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:36,000
have to be tuned just

3949
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:37,360
right like a sort of typical rule set

3950
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,399
doesn't generate any kind of interesting

3951
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:41,598
behavior

3952
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:43,920
yeah but some do i don't

3953
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:45,199
think we have a clear way of

3954
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:46,239
understanding what's doing which don't i

3955
02:03:45,198 --> 02:03:46,960
don't know maybe stephen thinks he does

3956
02:03:46,238 --> 02:03:48,879
i don't know

3957
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:51,198
but no no it's a giant mystery what

3958
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:55,039
stephen what stephen wolfram did

3959
02:03:51,198 --> 02:03:56,479
is um now there's a whole interesting

3960
02:03:55,039 --> 02:03:57,679
aspect of the fact that he's

3961
02:03:56,479 --> 02:03:59,839
a little bit of an outcast in the

3962
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:02,480
mathematics and physics community

3963
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:03,840
because he's so focused on a particular

3964
02:04:02,479 --> 02:04:06,000
his particular work

3965
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:07,599
i think if you put ego aside which i

3966
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,198
think

3967
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:10,800
unfairly some people are not able to

3968
02:04:09,198 --> 02:04:11,759
look beyond i think his work is actually

3969
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,760
quite brilliant

3970
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:15,760
but what he did is exactly this process

3971
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:18,079
of darwin-like exploration

3972
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:19,840
is taking these very simple ideas and

3973
02:04:18,078 --> 02:04:21,920
writing a thousand page book on them

3974
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:23,360
meaning like let's play around with this

3975
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:25,920
thing let's see

3976
02:04:23,359 --> 02:04:26,399
and can we figure anything out spoiler

3977
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:29,440
alert

3978
02:04:26,399 --> 02:04:31,839
no we can't in fact he does uh

3979
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:33,678
he does a challenge uh i think it's like

3980
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,639
a rule 30 challenge which is quite

3981
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:37,279
interesting just

3982
02:04:34,639 --> 02:04:38,000
simply for machine learning people for

3983
02:04:37,279 --> 02:04:40,800
mathematics

3984
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,679
people is can you predict the middle

3985
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:45,039
column

3986
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:45,920
for his it's a it's a it's a 1d cellular

3987
02:04:45,039 --> 02:04:48,399
automata

3988
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:49,279
can you pre generally speaking can you

3989
02:04:48,399 --> 02:04:51,519
predict

3990
02:04:49,279 --> 02:04:53,039
anything about how a particular rule

3991
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:56,159
will evolve

3992
02:04:53,039 --> 02:04:58,238
just in the future uh very simple

3993
02:04:56,158 --> 02:05:01,598
just look at one particular part of the

3994
02:04:58,238 --> 02:05:03,678
world just zooming in on that part

3995
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:04,719
you know 100 steps ahead can you predict

3996
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:07,599
something

3997
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:08,719
and uh the the the challenge is to do

3998
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:10,000
that kind of prediction

3999
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:12,639
so far as nobody's come up with an

4000
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,039
answer but the point is like

4001
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:16,719
we can't we don't have tools or maybe

4002
02:05:15,039 --> 02:05:18,840
it's impossible or

4003
02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:20,800
i mean he has these kind of laws of

4004
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:22,400
irreducibility they hear firstly but

4005
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,320
it's poetry it's like we can't prove

4006
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:25,679
these things it seems like we can't

4007
02:05:24,319 --> 02:05:27,759
that's the basic

4008
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:29,279
uh it almost sounds like ancient

4009
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:29,599
mathematics or something like that where

4010
02:05:29,279 --> 02:05:32,158
you

4011
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:34,319
like the gods will not allow us to

4012
02:05:32,158 --> 02:05:37,679
predict the cellular automata

4013
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:39,679
but uh that's fascinating that we can't

4014
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:41,359
i'm not sure what to make of it and

4015
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:42,239
there is power to calling this

4016
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:45,359
particular

4017
02:05:42,238 --> 02:05:48,399
set of rules game of life as conway did

4018
02:05:45,359 --> 02:05:50,000
because not actually exactly sure but i

4019
02:05:48,399 --> 02:05:51,679
think he had a sense that there's

4020
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,198
some core ideas here that are

4021
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:56,158
fundamental

4022
02:05:53,198 --> 02:05:59,198
to life to complex systems to the way

4023
02:05:56,158 --> 02:06:01,598
life emerged on earth

4024
02:05:59,198 --> 02:06:02,960
i'm not sure i think conway thought that

4025
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:04,400
it's something that i mean conway always

4026
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:05,840
had a rather ambivalent

4027
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:08,638
relationship with the game of life

4028
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:11,920
because i think he

4029
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:14,560
saw it as it was certainly the thing he

4030
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:17,279
was most famous for in the outside world

4031
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:18,560
and i think that he his view which is

4032
02:06:17,279 --> 02:06:19,759
correct

4033
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:21,440
is that he had done things that were

4034
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:22,000
much deeper mathematically than that you

4035
02:06:21,439 --> 02:06:23,839
know

4036
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,520
and i think it always like grieved him a

4037
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:26,159
bit that he was like the game of life

4038
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:27,599
guy

4039
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:30,399
when you know he proved all these

4040
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:32,000
wonderful theorems and like did i mean

4041
02:06:30,399 --> 02:06:33,519
created all these wonderful games like

4042
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,039
created the serial numbers like i mean

4043
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:36,960
he did i mean

4044
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:38,399
he was a very tireless guy who like just

4045
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:41,198
like did like an incredibly

4046
02:06:38,399 --> 02:06:43,279
variegated array of stuff so he was

4047
02:06:41,198 --> 02:06:44,638
exactly the kind of person who

4048
02:06:43,279 --> 02:06:45,840
you would never want to like reduce to

4049
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:46,719
like one achievement you know what i

4050
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:50,239
mean

4051
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:52,319
let me ask about group theory

4052
02:06:50,238 --> 02:06:53,359
you mentioned a few times what is group

4053
02:06:52,319 --> 02:06:56,319
theory

4054
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:58,479
what is an idea from group theory that

4055
02:06:56,319 --> 02:07:00,719
you find beautiful

4056
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:01,839
well so i would say group theory sort of

4057
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:04,560
starts

4058
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:05,199
as the general theory of symmetry is

4059
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,119
that

4060
02:07:05,198 --> 02:07:09,919
you know people looked at different

4061
02:07:07,118 --> 02:07:13,279
kinds of things and said like

4062
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:15,599
as we said like oh it could have maybe

4063
02:07:13,279 --> 02:07:17,599
all there is is the symmetry from left

4064
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:19,679
to right like a human being right or

4065
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:21,199
that's roughly bilateral bilaterally

4066
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:23,840
symmetric as we say

4067
02:07:21,198 --> 02:07:24,799
so um so there's two symmetries and then

4068
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:26,000
you're like well wait didn't i say

4069
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:28,320
there's just one there's just left

4070
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,920
to right well we always count the

4071
02:07:28,319 --> 02:07:31,679
symmetry of doing nothing

4072
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:33,199
we always count the symmetry that's like

4073
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:34,960
there's flip and don't flip those are

4074
02:07:33,198 --> 02:07:36,238
the two configurations that you can be

4075
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:40,158
in so there's two

4076
02:07:36,238 --> 02:07:41,919
um you know something like a rectangle

4077
02:07:40,158 --> 02:07:43,359
is bilaterally symmetric you can flip it

4078
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:45,679
left to right but you can also flip it

4079
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:47,519
top to bottom

4080
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:48,800
so there's actually four symmetries

4081
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:50,880
there's do nothing

4082
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:53,440
flip it left to right and flip it top to

4083
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:57,359
bottom or do both of those things

4084
02:07:53,439 --> 02:08:00,399
um a square

4085
02:07:57,359 --> 02:08:01,519
um there's even more because now you can

4086
02:08:00,399 --> 02:08:03,118
rotate it

4087
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:04,320
you can rotate it by 90 degrees so you

4088
02:08:03,118 --> 02:08:05,759
can't do that that's not a symmetry of

4089
02:08:04,319 --> 02:08:07,359
the rectangle if you try to rotate it 90

4090
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:08,800
degrees you get a rectangle oriented in

4091
02:08:07,359 --> 02:08:11,839
a different way

4092
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:13,039
so um a person has two symmetries a

4093
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:15,279
rectangle four

4094
02:08:13,039 --> 02:08:17,599
a square eight different kinds of shapes

4095
02:08:15,279 --> 02:08:19,840
have different numbers of symmetries

4096
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:23,760
um and the real observation is that

4097
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:25,920
that's just not like a set of things

4098
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:27,520
they can be combined you do one symmetry

4099
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:30,000
then you do another

4100
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:30,960
the result of that is some third

4101
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,760
symmetry

4102
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:35,439
so a group really abstracts away this

4103
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:37,840
notion of saying

4104
02:08:35,439 --> 02:08:37,839
um

4105
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:41,920
it's just some collection of

4106
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:42,399
transformations you can do to a thing

4107
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:44,319
where you

4108
02:08:42,399 --> 02:08:45,439
combine any two of them to get a third

4109
02:08:44,319 --> 02:08:47,279
so you know a place where this comes up

4110
02:08:45,439 --> 02:08:48,799
in computer sciences and

4111
02:08:47,279 --> 02:08:50,319
is in sorting because the ways of

4112
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:52,079
permuting a set

4113
02:08:50,319 --> 02:08:53,039
the ways of taking sort of some set of

4114
02:08:52,078 --> 02:08:54,158
things you have on the table and putting

4115
02:08:53,039 --> 02:08:56,000
them in a different order

4116
02:08:54,158 --> 02:08:57,519
shuffling a deck of cards for instance

4117
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,800
those are the symmetries of the deck and

4118
02:08:57,520 --> 02:09:00,159
there's a lot of them there's not two

4119
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:01,760
there's not four there's not eight think

4120
02:09:00,158 --> 02:09:04,078
about how many different orders the deck

4121
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:06,320
of card can be in each one of those is

4122
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:08,238
the result of applying a symmetry

4123
02:09:06,319 --> 02:09:09,679
uh to the original deck so a shuffle is

4124
02:09:08,238 --> 02:09:10,479
a symmetry right you're reordering the

4125
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:12,960
cards

4126
02:09:10,479 --> 02:09:13,519
if if i shuffle and then you shuffle the

4127
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:16,158
result

4128
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:16,880
is some other kind of thing you might

4129
02:09:16,158 --> 02:09:18,238
call it duffel

4130
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:20,800
a double shuffle which is a more

4131
02:09:18,238 --> 02:09:21,519
complicated symmetry so group theory is

4132
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:24,320
kind of

4133
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:25,920
the study of the general abstract world

4134
02:09:24,319 --> 02:09:27,198
that encompasses

4135
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:29,520
all these kinds of things but then of

4136
02:09:27,198 --> 02:09:31,598
course like lots of things that are way

4137
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:33,119
more complicated than that

4138
02:09:31,599 --> 02:09:35,039
like infinite groups of symmetries for

4139
02:09:33,118 --> 02:09:38,078
instance so thank you

4140
02:09:35,039 --> 02:09:41,359
oh yeah okay well okay ready think about

4141
02:09:38,078 --> 02:09:42,559
the symmetries of the line you're like

4142
02:09:41,359 --> 02:09:45,359
okay i can

4143
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:46,719
reflect it left to right you know around

4144
02:09:45,359 --> 02:09:48,399
the origin

4145
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:50,158
okay but i could also reflect it left to

4146
02:09:48,399 --> 02:09:53,118
right grabbing

4147
02:09:50,158 --> 02:09:54,479
somewhere else like at one or two or pi

4148
02:09:53,118 --> 02:09:56,319
or anywhere

4149
02:09:54,479 --> 02:09:58,238
or i could just slide it some distance

4150
02:09:56,319 --> 02:09:59,759
that's a symmetry slide it five units

4151
02:09:58,238 --> 02:10:01,039
over so there's clearly infinitely many

4152
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:02,480
symmetries of the line

4153
02:10:01,039 --> 02:10:04,800
that's an example of an infinite group

4154
02:10:02,479 --> 02:10:07,359
of symmetries is it possible to say

4155
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:08,000
something that kind of captivates keeps

4156
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:10,078
being

4157
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,479
brought up by physicists which is gage

4158
02:10:10,078 --> 02:10:14,319
theory gauge symmetry

4159
02:10:12,479 --> 02:10:15,759
as one of the more complicated type of

4160
02:10:14,319 --> 02:10:17,679
symmetries is there is that

4161
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:19,360
is there a easy explanation what the

4162
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:20,480
heck it is is that something that comes

4163
02:10:19,359 --> 02:10:22,158
up

4164
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:23,919
on your mind at all well i'm not a

4165
02:10:22,158 --> 02:10:24,319
mathematical physicist but i can say

4166
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:27,599
this

4167
02:10:24,319 --> 02:10:28,238
it is certainly true that has been a

4168
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:31,039
very

4169
02:10:28,238 --> 02:10:32,000
useful notion in physics to try to say

4170
02:10:31,039 --> 02:10:34,000
like

4171
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,840
what are the symmetry groups like of the

4172
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,198
world like what are the symmetries under

4173
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:38,800
which things don't change right so

4174
02:10:37,198 --> 02:10:40,319
we just i think we talked a little bit

4175
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:41,599
earlier about it should be a basic

4176
02:10:40,319 --> 02:10:42,479
principle that a theorem that's true

4177
02:10:41,599 --> 02:10:44,639
here

4178
02:10:42,479 --> 02:10:46,238
is also true over there yes and same for

4179
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:47,599
a physical law right i mean

4180
02:10:46,238 --> 02:10:49,519
if gravity is like this over here it

4181
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:50,719
should also be like this over there okay

4182
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:52,560
what that's saying is we think

4183
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:54,560
translation in space

4184
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:56,400
should be a symmetry all the laws of

4185
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,920
physics should be unchanged

4186
02:10:56,399 --> 02:10:59,598
if the symmetry we have in mind is a

4187
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:03,679
very simple one like translation

4188
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:05,920
and so then um there becomes a question

4189
02:11:03,679 --> 02:11:08,800
like what are the symmetries

4190
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:09,679
of the actual world with its physical

4191
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:11,920
laws

4192
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:14,000
and one way of thinking isn't

4193
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:15,440
oversimplification but like one way of

4194
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:19,760
thinking of this big

4195
02:11:15,439 --> 02:11:23,279
um shift from

4196
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:25,599
uh before einstein to after is that we

4197
02:11:23,279 --> 02:11:27,279
just changed our idea about what the

4198
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:30,719
fundamental group of

4199
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:32,238
symmetries were so that things like the

4200
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:33,039
lorenz contraction things like these

4201
02:11:32,238 --> 02:11:35,198
bizarre

4202
02:11:33,039 --> 02:11:36,560
relativistic phenomena or lorenz would

4203
02:11:35,198 --> 02:11:39,678
have said

4204
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:41,679
oh to make this work we need a thing to

4205
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:46,078
um

4206
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:47,520
to change its shape if it's moving

4207
02:11:46,078 --> 02:11:49,599
yeah nearly the speed of light well

4208
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:50,719
under the new frame of framework

4209
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:52,078
it's much better you feel like oh no it

4210
02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:54,319
wasn't changing its jeep you were just

4211
02:11:52,078 --> 02:11:55,359
wrong about what counted as a symmetry

4212
02:11:54,319 --> 02:11:57,599
now that we have this new group the

4213
02:11:55,359 --> 02:11:58,799
so-called lorenz group now that we

4214
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:00,319
understand what the symmetries really

4215
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:02,800
are we see it was just an illusion that

4216
02:12:00,319 --> 02:12:04,319
the the thing was changing its shape

4217
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:06,000
yeah so you can then describe the

4218
02:12:04,319 --> 02:12:07,840
sameness of things under

4219
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,880
this weirdness that exactly that is

4220
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:14,239
general relativity for example

4221
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:15,920
yeah yeah still um

4222
02:12:14,238 --> 02:12:17,279
i wish there was a simpler explanation

4223
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:20,000
of like exactly i mean

4224
02:12:17,279 --> 02:12:20,719
get you know gauge symmetry is a pretty

4225
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,439
simple

4226
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:26,000
general concept about rulers being

4227
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:26,000
deformed

4228
02:12:26,158 --> 02:12:30,078
i it's just i i uh i've actually just

4229
02:12:29,198 --> 02:12:33,519
personally been

4230
02:12:30,078 --> 02:12:36,639
on a search not a very uh rigorous

4231
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:38,320
or aggressive search but for uh

4232
02:12:36,639 --> 02:12:40,078
something i personally enjoy which is

4233
02:12:38,319 --> 02:12:43,118
taking complicated

4234
02:12:40,078 --> 02:12:44,639
concepts and finding the sort of minimal

4235
02:12:43,118 --> 02:12:46,559
example

4236
02:12:44,639 --> 02:12:48,078
that i can play around with especially

4237
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:49,360
programmatically that's great i mean

4238
02:12:48,078 --> 02:12:50,799
that this is what we try to train our

4239
02:12:49,359 --> 02:12:52,479
students to do right i mean in class

4240
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:54,639
this is exactly what

4241
02:12:52,479 --> 02:12:55,519
this is like best pedagogical practice i

4242
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:57,199
do

4243
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:58,880
hope there's simple explanation

4244
02:12:57,198 --> 02:13:02,238
especially like

4245
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:05,199
i've uh in my sort of uh

4246
02:13:02,238 --> 02:13:06,158
drunk random walk drunk walk whatever

4247
02:13:05,198 --> 02:13:08,158
that's called

4248
02:13:06,158 --> 02:13:10,158
uh sometimes stumble into the world of

4249
02:13:08,158 --> 02:13:12,078
topology

4250
02:13:10,158 --> 02:13:13,759
and like quickly like you know when you

4251
02:13:12,078 --> 02:13:14,960
like go to a party and you realize this

4252
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:18,159
is not the right

4253
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:19,118
party for me so whenever i go into

4254
02:13:18,158 --> 02:13:22,638
topology it's like

4255
02:13:19,118 --> 02:13:24,319
so much math everywhere i don't even

4256
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:26,480
know what it feels like

4257
02:13:24,319 --> 02:13:27,920
this is me like being a hater is i think

4258
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:30,000
there's way too much math like

4259
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:32,078
they're two the cool kids who just want

4260
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,118
to have like everything is expressed

4261
02:13:32,078 --> 02:13:34,399
through math

4262
02:13:33,118 --> 02:13:36,719
because they're actually afraid to

4263
02:13:34,399 --> 02:13:38,559
express stuff simply through language

4264
02:13:36,719 --> 02:13:40,560
that's that's my hater formulation of

4265
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:42,159
topology but at the same time i'm sure

4266
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:42,719
that's very necessary to do sort of

4267
02:13:42,158 --> 02:13:44,879
rigorous

4268
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:46,239
discussion but i feel like but don't you

4269
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:47,520
think that's what gauge symmetry is like

4270
02:13:46,238 --> 02:13:49,198
i mean it's not a field i know well but

4271
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:50,239
it certainly seems like yes it is like

4272
02:13:49,198 --> 02:13:53,279
that okay but

4273
02:13:50,238 --> 02:13:55,359
my problem with topology okay and even

4274
02:13:53,279 --> 02:13:56,559
like differential geom and differential

4275
02:13:55,359 --> 02:13:59,920
geometry

4276
02:13:56,560 --> 02:14:00,880
is like you're talking about beautiful

4277
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:03,118
things

4278
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:04,159
like if they could be visualized it's

4279
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:05,679
open question if

4280
02:14:04,158 --> 02:14:06,960
everything could be visualized but

4281
02:14:05,679 --> 02:14:07,520
you're talking about things that could

4282
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:11,039
be

4283
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:13,599
visually stunning i think

4284
02:14:11,039 --> 02:14:15,599
but they are hidden underneath all of

4285
02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:17,520
that math

4286
02:14:15,599 --> 02:14:19,679
like if you look at the papers that are

4287
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:21,440
written in topology if you look at all

4288
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:24,158
the discussions on stack exchange

4289
02:14:21,439 --> 02:14:26,479
they're all math dense math heavy and

4290
02:14:24,158 --> 02:14:28,238
the only kind of

4291
02:14:26,479 --> 02:14:29,519
visual things that emerge every once in

4292
02:14:28,238 --> 02:14:32,559
a while

4293
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:35,710
is like uh something like a mobius strip

4294
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:37,199
every once in a while some kind of uh um

4295
02:14:35,710 --> 02:14:39,279
[Music]

4296
02:14:37,198 --> 02:14:41,678
simple visualizations well there's the

4297
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:43,039
the vibration there's the hop vibration

4298
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:45,440
or all those kinds of things

4299
02:14:43,039 --> 02:14:46,560
that somebody some grad student from

4300
02:14:45,439 --> 02:14:48,719
like 20 years ago

4301
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:50,079
wrote a program in fortran to visualize

4302
02:14:48,719 --> 02:14:52,560
it and that's it

4303
02:14:50,078 --> 02:14:53,599
and it's just you know it makes me sad

4304
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:55,280
because

4305
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:57,840
those are visual disciplines just like

4306
02:14:55,279 --> 02:14:59,118
computer vision is a visual discipline

4307
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:01,840
so you can provide a lot of visual

4308
02:14:59,118 --> 02:15:04,559
examples i wish topology

4309
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:07,039
was more excited and in love with

4310
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:08,320
visualizing some of the ideas

4311
02:15:07,039 --> 02:15:09,679
i mean you could say that but i would

4312
02:15:08,319 --> 02:15:11,759
say for me a picture of the hop

4313
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:13,520
vibration does nothing for me

4314
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:14,880
whereas like when you're like oh it's

4315
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:16,480
like about the quaternions it's like a

4316
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:18,000
subgroup of the quaternions i'm like oh

4317
02:15:16,479 --> 02:15:19,198
so now i see what's going on like why

4318
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,479
didn't you just say that why were you

4319
02:15:19,198 --> 02:15:21,439
like showing me this stupid picture

4320
02:15:20,479 --> 02:15:22,399
instead of telling me what you were

4321
02:15:21,439 --> 02:15:25,919
talking about

4322
02:15:22,399 --> 02:15:26,960
oh yeah yeah i'm just saying no but it

4323
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:28,480
goes back to what you're saying about

4324
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:30,158
teaching that like people are different

4325
02:15:28,479 --> 02:15:31,118
in what they'll respond to so i think

4326
02:15:30,158 --> 02:15:32,479
there's no i mean

4327
02:15:31,118 --> 02:15:34,319
i'm very opposed to the idea that

4328
02:15:32,479 --> 02:15:36,879
there's one right way to explain things

4329
02:15:34,319 --> 02:15:38,319
i think there's a huge variation in like

4330
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:41,039
you know our brains like have all these

4331
02:15:38,319 --> 02:15:42,479
like weird like hooks and loops and it's

4332
02:15:41,039 --> 02:15:43,920
like very hard to know like what's going

4333
02:15:42,479 --> 02:15:45,439
to latch on and it's not going to be the

4334
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:48,078
same thing

4335
02:15:45,439 --> 02:15:49,919
for everybody so well i think

4336
02:15:48,078 --> 02:15:51,439
monoculture is bad right i think that's

4337
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:52,078
and i think we're agreeing on that point

4338
02:15:51,439 --> 02:15:53,678
that like

4339
02:15:52,078 --> 02:15:55,118
it's good that there's like a lot of

4340
02:15:53,679 --> 02:15:56,800
different ways in and a lot of different

4341
02:15:55,118 --> 02:15:58,000
ways to describe these ideas because

4342
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:00,239
different people are going to find

4343
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:03,520
different things illuminating but

4344
02:16:00,238 --> 02:16:04,399
that said i think there's a lot to be

4345
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:06,800
discovered

4346
02:16:04,399 --> 02:16:06,799
when you

4347
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:10,960
force little like silos of brilliant

4348
02:16:10,319 --> 02:16:15,198
people

4349
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:18,880
to kind of find a middle ground

4350
02:16:15,198 --> 02:16:21,359
or like uh aggregate or

4351
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:23,440
come together in a way so there's like

4352
02:16:21,359 --> 02:16:25,598
people that do love visual things

4353
02:16:23,439 --> 02:16:26,960
i mean there's a lot of disciplines

4354
02:16:25,599 --> 02:16:28,800
especially in computer science

4355
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:30,000
that they're obsessed with visualizing

4356
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:31,520
visualizing data

4357
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,959
visualizing neural networks i mean

4358
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:34,479
neural networks themselves are

4359
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:35,839
fundamentally visual there's a lot of

4360
02:16:34,478 --> 02:16:36,718
work in computer vision that's very

4361
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:38,719
visual

4362
02:16:36,718 --> 02:16:41,039
and then coming together with some some

4363
02:16:38,718 --> 02:16:42,478
folks that were like deeply rigorous

4364
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:44,240
and are like totally lost in

4365
02:16:42,478 --> 02:16:46,079
multi-dimensional space where it's hard

4366
02:16:44,239 --> 02:16:48,079
to even bring them back down to 3d

4367
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:49,200
[Laughter]

4368
02:16:48,079 --> 02:16:51,120
they're very comfortable in this

4369
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:53,359
multi-dimensional space so forcing them

4370
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:55,120
to kind of work together to communicate

4371
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:57,200
because it's not just about public

4372
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:59,040
communication of ideas

4373
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:00,719
it's also i feel like when you're forced

4374
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:02,000
to do that public communication like you

4375
02:17:00,718 --> 02:17:05,119
did with your book

4376
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:06,879
i think deep profound ideas can be

4377
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:08,639
discovered that's like applicable for

4378
02:17:06,879 --> 02:17:09,920
research and for science

4379
02:17:08,638 --> 02:17:13,358
like there's something about that

4380
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:15,439
simplification or not simplification but

4381
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:16,960
this distillation or condensation or

4382
02:17:15,439 --> 02:17:18,239
whatever the hell you call it

4383
02:17:16,959 --> 02:17:20,079
compression

4384
02:17:18,239 --> 02:17:22,079
of ideas that somehow actually

4385
02:17:20,079 --> 02:17:24,959
stimulates creativity

4386
02:17:22,079 --> 02:17:26,159
and uh i'd be excited to see more of

4387
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:28,159
that in the

4388
02:17:26,159 --> 02:17:29,439
in in the mathematics community can you

4389
02:17:28,159 --> 02:17:30,638
let me make a crazy metaphor

4390
02:17:29,439 --> 02:17:32,479
maybe it's a little bit like the

4391
02:17:30,638 --> 02:17:33,839
relation between prose and poetry right

4392
02:17:32,478 --> 02:17:35,039
i mean if you you might say like why do

4393
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:36,639
we need anything more than prose you're

4394
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:37,679
trying to convey some information so you

4395
02:17:36,638 --> 02:17:40,478
just like say it

4396
02:17:37,679 --> 02:17:41,040
um well poetry does something right it's

4397
02:17:40,478 --> 02:17:42,718
sort of

4398
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:44,319
you might think of it as a kind of

4399
02:17:42,718 --> 02:17:45,598
compression of course not all poetry is

4400
02:17:44,318 --> 02:17:48,718
compressed like not awesome

4401
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:51,840
some of it is quite baggy but like

4402
02:17:48,718 --> 02:17:54,079
um you are kind of

4403
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:55,599
often it's compressed right a lyric poem

4404
02:17:54,079 --> 02:17:57,359
is often sort of like a compression of

4405
02:17:55,599 --> 02:17:59,760
what would take a long

4406
02:17:57,359 --> 02:18:02,318
time and be complicated to explain in

4407
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:04,398
prose into sort of

4408
02:18:02,318 --> 02:18:06,718
a different mode that it's going to hit

4409
02:18:04,398 --> 02:18:10,079
in a different way we talked about

4410
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:13,598
poncare conjecture

4411
02:18:10,079 --> 02:18:16,558
there's a guy he's russian grigori

4412
02:18:13,599 --> 02:18:19,040
pearlman he proved poincare's conjecture

4413
02:18:16,558 --> 02:18:20,558
if you can comment on the proof itself

4414
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:22,080
if that stands out to you something

4415
02:18:20,558 --> 02:18:24,079
interesting or the

4416
02:18:22,079 --> 02:18:25,920
human story of it which is he turned

4417
02:18:24,079 --> 02:18:30,159
down the fields medal

4418
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:32,879
for the proof is there something

4419
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:34,239
you find inspiring or insightful about

4420
02:18:32,879 --> 02:18:38,079
the proof itself

4421
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:40,959
or about the man yeah i mean one thing

4422
02:18:38,079 --> 02:18:42,558
i really like about the proof and partly

4423
02:18:40,959 --> 02:18:44,558
that's because it's sort of a

4424
02:18:42,558 --> 02:18:45,840
thing that happens again and again in

4425
02:18:44,558 --> 02:18:47,599
this book i mean i'm writing about

4426
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:49,280
geometry and the way it sort of appears

4427
02:18:47,599 --> 02:18:50,159
in all these kind of real world problems

4428
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:52,000
and

4429
02:18:50,159 --> 02:18:55,039
but it happens so often that the

4430
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:57,679
geometry you think you're studying

4431
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:59,200
is somehow not enough you have to go one

4432
02:18:57,679 --> 02:19:01,599
level higher in abstraction

4433
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:03,040
and study a higher level of geometry and

4434
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:04,960
the way that plays out

4435
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:06,399
is that you know poincare asks a

4436
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:07,839
question about a certain kind of

4437
02:19:06,398 --> 02:19:09,599
three-dimensional object

4438
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:11,920
is it the usual three-dimensional space

4439
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:13,920
that we know or is it some kind of

4440
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:15,359
exotic thing and so of course this

4441
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:17,599
sounds like it's a question about the

4442
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:20,318
geometry of the three-dimensional space

4443
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:21,760
but no apparelment understands and by

4444
02:19:20,318 --> 02:19:23,439
the way in a tradition that involves

4445
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:25,760
richard hamilton and many other people

4446
02:19:23,439 --> 02:19:27,359
like most really important mathematical

4447
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:28,960
advances this doesn't happen alone it

4448
02:19:27,359 --> 02:19:30,159
doesn't happen in a vacuum it happens as

4449
02:19:28,959 --> 02:19:31,199
the culmination of a program that

4450
02:19:30,159 --> 02:19:32,718
involves many people

4451
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:33,760
same with wiles by the way i mean we

4452
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:35,279
talked about wiles and i want to

4453
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:36,719
emphasize that

4454
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:38,719
starting all the way back with kumar who

4455
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:42,159
i mentioned in the 19th century but

4456
02:19:38,718 --> 02:19:44,398
um gerhard frye and mazer and ken ribbit

4457
02:19:42,159 --> 02:19:46,318
and like many other people

4458
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:47,679
are involved in building the other

4459
02:19:46,318 --> 02:19:49,519
pieces of the arch before you put the

4460
02:19:47,679 --> 02:19:50,318
keystone in we stand on the shoulders of

4461
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:53,680
giants

4462
02:19:50,318 --> 02:19:53,680
yes um

4463
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:58,079
so what is this idea the idea is that

4464
02:19:56,799 --> 02:19:59,119
well of course the geometry of the

4465
02:19:58,079 --> 02:20:01,120
three-dimensional

4466
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:02,880
object itself is relevant but the real

4467
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:05,439
geometry you have to understand is

4468
02:20:02,879 --> 02:20:07,438
the geometry of the space of all

4469
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:10,318
three-dimensional geometries

4470
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:12,000
whoa you're going up a higher level

4471
02:20:10,318 --> 02:20:16,239
because when you do that you can say

4472
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:18,799
now let's trace out a path

4473
02:20:16,239 --> 02:20:20,079
in that space yes there's a mechanism

4474
02:20:18,799 --> 02:20:22,478
called reachy flow and again we're

4475
02:20:20,079 --> 02:20:23,600
outside my research area so for all the

4476
02:20:22,478 --> 02:20:25,679
geometric analysts and differential

4477
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:28,318
geometers out there listening to this

4478
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:29,359
if i please i'm doing my best and i'm

4479
02:20:28,318 --> 02:20:31,680
roughly saying

4480
02:20:29,359 --> 02:20:33,200
so this the ritchie flow allows you to

4481
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:35,200
say like okay let's start from some

4482
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:37,120
mystery three-dimensional space

4483
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:38,240
which poincare would conjecture is

4484
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:39,600
essentially the same thing as our

4485
02:20:38,239 --> 02:20:41,119
familiar three-dimensional space but we

4486
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:44,318
don't know that

4487
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:46,960
and now you let it flow you

4488
02:20:44,318 --> 02:20:47,359
sort of like let it move in its natural

4489
02:20:46,959 --> 02:20:48,639
path

4490
02:20:47,359 --> 02:20:50,479
according to some almost physical

4491
02:20:48,639 --> 02:20:52,079
process and ask

4492
02:20:50,478 --> 02:20:54,159
where it winds up and what you find is

4493
02:20:52,079 --> 02:20:55,840
that it always winds up

4494
02:20:54,159 --> 02:20:58,159
you've continuously deformed it there's

4495
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:59,200
that word deformation again

4496
02:20:58,159 --> 02:21:00,639
and what you can prove is that the

4497
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:02,159
process doesn't stop until you get to

4498
02:21:00,639 --> 02:21:04,559
the usual three-dimensional space and

4499
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:06,799
since you can get from the mystery thing

4500
02:21:04,559 --> 02:21:07,680
to the standard space by this process of

4501
02:21:06,799 --> 02:21:11,119
continually

4502
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:12,960
changing and never kind of having any

4503
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:15,840
sharp transitions

4504
02:21:12,959 --> 02:21:17,119
then the original shape must have been

4505
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:18,799
the same as the standard

4506
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:20,479
shape that's the nature of the proof now

4507
02:21:18,799 --> 02:21:20,719
of course it's incredibly technical i

4508
02:21:20,478 --> 02:21:22,478
think

4509
02:21:20,719 --> 02:21:24,239
as i understand it i think the hard part

4510
02:21:22,478 --> 02:21:25,760
is proving that

4511
02:21:24,239 --> 02:21:28,478
the favorite word of ai people you don't

4512
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:30,318
get any singularities along the way

4513
02:21:28,478 --> 02:21:31,920
um but of course in this context

4514
02:21:30,318 --> 02:21:35,279
singularity just means

4515
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:37,680
acquiring a sharp kink it just means uh

4516
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:39,359
becoming non-smooth at some point so

4517
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:40,398
just saying something interesting about

4518
02:21:39,359 --> 02:21:42,640
uh

4519
02:21:40,398 --> 02:21:44,398
formal about the smooth trajectory

4520
02:21:42,639 --> 02:21:46,719
through this weird space

4521
02:21:44,398 --> 02:21:48,318
yeah but yeah so what i like about it is

4522
02:21:46,719 --> 02:21:49,519
that it's just one of many examples of

4523
02:21:48,318 --> 02:21:51,119
where

4524
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:53,120
it's not about the geometry you think

4525
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:56,479
it's about it's about the geometry of

4526
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:56,880
all geometries so to speak and it's only

4527
02:21:56,478 --> 02:21:58,639
by

4528
02:21:56,879 --> 02:22:00,318
kind of like kind of like being jerked

4529
02:21:58,639 --> 02:22:02,318
out of flat land right same idea it's

4530
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:04,000
only by sort of

4531
02:22:02,318 --> 02:22:05,199
seeing the whole thing globally at once

4532
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,318
that you can really make progress on

4533
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:08,319
understanding like the one thing you

4534
02:22:06,318 --> 02:22:09,760
thought you were looking at

4535
02:22:08,318 --> 02:22:11,279
it's a romantic question but what do

4536
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:12,880
what what do you think about him turning

4537
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:16,159
down the fields medal

4538
02:22:12,879 --> 02:22:18,159
is uh is that just our nobel prizes and

4539
02:22:16,159 --> 02:22:20,000
feelings medals just

4540
02:22:18,159 --> 02:22:21,840
just the cherry on top of the cake and

4541
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:25,520
really math itself

4542
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:27,040
the process of uh curiosity of pulling

4543
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:29,439
at the string of

4544
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:30,160
the mystery before us that's the cake

4545
02:22:29,439 --> 02:22:34,960
and then

4546
02:22:30,159 --> 02:22:36,559
the awards are just icing and

4547
02:22:34,959 --> 02:22:38,799
uh clearly i've been fasting and i'm

4548
02:22:36,559 --> 02:22:42,000
hungry but uh

4549
02:22:38,799 --> 02:22:43,199
but do you think it's um it's it's

4550
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:45,040
tragic or just

4551
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:46,240
just a little curiosity that he turned

4552
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:47,760
on the metal

4553
02:22:46,239 --> 02:22:50,079
well it's interesting because on the one

4554
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:54,318
hand i think it's absolutely true

4555
02:22:50,079 --> 02:22:56,478
that right in some kind of like vast

4556
02:22:54,318 --> 02:22:58,239
spiritual sense like awards are not

4557
02:22:56,478 --> 02:22:59,119
important like not important the way

4558
02:22:58,239 --> 02:23:01,119
that sort of like

4559
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:02,319
understanding the universe is important

4560
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:03,760
um

4561
02:23:02,318 --> 02:23:05,519
on the other hand most people who are

4562
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:07,600
offered that prize accept it you know

4563
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:09,840
it's it is so there's something unusual

4564
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:12,720
about his uh

4565
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:13,520
his choice there um i i wouldn't say i

4566
02:23:12,719 --> 02:23:15,760
see it as

4567
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:17,520
tragic i mean maybe if i don't really

4568
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:19,439
feel like i have a clear picture of

4569
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:21,040
of why he chose not to take it i mean

4570
02:23:19,439 --> 02:23:22,559
it's not he's not alone

4571
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:23,920
in doing things like this people

4572
02:23:22,559 --> 02:23:25,279
sometimes turn down prizes for

4573
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:28,000
ideological reasons

4574
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:28,479
um probably more often in mathematics i

4575
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,159
mean

4576
02:23:28,478 --> 02:23:31,920
i think i'm right in saying that peter

4577
02:23:30,159 --> 02:23:33,359
schulze like turned down sort of some

4578
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:34,799
big monetary

4579
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:35,370
prize because he just you know i mean i

4580
02:23:34,799 --> 02:23:36,478
think he

4581
02:23:35,370 --> 02:23:39,120
[Music]

4582
02:23:36,478 --> 02:23:40,799
at some point you have plenty of money

4583
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:42,399
and maybe you think it sends the wrong

4584
02:23:40,799 --> 02:23:43,840
message about what the point of doing

4585
02:23:42,398 --> 02:23:46,959
mathematics

4586
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:47,439
is um i do find that there's most people

4587
02:23:46,959 --> 02:23:48,719
accept

4588
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:50,079
you know most people are given a prize

4589
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:51,199
most people take it i mean people like

4590
02:23:50,079 --> 02:23:53,200
to be appreciated but

4591
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:54,560
like i said we're people yes not that

4592
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:57,280
different from most other people

4593
02:23:54,559 --> 02:23:58,559
but the important reminder that that

4594
02:23:57,280 --> 02:24:00,960
turning down the prize

4595
02:23:58,559 --> 02:24:02,239
serves for me it's not that there's

4596
02:24:00,959 --> 02:24:03,679
anything wrong with the prize

4597
02:24:02,239 --> 02:24:05,439
and there's something wonderful about

4598
02:24:03,680 --> 02:24:07,920
the prize i think the no

4599
02:24:05,439 --> 02:24:10,239
the nobel prize is trickier because so

4600
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:11,600
many nobel prizes are given

4601
02:24:10,239 --> 02:24:14,000
first of all the nobel prize often

4602
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:15,600
forgets many many of the

4603
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:18,000
important people throughout history

4604
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:20,159
second of all there's like these weird

4605
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:22,079
rules to it there's only three people

4606
02:24:20,159 --> 02:24:24,000
and some projects have a huge number of

4607
02:24:22,079 --> 02:24:27,359
people and it's like this

4608
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:30,398
it um i don't know it it doesn't

4609
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:31,760
kind of highlight the way

4610
02:24:30,398 --> 02:24:33,519
science is done on some of these

4611
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:35,040
projects in the best possible way

4612
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:37,120
but in general the prizes are great but

4613
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:37,600
what this kind of teaches me and reminds

4614
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:39,120
me is

4615
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:41,280
sometimes in your life there'll be

4616
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:46,160
moments

4617
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:48,079
when the thing that you

4618
02:24:46,159 --> 02:24:50,639
you would really like to do society

4619
02:24:48,079 --> 02:24:53,039
would really like you to do

4620
02:24:50,639 --> 02:24:53,840
is the thing that goes against something

4621
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:55,920
you believe in

4622
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:58,318
whatever that is some kind of principle

4623
02:24:55,920 --> 02:25:01,520
and stand your ground

4624
02:24:58,318 --> 02:25:03,279
in the face of that it's something um

4625
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:05,040
i believe most people will have a few

4626
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:06,800
moments like that in their life

4627
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:08,960
maybe one moment like that and you have

4628
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:10,398
to do it that's what integrity is

4629
02:25:08,959 --> 02:25:12,000
so like it doesn't have to make sense to

4630
02:25:10,398 --> 02:25:13,119
the rest of the world but to stand on

4631
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:15,680
that like

4632
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:17,040
to say no it's interesting because i

4633
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:17,680
think do you know that he turned down

4634
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:20,160
the prize

4635
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:20,880
in service of some principle because i

4636
02:25:20,159 --> 02:25:22,639
don't know that

4637
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:24,559
well yes that seems to be the inkling

4638
02:25:22,639 --> 02:25:26,079
but he has never made it super clear but

4639
02:25:24,559 --> 02:25:27,920
the the inkling is that there he had

4640
02:25:26,079 --> 02:25:29,039
some problems with the whole process of

4641
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:31,920
mathematics that

4642
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:32,640
includes awards like this hierarchies

4643
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:34,159
and

4644
02:25:32,639 --> 02:25:35,680
reputations and all those kinds of

4645
02:25:34,159 --> 02:25:37,600
things and individualism that's

4646
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:38,960
fundamental to american culture

4647
02:25:37,600 --> 02:25:41,200
he probably because he visited the

4648
02:25:38,959 --> 02:25:44,959
united states quite a bit

4649
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:48,079
that he probably you know

4650
02:25:44,959 --> 02:25:49,919
it's it's like all about experiences and

4651
02:25:48,079 --> 02:25:51,439
he may have had you know some parts of

4652
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:53,840
academia

4653
02:25:51,439 --> 02:25:55,920
some pockets of academia can be less

4654
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:57,520
than inspiring perhaps sometimes

4655
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:59,600
because of the individual egos involved

4656
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:01,120
not academia people in general smart

4657
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:04,559
people with egos

4658
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:06,160
and if they if you interact with a

4659
02:26:04,559 --> 02:26:07,439
certain kinds of people you can become

4660
02:26:06,159 --> 02:26:10,000
cynical too easily

4661
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:11,359
i'm one of those people that i've been

4662
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:13,439
really fortunate to interact with

4663
02:26:11,359 --> 02:26:14,159
incredible people at mit and academia in

4664
02:26:13,439 --> 02:26:16,239
general but

4665
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:17,520
i've met some [ __ ] and i tend to

4666
02:26:16,239 --> 02:26:19,680
just kind of when i when i

4667
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:21,520
run into difficult folks i just kind of

4668
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:22,000
smile and send them all my love and just

4669
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:24,319
kind of go

4670
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:26,559
go around but for others those

4671
02:26:24,318 --> 02:26:28,318
experiences can be sticky

4672
02:26:26,559 --> 02:26:29,840
like they can become cynical about the

4673
02:26:28,318 --> 02:26:32,959
world

4674
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:34,639
when uh folks like that exist so it's he

4675
02:26:32,959 --> 02:26:36,478
he may have uh he may have become a

4676
02:26:34,639 --> 02:26:37,039
little bit cynical about the process of

4677
02:26:36,478 --> 02:26:38,559
science

4678
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:40,080
well you know it's a good opportunity

4679
02:26:38,559 --> 02:26:41,600
let's posit that that's his reasoning

4680
02:26:40,079 --> 02:26:43,520
because i truly don't know

4681
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:45,680
um it's an interesting opportunity to go

4682
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:46,880
back to almost the very first thing we

4683
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:49,120
talked about the idea of the

4684
02:26:46,879 --> 02:26:51,119
mathematical olympiad because of course

4685
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:52,319
that is so the international

4686
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:53,120
mathematical olympiad is like a

4687
02:26:52,318 --> 02:26:55,359
competition

4688
02:26:53,120 --> 02:26:57,120
for high school students solving math

4689
02:26:55,359 --> 02:26:59,280
problems and

4690
02:26:57,120 --> 02:27:00,800
in some sense it's absolutely false to

4691
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:02,000
the reality of mathematics because just

4692
02:27:00,799 --> 02:27:05,519
as you say

4693
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:09,280
it is a contest where you win prizes

4694
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:10,399
um the aim is to sort of be faster than

4695
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:13,359
other people

4696
02:27:10,398 --> 02:27:15,119
uh and you're working on sort of canned

4697
02:27:13,359 --> 02:27:17,120
problems that someone already knows the

4698
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:19,600
answer to like not

4699
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:20,479
problems that are unknown so you know in

4700
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:22,079
my own life

4701
02:27:20,478 --> 02:27:23,438
i think when i was in high school i was

4702
02:27:22,079 --> 02:27:25,200
like very motivated by those

4703
02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:26,159
competitions and like i went to the math

4704
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:28,800
olympiad and

4705
02:27:26,159 --> 02:27:29,920
you won it twice and got i mean well

4706
02:27:28,799 --> 02:27:31,519
there's something i have to explain to

4707
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:32,719
people because it says i think it says

4708
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:35,120
on wikipedia that i won

4709
02:27:32,719 --> 02:27:36,719
a gold medal and in the real olympics

4710
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:38,399
they only give one gold medal

4711
02:27:36,719 --> 02:27:39,840
in each event i just have to emphasize

4712
02:27:38,398 --> 02:27:41,439
that the international math olympiad

4713
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:43,359
is not like that the gold medal gold

4714
02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:44,559
medals are awarded to the top 112th of

4715
02:27:43,359 --> 02:27:46,880
all participants

4716
02:27:44,559 --> 02:27:48,318
okay so sorry to bust the legend or

4717
02:27:46,879 --> 02:27:49,358
anything like well you're an exceptional

4718
02:27:48,318 --> 02:27:51,760
performer in terms of

4719
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:53,120
uh achieving high scores on the problems

4720
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:54,639
and they're very difficult

4721
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:56,240
so you've achieved a high level of

4722
02:27:54,639 --> 02:27:58,079
performance on the

4723
02:27:56,239 --> 02:27:59,840
in this very specialized skill and by

4724
02:27:58,079 --> 02:28:02,079
the way it was very it was a very cold

4725
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:04,478
war activity you know when in 1987 the

4726
02:28:02,079 --> 02:28:05,840
first year i went it was in havana

4727
02:28:04,478 --> 02:28:07,599
americans couldn't go to havana back

4728
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:08,639
then it was a very complicated process

4729
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:10,159
to get there

4730
02:28:08,639 --> 02:28:11,920
and they took the whole american team on

4731
02:28:10,159 --> 02:28:13,520
a field trip to the museum of american

4732
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:15,760
imperialism

4733
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:17,600
in havana so we could see what america

4734
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:21,280
was all about

4735
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:24,880
how would you recommend a person

4736
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:27,920
learn math so somebody who's young

4737
02:28:24,879 --> 02:28:30,000
or somebody my age or somebody older

4738
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:32,000
who've taken a bunch of math but wants

4739
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:34,398
to rediscover the beauty of math

4740
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,920
and maybe integrate into their work more

4741
02:28:34,398 --> 02:28:39,199
so than the research space

4742
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:40,079
so and and so on is there something you

4743
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:43,120
could say about the

4744
02:28:40,079 --> 02:28:43,120
process of uh

4745
02:28:44,159 --> 02:28:47,520
incorporating mathematical thinking into

4746
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:49,439
your life

4747
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:50,800
i mean if the thing is it's in part a

4748
02:28:49,439 --> 02:28:52,960
journey of self-knowledge

4749
02:28:50,799 --> 02:28:54,799
you have to know what's going to work

4750
02:28:52,959 --> 02:28:56,159
for you and that's going to be

4751
02:28:54,799 --> 02:28:58,239
different for different people so there

4752
02:28:56,159 --> 02:28:59,200
are totally people who at any stage of

4753
02:28:58,239 --> 02:29:02,239
life

4754
02:28:59,200 --> 02:29:04,000
just start reading math textbooks that

4755
02:29:02,239 --> 02:29:06,478
is a thing that you can do and it works

4756
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:08,478
for some people and not for others

4757
02:29:06,478 --> 02:29:09,519
for others a gateway is you know i

4758
02:29:08,478 --> 02:29:11,039
always recommend like

4759
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:12,479
the books of martin gardner or another

4760
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:13,280
sort of person we haven't talked about

4761
02:29:12,478 --> 02:29:16,478
but who also

4762
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:18,079
like conway embodies that spirit of play

4763
02:29:16,478 --> 02:29:20,159
um he wrote a column in scientific

4764
02:29:18,079 --> 02:29:21,680
american for decades called mathematical

4765
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:25,119
recreations and there's such

4766
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:26,639
joy in it and such fun and these books

4767
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:28,160
the columns are collected into books and

4768
02:29:26,639 --> 02:29:29,680
the books are old now but for each

4769
02:29:28,159 --> 02:29:30,959
generation of people who discover them

4770
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:32,720
they're completely

4771
02:29:30,959 --> 02:29:35,279
fresh and they give a totally different

4772
02:29:32,719 --> 02:29:36,799
way into the subject than

4773
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:38,640
reading a formal textbook which for some

4774
02:29:36,799 --> 02:29:41,279
people would be the right

4775
02:29:38,639 --> 02:29:42,239
thing to do and you know working contest

4776
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:44,000
style problems too

4777
02:29:42,239 --> 02:29:45,359
those are bound to books like especially

4778
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,559
like russian and bulgarian problems

4779
02:29:45,359 --> 02:29:47,840
right there's book after book

4780
02:29:46,559 --> 02:29:50,000
problems from those contexts that's

4781
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:51,200
going to motivate some people um

4782
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,719
for some people it's gonna be like

4783
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:53,760
watching well-produced videos like a

4784
02:29:52,719 --> 02:29:55,199
totally different

4785
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:56,398
format like i feel like i'm not

4786
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:58,399
answering your question i'm sort of

4787
02:29:56,398 --> 02:30:00,639
saying there's no one answer and like

4788
02:29:58,398 --> 02:30:01,840
it's a journey where you figure out what

4789
02:30:00,639 --> 02:30:04,398
resonates with you

4790
02:30:01,840 --> 02:30:05,760
for some people if the self-discovery is

4791
02:30:04,398 --> 02:30:06,559
trying to figure out why is it that i

4792
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:07,760
want to know

4793
02:30:06,559 --> 02:30:10,478
okay i'll tell you a story once when i

4794
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:11,760
was in grad school i was very frustrated

4795
02:30:10,478 --> 02:30:12,398
with my like lack of knowledge of a lot

4796
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:13,760
of things

4797
02:30:12,398 --> 02:30:15,039
as we all are because no matter how much

4798
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:16,398
we know we don't know much more and

4799
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:18,720
going to grad school means just coming

4800
02:30:16,398 --> 02:30:20,079
face to face with like the incredible

4801
02:30:18,719 --> 02:30:22,398
overflowing fault of your ignorance

4802
02:30:20,079 --> 02:30:23,600
right so i told joe harris who was an

4803
02:30:22,398 --> 02:30:26,398
algebraic geometer

4804
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:27,520
a professor in my department i was like

4805
02:30:26,398 --> 02:30:28,959
i really feel like i don't know enough

4806
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:30,399
and i should just like take a year of

4807
02:30:28,959 --> 02:30:33,039
leave and just like read

4808
02:30:30,398 --> 02:30:34,799
ega the holy textbook el amon de

4809
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:36,800
geometry algebraic the elements of

4810
02:30:34,799 --> 02:30:38,239
algebraic geometry this like

4811
02:30:36,799 --> 02:30:39,279
i'm just gonna i i feel like i don't

4812
02:30:38,239 --> 02:30:40,799
know enough so i'm just gonna sit and

4813
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:44,840
like read this like

4814
02:30:40,799 --> 02:30:47,840
1500 page many volume book

4815
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:48,960
um and he was like and the professor

4816
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:49,439
hair was like that's a really stupid

4817
02:30:48,959 --> 02:30:50,719
idea

4818
02:30:49,439 --> 02:30:52,239
and i was like why is that a stupid idea

4819
02:30:50,719 --> 02:30:53,199
then i would know more algebraic

4820
02:30:52,239 --> 02:30:55,760
geometries like because you're not

4821
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:56,960
actually gonna do it like you learn

4822
02:30:55,760 --> 02:30:58,159
i mean he knew me well enough to say

4823
02:30:56,959 --> 02:30:59,519
like you're gonna learn because you're

4824
02:30:58,159 --> 02:31:01,200
gonna be working on a problem and then

4825
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:03,040
there's going to be a fact from ega you

4826
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:04,319
need in order to solve your problem that

4827
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:05,120
you want to solve and that's how you're

4828
02:31:04,318 --> 02:31:06,318
going to learn it

4829
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:08,319
you're not going to learn it without a

4830
02:31:06,318 --> 02:31:09,279
problem to bring you into it and so for

4831
02:31:08,318 --> 02:31:11,199
a lot of people

4832
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:13,200
i think if you're like i'm trying to

4833
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:14,640
understand machine learning and i'm like

4834
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:16,960
i can see that there's sort of some

4835
02:31:14,639 --> 02:31:21,599
mathematical technology that i

4836
02:31:16,959 --> 02:31:23,438
don't have i think you like let

4837
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:24,720
that problem that you actually care

4838
02:31:23,439 --> 02:31:26,479
about

4839
02:31:24,719 --> 02:31:27,920
drive your learning i mean one thing

4840
02:31:26,478 --> 02:31:29,840
i've learned from advising students you

4841
02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:32,960
know

4842
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:34,079
math is really hard in fact anything

4843
02:31:32,959 --> 02:31:38,000
that you do

4844
02:31:34,079 --> 02:31:40,318
right is hard um

4845
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:41,680
and because it's hard like you might

4846
02:31:40,318 --> 02:31:43,359
sort of have some idea that somebody

4847
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:45,280
else gives you oh i should learn

4848
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:46,559
x y and z well if you don't actually

4849
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:48,079
care you're not going to do it you might

4850
02:31:46,559 --> 02:31:48,879
feel like you should maybe somebody told

4851
02:31:48,079 --> 02:31:51,439
you you should

4852
02:31:48,879 --> 02:31:52,639
but i think you have to hook it to

4853
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:54,398
something that you actually care about

4854
02:31:52,639 --> 02:31:55,680
so for a lot of people that's the way in

4855
02:31:54,398 --> 02:31:56,000
you have an engineering problem you're

4856
02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:57,920
trying

4857
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:59,439
to handle you have a physics problem

4858
02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:00,960
you're trying to handle

4859
02:31:59,439 --> 02:32:03,040
you have a machine learning problem

4860
02:32:00,959 --> 02:32:05,119
you're trying to handle let

4861
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:06,560
that not a kind of abstract idea of what

4862
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:08,399
the curriculum is

4863
02:32:06,559 --> 02:32:10,799
drive your mathematical learning and

4864
02:32:08,398 --> 02:32:12,959
also just as a brief comment

4865
02:32:10,799 --> 02:32:15,119
that math is hard there's a sense to

4866
02:32:12,959 --> 02:32:17,358
which heart is a feature not a bug

4867
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:19,120
in the sense that again this maybe this

4868
02:32:17,359 --> 02:32:22,960
is my own learning

4869
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:24,960
preference but i think it's a value to

4870
02:32:22,959 --> 02:32:26,000
fall in love with the process of doing

4871
02:32:24,959 --> 02:32:28,879
something hard

4872
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:30,959
overcoming it and becoming a better

4873
02:32:28,879 --> 02:32:33,119
person because of it like i hate running

4874
02:32:30,959 --> 02:32:35,679
i hate exercise to bring it down to like

4875
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:39,680
the simplest hard

4876
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:41,359
and i enjoy the part once it's done

4877
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:42,880
the person i feel like for the in the

4878
02:32:41,359 --> 02:32:44,640
rest of the day once i've accomplished

4879
02:32:42,879 --> 02:32:46,398
it the actual process especially the

4880
02:32:44,639 --> 02:32:48,478
process of getting started

4881
02:32:46,398 --> 02:32:49,439
in the initial like i really i don't

4882
02:32:48,478 --> 02:32:51,279
feel like doing it

4883
02:32:49,439 --> 02:32:53,439
and i really have the way i feel about

4884
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:55,280
running is the way i feel about

4885
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:56,559
really anything difficult in the

4886
02:32:55,280 --> 02:33:00,079
intellectual space

4887
02:32:56,559 --> 02:33:02,079
especially mathematics but also

4888
02:33:00,079 --> 02:33:04,719
just something that requires like

4889
02:33:02,079 --> 02:33:07,200
holding a bunch of concepts in your mind

4890
02:33:04,719 --> 02:33:09,119
with some uncertainty like where this

4891
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:10,079
the terminology or the notation is not

4892
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:12,319
very clear

4893
02:33:10,079 --> 02:33:13,280
and so you have to kind of hold all

4894
02:33:12,318 --> 02:33:15,119
those things together

4895
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:17,040
and like keep pushing forward through

4896
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:19,520
the frustration of really

4897
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:20,240
like obviously not understanding certain

4898
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:22,880
like

4899
02:33:20,239 --> 02:33:24,398
parts of the picture like your giant

4900
02:33:22,879 --> 02:33:26,879
missing parts of the picture

4901
02:33:24,398 --> 02:33:28,879
and still not giving up it's the same

4902
02:33:26,879 --> 02:33:31,519
way i feel about running

4903
02:33:28,879 --> 02:33:32,799
and and there's something about falling

4904
02:33:31,520 --> 02:33:35,359
in love

4905
02:33:32,799 --> 02:33:36,559
with the feeling of after you went to

4906
02:33:35,359 --> 02:33:39,280
the journey of

4907
02:33:36,559 --> 02:33:40,959
not having a complete picture at the end

4908
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:42,399
having a complete picture and then you

4909
02:33:40,959 --> 02:33:44,398
get to appreciate the beauty

4910
02:33:42,398 --> 02:33:45,920
and just remembering that it sucked for

4911
02:33:44,398 --> 02:33:48,318
a long time

4912
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:49,760
and how great it felt when you figured

4913
02:33:48,318 --> 02:33:51,920
it out at least at the basic

4914
02:33:49,760 --> 02:33:53,600
that's not sort of research thinking

4915
02:33:51,920 --> 02:33:58,799
because with research you probably

4916
02:33:53,600 --> 02:34:01,200
also have to enjoy the dead ends

4917
02:33:58,799 --> 02:34:03,199
with uh with learning math from a

4918
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:04,720
textbook or from video there's a nice

4919
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:06,240
you have to enjoy the dead ends but i

4920
02:34:04,719 --> 02:34:06,639
think you have to accept the dead ends

4921
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:09,760
let me

4922
02:34:06,639 --> 02:34:14,239
let's put it that way well yeah

4923
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:16,478
enjoy the suffering of it so i i

4924
02:34:14,239 --> 02:34:18,318
the way i think about it i do uh there's

4925
02:34:16,478 --> 02:34:19,358
an uh i don't enjoy the suffering it

4926
02:34:18,318 --> 02:34:21,119
pisses me off but

4927
02:34:19,359 --> 02:34:22,318
i accept that it's part of the process

4928
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:24,079
it's interesting there's a lot of ways

4929
02:34:22,318 --> 02:34:25,680
to kind of deal with that dead end

4930
02:34:24,079 --> 02:34:29,039
um there's a guy who's the ultra

4931
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:31,120
marathon runner navy seal david goggins

4932
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:34,080
who kind of i mean there's a certain

4933
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:37,600
philosophy of like

4934
02:34:34,079 --> 02:34:37,600
most people would quit here

4935
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:43,760
and so if most people would quit here

4936
02:34:40,719 --> 02:34:45,599
and i don't i'll have an opportunity to

4937
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:48,159
discover something beautiful that others

4938
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:48,159
haven't yet

4939
02:34:48,239 --> 02:34:55,680
so like anything any feeling that really

4940
02:34:52,398 --> 02:34:57,840
sucks it's like okay most people

4941
02:34:55,680 --> 02:35:00,479
would would just like go do something

4942
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:04,639
smarter if i stick with this

4943
02:35:00,478 --> 02:35:06,639
um i will discover a new garden of uh

4944
02:35:04,639 --> 02:35:08,398
fruit trees that i can pick okay you say

4945
02:35:06,639 --> 02:35:10,318
that but like what about the guy who

4946
02:35:08,398 --> 02:35:11,920
like wins the nathan's hot dog eating

4947
02:35:10,318 --> 02:35:14,079
contest every year like when he eats his

4948
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:15,840
35th hot dog he like correctly says like

4949
02:35:14,079 --> 02:35:18,318
okay most people would stop here

4950
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:20,079
like are you like lotting that he's like

4951
02:35:18,318 --> 02:35:20,398
no i'm gonna eat the thirty times i am i

4952
02:35:20,079 --> 02:35:24,000
am

4953
02:35:20,398 --> 02:35:26,959
i am in the in the long arc of history

4954
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,439
that man is onto something which brings

4955
02:35:26,959 --> 02:35:29,599
up

4956
02:35:27,439 --> 02:35:30,960
this question what advice would you give

4957
02:35:29,600 --> 02:35:33,520
to young people today

4958
02:35:30,959 --> 02:35:36,000
thinking about their career about their

4959
02:35:33,520 --> 02:35:40,479
life whether it's in mathematics

4960
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:42,398
uh poetry or hot dog eating cockneys

4961
02:35:40,478 --> 02:35:43,920
and you know i have kids so this is

4962
02:35:42,398 --> 02:35:45,680
actually a live issue for me right i

4963
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:46,639
actually it's a it's not a photograph i

4964
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:48,318
actually do have to give

4965
02:35:46,639 --> 02:35:50,478
advice to two young people all the time

4966
02:35:48,318 --> 02:35:54,959
they don't listen but i still give it

4967
02:35:50,478 --> 02:35:55,760
um you know one thing i often say to

4968
02:35:54,959 --> 02:35:57,438
students i don't think i've actually

4969
02:35:55,760 --> 02:36:00,239
said this to my kids yet but i say

4970
02:35:57,439 --> 02:36:02,960
to students a lot is you know you come

4971
02:36:00,239 --> 02:36:06,159
to these decision points

4972
02:36:02,959 --> 02:36:08,719
and everybody is beset by self-doubt

4973
02:36:06,159 --> 02:36:09,680
right it's like not sure like what

4974
02:36:08,719 --> 02:36:13,119
they're capable of

4975
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:14,639
like not sure what they're what they

4976
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:16,479
really want to do

4977
02:36:14,639 --> 02:36:18,478
i always i sort of tell people like

4978
02:36:16,478 --> 02:36:21,438
often when you have a decision to make

4979
02:36:18,478 --> 02:36:22,079
um one of the choices is the high

4980
02:36:21,439 --> 02:36:23,359
self-esteem

4981
02:36:22,079 --> 02:36:25,439
choice and i always thought make the

4982
02:36:23,359 --> 02:36:28,399
high self-esteem choice make the choice

4983
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:29,520
sort of take yourself out of it and like

4984
02:36:28,398 --> 02:36:31,199
if you didn't have those

4985
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:32,720
you can probably figure out what the

4986
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:34,880
version of you feels completely

4987
02:36:32,719 --> 02:36:36,478
confident would do

4988
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:39,199
and do that and see what happens and i

4989
02:36:36,478 --> 02:36:41,358
think that's often like pretty good

4990
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:42,960
advice that's interesting sort of like

4991
02:36:41,359 --> 02:36:44,399
uh

4992
02:36:42,959 --> 02:36:46,398
you know like with sims you can create

4993
02:36:44,398 --> 02:36:48,559
characters like create

4994
02:36:46,398 --> 02:36:50,079
a character of yourself that lacks all

4995
02:36:48,559 --> 02:36:51,680
the self-doubt

4996
02:36:50,079 --> 02:36:54,478
right but it doesn't mean i would never

4997
02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:56,720
say to somebody you should just go have

4998
02:36:54,478 --> 02:36:57,840
high self-esteem yeah you shouldn't have

4999
02:36:56,719 --> 02:36:59,199
doubts no you probably should have

5000
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:01,359
doubts it's okay to have them

5001
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:03,280
but sometimes it's good to act in the

5002
02:37:01,359 --> 02:37:07,040
way that the person who didn't have them

5003
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:08,399
would act um that's a really nice way to

5004
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:11,280
put it

5005
02:37:08,398 --> 02:37:12,959
yeah that's a that's a like from a third

5006
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:15,439
person perspective

5007
02:37:12,959 --> 02:37:18,000
take the part of your brain that wants

5008
02:37:15,439 --> 02:37:19,840
to do big things what would they do

5009
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:21,439
that's not afraid to do those things

5010
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:24,478
what would they do

5011
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:25,920
yeah that's that's really nice that's

5012
02:37:24,478 --> 02:37:27,519
actually a really nice way to formulate

5013
02:37:25,920 --> 02:37:30,318
it that's very practical advice you

5014
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:30,319
should give it to your kids

5015
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:34,800
do you think there's meaning to any of

5016
02:37:32,478 --> 02:37:38,959
it from a mathematical perspective

5017
02:37:34,799 --> 02:37:41,279
this life if i were to ask you

5018
02:37:38,959 --> 02:37:43,438
we're talking about primes talking about

5019
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:46,239
proving stuff

5020
02:37:43,439 --> 02:37:47,280
can we say and then the book that god

5021
02:37:46,239 --> 02:37:49,600
has

5022
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:50,479
that mathematics allows us to arrive at

5023
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:52,720
something about

5024
02:37:50,478 --> 02:37:54,879
in that book there's certainly a chapter

5025
02:37:52,719 --> 02:37:57,438
on the meaning of life in that book

5026
02:37:54,879 --> 02:37:58,159
do you think we humans can get to it and

5027
02:37:57,439 --> 02:37:59,600
maybe

5028
02:37:58,159 --> 02:38:01,439
if you were to write cliff notes what do

5029
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:03,359
you suspect those cliff notes would say

5030
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:04,800
i mean look the way i feel is that you

5031
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:07,120
know mathematics

5032
02:38:04,799 --> 02:38:07,840
as we've discussed like it underlies the

5033
02:38:07,120 --> 02:38:09,280
way we think about

5034
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:11,040
constructing learning machines and

5035
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:13,680
underlies physics

5036
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:15,600
um it can be used i mean it does all

5037
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:17,120
this stuff

5038
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:18,559
and also you want the meaning of life i

5039
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:20,000
mean it's like we already did a lot for

5040
02:38:18,559 --> 02:38:22,478
you like ask a rabbi

5041
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:24,639
[Laughter]

5042
02:38:22,478 --> 02:38:26,478
no i mean yeah you know i wrote a lot in

5043
02:38:24,639 --> 02:38:27,119
the la in the last book how not to be

5044
02:38:26,478 --> 02:38:29,279
wrong

5045
02:38:27,120 --> 02:38:30,640
yeah i wrote a lot about pascal a

5046
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:34,159
fascinating guy

5047
02:38:30,639 --> 02:38:35,920
um who is a sort of very serious

5048
02:38:34,159 --> 02:38:36,478
religious mystic as well as being an

5049
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:37,840
amazing

5050
02:38:36,478 --> 02:38:39,358
mathematician and he's well known for

5051
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:40,559
pascal's wager i mean he's probably

5052
02:38:39,359 --> 02:38:42,239
among all mathematicians he's the ones

5053
02:38:40,559 --> 02:38:44,000
who's best known for this

5054
02:38:42,239 --> 02:38:45,359
can you actually like apply mathematics

5055
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:49,040
to kind of

5056
02:38:45,359 --> 02:38:51,040
these transcendent questions

5057
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:52,960
um but what's interesting when i really

5058
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:54,640
read pascal

5059
02:38:52,959 --> 02:38:56,159
about what he wrote about this you know

5060
02:38:54,639 --> 02:38:58,000
i started to see that people often think

5061
02:38:56,159 --> 02:38:59,920
oh this is him saying i'm gonna use

5062
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,159
mathematics

5063
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:03,200
to sort of show you why you should

5064
02:39:02,159 --> 02:39:04,799
believe in god

5065
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:06,000
you know to really that's this

5066
02:39:04,799 --> 02:39:06,719
mathematics has the answer to this

5067
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,959
question

5068
02:39:06,719 --> 02:39:11,039
um but he really doesn't say that he

5069
02:39:08,959 --> 02:39:13,039
almost kind of says

5070
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:14,479
the opposite if you ask blaise pascal

5071
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:16,399
like why do you believe in god

5072
02:39:14,478 --> 02:39:18,559
it's he'd be like oh because i met god

5073
02:39:16,398 --> 02:39:20,478
you know he had this kind of like

5074
02:39:18,559 --> 02:39:22,398
psychedelic experience it's like a

5075
02:39:20,478 --> 02:39:24,159
mystical experience where

5076
02:39:22,398 --> 02:39:25,279
as he tells it he just like directly

5077
02:39:24,159 --> 02:39:26,719
encountered god and he's like okay i

5078
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:27,439
guess there's a god i met him last night

5079
02:39:26,719 --> 02:39:29,039
so that's

5080
02:39:27,439 --> 02:39:30,398
that's it that's why he believed it

5081
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:32,479
didn't have to do with any kind you know

5082
02:39:30,398 --> 02:39:36,079
the mathematical argument was like

5083
02:39:32,478 --> 02:39:37,920
um about certain reasons for behaving in

5084
02:39:36,079 --> 02:39:40,079
a certain way but he basically said like

5085
02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:42,398
look like math doesn't tell you that

5086
02:39:40,079 --> 02:39:43,280
god's there or not like if god's there

5087
02:39:42,398 --> 02:39:46,639
he'll tell you

5088
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:49,439
you know you don't i love this so you ha

5089
02:39:46,639 --> 02:39:50,398
you have mathematics you have uh what do

5090
02:39:49,439 --> 02:39:52,159
you what do you have

5091
02:39:50,398 --> 02:39:53,680
like a ways to explore the mind let's

5092
02:39:52,159 --> 02:39:56,719
say psychedelics

5093
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:57,920
you have like incredible technology you

5094
02:39:56,719 --> 02:40:00,559
also have

5095
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:01,920
love and friendship and like what what

5096
02:40:00,559 --> 02:40:04,799
the hell do you want to know what the

5097
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:06,000
meaning of it all is just enjoy it

5098
02:40:04,799 --> 02:40:07,920
i don't think there's a better way to

5099
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:09,520
end it jordan this was a fascinating

5100
02:40:07,920 --> 02:40:14,079
conversation i really love

5101
02:40:09,520 --> 02:40:17,600
the way you explore math in your writing

5102
02:40:14,079 --> 02:40:20,639
the the willingness to be specific

5103
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:22,079
and clear and actually explore difficult

5104
02:40:20,639 --> 02:40:24,318
ideas but at the same time

5105
02:40:22,079 --> 02:40:26,639
stepping outside and figuring out

5106
02:40:24,318 --> 02:40:30,239
beautiful stuff and i love the chart

5107
02:40:26,639 --> 02:40:32,318
at the opening of uh your new book

5108
02:40:30,239 --> 02:40:34,398
that shows the chaos the mess that is

5109
02:40:32,318 --> 02:40:35,519
your mind yes this is what i was trying

5110
02:40:34,398 --> 02:40:38,879
to keep in my head

5111
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:39,840
all at once while i was writing and um

5112
02:40:38,879 --> 02:40:41,358
i probably should have drawn this

5113
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:43,120
picture earlier in the process maybe it

5114
02:40:41,359 --> 02:40:45,279
would have made my organization easier i

5115
02:40:43,120 --> 02:40:47,359
actually drew it only at the end

5116
02:40:45,279 --> 02:40:48,560
and many of the things we talked about

5117
02:40:47,359 --> 02:40:51,120
are on this map

5118
02:40:48,559 --> 02:40:54,639
the connections are yet to be fully

5119
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:57,439
dissected and investigated and yes

5120
02:40:54,639 --> 02:41:00,719
god is in the picture right on the edge

5121
02:40:57,439 --> 02:41:02,079
right on the edge not in the center

5122
02:41:00,719 --> 02:41:03,519
thank you so much for talking it is a

5123
02:41:02,079 --> 02:41:05,760
huge honor that you would waste your

5124
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:07,120
valuable time with me

5125
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:09,520
thank you like we went to some amazing

5126
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:10,560
places today this is really fun

5127
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:12,479
thanks for listening to this

5128
02:41:10,559 --> 02:41:13,439
conversation with jordan ellenberg and

5129
02:41:12,478 --> 02:41:16,639
thank you to

5130
02:41:13,439 --> 02:41:18,800
secret sauce expressvpn blinkist

5131
02:41:16,639 --> 02:41:21,278
and indeed check them out in the

5132
02:41:18,799 --> 02:41:23,119
description to support this podcast

5133
02:41:21,279 --> 02:41:25,520
and now let me leave you with some words

5134
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:26,640
from jordan in his book how not to be

5135
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:28,960
wrong

5136
02:41:26,639 --> 02:41:30,478
knowing mathematics is like wearing a

5137
02:41:28,959 --> 02:41:32,799
pair of x-ray specs

5138
02:41:30,478 --> 02:41:34,639
that reveal hidden structures underneath

5139
02:41:32,799 --> 02:41:35,679
the messy and chaotic surface of the

5140
02:41:34,639 --> 02:41:37,278
world

5141
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:45,840
thank you for listening and hope to see

5142
02:41:37,279 --> 02:41:45,840
you next time

5143
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:49,120
you
