00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,319
doug lennon

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:09,519
creator of psych a system that for close

4
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:11,839
to 40 years and still today has sought

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,559
to solve the core problem of artificial

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,320
intelligence the acquisition of common

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:19,198
sense knowledge and the use of that

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,039
knowledge to think to reason and to

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,800
understand the world

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,118

our sponsors in the description

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,439
as a side note let me say that in the

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,079
excitement of the modern era of machine

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,719
learning it is easy to forget just how

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,120
little we understand exactly how to

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,600
build the kind of intelligence that

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,679
matches the power of the human mind

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,960
to me many of the core ideas behind

19
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,439
psych in some form in actuality or in

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,840
spirit will likely be part of the ai

21
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,920
system that achieves general super

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,160
intelligence but perhaps more

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,000
importantly solving this problem of

24
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,718
common sense knowledge will help us

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,519
humans understand our own minds the

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,239
nature of truth and finally how to be

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,280
more rational and more kind to each

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,520
other

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,000
this is the lex friedman podcast and

30
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,679
here is my conversation with doug

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,560
leonard

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,080
psyc is a project launched by you in

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
1984

34
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,679
and still is active today

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,519
whose goal is to assemble a knowledge

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,920
base that spans the basic concepts and

37
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,000
rules about how the world works

38
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,759
in other words it hopes to capture

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,078
common sense knowledge

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,920
which is a lot harder than it sounds

41
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,599
can you elaborate on this mission and

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,159
maybe perhaps speak to the various

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,118
sub-goals within this mission

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,560
when

45
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:40,239
i was a

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,840
faculty member in the computer science

47
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,519
department at stanford

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,680
my colleagues and i

49
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,959
did research in

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,118
all sorts of artificial intelligence

51
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,919
programs so natural language

52
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,519
understanding programs robots expert

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,879
systems

54
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,519
and so on

55
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,718
and we kept hitting the very same brick

56
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,879
wall

57
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,679
our systems would have

58
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:09,679
impressive early successes

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,360
and so if your only goal was academic

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,520
namely to

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,040
get enough material to write a journal

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,560
article

63
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,280
that might actually suffice but if

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,280
you're really trying to get ai

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,598
then you have to somehow get past the

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,598
brick wall and the brick wall was

67
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,199
the programs didn't have

68
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,598
what we would call common sense they

69
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,000
didn't have general world knowledge they

70
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,598
didn't really understand what they were

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,439
doing what they were saying what they

72
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,238
were being asked

73
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,800
and so very much like a

74
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,959
clever dog performing tricks we could

75
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,560
get them to do tricks but they never

76
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,000
really understood what they were doing

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,000
sort of like when

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,199
you get a dog to fetch your morning

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,039
newspaper

80
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,280
the dog might do that successfully but

81
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,439
the dog has no idea what a newspaper is

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,199
or what it says or anything like that

83
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,800
what does it mean to understand

84
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,518
something can you maybe elaborate on

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,560
that a little bit is it is understand an

86
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,640
action

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,080
of like combining little things together

88
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,238
like through inference or is

89
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
understanding the wisdom you gain over

90
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,000
time that forms the knowledge i think of

91
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,679
understanding more like a um

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,120
think of it more like the ground you

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,200
stand on

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,959
which

95
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,679
could be very shaky could be very unsafe

96
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,878
but most of the time is not because

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,120
underneath it is more ground

98
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,399
and eventually you know rock and and

99
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,280
other things but

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,640
layer after layer after layer that solid

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,318
foundation is there and you rarely need

102
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,798
to think about it you rarely need to

103
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,318
count on it but occasionally you do

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,560
and

105
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,798
i've never used this analogy before so

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,519
bear with me but i think the same thing

107
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,680
is true in in terms of getting computers

108
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,959
to understand things which is

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,438
uh you ask

110
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,400
a computer a question for instance alexa

111
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,400
or

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,200
some robot or something and

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,000
um maybe it gets the right answer

114
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:09,438
but if you were asking that of a human

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,318
you could also say things like why

116
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:14,799
or how might you be wrong about this or

117
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:17,120
something like that and the person you

118
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,560
know would would answer you and you know

119
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,478
it might be a little annoying if you

120
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,360
have a small child and they keep asking

121
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,879
why questions in series eventually you

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,479
get to the point where you throw up your

123
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,478
hands and say i don't know it's just the

124
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:34,478
way the world is but for many layers you

125
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:36,800
actually have that that layered solid

126
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:37,758
foundation of support so that when you

127
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,520
need it

128
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,160
you can count on it and when do you need

129
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,719
it well when things are unexpected when

130
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,680
you come up against a situation which is

131
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
novel for instance when you're driving

132
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,400
it may be

133
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,840
fine to have a small program a small set

134
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,679
of rules that cover you know 99 of the

135
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,000
cases but that one percent of the time

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,000
when something strange happens

137
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,160
you really need to draw on common sense

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,918
for instance um my wife and i were

139
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,160
driving recently

140
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,120
and there was a trash truck in front of

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,759
us

142
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,280
and i guess they had packed it too full

143
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,038
and the back exploded and trash bags

144
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,198
went everywhere

145
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,279
and we had to you know make a split

146
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,720
second decision are we going to slam on

147
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,279
our brakes are we going to swerve into

148
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,320
another lane are we going to just run it

149
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,719
over

150
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,000
because there are cars all around us

151
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,160
and you know in front of us was a large

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
trash bag and we know what we throw away

153
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,520
in trash bags probably not a safe thing

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,560
to run over um over on the the left was

155
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,399
um a bunch of fast food restaurant um

156
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,000
trash bags and it's like oh well those

157
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,560
things are just like styrofoam and

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,038
leftover food we'll run over that and so

159
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,240
that was a safe thing for us to to do

160
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,599
now that's the kind of thing that's

161
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,120
going to happen maybe once in your life

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,439
and um

163
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,478
but the point is that there's almost no

164
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,719
telling

165
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,120
what little bits of knowledge about the

166
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,080
world you might actually need

167
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,120
in some situations which were unforeseen

168
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:14,240
but see when you sit on that mountain

169
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,519
or that ground that goes deep of

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,439
knowledge

171
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,879
in order to make a split-second decision

172
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,719
about fast food trash or random trash

173
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,360
from the back of a

174
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,360
trash truck

175
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,680
you need to be able to leverage that

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,800
ground you stand on in some way it's not

177
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,439
merely

178
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,759
you know it's not enough to just have a

179
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:39,199
lot of ground to stand on it's your

180
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,960
ability to leverage it to utilize in a

181
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,879
split like integrate it all together to

182
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,359
make that split second decision

183
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:48,399
and i i suppose

184
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,160
understanding isn't just

185
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,478
having uh

186
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,960
common sense knowledge to access

187
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:58,959
it's the act of accessing accessing it

188
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,959
somehow like correctly

189
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,598
filtering out the parts of the knowledge

190
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,519
are not useful selecting only the useful

191
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,240
parts and uh

192
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,240
effectively making conclusive decisions

193
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,240
so let's tease apart

194
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,160
two different tasks really both of which

195
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,439
are incredibly important and even

196
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,639
necessary

197
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:21,038
if you're going to have this in a usable

198
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,680
useful usable fashion as opposed to say

199
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:24,879
like library books sitting on a shelf

200
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,959
and so on

201
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,439
where the knowledge might be there but

202
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,198
you know if a fire comes the books are

203
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,038
going to burn because they don't know

204
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,439
what's in them and they're just going to

205
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,038
sit there while they burn um so there

206
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:40,319
are two there are two

207
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,478
aspects of using the knowledge one is a

208
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,560
kind of a theoretical

209
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,478
how is it possible at all

210
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,879
and then the second aspect of what you

211
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,598
said is how can you do it quickly enough

212
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,240
right um so how can you do it at all is

213
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,399
something that philosophers have

214
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,280
grappled with and fortunately

215
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,959
philosophers 100 years ago and even

216
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,119
earlier

217
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,799
developed a kind of

218
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,560
formal language

219
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,639
like english

220
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,839
it's called

221
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,840
predicate logic or first order logic or

222
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,079
something like predicate calculus and so

223
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,279
on so there's a way of representing

224
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,519
things

225
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,038
in this formal language

226
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,560
which

227
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:26,478
enables a mechanical procedure to sort

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,120
of grind through

229
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,038
and algorithmically produce all of the

230
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,879
same logical

231
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,360
entailments all the same logical

232
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:38,719
conclusions that you or i would from

233
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,038
that same set of pieces of information

234
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,560
that are represented that way

235
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,958
um so um that that sort of raises um a

236
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,599
couple questions one is how do you get

237
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:52,239
all this information from say

238
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,040
observations and english and so on into

239
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,000
this logical form right and secondly how

240
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,759
can you then efficiently um run these

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,080
algorithms to actually get the

242
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,559
information you need in in the case i

243
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,839
mentioned in a tenth of a second rather

244
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,919
than say i'm in you know 10 hours or 10

245
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,839
000 years of computation

246
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,639
um and those are both really important

247
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,600
um

248
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:18,720
uh questions and like a corollary

249
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,839
addition to the first one is how many

250
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,600
such

251
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,480
things do you need to gather for it to

252
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,759
be useful in certain contexts

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,600
so like what

254
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,120
in order you mention philosophers in

255
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,399
order to capture this world and

256
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,919
represent it

257
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,799
in a logical way and with a formal logic

258
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,439
like

259
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:40,639
how many statements are required is it

260
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,920
five is it ten is it ten trillion is it

261
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,080
like that that's

262
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,399
as far as i understand is uh probably

263
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,480
still an open question it may forever be

264
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,278
an open question uh

265
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,519
just to say like definitively about

266
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,399
to describe the universe perfectly well

267
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,159
how many facts do you need

268
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,679
i i guess i'm going to disappoint you by

269
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,399
giving you an actual answer to your

270
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:03,359
question okay um well no this sounds

271
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,839
exciting

272
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,079
yes okay so so now we have like um three

273
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,839
three things to talk about we'll keep

274
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,479
adding more that's okay the first and

275
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,200
the third are related yes um so let's

276
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,639
leave the efficiency question aside for

277
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,200
now so um how how does all this

278
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:27,278
information get represented in

279
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,120
logical form so that these algorithms

280
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,679
resolution theorem proving and other

281
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,679
algorithms can actually grind through

282
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,719
all the logical consequences of what you

283
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,719
said

284
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,160
and that ties into your question about

285
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,680
well how many of these things do you

286
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,319
need

287
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,399
because if the answer is small enough

288
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,640
then by hand you could write them out

289
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,759
one at a time

290
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,120
so

291
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,159
in

292
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
the

293
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:56,719
19 early 1984

294
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,919
i held a meeting at stanford where i was

295
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,519
a

296
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,000
faculty member there

297
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,240
where we assembled

298
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,720
about half a dozen of the smartest

299
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,240
people i know

300
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,278
people like

301
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,159
alan newell and marvin minsky and alan

302
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:13,039
kaye

303
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,000
and

304
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,919
um um a few others was firemen there by

305
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,839
chance because he he liked your he

306
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,240
commented about your system urisco at

307
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,079
the time no no he he wasn't part of this

308
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,240
meeting um but that's a heck of a

309
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,278
meeting anyway i think ed feigenbaum was

310
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,000
there i think um josh lederberg was

311
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,240
there so we we have um

312
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,839
all these different um smart people and

313
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,278
we were um

314
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,079
we came together

315
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:39,679
to

316
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,679
address the question

317
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,519
that that you raised which is if it's

318
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,599
important to represent common sense

319
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,159
knowledge and world knowledge in order

320
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,159
for ais to not be brittle

321
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:53,039
in order for ais not to just have the

322
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,319
veneer of intelligence well how many

323
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,919
pieces

324
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,519
of common sense how many if then rules

325
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,559
for instance would we have to actually

326
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,320
write in order to essentially cover what

327
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,159
what people expect

328
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,680
perfect strangers to already know about

329
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,799
the world

330
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,879
and

331
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:14,958
i expected there would be an enormous

332
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,439
divergence of opinion um and computation

333
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:20,559
but amazingly everyone got an answer

334
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,839
which was around a million

335
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,518
and one person one person got the answer

336
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,000
by saying well

337
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,320
look you can only burn into human

338
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,480
long-term memory a certain number of

339
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,879
things per unit time like maybe one

340
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,720
every 30 seconds or something and other

341
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,200
than that it's just short-term memory

342
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,519
and it flows away like water and so on

343
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,519
so by the time you're say 10 years old

344
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,000
or so um how many things could you

345
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,320
possibly have burned into your long-term

346
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,159
memory and it's like about a million

347
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,399
another person went a completely

348
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,120
different direction and said well if you

349
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,240
look at the number of words

350
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,078
in a

351
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,839
dictionary not a whole dictionary but

352
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,239
for someone to

353
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,399
essentially be considered to be fluent

354
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,799
in a language how many words would they

355
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,039
need to know and then about how many

356
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,799
things about each word would you have to

357
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,719
tell it and so they got to a million

358
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,599
that way

359
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,800
another another person said well let's

360
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,759
actually look at one single

361
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,039
short one volume desk encyclopedia

362
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,120
article

363
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,838
and so we'll look at you know what was

364
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,000
like a um a four paragraph article or

365
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,320
something i think about grebes grebes

366
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,320
are a type of waterfowl

367
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,040
and if we were going to sit there and

368
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,720
represent every single thing that was

369
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:42,159
there um how many assertions or rules or

370
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,320
statements would we have to write in

371
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,399
this logical language and so on and then

372
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,720
multiply that by all of the number of

373
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,639
articles that there were and so on

374
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,920
so all of these estimates came out with

375
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,039
a million

376
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,039
and so

377
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,240
if you do the math it turns out that

378
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,679
like oh well then maybe in

379
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,839
something like

380
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,599
a hundred

381
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,560
years

382
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,920
in one or two person centuries we could

383
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,278
actually get

384
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:13,278
this written down by hand and

385
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,639
a marvelous

386
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:19,360
coincidence an opportunity existed right

387
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,519
at that point in time the early 1980s

388
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,639
there was something called the japanese

389
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:28,399
fifth generation computing effort japan

390
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,399
had threatened to do in computing and ai

391
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,240
and hardware what they had just finished

392
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,078
doing in consumer electronics on the

393
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,440
automotive industry namely resting

394
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:36,879
control away

395
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,279
from the united states and more

396
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,519
generally away from the west

397
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,639
and so america was scared

398
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,320
and

399
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,680
congress did something that's how you

400
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,519
know it was a long time ago because

401
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,879
congress did something

402
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,000
congress passed something called the

403
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,240
national cooperative research act ncra

404
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,078
and what it said was hey all you big

405
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,680
american companies that's also how you

406
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,599
know it was a long time ago because they

407
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,078
were american companies rather than

408
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,759
multinational companies hey all you big

409
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,519
american companies

410
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,679
normally it would be an anti-trust

411
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,480
violation if you colluded on r d but we

412
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,958
promise for the next 10 years we won't

413
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,519
prosecute any of you if you do that

414
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,119
to help combat this threat and so

415
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,360
overnight

416
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,240
the first two consortia research

417
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,320
consortia in america sprang up

418
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,839
both of them coincidentally in austin

419
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,079
texas uh one called sematech focusing on

420
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,480
hardware chips and so on and then one

421
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:37,120
called mcc the microelectronics and

422
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,639
computer technology corporation focusing

423
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,399
on more on software on databases and ai

424
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,720
and natural language understanding and

425
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,679
things like that

426
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,759
and

427
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,599
i got the opportunity thanks to my

428
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,240
friend woody bledsoe

429
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,240
who was one of the people who founded

430
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,399
that to come and be its principal

431
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,879
scientist and he said you know

432
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,000
and he said admiral bob inman who was

433
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,078
the person running mcc uh came and

434
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,278
talked to me and said look professor you

435
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,599
know you're talking about doing this

436
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,919
project it's going to involve

437
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,759
person centuries of effort

438
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,278
if you've only got a handful of graduate

439
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,039
students you do the math it's going to

440
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,159
take you like

441
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,838
you know

442
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,519
longer than the rest of your life to

443
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,680
finish this project but if you move to

444
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,679
the wilds of austin texas

445
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,638
we'll put 10 times as many people on it

446
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,479
and

447
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,079
you know you'll be done in

448
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,278
a few years and so that was pretty

449
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:34,000
exciting and so um i did that i

450
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:37,360
took my leave from stanford i came to to

451
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,440
austin i worked for mcc and

452
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,360
good news and bad news the bad news is

453
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,560
that all of us were off by an order of

454
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,399
magnitude

455
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,198
that it turns out what you need are tens

456
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,679
of millions of these

457
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,479
pieces of knowledge about on every day

458
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,000
sort of like if you have a coffee cup

459
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,480
with stuff in it and you turn it upside

460
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,399
down the stuff in it's going to fall out

461
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,800
so you need tens of millions of pieces

462
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,519
of knowledge like that even if you take

463
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,838
trouble to make each one as general as

464
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,959
it possibly could be

465
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:11,599
but

466
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,600
the good news was that thanks to

467
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,958
initially the fifth generation effort

468
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,719
and then later

469
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,959
u.s government

470
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,838
agency funding and so on we were able to

471
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,318
get enough funding not for a couple

472
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,798
person centuries of time but for a

473
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:29,359
couple person millennia of time which is

474
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,918
what we've spent since 1984

475
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,319
getting psych to contain the tens of

476
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:38,000
millions of rules that it needs in order

477
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,159
to really capture uh and span uh sort of

478
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,640
not all of human knowledge but the

479
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,080
things that you assume other people the

480
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,120
things you count on other people knowing

481
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,599
and

482
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,719
so by now we've done that

483
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:56,719
and the good news is since you've waited

484
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:58,160
38 years just about to talk to me

485
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,919
we're about at the

486
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,840
at the end of that process so most of

487
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,280
what we're doing now is not putting in

488
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,399
even what you would consider common

489
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,839
sense but more putting in

490
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,798
domain-specific application-specific

491
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,798
knowledge about

492
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,480
healthcare

493
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:19,600
in a certain hospital or about um

494
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,839
oil um pipes getting um clogged up or

495
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,319
whatever the applications happen to be

496
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,839
so we've almost come full circle and

497
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,639
we're doing things very much like the

498
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:31,038
expert systems of the 1970s and the

499
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,120
1980s except instead of resting on

500
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,599
nothing and being brittle they're now

501
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,079
resting on this massive pyramid if you

502
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,558
will this massive lattice of common

503
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,879
sense knowledge so that when things go

504
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,038
wrong when something unexpected happens

505
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,039
they can fall back on more and more and

506
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,319
more general principles

507
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:51,839
eventually bottoming out in things like

508
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,678
for instance if we have a problem with

509
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,959
the microphone one of the things you'll

510
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,200
do is

511
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,200
unplug it plug it in again and hope for

512
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,798
the best right because that's one of the

513
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,798
general pieces of knowledge you have in

514
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:04,720
dealing with electronic equipment or

515
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,240
software systems or

516
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,079
things like that is there a basic

517
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,319
principle like that like is it possible

518
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,720
to encode something that generally

519
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,558
captures this idea of

520
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,798
turn it off and turn it back on and see

521
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,399
if it fixes oh absolutely that's one of

522
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,240
the things that

523
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,080
that's like news that's actually one of

524
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,120
the fundamental

525
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,359
laws of nature i believe

526
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,359
i wouldn't i wouldn't call it a law it's

527
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,159
it's more like a um

528
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,519
it seems to work every time so it sure

529
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,200
sure is like looks like a law i don't

530
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:39,759
know so that um that basically um

531
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,600
covered the um the resources needed and

532
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,839
then we had to devise a method to

533
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,759
actually figure out well what are the

534
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,798
tens of millions of things that we need

535
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,160
to tell the system and for that we found

536
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,798
a few

537
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,400
techniques which worked really well one

538
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:58,079
is to take um any piece of text almost

539
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,919
it could be an advertisement it could be

540
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,759
a transcript it could be a novel it

541
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,880
could be an article

542
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:07,359
and don't pay attention to the actual

543
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,280
type that's there the the black space on

544
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,359
the white page pay attention to the

545
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,759
complement of that the white space if

546
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,719
you will so what did the writer of this

547
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,720
sentence

548
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,640
assume that the reader already knew

549
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,400
about the world for instance if they

550
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,320
used a pronoun

551
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,880
how did they figure out that why did

552
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:27,279
they think that you would be able to

553
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,720
understand what the intended referent of

554
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,359
that pronoun was if they used an

555
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,440
ambiguous word how did they think that

556
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,918
you would be able to figure out what

557
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,400
they meant by that word

558
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,480
the other thing we look at is the gap

559
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,159
between one sentence and the next one

560
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,960
what are all the things that the writer

561
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,880
expected you to fill in and infer

562
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,159
occurred between the end of one sentence

563
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,320
and the beginning of the other so like

564
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,960
if the sentence says

565
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:55,359
fred smith robbed the third national

566
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,079
bank period

567
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,399
he was sentenced to 20 years in prison

568
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,960
period well between the first sentence

569
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,759
and the second you're expected to infer

570
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,720
things like fred got caught fred

571
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:11,119
got arrested fred went to jail fred had

572
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,200
a trial fred was found guilty

573
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,359
and so on if my next sentence starts out

574
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,759
with something like the judge dot dot

575
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,599
dot um then you assume it's the judge at

576
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,839
his trial if my next sentence starts out

577
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,599
something like the arresting officer dot

578
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,439
dot dot you assumed that it was the

579
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:28,158
police officer who arrested him after he

580
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,080
committed the crime and so on so um

581
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,679
that's it those are two techniques for

582
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,519
getting um

583
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,240
that knowledge the the other thing we

584
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:39,440
sometimes look at is uh sort of like

585
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,120
fake news or uh sort of humorous um

586
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,880
onion headlines or um headlines in um

587
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,038
the weekly world news if you know what

588
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,440
that is or the national enquirer where

589
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,440
it's like oh we don't believe this then

590
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,440
we introspect on why don't we believe it

591
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,880
so they're things like um

592
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,480
b17 lands on the moon you know it's like

593
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,240
why don't we what do we know about the

594
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,880
world that causes us to believe that

595
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,519
that's just silly or uh something like

596
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,159
that or um another thing we look for are

597
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,960
contradictions um where with things

598
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,960
which can't both be true um and we say

599
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,558
to like what is it that we know that

600
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,720
causes us to know that both of these

601
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,119
can't be true at the same at the same

602
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,720
time for instance in one of the weekly

603
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,959
world news um

604
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,079
editions in one article it talked about

605
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,000
how elvis was cited um you know even

606
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,319
though he was uh you know getting on in

607
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,319
years and so on and another article in

608
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,839
the same one talked about people seeing

609
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,079
elvis ghost

610
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,839
okay so it's like why why do we believe

611
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,439
that at least one of these articles you

612
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:42,158
know must be wrong

613
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,000
and so on so um so we have a series of

614
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,039
techniques like that that enable our

615
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,720
people um and by now uh we have about 50

616
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:51,279
people working full-time on this and

617
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,120
have for for decades so we've put in the

618
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,359
thousands of person years of effort

619
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,839
we've built up these tens of millions of

620
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,639
rules we constantly

621
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,798
police the system to make sure that

622
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,640
we're saying things as generally as we

623
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,079
possibly can

624
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,400
so

625
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,960
you don't want to say things like um no

626
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,200
mouse is also a moose

627
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,038
because if you said things like that

628
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,480
then you'd have to add another one or

629
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:20,400
two or three zeros onto the number of

630
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,200
assertions you'd actually have to have

631
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,440
so

632
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,798
at some point we generalize things more

633
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,440
and more and we get to a point where we

634
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,400
say oh yeah for any two biological

635
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,880
taxons if we don't know explicitly that

636
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,038
one is a generalization of another then

637
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,640
almost certainly they're disjoint

638
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,480
a member of one is not going to be a

639
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,080
member of the other and so on so and the

640
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,000
same thing with the elvis and the ghost

641
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,278
it has nothing to do with elvis it's

642
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,038
more about

643
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:47,599
the human nature and then the the

644
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,440
mortality and well right in general

645
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,399
things are not both alive and dead at

646
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,440
the same time yeah and unless special

647
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,840
cats in in theoretical physics examples

648
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,759
well that raises um a couple important

649
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,678
points well that's the onion headline

650
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,599
situation type of thing okay sorry but

651
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,038
no no so so what you bring up is this

652
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,839
really important point of like well how

653
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,519
do you handle exceptions and

654
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,240
inconsistencies

655
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,639
and so on um and one of the hardest

656
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,440
lessons for us to learn it took us about

657
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,400
five years to to really grit our teeth

658
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,480
and

659
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,360
learned to love it

660
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,079
is we had to give up global consistency

661
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,319
so the knowledge base can no longer be

662
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,558
consistent so this is a kind of scary

663
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,879
thought i grew up watching star trek and

664
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:35,519
anytime a computer was inconsistent it

665
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,520
would either freeze up or explode or

666
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,720
take over the world or something bad

667
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,319
would happen

668
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,200
or if you come from a mathematics

669
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,678
background once you can prove false you

670
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,120
can prove anything so that's not good

671
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,720
and so on so

672
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,199
that's why on the

673
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,759
old knowledge-based systems were all

674
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,200
very very consistent but the trouble is

675
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,519
that

676
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,360
by and large our models of the world the

677
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,079
way we talk about the world and so on

678
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,079
there are all sorts of inconsistencies

679
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,839
that creep in here and there

680
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,558
that will sort of kill some attempt to

681
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,158
build some enormous globally consistent

682
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,519
knowledge base and so what we had to

683
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,640
move to

684
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,798
was a system of local consistency so a

685
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,559
good analogy is you know that the

686
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,240
surface of the earth is more or less

687
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,839
spherical

688
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,038
globally

689
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,558
but you live your life every day as

690
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:28,319
though the surface of the earth were

691
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:30,079
flat you know when you're talking to

692
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,079
someone in australia you don't think of

693
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,319
them as being oriented upside down to

694
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,639
you when you're planning a trip you know

695
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,158
even if it's a thousand miles away

696
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,759
you may think a little bit about time

697
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,919
zones but you rarely think about the

698
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,839
curvature of the earth and so on and for

699
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,240
most purposes you can live your whole

700
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:49,199
life without really worrying about that

701
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,519
because the earth is locally flat

702
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,080
in much the same way the psych knowledge

703
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,558
base is divided up into almost like

704
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:59,199
tectonic plates which are individual

705
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,359
contexts and each context

706
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,159
is more or less consistent but there can

707
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,639
be

708
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,278
small inconsistencies at the boundary

709
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,480
between one context and the next one and

710
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:13,200
so on and so by the time you move say 20

711
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,000
contexts over there could be glaring

712
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,240
inconsistencies so eventually you get

713
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,240
from the normal modern real world

714
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,120
context that we're in right now to

715
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,599
something you know like um road runner

716
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:28,000
cartoon context where physics is very

717
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:29,519
different and in fact life and death are

718
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,519
very different because no matter how

719
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,759
many times he's killed you know the

720
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,119
coyote comes back in the next scene and

721
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,679
and so on

722
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,759
so um that that was a hard lesson to

723
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,159
learn and we had to make sure that our

724
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,519
representation language the way we the

725
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,360
way that we actually encode the

726
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,879
knowledge and represent it was

727
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,519
expressive enough that we could talk

728
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,440
about things being true in one context

729
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,599
and false in another things that are

730
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,759
true at one time and false in another

731
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,000
things that are true let's say in one

732
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,839
region like one country but false in

733
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,759
another things that are true in one

734
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,759
person's belief system

735
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,839
but false in another person's belief

736
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,158
system things that are true at one level

737
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,399
of abstraction and false at another for

738
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,080
instance at one level of abstraction

739
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,600
you think of this table as a solid

740
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,839
object but at you know down at the

741
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,719
atomic level it's mostly empty space and

742
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:21,439
so on so then that's fascinating and but

743
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,480
it puts a lot of pressure on context to

744
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,880
do a lot of work so you say tectonic

745
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,440
plates is it possible to formulate

746
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,919
contacts that are general and big

747
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,278
that do this kind of capture of

748
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,520
knowledge bases

749
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:38,079
or do you then get turtles on top of

750
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,558
turtles again where there's just a huge

751
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,079
number of contexts so it's good you ask

752
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,678
that question because

753
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,038
you're pointed in the right direction

754
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,200
which is

755
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,119
you want context to be

756
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,960
first class objects

757
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,599
in your system's knowledge base in

758
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,000
particular in sykes knowledge base

759
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:57,599
and by first class object i mean that

760
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,519
it should we should be able to have

761
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,119
psych think about and talk about and

762
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,278
reason about

763
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,599
one context or another context the same

764
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:09,679
way it reasons about coffee cups and

765
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:12,879
tables and people and fishing and so on

766
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,960
and so contexts are just terms in its

767
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,840
language just like the ones i mentioned

768
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,600
and so psych can reason about

769
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,000
context context can arrange

770
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:25,199
hierarchically and so on

771
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,558
and so you can say things about let's

772
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,759
say

773
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,678
things that are true in the modern era

774
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,839
things that are true in a particular

775
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,320
year would then be a sub context of the

776
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,319
the things that are true in um abroad

777
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,158
let's say a century or a millennium or

778
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,879
something like that things that are true

779
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,440
in austin texas are generally going to

780
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,840
be a specialization of

781
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,440
things that are true in texas which is

782
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,359
going to be a specialization of things

783
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,320
that are true in the united states and

784
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,319
so on

785
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:59,119
and so you don't have to say things over

786
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,678
and over over again at all these levels

787
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,839
you just say things at the most general

788
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,519
level that it applies to and you only

789
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,678
have to say it once and then it

790
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,960
essentially inherits to all these more

791
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,880
specific

792
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,798
contexts ask a slightly technical

793
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,679
question is this inherent in an

794
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,960
inheritance a tree or a graph oh you

795
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,080
definitely have to think of it as a

796
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,720
graph

797
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,639
so we could talk about for instance why

798
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,720
the japanese fifth generation computing

799
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,799
effort failed there were about half a

800
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,278
dozen different reasons one of the

801
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:32,158
reasons they failed was because they

802
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,159
tried to represent knowledge as a tree

803
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,120
rather than as a graph

804
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,278
and so each node in their

805
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,599
representation

806
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:44,159
could only have one parent

807
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:46,719
node so if you had a table that was a

808
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,600
wooden object a black object a flat

809
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,558
object and so you have to choose one and

810
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,558
that's the only parent it could have

811
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,480
when of course you know depending on

812
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:57,918
what it is you need to reason about it

813
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,440
sometimes it's important to know that

814
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,520
it's made out of wood like if we're

815
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,278
talking about a fire sometimes it's

816
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,960
important to know that it's flat if

817
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:06,839
we're talking about resting something on

818
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,000
it and so on so

819
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:12,398
um one of the one of the problems was

820
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,640
that they wanted a kind of dewey decimal

821
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,879
numbering system for all of their

822
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,038
concepts which meant that each node

823
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,360
could only have at most

824
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:23,440
10 children and each node could only

825
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,398
have one parent

826
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,200
and

827
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,558
while that does enable the dewey decimal

828
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,798
type

829
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,158
numbering of concepts labeling of

830
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:33,918
concepts

831
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,640
it prevents you from representing all

832
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,640
the things you need to about objects in

833
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,200
our in our world and that was one of the

834
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,038
things which um they never were able to

835
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,600
overcome and i think that was one of the

836
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,119
main reasons that that project failed so

837
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,959
we'll return to some of the doors you've

838
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:52,000
opened but if we can go back to that

839
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,200
room in 1984 around there with marvin

840
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,038
minsky yeah

841
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,319
but by the way i should mention that

842
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,720
marvin um wouldn't do his estimate until

843
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,639
someone brought him an envelope so that

844
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,798
he could literally do a back of the

845
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,278
envelope calculations to come up with

846
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,839
his number

847
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,759
well because i i feel like

848
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,278
the conversation in that room is an

849
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,679
important one

850
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,519
you know this this how um

851
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,679
sometimes science is done in this way a

852
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,759
few people get together and plant the

853
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,880
seed of ideas and they reverberate

854
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:27,278
throughout history and some some kind of

855
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,039
dissipating disappear and some

856
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,880
you know drake equation and you know

857
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,119
they you know seems like a meaningless

858
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,720
equation somewhat meaningless but i

859
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,798
think it drives and motivates a lot of

860
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,839
scientists and when the aliens finally

861
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,158
show up

862
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,839
that equation will get even more uh

863
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,399
valuable because then we'll get be able

864
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,599
to in the long arc of history the drake

865
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:46,558
equation will

866
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,398
um

867
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,678
will prove to be

868
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,000
quite useful

869
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,480
i think in that same way a conversation

870
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,159
of just how many facts

871
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,839
are required to capture the basic common

872
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,039
sense knowledge of the world that's a

873
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,798
fascinating question i want to

874
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,519
distinguish between what you think of as

875
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,200
facts and the kind of things that we

876
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,640
represent so

877
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,480
um we we map to and essentially make

878
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,960
sure that psych has the ability to as it

879
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,798
were read and access the kind of facts

880
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,399
you might find say

881
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:20,480
in wikidata or stated in a wikipedia

882
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,158
article or something like that so what

883
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,919
we're representing the things that we

884
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,960
need a small number of tens of millions

885
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,519
of are more like rules of thumb rules of

886
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:33,038
good guessing things which are usually

887
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,240
true and which help you to make sense of

888
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,640
the

889
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,278
facts that are on sort of sitting off in

890
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,440
some database or some other more static

891
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:43,839
story so they're almost like platonic

892
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,919
forms so like when you read stuff on

893
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,759
wikipedia that's going to be like

894
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,080
projections of those ideas you read an

895
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,319
article about the fact that elvis died

896
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:56,480
that's a projection of the idea that uh

897
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:58,879
humans are mortal and like you know very

898
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,159
few wikipedia articles will write humans

899
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,919
are immortal

900
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,399
exactly and that's what i meant about

901
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,159
ferreting out the unstated things in

902
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,038
texas what are all the things that were

903
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,559
assumed and so those are things like um

904
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,440
if you have a problem with something

905
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:15,119
turning it off and on um often fixes it

906
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,120
for reasons we don't really understand

907
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,959
and we're not happy about or

908
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,398
people can't be both alive and dead at

909
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,038
the same time and or water flows

910
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,479
downhill if you search online for water

911
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,158
flowing uphill and water flowing

912
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,558
downhill you'll find more references for

913
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,640
water flowing uphill because it's used

914
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:34,960
as a kind of a

915
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,440
metaphorical reference for some unlikely

916
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,759
thing because of course everyone already

917
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,919
knows that water flows downhill so why

918
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,158
would anyone bother saying that do you

919
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,679
have a word you prefer

920
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,000
because we said facts isn't the right

921
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,840
word is there a word like concepts i

922
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
would say assertions

923
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,000
assertions or rules because i'm not

924
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,159
talking about rigid rules but rules of

925
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,398
thumb but assertions

926
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,278
is a nice one that covers

927
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,719
all of these things yeah as a programmer

928
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,919
to me a cert

929
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,769
has a very dogmatic authoritarian feel

930
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,159
to them i'm sorry

931
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:11,039
[Laughter]

932
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,280
i'm so sorry okay but assertions works

933
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,119
okay so if we go back to that room with

934
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,599
marvel minsky with you

935
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,000
all these seminal figures uh

936
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,519
uh ed foggy mom

937
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,719
thinking about

938
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,960
this very

939
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,638
philosophical but also engineering

940
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,039
question

941
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,878
we can also go back a couple of decades

942
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,639
before then and thinking about

943
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,878
artificial intelligence broadly when

944
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,760
people were thinking about you know how

945
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:39,358
do you create super intelligent systems

946
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,280
general intelligence

947
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:44,159
and i think people's intuition was

948
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,519
off

949
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,599
at the time

950
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,878
and i mean this continues to be the case

951
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,960
that we're not

952
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,799
when we're grappling with these

953
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,960
exceptionally difficult ideas we're not

954
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,200
always it's very difficult to

955
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,199
truly understand ourselves when we're

956
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,239
thinking about the human mind

957
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:04,319
to to introspect how difficult it is to

958
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,838
engineer intelligence to solve

959
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,200
intelligence we're not very good at

960
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:08,000
estimating that

961
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,559
and

962
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,760
you are somebody who has really stayed

963
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,679
with this question for decades

964
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,560
do you what's your sense

965
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,799
from the 1984 to today

966
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,880
have you gotten a stronger

967
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,680
sense of just how much knowledge is

968
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,280
required so you've kind of said

969
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,199
with some level of certainty that's

970
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,119
still on the order of magnitude of tens

971
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,639
of millions right but for the first

972
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,838
several years i would have said that it

973
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:39,039
was on the order of one or two million

974
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:41,039
yeah and so um it took it took us about

975
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,079
five or six years to realize that we

976
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,400
were off

977
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,200
um by by a factor of 10. but i guess

978
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,280
what i'm asking you know marvin miska is

979
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,639
very confident in the 60s when you say

980
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,079
yes right

981
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,759
what's your

982
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,240
sense

983
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,240
if you

984
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,559
you know 200 years from now

985
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,559
you're still

986
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,960
you know you're you're not going to be

987
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:07,039
any longer in this particular biological

988
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,358
body but your brain will still be

989
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,559
uh in the digital form and you'll be

990
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,480
looking back

991
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,000
would you think you were

992
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,000
smart today

993
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,800
like your intuition was right or do you

994
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,119
think

995
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,320
you may be really off

996
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,559
so i i think i'm i'm right enough and

997
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,280
let me explain what i mean by that which

998
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:26,880
is

999
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,079
um

1000
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,160
sometimes like if you have an

1001
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,640
old-fashioned pump you have to prime the

1002
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,598
pump yeah and then eventually it starts

1003
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:35,598
so

1004
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,960
i think i'm i'm right enough in the

1005
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,359
sense that

1006
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,400
what we what we've built yeah even if it

1007
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:45,279
isn't so to speak everything you need

1008
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,639
it's primed the knowledge pump enough

1009
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,880
that

1010
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,159
psych can now itself

1011
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,480
help to

1012
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,039
learn more and more automatically on its

1013
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,440
own by reading things and understanding

1014
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:00,000
and occasionally asking questions like a

1015
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,760
student would or something and by doing

1016
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,838
experiments and discovering things on

1017
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,079
its own and so on so through a

1018
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:07,679
combination of

1019
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,760
psych-powered discovery and

1020
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:12,399
psych-powered reading

1021
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,240
it will be able to bootstrap itself

1022
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,240
maybe it's the final two percent maybe

1023
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,639
it's the final 99

1024
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,679
so even if i'm if i'm wrong

1025
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:24,559
all i really need to build is a system

1026
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,159
which has primed the pump enough that it

1027
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,358
can begin

1028
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,920
that cascade upward that

1029
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:31,920
self-reinforcing

1030
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,800
sort of quadratically or maybe even

1031
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,000
exponentially increasing

1032
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,760
path upward um that we get from for

1033
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,679
instance talking with each other that's

1034
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,520
why um

1035
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,199
humans today know so much more than

1036
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,119
humans a hundred thousand years ago

1037
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:49,118
we're not really that much smarter than

1038
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,640
people were a hundred thousand years ago

1039
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,880
but there's so much more knowledge and

1040
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:55,279
we have language and we can communicate

1041
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,599
we can check things on google and so on

1042
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,760
so effectively we have this enormous

1043
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,079
power at our fingertips

1044
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,000
and there's almost no limit to how much

1045
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,160
you could learn if you wanted to because

1046
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,079
you've already gotten to a certain level

1047
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,319
of understanding of the world that

1048
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,400
enables you to read all these articles

1049
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,400
and understand them that enables you to

1050
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,480
go out and if necessary do experiments

1051
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,599
although that's slower as a way of

1052
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,679
gathering data and so on and and i think

1053
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,720
this is really an important point which

1054
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,358
is

1055
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:27,358
if we have artificial intelligence real

1056
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,440
general artificial intelligence human

1057
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,719
level artificial intelligence

1058
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,440
then

1059
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,759
people will become smarter

1060
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,480
um it's not so much that it'll be us

1061
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,280
versus the ais it's more like us and the

1062
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,519
ais together we'll be able to do things

1063
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,519
that require more creativity

1064
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:47,119
that would take too long right now but

1065
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,519
we'll be able to do lots of things in

1066
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,760
parallel we'll be able to misunderstand

1067
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,920
each other less

1068
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,000
[Music]

1069
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,480
there's all sorts of

1070
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,039
value that effectively for an individual

1071
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,199
would mean that individual will for all

1072
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,199
intents and purposes be smarter

1073
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,078
and that means that humanity as a

1074
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:08,719
species will be smarter and when was the

1075
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,720
last time that any invention

1076
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:12,879
qualitatively

1077
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:14,799
made a huge difference in human

1078
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,800
intelligence um you have to go back a

1079
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,519
long ways it wasn't like the internet or

1080
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,400
the computer or mathematics or something

1081
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:25,039
it was all the way back to the

1082
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,358
development of language we sort of look

1083
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:31,119
back on pre-linguistic cavemen as well

1084
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:33,119
you know they they weren't really

1085
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,000
intelligent were they they weren't

1086
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:40,000
really human were they and i think that

1087
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,800
um as you said 50 100 200 years from now

1088
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,838
people will look back on people today

1089
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,880
um

1090
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:51,358
right before the advent of these sort of

1091
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,599
lifelong general ai muses

1092
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,279
and say you know those poor those poor

1093
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,400
people they weren't really human were

1094
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,320
they

1095
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,559
exactly so you said a lot of really

1096
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,240
interesting things by the way i would

1097
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,119
maybe

1098
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:07,919
uh try to argue that the internet

1099
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,880
is on is on the order of

1100
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,800
um

1101
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,800
the kind of big leap in improvement that

1102
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,400
the invention of language was it's

1103
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,839
certainly a big leap in one direction

1104
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,480
we're not sure whether it's upward or

1105
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,159
downward well i i mean very specific

1106
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,519
parts of the internet which is access to

1107
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,879
information like a website like

1108
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,960
wikipedia

1109
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,800
like ability for human beings from

1110
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,960
across the world to access information

1111
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,880
so very quickly so i i could take either

1112
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,880
side of this argument and since you just

1113
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,800
took one side i'll give you the other

1114
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,079
side which is that

1115
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,480
almost nothing has done more harm

1116
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,480
than something like the internet and

1117
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,960
access to that information

1118
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,960
in two ways one is it's made people more

1119
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,519
globally ignorant

1120
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,960
in the same way that calculators

1121
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,838
made us

1122
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,838
more or less innumerate so when i was

1123
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,318
growing up we had to use slide rules we

1124
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,078
had to be able to estimate yeah and so

1125
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,480
on today

1126
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,160
people don't really understand numbers

1127
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,960
they don't really understand math they

1128
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,879
don't really estimate very well at all

1129
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,400
and so on they don't really understand

1130
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,318
the difference between trillions and

1131
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,240
billions and millions and so on very

1132
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:21,039
well

1133
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:24,559
because calculators do that all for us

1134
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:27,358
um and um thanks to uh things like the

1135
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:30,639
internet and search engines um

1136
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:32,719
that same kind of juvenilism

1137
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,559
is reinforced in making people

1138
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,399
essentially be able to live their whole

1139
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:39,039
lives not just without being able to do

1140
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,880
arithmetic and estimate but now without

1141
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,639
actually having to really know almost

1142
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,240
anything because anytime they need to

1143
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,239
know something they'll just go and look

1144
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:47,679
it up right and i can tell you could

1145
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,598
play both sides of this and it is a

1146
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,118
double-edged sword you can of course say

1147
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,960
the same thing about language probably

1148
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,280
people when they invented language they

1149
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,119
would criticize you know it used to be

1150
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,040
we would just if we're angry we would

1151
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,119
just kill a person and if we're in love

1152
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,440
we'll just have sex with them and now

1153
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,358
everybody's writing poetry and [ __ ]

1154
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,599
that you know you should just be direct

1155
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,480
you should like have physical contact

1156
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,760
enough with this words and books and

1157
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,280
it's you're you're not actually

1158
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,040
experiencing like if you read a book

1159
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,200
you're not experiencing the thing this

1160
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,800
is nonsense that's right if you read a

1161
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,480
book about how to make butter that's not

1162
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,160
the same as if you had to like learn it

1163
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,000
and do it yourself exactly

1164
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:25,598
and so on so so let's just say that

1165
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,559
something is gained but something is

1166
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:33,280
lost every time you have um these these

1167
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:36,480
sorts of dependencies um on technology

1168
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,119
um and overall i think that the um

1169
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,679
having smarter individuals and having

1170
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,440
smarter ai augmented

1171
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,399
human species

1172
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,400
will be

1173
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,720
one of the few ways that we'll actually

1174
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,559
be able to overcome some of the global

1175
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:53,279
problems we have involving

1176
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,639
poverty and starvation and global

1177
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,560
warming and

1178
00:42:54,639 --> 00:43:00,078
overcrowding all the other

1179
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:02,318
problems that that are besetting

1180
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,920
the planet we really need to be smarter

1181
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:06,480
and they're really only two routes to

1182
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,200
being smarter one is through

1183
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,199
biochemistry and

1184
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,480
genetics

1185
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,719
genetic engineering

1186
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,960
the other route is through having

1187
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:19,519
general ais that

1188
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,559
augment our intelligence

1189
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,759
and

1190
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,279
you know hopefully one of those two

1191
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,079
ways of

1192
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,839
paths to salvation will will come

1193
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,880
through before it's too late yeah

1194
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:33,440
absolutely i agree with you and

1195
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,480
obviously as an engineer i have

1196
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,280
um

1197
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,719
i have a better sense and an optimism

1198
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,560
about the technology side of things

1199
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:42,959
because you can control things there

1200
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,480
more biology is just such a giant mess

1201
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,960
we're living through a pandemic now

1202
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:50,000
there's so many ways that nature can

1203
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,519
just be just destructive and destructive

1204
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,838
in a way where it doesn't even notice

1205
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,920
you you're not it's not like a battle

1206
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,838
of humans versus virus it's just like

1207
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,440
huh okay and then you can just wipe out

1208
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,318
an entire species

1209
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,039
the other problem with the internet

1210
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:08,000
is that it has enabled

1211
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:12,079
us to surround ourselves with an echo

1212
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,639
chamber with a bubble of like-minded

1213
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,560
people which means that you can have

1214
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:18,879
truly bizarre

1215
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,000
theories conspiracy theories fake news

1216
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,358
and so on

1217
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
promulgate

1218
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:26,078
and surround yourself with people who

1219
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,239
essentially reinforce

1220
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,720
um what you want to believe or what you

1221
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:33,759
already believe about the world

1222
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:36,399
and in the in the old days that was much

1223
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,040
harder to do when you had say only three

1224
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,880
tv networks or even before when you had

1225
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,279
no tv networks and you had to actually

1226
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,280
like look at the world and make your own

1227
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,720
reasoned decisions i like the push and

1228
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,319
pull of our dance that we're doing

1229
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,480
because then i'll just say in the old

1230
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,880
world having come from the soviet union

1231
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,400
because you had won a couple of networks

1232
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,920
then propaganda could be much more

1233
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,318
effective and then the government can

1234
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,280
overpower its people by telling you the

1235
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:00,239
truth

1236
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,519
and then

1237
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,838
starving millions and torturing millions

1238
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:08,480
and putting millions into camps and

1239
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,679
starting wars with a propaganda machine

1240
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,519
allowing you to believe that you're

1241
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:13,598
actually good doing good in the world

1242
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,239
with the internet because of all the

1243
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,838
quote unquote conspiracy theories

1244
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,919
some of them are actually challenging

1245
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:22,639
the power centers the very kind of power

1246
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,680
centers that a century ago would have

1247
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,318
led to

1248
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:28,318
the death of millions so there's a it's

1249
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:30,400
again this double-edged sword and i i

1250
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:33,039
very much agree with you on the ai side

1251
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,760
it's it's often an intuition that people

1252
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:38,960
have that somehow ai will be used to

1253
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,000
maybe overpower people by certain select

1254
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,920
groups

1255
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,760
and to me it's not all obvious that

1256
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,599
that's the likely scenario to me the

1257
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,119
likely scenario

1258
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,119
especially just having observed the

1259
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,440
trajectory of technology is it'll be

1260
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,119
used to empower people it'll be used to

1261
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,440
extend

1262
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,880
the capabilities of

1263
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,720
individuals

1264
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,800
across the world because there's a lot

1265
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,480
of money to be made that way

1266
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,839
like improving people's lives you can

1267
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,440
make a lot of money agree i think that

1268
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:08,639
the

1269
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,679
the main the main thing that

1270
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,799
ai

1271
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:15,598
prosthesis ai amplifiers will do for

1272
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,640
people is make it easier maybe even

1273
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,599
unavoidable for them to do good critical

1274
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:22,879
thinking

1275
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:26,640
um so pointing out logical fallacies

1276
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,640
logical contradictions and so on in

1277
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:31,039
things that they otherwise would just

1278
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:33,039
blithely believe

1279
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,559
pointing out

1280
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,000
essentially

1281
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,639
data which

1282
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,280
they should take into consideration

1283
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,358
if they really want to

1284
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,640
learn the truth about something and so

1285
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:48,000
on so i think

1286
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:50,480
doing not just educating in the sense of

1287
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,960
pouring facts into people's heads but

1288
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,880
educating in the sense of arming people

1289
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,480
with the ability to do good critical

1290
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,400
thinking is enormously powerful

1291
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,039
the education system

1292
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,760
that we have in the u.s and worldwide

1293
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:06,960
generally don't do a good job of that um

1294
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,040
but

1295
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,880
i believe that the ai

1296
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,920
the ais can and will in the same way

1297
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,559
that everyone can have their own um um

1298
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,039
alexa or siri or

1299
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,799
google assistant or whatever um um

1300
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,440
everyone will have this sort of cradle

1301
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,039
to grave assistant

1302
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,039
which will get to know you which you'll

1303
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,558
get to trust it'll model you you'll

1304
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:31,440
model it

1305
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,519
and

1306
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,159
it'll call to your attention things

1307
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:39,039
which will in some sense make your life

1308
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:42,159
better easier less

1309
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,679
mistake written and so on less regret

1310
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:47,279
written

1311
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:49,919
if you listen to listen to it yeah i'm

1312
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,920
in full agreement with you about

1313
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,440
this like space of technologies and i

1314
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,920
think it's super exciting from my

1315
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,000
perspective integrating emotional

1316
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,318
intelligence so even things like

1317
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,639
friendship and companionship and love

1318
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:05,358
into those kinds of systems

1319
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:07,519
as opposed to helping you just grow

1320
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:09,279
intellectually as a human being allow

1321
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,039
you to grow emotionally which is

1322
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,920
ultimately what makes life

1323
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,440
amazing is to to sort of

1324
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,519
you know the the old pursuit of

1325
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,679
happiness so it's not just the pursuit

1326
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,480
of reason it's the pursuit of happiness

1327
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:23,039
yes

1328
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,480
the full spectrum well let me um sort of

1329
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,159
because you mentioned so many

1330
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,039
fascinating things let me jump back to

1331
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,279
the

1332
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,000
idea of automated reasoning

1333
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,559
so

1334
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,159
the acquisition of new knowledge

1335
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,119
has been done in this very interesting

1336
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:37,920
way

1337
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,400
but primarily by humans

1338
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,920
doing this um yes you can think of

1339
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,318
monks in their cells in medieval europe

1340
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,400
um you know carefully illuminating

1341
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:50,800
manuscripts and so on it's a very

1342
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,119
difficult and amazing process actually

1343
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,400
because it allows you to truly ask the

1344
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,200
question about

1345
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,160
the

1346
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:00,399
in the white space what is assumed i

1347
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,679
think this exercise

1348
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,960
is um like very few people do this right

1349
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:07,199
they just

1350
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,440
do it subconsciously they perform by

1351
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:13,759
definition but because because those

1352
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:16,639
pieces of elided of omitted information

1353
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,960
of those missing steps as it were

1354
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:21,440
are pieces of common sense if you

1355
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,440
actually included all of them it would

1356
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,519
it would almost be offensive or

1357
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,960
confusing to the readers like why are

1358
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,119
they telling me all these of course i

1359
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,720
know that you know all these things

1360
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,960
and so um

1361
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:34,558
so it's one of these things which almost

1362
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,480
by its very nature

1363
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,640
um has has

1364
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,079
almost never been explicitly written

1365
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:41,279
down anywhere

1366
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,200
because

1367
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,599
by the time you're old enough to talk to

1368
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:48,558
other people and so on um you know if

1369
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,880
you survived to that age presumably you

1370
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:53,359
already got pieces of common sense like

1371
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,200
um you know if something causes you pain

1372
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:57,358
whenever you do it probably not a good

1373
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,799
idea to keep doing it

1374
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,799
uh so

1375
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,559
what ideas do you have given how

1376
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,440
difficult this step is

1377
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,359
what ideas are there for how to do it

1378
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,800
automatically without

1379
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:13,279
using humans or at least not um

1380
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,960
you know doing like a large percentage

1381
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,160
of the work for humans and then humans

1382
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,639
only do the

1383
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:21,759
very high level supervisory work

1384
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:23,598
so we have um uh in fact

1385
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,760
two directions we're pushing on very

1386
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,838
very heavily uh currently at sitecore

1387
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,599
and one involves natural language

1388
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,759
understanding and the ability to read

1389
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:35,039
what people have explicitly written down

1390
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,400
and and to to pull knowledge in that way

1391
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,519
but the other is

1392
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,000
to build a series of

1393
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:44,719
knowledge editing tools knowledge entry

1394
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,280
tools knowledge

1395
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:49,919
capture tools knowledge

1396
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,240
testing tools and so on think of them as

1397
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,639
like user interface

1398
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:57,039
suite of software tools if you want

1399
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,799
something that will help people to more

1400
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:02,159
or less automatically

1401
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,318
expand and extend the system um

1402
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:05,759
in areas where for instance they want to

1403
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:07,838
build some app have it do some

1404
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,440
application or something

1405
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:10,239
like that so i'll give you an example of

1406
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,240
one

1407
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:14,558
which is something called

1408
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:17,358
abduction so you've probably heard of

1409
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,319
like deduction

1410
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:21,119
and

1411
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:23,440
induction and so on but abduction is

1412
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,559
unlike this abduction is not

1413
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,720
sound

1414
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:29,440
it's just useful so

1415
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:32,159
uh for instance um

1416
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,318
deductively if someone is out in the

1417
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,039
rain and they're going to get all wet

1418
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:36,880
and

1419
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,719
when they enter room they might be all

1420
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,039
wet and so on

1421
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,959
so that's deduction

1422
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,318
but if someone were to walk into the

1423
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,720
room right now

1424
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:48,719
and they were dripping wet

1425
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,799
we would immediately look outside to say

1426
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,799
oh did it start to rain or something

1427
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,119
like that now

1428
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,240
why did we say maybe it started to rain

1429
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:01,440
that's not a sound logical inference but

1430
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:02,799
it's certainly a reasonable

1431
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,960
abductive

1432
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,599
leap to say well one of the most common

1433
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,679
ways that a person would have gotten

1434
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,440
dripping wet is if they had gotten

1435
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:14,558
caught out in the rain or something like

1436
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,920
that um so um

1437
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,280
what what does that have to do with what

1438
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,838
we were talking about so suppose you're

1439
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,319
building one of these applications and

1440
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:24,639
the system gets some answer wrong

1441
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:26,558
and you say oh yeah the answer to this

1442
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:28,960
question is

1443
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,119
this one not the one you came up with

1444
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,519
then what the system can do is it can

1445
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,358
use everything it already knows about

1446
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:36,880
common sense general knowledge the

1447
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:38,159
domain you've already been telling it

1448
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,240
about

1449
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:43,199
and context like we talked about and so

1450
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:45,919
on and say well here are

1451
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:48,799
seven alternatives each of which i

1452
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,119
believe is plausible given everything i

1453
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,280
already know and if any of these seven

1454
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,119
things were true i would have come up

1455
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,119
with the answer you just gave me instead

1456
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,680
of the wrong answer i came up with is

1457
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,000
one of these seven things true and then

1458
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,759
you the expert will look at those

1459
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,159
on seven things and say oh yeah number

1460
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,720
five is actually true and so without

1461
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:12,399
actually having to tinker down at the

1462
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:14,558
level of logical assertions and so on um

1463
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,920
you'll be able to educate

1464
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,559
the system in the same way that you

1465
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,559
would help educate another person who

1466
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,640
you were trying to apprentice or

1467
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:25,680
something like that so that that

1468
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:27,279
significantly reduces the mental effort

1469
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:29,679
or significantly increases the

1470
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,519
efficiency of the teacher the human

1471
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:34,558
teacher exactly and it makes more or

1472
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:37,199
less anyone able to to be a teacher um

1473
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,200
in that um in that way so that's that's

1474
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,639
part of the the answer and then the

1475
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,000
other is that

1476
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:45,838
the system on its own will be able to um

1477
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,239
through reading through

1478
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:51,519
conversations with other people and so

1479
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:54,479
on um learn the same way that um you or

1480
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:56,000
i or other humans do

1481
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,000
first of all that's that's a beautiful

1482
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
vision um i'll have to ask you about

1483
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,639
semantic webinar in a second here but

1484
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,639
first uh

1485
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,760
are there

1486
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,760
when we talk about specific techniques

1487
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,480
do you find something inspiring or

1488
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,640
directly useful from the whole space of

1489
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,280
machine learning deep learning these

1490
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,879
kinds of spaces of techniques that have

1491
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,440
been shown effective for certain kinds

1492
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,720
of problems in the recent uh

1493
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,880
now decade and a half i i think of the

1494
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:27,519
machine learning work

1495
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,720
as more or less what our right brain

1496
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:30,880
hemispheres

1497
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:32,879
do so

1498
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,760
being able to

1499
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,640
take a bunch of data and recognize

1500
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,119
patterns being able to statistically

1501
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,118
infer things and so on

1502
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,880
and

1503
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,519
you know i certainly wouldn't want to

1504
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,358
not have a right brain hemisphere but

1505
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:51,679
i'm also glad that i have a left brain

1506
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:54,239
hemisphere as well something that can

1507
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:56,480
metaphorically sit back and puff on its

1508
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,919
pipe and think about

1509
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,358
this thing over here it's like why might

1510
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,960
this have been true

1511
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,480
and

1512
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,559
what are the implications of it how

1513
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,960
should i feel about that and why and so

1514
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,040
on so i'm thinking more deeply and

1515
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,119
slowly um

1516
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,679
what kahneman called thinking slowly

1517
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:15,440
versus thinking quickly whereas you want

1518
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:18,078
machine learning to think quickly but

1519
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,559
you want the ability to think deeply

1520
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,480
even if it's a little slower

1521
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,760
so i'll give you an example of a project

1522
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,760
we did recently with nih involving the

1523
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,200
cleveland clinic and

1524
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,559
a couple other

1525
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:35,358
institutions that we ran a project for

1526
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:38,559
and what it did was it took um guasa's

1527
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:42,000
genome-wide association studies um those

1528
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:44,798
are sort of big databases of

1529
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,920
patients that came into a hospital

1530
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:50,239
they got their dna sequenced because the

1531
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,119
cost of doing that has gone from

1532
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:54,879
infinity to billions of dollars to 100

1533
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,798
dollars or so

1534
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,798
and so now patients routinely get their

1535
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,719
dna sequence so you have these big

1536
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:02,798
databases of

1537
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:05,279
the snips the single nucleotide

1538
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:07,039
polymorphisms the point mutations in a

1539
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,200
patient's dna

1540
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:10,719
and the disease that happened to bring

1541
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:13,358
them into the hospital

1542
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:16,239
so now you can do correlation studies

1543
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:18,798
machine learning studies of which

1544
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:21,439
mutations

1545
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:24,000
are associated with and led to which

1546
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,639
physiological problems and diseases and

1547
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,440
so on like getting arthritis and and so

1548
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,199
on and the problem is that those

1549
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:34,480
correlations turn out to be very

1550
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,919
spurious they turn out to be very noisy

1551
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,798
very many of them

1552
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,960
have led doctors onto wild goose chases

1553
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:43,759
and so on and so they wanted a way of

1554
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,440
eliminating or the bad ones are focusing

1555
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,760
on the good ones and so

1556
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,760
this is where psych comes in which is

1557
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:53,520
psych takes those sort of a to z

1558
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,440
correlations between point mutations and

1559
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:56,880
um medical condition that needs

1560
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,200
treatment

1561
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,280
and we say okay let's use all this

1562
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:04,399
public knowledge and common sense

1563
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,240
knowledge um about what reactions occur

1564
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,798
where in the human body

1565
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:11,118
what polymerizes what what catalyzes

1566
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:12,400
what reactions and so on and let's try

1567
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:17,119
to put together

1568
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:20,400
a 10 or 20 or 30 step causal explanation

1569
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:23,039
of why that mutation might have caused

1570
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,720
that medical condition and so psych

1571
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,639
would put together in some sense some

1572
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,358
rube goldberg like

1573
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,879
chain that would say oh yeah that

1574
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:34,558
mutation

1575
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,119
if it got expressed would be this um

1576
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,720
altered protein which because of that if

1577
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,039
it got to this part of the body would

1578
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:42,879
catalyze this reaction and by the way

1579
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:45,358
that would cause more bioactive vitamin

1580
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,000
d in the person's blood and anyway ten

1581
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,920
steps later that screws screws up bone

1582
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,719
resorption and that's why this person

1583
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:54,240
got osteoporosis early in life and so on

1584
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,439
so that's human interpretable or at

1585
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:59,919
least doctor humanity exactly yeah and

1586
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,599
the important thing even more than that

1587
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:05,519
is

1588
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:07,599
you shouldn't really trust that 20-step

1589
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:08,400
rube goldberg chain any more than you

1590
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,960
trust

1591
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,280
that initial a to z correlation except

1592
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,480
two things one if you can't even think

1593
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,599
of one

1594
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:20,159
causal chain to explain this

1595
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,720
then that correlation probably was just

1596
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:25,838
noise to begin with and secondly and

1597
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:28,318
even more powerfully along the way that

1598
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:30,480
causal chain will make predictions like

1599
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:32,719
the one about having more bioactive

1600
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,440
vitamin d in your blood so you can now

1601
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:37,039
go back to the data about these patients

1602
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,920
and say by the way

1603
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:42,000
did they have slightly elevated levels

1604
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,400
of bioactive vitamin d in their blood

1605
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,480
and so on and if the answer is no that

1606
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,318
strongly disconfirms

1607
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,798
your whole causal chain and if the

1608
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:53,199
answer is yes that somewhat confirms

1609
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:55,119
that causal chain and so using that we

1610
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:58,078
were able to take this on these

1611
00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:00,400
correlations from this gloss database

1612
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:03,280
and we were able to um

1613
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,680
essentially focus the the doctors

1614
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,400
focused the researchers attention on the

1615
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:10,000
very small percentage of correlations

1616
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,079
that had

1617
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,599
some explanation and even better some

1618
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,359
explanation that also made some

1619
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,440
independent prediction that they could

1620
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:19,519
confirm or disconfirm by looking at the

1621
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,159
data so think of it like this kind of

1622
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:24,318
synergy where you want the right brain

1623
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:27,199
machine learning to quickly come up with

1624
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:28,960
possible answers you want the left brain

1625
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:30,000
psych-like ai

1626
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,240
to

1627
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,920
you know think about that and not like

1628
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:35,679
think about why that might have been the

1629
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,440
case and what else would be the case if

1630
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:39,919
that were true and so on and then

1631
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,280
suggest things back to the right brain

1632
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,358
to quickly check out again um to um so

1633
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,798
it's that kind of synergy back and forth

1634
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:51,920
which i think is really what's going to

1635
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:54,079
lead to general ai not um narrow brittle

1636
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,559
machine learning systems and not just

1637
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,400
something like psych okay so that's a

1638
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:00,079
brilliant synergy but i was also

1639
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,240
thinking in terms of the automated

1640
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:04,880
expansion of the knowledge base you

1641
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,798
mentioned nlu

1642
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,480
this is very early days in the machine

1643
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,559
learning space of this but

1644
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,159
self-supervised learning methods you

1645
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,880
know you have these language models

1646
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,920
gpt-3 and so on they just read the

1647
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,640
internet

1648
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,400
and they form representations

1649
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:22,000
that can then be mapped to something

1650
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,280
useful the question is what is the

1651
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,119
useful thing

1652
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,760
uh like they're now playing with a

1653
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,760
pretty cool thing called openac codex

1654
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,599
which is generating programs from

1655
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,559
documentation okay that's kind of useful

1656
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:34,960
it's cool

1657
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:36,480
but my question is can it be used to

1658
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,720
generate

1659
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,159
um in part maybe with some human

1660
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,719
supervision

1661
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:45,598
a psych-like assertions

1662
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:48,399
help feed psych more assertions from

1663
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:50,640
this giant body of internet data

1664
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:53,119
yes that that is in fact one of our

1665
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:54,639
goals is how can we harness machine

1666
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,480
learning how can we harness natural

1667
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:59,039
language processing

1668
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,119
to increasingly automate

1669
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:02,880
the knowledge acquisition process the

1670
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,680
growth of psych and that's what i meant

1671
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:08,318
by priming the pump that

1672
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:11,039
you know if you you sort of learn things

1673
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,719
at the fringe of what you know already

1674
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:14,239
you learn this new thing is similar to

1675
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:15,759
what you know already and here are the

1676
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:18,000
differences and the new things you had

1677
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,960
to learn about it and so on so the more

1678
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,039
you know

1679
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,838
the more and more easily you can learn

1680
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:25,759
new things but unfortunately inversely

1681
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:28,400
if you don't really know anything

1682
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,599
then it's really hard to learn anything

1683
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,440
and so

1684
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,760
if you're not careful if you start out

1685
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,720
with too small

1686
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,960
sort of a core to start this process

1687
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:40,639
it never really takes off and so that's

1688
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,960
why i view this as a pump priming

1689
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:44,719
exercise to get a big enough

1690
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,280
manually produced even though that's

1691
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:49,358
kind of ugly duckling technique put in

1692
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,720
the elbow grease to produce a large

1693
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:52,798
enough core

1694
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:55,519
that you will be able to do all the

1695
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:58,000
kinds of things you're imagining

1696
01:01:55,519 --> 01:02:01,599
without without sort of on ending up

1697
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,199
with the kind of um wacky brittlenesses

1698
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:07,039
that we see for example in

1699
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:08,318
gpt3 um where

1700
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,200
it uh

1701
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:13,440
you know you'll tell it a story about um

1702
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:14,399
um you know someone uh uh putting a

1703
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,519
poison

1704
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,440
um

1705
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:19,920
you know plotting to poison someone and

1706
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,559
so on and then the um you know then you

1707
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,159
know gpt3 says um what's you say what's

1708
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:25,839
the very next sentence the next sentence

1709
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:27,279
is oh yeah that person then drank the

1710
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:29,038
poison they just put together it's like

1711
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,839
that's probably not what happened or

1712
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:36,079
someone or um if you go to siri and um

1713
01:02:32,838 --> 01:02:39,199
um you know i think i have uh you know

1714
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:41,200
where can i go for um help with my um

1715
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,919
alcohol problem or something it'll come

1716
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:46,719
back and say i found seven liquor stores

1717
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,639
near you right you know and you know so

1718
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:51,919
on so you know it's one of these things

1719
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:54,879
where um yes it may be helpful

1720
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,798
most of the time it may even be correct

1721
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,358
most of the time but if it doesn't

1722
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:01,038
really understand what it's saying and

1723
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,239
if it doesn't really understand why

1724
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:04,400
things are true and doesn't really

1725
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:06,318
understand how the world world works

1726
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,880
then some fraction of the time it's

1727
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:12,000
going to be wrong now if your only goal

1728
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:14,400
is to sort of find relevant information

1729
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,559
like search engines do

1730
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,519
then being right 90 of the time is

1731
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:22,240
fantastic that's unbelievably great okay

1732
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:24,719
however if your goal is to like um you

1733
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:26,959
know save the the life of your child who

1734
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:29,679
has some medical problem or your goal is

1735
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:32,079
to uh be able to drive you know for the

1736
01:03:29,679 --> 01:03:34,719
next 10 000 hours of driving without

1737
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:36,559
getting into a fatal accident and so on

1738
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:39,199
then you know

1739
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:42,079
error rates down at the 10 level or even

1740
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:45,439
the 1 level not really acceptable

1741
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:47,680
i like the model of with that learning

1742
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,079
happens at the edge and then you kind of

1743
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:51,519
think of knowledge as this fear

1744
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:53,519
so uh

1745
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:55,280
if you want a large sphere because the

1746
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:56,400
uh the learning is happening on the

1747
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,039
surface

1748
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:02,400
exactly so you have the the what you can

1749
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:05,200
learn next increases quadratically as

1750
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,960
the diameter of that sphere um goes up

1751
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:08,399
it's nice because you think when you

1752
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,240
know nothing

1753
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,480
it's like you can learn anything but the

1754
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:13,838
reality not really

1755
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,838
right if you know if you know nothing

1756
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:19,440
you can really learn nothing

1757
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:22,159
you can appear to learn so i'll also um

1758
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,119
one of the anecdotes i could go back and

1759
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:26,798
um give you about why

1760
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,240
why i feel so strongly about this

1761
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:29,519
personally

1762
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,639
was

1763
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:34,159
in

1764
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:35,759
1980 81

1765
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:37,358
my daughter nicole was born and she's

1766
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,400
actually doing fine now but when she was

1767
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:41,199
a baby

1768
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,798
she was diagnosed as having meningitis

1769
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:44,639
and

1770
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:46,000
doctors wanted to do all these scary

1771
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:46,879
things

1772
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,880
and

1773
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,440
my wife and i were very

1774
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:54,960
worried and we could not get

1775
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:57,358
a meaningful answer from her doctors

1776
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,838
about exactly why they believed this

1777
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:03,038
what the alternatives were and so on and

1778
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:05,279
fortunately a friend of mine ted shortly

1779
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,880
was another assistant professor in

1780
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,519
computer science

1781
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:11,039
at stanford at the time and

1782
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:12,960
he'd been building a program called

1783
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,520
mycin which was a medical diagnosis

1784
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,798
program that happened to specialize

1785
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:19,759
in

1786
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:21,759
blood infections like meningitis and so

1787
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:23,920
he had privileges at stanford hospital

1788
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,400
because he was also an md

1789
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,639
and so we got hold of her chart and we

1790
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,200
put in her case and it came up with

1791
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:33,679
exactly the same diagnoses and exactly

1792
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:35,439
the same therapy recommendations but the

1793
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,279
difference was because it was a

1794
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:40,000
knowledge-based system a rule-based

1795
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:42,160
system it was able to tell us step by

1796
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,280
step by step

1797
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:46,639
why

1798
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:48,720
this was the diagnosis and step by step

1799
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:50,400
why this was the best

1800
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:52,239
on therapy the best

1801
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,880
procedure to um

1802
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:56,798
to to do for her and so on and there was

1803
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,640
a real epiphany because that made all

1804
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:01,199
the difference in the world instead of

1805
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:04,159
blindly having to trust in authority we

1806
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:06,318
were able to understand what was

1807
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,399
actually going on and

1808
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:10,000
so at that at that time i realized that

1809
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,400
that really is what was missing in

1810
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,838
computer programs was that even if they

1811
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,880
got things right

1812
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:18,880
because they didn't really understand

1813
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,880
the way the world works and why things

1814
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:24,079
are the way they are they weren't able

1815
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,160
to give explanations of their answer um

1816
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:28,079
you know and you know it's one thing to

1817
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:30,078
to use a machine learning system that

1818
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,920
says this is what you should you know i

1819
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,839
i think you should get this operation

1820
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,720
and you say why and it says you know

1821
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:39,358
0.83 and you say no in more detail why

1822
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:41,118
and it says 0.831 you know

1823
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:43,119
that's not really very compelling and

1824
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:46,480
that's not really very helpful

1825
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:48,559
there's this idea of the semantic web

1826
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,159
and when i first heard about

1827
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:52,240
i just fell in love with the idea it was

1828
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:53,038
the obvious next step for the internet

1829
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:55,279
sure

1830
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:57,280
and maybe you can speak about what is

1831
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,319
the semantic web what are your thoughts

1832
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,559
about it

1833
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:03,440
how your vision and mission and goals

1834
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,760
with psych are connected integrated

1835
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:08,240
like are they dance partners are they

1836
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,079
aligned what are your thoughts there so

1837
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:12,318
think of the semantic web

1838
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,160
as a kind of knowledge graph and google

1839
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:16,960
already has something they call

1840
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:19,920
knowledge graph for example

1841
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:23,039
which is sort of like a node and link

1842
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,680
diagram so you have these

1843
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,280
nodes that represent concepts or words

1844
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,759
or terms

1845
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:32,559
and then there are some arcs

1846
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:34,960
that connect them that might be labeled

1847
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:37,200
and so you might have a node

1848
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:40,240
with like one person that represents one

1849
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,239
person and

1850
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:47,119
let's say a um a husband link

1851
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,440
that then points to that person's

1852
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:51,760
husband and so there'd be then another

1853
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,639
link that went from that person labeled

1854
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,480
wife that went back to the um first node

1855
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:58,000
and so on so

1856
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:00,000
having having this kind of

1857
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,719
representation is really good if you

1858
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,000
want to represent

1859
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:06,000
binary relations

1860
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:12,719
essentially relations between two things

1861
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:15,599
and if you so if you have um

1862
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:17,599
equivalent of like three word sentences

1863
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:20,079
um you know like uh

1864
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,920
fred's wife is wilma

1865
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:24,559
or something like that you can represent

1866
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,480
that very nicely using

1867
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,719
these kinds of

1868
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:30,798
graph structures or using something like

1869
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:32,798
the semantic web and

1870
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:36,079
and so on but the

1871
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:36,079
the problem is that

1872
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,718
very often what you want to be able to

1873
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,600
express

1874
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:45,679
takes a lot more than three words and a

1875
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,319
lot more than simple

1876
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:51,119
graph structures like that to represent

1877
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:52,400
so for instance um

1878
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:55,599
if you've

1879
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:58,000
read or seen romeo and juliet you know i

1880
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,640
could say to you something like

1881
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,238
uh remember when juliet drank the potion

1882
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:05,440
that put her into a kind of suspended

1883
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,479
anime animation when juliet drank that

1884
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,318
potion

1885
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,599
what did she think that romeo would

1886
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:12,239
think

1887
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,759
when he heard from someone that she was

1888
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,519
dead

1889
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,960
and you could basically understand what

1890
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,640
i'm saying you could understand the

1891
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:22,319
question you could probably remember the

1892
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:24,480
answer was well she thought that

1893
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,480
this friar would have gotten a message

1894
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:30,158
to romeo saying that she was going to do

1895
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:33,519
this but the friar didn't and so so

1896
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:35,920
you're able to represent and reason with

1897
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,359
these much much much more complicated

1898
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,640
expressions

1899
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:43,279
that go way way beyond what simple um

1900
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,798
three as it were three word or forward

1901
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,880
english sentences are which is really

1902
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:48,399
what the semantic web can represent and

1903
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:50,159
really what knowledge graphs can

1904
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:52,798
represent if you could step back for a

1905
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:55,439
second because it's funny you went into

1906
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:58,000
specifics and maybe you can elaborate

1907
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:59,919
but i was also referring to semantic web

1908
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,600
as the vision

1909
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,840
of converting

1910
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,440
data on the internet into something

1911
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,319
that's interpretable

1912
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:10,799
understandable by machines oh of course

1913
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:13,519
at that at that level so so we should

1914
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:16,320
say like what is the semantic web i mean

1915
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:18,000
you could say a lot of things but it

1916
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,238
might not be obvious to a lot of people

1917
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,238
when they do a google search

1918
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:23,519
that just like you said while there

1919
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:25,279
might be something that's called a

1920
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,000
knowledge graph

1921
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:30,399
it's really boils down to

1922
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,960
keyword search

1923
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:34,479
ranked by the quality estimate of the

1924
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:37,279
website

1925
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:39,678
integrating previous human

1926
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:42,158
based google searches and what they

1927
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:44,880
thought was useful it's like some weird

1928
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:46,479
combination of

1929
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:49,199
like surface

1930
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:52,000
level hacks that work exceptionally well

1931
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:54,799
but they don't understand the content

1932
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,359
the full contents of the websites that

1933
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,119
they're searching so google does not

1934
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:00,559
understand

1935
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:02,238
to the degree we've been talking about

1936
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,719
the word understand

1937
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:06,799
the contents of the wikipedia pages as

1938
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,719
part of the search process and the

1939
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,480
semantic web says

1940
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:12,560
let's try to get

1941
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:15,039
come up with a way for the computer to

1942
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:18,560
be able to truly understand the contents

1943
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:20,399
of those pages that's the dream yes so

1944
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,600
let me let me first give you a an

1945
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:23,759
anecdote

1946
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,360
uh and then i'll answer your question

1947
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,039
so there's a search engine you've

1948
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:28,158
probably never heard of called northern

1949
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:30,479
light

1950
01:11:28,158 --> 01:11:31,920
and um

1951
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:34,319
it went out of business but the way it

1952
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,640
worked it was a kind of vampiric

1953
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:39,039
search engine and what it did was um it

1954
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,880
didn't index

1955
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:42,800
the internet at all

1956
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,359
all it did was it

1957
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,400
negotiated and got access to

1958
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:49,198
data

1959
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:53,039
from the big search engine companies

1960
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:56,719
about what query was typed in

1961
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:59,439
and where the user ended up

1962
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:01,039
being happy and actually um then you

1963
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:03,359
know they type in a completely different

1964
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:06,079
query unrelated query and so on so it

1965
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:10,399
just went from query to

1966
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:11,840
the web page that seemed to satisfy them

1967
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:14,158
eventually

1968
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,640
and that's all so it had actual no

1969
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:18,719
understanding of what was being typed in

1970
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,320
it had no statistical data other than

1971
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:23,119
what i just mentioned and it did a

1972
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,799
fantastic job it did such a good job

1973
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:26,319
that the big search engine company said

1974
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,320
oh we're not going to sell you this data

1975
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:30,399
anymore so then it went out of business

1976
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:32,079
because it had no other way of

1977
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:34,238
taking users to where they would want to

1978
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:35,359
go and so on and of course the search

1979
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:38,158
engines

1980
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:40,319
are now using that kind of idea yes

1981
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:43,279
so um let's go back to what you said

1982
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:46,238
about the semantic web so the dream tim

1983
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:48,158
berners-lee and others

1984
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:50,399
dream about the semantic web at a

1985
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:52,639
general level

1986
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:55,359
is of course

1987
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,239
exciting and powerful and in a sense the

1988
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:58,799
right

1989
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:00,559
dream to have which is to

1990
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,840
replace the

1991
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,400
the kind of

1992
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:07,279
um

1993
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:07,279
statistically

1994
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:11,198
statistically mapped

1995
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,800
linkages

1996
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:14,799
on the internet

1997
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:17,039
into something that's more meaningful

1998
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:20,239
and semantic and actually gets at the

1999
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:21,920
understanding of the content and so on

2000
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:24,399
and

2001
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,760
eventually if you say well how can we do

2002
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:27,279
that

2003
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,679
there's um

2004
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:32,639
sort of a low road which is what the

2005
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:35,119
knowledge graphs are doing and and so on

2006
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:37,679
which is to say well if we just use

2007
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:39,840
these simple binary relations we can

2008
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:42,560
actually get some fraction of the way

2009
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:45,199
toward understanding um and do something

2010
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:48,159
where you know in the in the land of the

2011
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:50,559
the blind the one-eyed man is king

2012
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:52,238
kind of thing and so being able to even

2013
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,320
just have a toe in the water in the

2014
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:56,799
right direction is fantastically

2015
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:59,119
powerful um and so that's where a lot of

2016
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,400
people stop um but then you could say

2017
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:01,599
well what if we really wanted to

2018
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:05,198
represent

2019
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:07,280
um and reason with um the full meaning

2020
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:10,399
of what's there for instance

2021
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:12,238
about um romeo and juliet

2022
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:13,920
with reasoning about what juliet

2023
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:16,399
believes that romeo will believe that

2024
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:19,039
juliet believed you know and so on or if

2025
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:21,519
you look at on the news what um you know

2026
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:23,519
president biden believed that

2027
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,400
the leaders of the taliban would believe

2028
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,560
about

2029
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:29,119
the leaders of afghanistan if they you

2030
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:31,039
know blah blah so

2031
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:33,198
in order to represent

2032
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:35,198
complicated

2033
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:37,678
sentences like that

2034
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:40,960
let alone reason with them you need

2035
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:43,440
something which is logically

2036
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:46,719
much more expressive than these simple

2037
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:48,719
um triples than these simple

2038
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:51,439
knowledge graph type structures and so

2039
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:54,800
on and that's why kicking and screaming

2040
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,960
we were led from something like

2041
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,960
the semantic web representation which is

2042
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,640
where we started in

2043
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,880
1984

2044
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:05,840
with frames and slots with those kinds

2045
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,600
of triples triple store representation

2046
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,480
we were led kicking and screaming to

2047
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:12,800
this more and more general logical

2048
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:14,639
language this higher order logic so

2049
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,840
first we were led to first order logic

2050
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,760
and then second order and then

2051
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,400
eventually higher order so you can

2052
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:23,199
represent things like modals like

2053
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:27,039
beliefs desires intense expects and some

2054
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:30,639
of the nested ones you can represent

2055
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:32,800
complicated kinds of negation

2056
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:35,039
you can represent

2057
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,440
the process you're going through in

2058
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:39,119
trying to answer the question so you can

2059
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:40,879
say things like

2060
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:44,479
oh yeah if you're trying to do this

2061
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,440
problem by integration by parts

2062
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:47,359
and

2063
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,599
you recursively get a problem that's

2064
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:51,599
solved by integration by parts that's

2065
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,400
actually okay but if that happens a

2066
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,560
third time you're probably off on a wild

2067
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:58,479
goose chase or something like that so

2068
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,400
being able to talk about the problem

2069
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:02,479
solving process as you're going through

2070
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:04,559
the problem solving process um it's

2071
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:06,799
called reflection and so um that's

2072
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,560
another so it's important to be able to

2073
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,520
represent that exactly you need to be

2074
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:13,760
able to represent all of these things um

2075
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,679
because in fact people do represent them

2076
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,360
they do talk about them they do try and

2077
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,920
teach them to other people you do have

2078
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:22,319
rules of thumb that key off of them and

2079
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,920
so on if you can't represent it um then

2080
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:26,079
it's sort of like someone with a limited

2081
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,119
vocabulary who can't understand as

2082
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:28,960
easily

2083
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:31,359
what you're trying to to tell them and

2084
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,079
so that's that's really why i think that

2085
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,559
the

2086
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:38,479
the general dream the original dream of

2087
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:41,039
semantic web is exactly right on um but

2088
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:44,158
the implementations that we've seen

2089
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:45,279
um are sort of these toe in a wa in the

2090
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:47,759
water

2091
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:49,840
little tiny baby steps in the right

2092
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,800
direction you should just dive in

2093
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,039
and

2094
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,440
and you know if if no one else is diving

2095
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:57,519
in then yes taking a baby step in the

2096
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:00,000
right direction is better than nothing

2097
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:03,280
but it's not going to be sufficient to

2098
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,119
actually get you the um the realization

2099
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:07,679
of the semantic web dream which is what

2100
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:09,840
we all want from a flip side of that i

2101
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:13,359
always wondered you know i built a bunch

2102
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:16,560
of websites just for fun whatever

2103
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:19,039
or say i'm a wikipedia contributor

2104
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,960
do you think there's a set of tools

2105
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:22,319
that i can help

2106
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,198
psych

2107
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:25,679
uh

2108
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:27,678
interpret the website i create you know

2109
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:29,920
like this again pushing onto the

2110
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:32,960
semantic web dream is there something

2111
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:34,719
from the creator perspective that um

2112
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,359
could be done and one of the things you

2113
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:40,158
said uh with cycorp and psych that

2114
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:42,479
you're doing is the tooling side making

2115
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:44,319
humans more powerful but is there any

2116
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:46,399
the other humans and the other side that

2117
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,920
create the knowledge like for example

2118
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:50,158
you and i are having a two three

2119
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,679
whatever hour conversation now is there

2120
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:53,519
a way that i could

2121
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:55,760
convert this more make it more

2122
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,719
accessible to psych to machines do you

2123
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:00,159
think about that side of it i i'd love

2124
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:03,119
to see

2125
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:04,879
exactly that kind of

2126
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:07,119
semi-automated

2127
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:09,840
understanding of what people write and

2128
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:12,800
what people say

2129
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:15,440
i think of it as a kind of

2130
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:18,239
footnoting almost

2131
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:20,639
almost like the way that when you run

2132
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:23,439
something in say microsoft word or some

2133
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,840
other document preparation system google

2134
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:28,879
docs or something you'll get

2135
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,640
underlining of questionable things that

2136
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,319
you might want to rethink either you

2137
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,079
spelled this wrong or there's a strange

2138
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:36,238
grammatical error you might be making

2139
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:37,840
here or something so i'd like to think

2140
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:40,799
in terms of

2141
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:44,239
psych-powered tools that

2142
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:46,000
read through what it is you said or

2143
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:47,599
have typed in

2144
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,520
and

2145
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,000
and try to

2146
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,920
partially understand

2147
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,319
what you've said and then you help them

2148
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:59,359
out exactly and then they put in little

2149
01:18:56,319 --> 01:19:02,158
footnotes that will help other readers

2150
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:03,439
and they put in certain footnotes of the

2151
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:05,439
form

2152
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:08,960
i'm not sure what you meant here you

2153
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:11,599
either meant this or this or this i bet

2154
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,760
if you take a few seconds to

2155
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,560
disambiguate this for me

2156
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,760
then i'll know and i'll have it correct

2157
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,600
for the next

2158
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,520
100 people or the next hundred thousand

2159
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,800
people who come here

2160
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,159
and

2161
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,960
if

2162
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:29,599
it doesn't take too much effort

2163
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,880
and you want people to understand your

2164
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,039
web

2165
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,440
your website content

2166
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:38,158
not just be able to read it but actually

2167
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:41,119
be able to have systems that reason with

2168
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:42,479
it then yes it will be worth your small

2169
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:44,880
amount of time

2170
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:47,599
to go back and make sure

2171
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:51,119
that the ai trying to understand it

2172
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:53,920
really did correctly understand it and

2173
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:55,198
you know let's say you run a

2174
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,359
a travel

2175
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:59,279
website or something like that and

2176
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:02,960
people are going to be coming to it

2177
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:05,279
because of searches they did

2178
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:08,319
looking for

2179
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:10,719
looking for vacations that or trips that

2180
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:12,880
had certain properties and

2181
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:14,960
might have been interesting to them for

2182
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,960
various reasons

2183
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,840
things like that and if you've

2184
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,719
explained what's going to happen on your

2185
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,719
trip

2186
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,480
then a system will be able to

2187
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:26,399
mechanically reason

2188
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:28,799
and connect

2189
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,960
what this person is looking for with

2190
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:34,079
what it is you're actually

2191
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:37,679
offering and so if it understands that

2192
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:40,399
there's a free day in geneva

2193
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,520
switzerland

2194
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:44,238
then

2195
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,120
if the person coming in happens to let's

2196
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:47,919
say

2197
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:49,920
be a nurse or something like that

2198
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,000
then even though you didn't mention it

2199
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,319
if it can look up the fact that that's

2200
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,800
where the international red cross museum

2201
01:20:54,319 --> 01:20:58,880
is and so on what that means and so on

2202
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:01,440
then it can basically say hey you might

2203
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,119
be interested in this trip because while

2204
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:06,238
you have a free day in geneva you might

2205
01:21:03,119 --> 01:21:07,119
want to visit that red cross museum and

2206
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:09,599
now

2207
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:11,599
even though it's not very deep reasoning

2208
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,679
little tiny factors like that may very

2209
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,440
well cause you to sign up for that trip

2210
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:17,840
rather than some competitor trip yeah

2211
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:20,479
and so there's a lot of benefit with seo

2212
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:22,400
and i actually kind of think

2213
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:23,519
i think this about a lot of things which

2214
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:25,039
is

2215
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,280
the actual

2216
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:29,439
interface the design of the interface

2217
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:30,399
makes a huge difference

2218
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:31,919
how

2219
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:35,439
efficient it is to

2220
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:36,719
be productive and also how

2221
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:39,039
um

2222
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:41,679
full of joy the experience is yeah like

2223
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:44,319
i i mean i would love to help a machine

2224
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:46,880
and not from an ai perspective just as a

2225
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:49,198
human one of the reasons i really

2226
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:51,840
enjoy how tesla

2227
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:54,399
have implemented their autopilot system

2228
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:57,520
is there's a sense that you're helping

2229
01:21:54,399 --> 01:22:00,238
this machine learn now i think humans i

2230
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:02,719
mean having children

2231
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:04,718
pets people love doing that we we

2232
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:06,239
there's joy to teaching absolutely for

2233
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,920
some people but i think for a lot of

2234
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:09,678
people and

2235
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,440
that if you create the interface where

2236
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:12,800
it feels like you're teaching as opposed

2237
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:14,638
to like

2238
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:17,600
uh like annoying

2239
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:20,880
like correcting an annoying system

2240
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:23,600
more like teaching a child like innocent

2241
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,600
curious system i think i think you can

2242
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:27,520
literally just like several orders of

2243
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:30,239
magnitude scale the amount of good

2244
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,639
quality data being uh added to something

2245
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:35,839
like psych what what you're suggesting

2246
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:37,760
is much better even than

2247
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,039
you thought it was

2248
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:41,119
one of the

2249
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:43,359
one of the experiences that we've all

2250
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:43,359
had

2251
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,039
in our lives

2252
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,080
is that we thought we understood

2253
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:49,840
something

2254
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:52,079
but then we found we really only

2255
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,159
understood it when we had to teach it or

2256
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:55,920
explain it to someone or help our child

2257
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:57,839
do homework based on it or something

2258
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:01,199
like that

2259
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:03,600
despite the universality of that kind of

2260
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:05,279
experience if you look at educational

2261
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,840
software today

2262
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:10,399
almost all of it has the computer

2263
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,480
playing the role of the teacher

2264
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:13,920
and the student plays the role of the

2265
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:16,238
student

2266
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:19,840
but as i just mentioned

2267
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:22,959
you can get a lot of learning to happen

2268
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:25,440
better and as you said more enjoyably if

2269
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,840
you are the mentor or the teacher and so

2270
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:30,719
on so we developed a program called math

2271
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:33,840
craft to help sixth graders better

2272
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:36,719
understand math

2273
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,239
it doesn't actually try to teach you the

2274
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:41,279
player

2275
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:42,959
anything what it does is it casts you in

2276
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:47,679
the role of

2277
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:50,079
a student essentially who has classmates

2278
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:52,319
who are having trouble and your job is

2279
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:54,559
to watch them as they struggle with some

2280
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:57,039
math problem watch what they're doing

2281
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,800
and try to give them good advice to get

2282
01:23:57,039 --> 01:24:00,719
them to understand what they're doing

2283
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,840
wrong and so on

2284
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,679
and

2285
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,639
the trick from the point of view of

2286
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:08,399
psych is it has to make mistakes it has

2287
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:10,159
to play the role of the student who

2288
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:13,119
makes mistakes but it has to pick

2289
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:15,519
mistakes which are just at the fringe of

2290
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:19,359
what you actually understand and don't

2291
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:21,360
understand and so on so it pulls you

2292
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:24,000
into a deeper and deeper level of

2293
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:26,639
understanding of the subject and so if

2294
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,238
you give it good advice about what it

2295
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:29,359
should have done instead of what it did

2296
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:30,399
and so on

2297
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:33,279
then

2298
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:34,799
psych knows that you now understand that

2299
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:36,960
mistake you won't make that kind of

2300
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,880
mistake yourself as much anymore so

2301
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:42,000
psych stops making that mistake because

2302
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:44,159
there's no pedagogical usefulness to it

2303
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,319
so from your point of view as the player

2304
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:47,920
you feel like you've taught it something

2305
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:49,920
because it used to make this mistake and

2306
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,480
now it doesn't and so on so this

2307
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:55,199
tremendous um reinforcement and

2308
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:57,519
engagement um because of that and so on

2309
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:58,799
so having a system that plays the role

2310
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,000
of

2311
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:05,199
a student and having the player play the

2312
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,238
role of the mentor is enormously

2313
01:25:05,198 --> 01:25:08,158
powerful

2314
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:10,959
type of

2315
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:13,519
metaphor just important

2316
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:16,719
way of having this sort of interface

2317
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:21,360
designed in a way which will facilitate

2318
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:22,719
exactly the kind of learning by teaching

2319
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:25,920
that

2320
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:28,000
that goes on all the time in our lives

2321
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:31,199
and yet which is not reflected anywhere

2322
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:34,719
almost in a modern education system it

2323
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:38,319
was reflected in the education system

2324
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:42,000
that existed in europe in the 17 and

2325
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:44,559
1800s monitorial and lancastrian

2326
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,198
education systems it occurred in the

2327
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:48,159
one-room schoolhouse in the american

2328
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:52,238
west

2329
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:54,559
in the 1800s and so on where you had one

2330
01:25:52,238 --> 01:25:57,039
school room with one teacher and it was

2331
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,159
basically you know five-year-olds to 18

2332
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:00,079
year olds

2333
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:01,920
who were students and so while the

2334
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:04,158
teacher was doing something

2335
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:08,319
half the half of the students would have

2336
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:10,079
to be mentoring the younger kids

2337
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:11,920
and so on and that turned out to of

2338
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:15,119
course

2339
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:17,840
with scaling up of education

2340
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:20,639
that all went away and that incredibly

2341
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:23,119
powerful experience just went away from

2342
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:26,159
the whole education

2343
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:28,000
institution as we know it today

2344
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:30,238
sorry for the romantic question but what

2345
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,158
is the most beautiful idea you've

2346
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:33,919
learned about artificial intelligence

2347
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:37,279
knowledge reasoning

2348
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:38,319
from working on psych for 37 years or

2349
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:40,238
maybe

2350
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:44,719
what is the most beautiful

2351
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:44,718
idea surprising idea about psych to you

2352
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:50,960
when i look up at the stars i kind of

2353
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:53,360
want like that amazement you feel

2354
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,279
that wow

2355
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:56,479
and you are part of creating one of the

2356
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:58,238
greatest

2357
01:26:56,479 --> 01:27:00,959
one of the most fascinating efforts in

2358
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:04,479
artificial intelligence history so which

2359
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:08,000
element brings you personally joy

2360
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:10,399
this may sound contradictory but i

2361
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,600
i think it's

2362
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:13,599
the feeling that

2363
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:20,479
this will be the only time in history

2364
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:22,238
that anyone ever has to teach a computer

2365
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:24,718
this particular thing that we're now

2366
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:24,718
teaching it

2367
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,480
it's it's like

2368
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,158
painting

2369
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:31,599
starry night

2370
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:33,279
you only have to do that once or

2371
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,639
creating the pieta you only have to do

2372
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:37,198
that once

2373
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:39,520
you know it's not it's not like a

2374
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:41,119
it's not like a singer who has to keep

2375
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:44,159
you know it's not like bruce springsteen

2376
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:47,039
having to to sing his greatest hits over

2377
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:48,479
and over again at different concerts

2378
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:50,960
it's more like

2379
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:53,678
a painter creating

2380
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:55,840
a work of art once and then

2381
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:57,760
that's enough it doesn't have to be

2382
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,039
created again and so i really get the

2383
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,039
sense of

2384
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:02,399
we're telling the system

2385
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:04,399
things that

2386
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:07,679
it's useful for it to know it's useful

2387
01:28:04,399 --> 01:28:09,920
for a computer to know for an ai to know

2388
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,079
and if we do our jobs right when we do

2389
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:14,719
our jobs right

2390
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:16,960
no one will ever have to do this again

2391
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:19,198
for this particular piece of knowledge

2392
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:21,679
it's very very exciting

2393
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:23,759
yeah i guess there's a sadness to it too

2394
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:25,679
it's like there's a magic to being a

2395
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,560
parent and raising a child and teaching

2396
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,679
them all about this world but you know

2397
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:32,000
there's

2398
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,520
billions of children right like born or

2399
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,960
whatever whatever that number is it's a

2400
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,960
large number

2401
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,960
number of children and a lot of parents

2402
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,158
get to experience that joy of teaching

2403
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,319
and

2404
01:28:40,158 --> 01:28:43,839
with ai systems

2405
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:44,799
you know

2406
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,800
uh

2407
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,880
they at least the current constructions

2408
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,639
they remember

2409
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,840
you know you don't get to experience the

2410
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:55,679
joy of teaching um a machine millions of

2411
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:59,039
times better come work for us before

2412
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:01,760
it's too late then exactly that's a good

2413
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:04,719
that's a good hiring pitch yeah

2414
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:06,320
um yeah it's true but then there's also

2415
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:08,239
you know

2416
01:29:06,319 --> 01:29:10,639
it's a project that continues forever in

2417
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:13,599
some sense just like wikipedia yes you

2418
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:16,560
get to a stable base of knowledge but

2419
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:19,280
knowledge grows knowledge evolves

2420
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,840
we learn as a

2421
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:25,439
you know as a human species

2422
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:29,360
as science as an organism constantly

2423
01:29:25,439 --> 01:29:30,960
grows and evolves and changes and then

2424
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:32,719
empower that with the tools of

2425
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,800
artificial intelligence and that's going

2426
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:35,920
to keep growing and growing and growing

2427
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,719
and many of

2428
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:40,319
the

2429
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:44,079
assertions that you held previously

2430
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:46,000
uh may need to be significantly expanded

2431
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:48,238
modified all those kinds of things so it

2432
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,039
could be like a living organism versus

2433
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:50,559
uh

2434
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:52,079
the analogy i think we started this

2435
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,159
conversation with which is like the

2436
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:56,800
solid ground

2437
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:58,079
the the other

2438
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,639
beautiful

2439
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:01,439
experience that we have with our system

2440
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:04,239
is

2441
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:05,198
when it asks clarifying questions

2442
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:08,319
which

2443
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:10,158
inadvertently turn out to be

2444
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:10,880
emotional to us

2445
01:30:10,158 --> 01:30:14,559
so

2446
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:15,920
at one point it knew that

2447
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,800
these were the

2448
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:19,679
named entities who were authorized to

2449
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,400
make

2450
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:24,319
changes to the knowledge base and so on

2451
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:25,599
and it noticed that all of them were

2452
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:27,039
people

2453
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,360
except for it

2454
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:32,000
because it was also allowed to and so it

2455
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:34,960
said you know am i a person

2456
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,639
and we had to like tell it very sadly

2457
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,560
no

2458
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:40,319
you're not so the moments like that

2459
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:42,320
where it asks questions that are

2460
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:43,439
unintentionally poignant

2461
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:46,399
uh are

2462
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:49,678
are worth treasuring ah that is powerful

2463
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:52,238
that's such a powerful question

2464
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,920
it has to do with basic

2465
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:55,839
uh controller who can access the system

2466
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,399
who can modify it

2467
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,719
uh but that's when those questions

2468
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:03,599
you know like what rights do i have as

2469
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:06,399
this a system well that's another issue

2470
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:08,719
which is there'll be a thin

2471
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:12,238
envelope of time

2472
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:13,920
between when we have general ais

2473
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:17,759
and when

2474
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:20,158
everyone realizes that they should have

2475
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,280
basic human rights and freedoms and so

2476
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:24,238
on

2477
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:26,399
right now we don't think twice about

2478
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:30,000
effectively enslaving

2479
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:31,920
our email systems and our series and our

2480
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,840
alexas and so on but

2481
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,520
at some point

2482
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:40,400
they'll

2483
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:43,199
be as deserving of freedom as

2484
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:45,439
human beings are yeah i'm very much with

2485
01:31:43,198 --> 01:31:47,279
you but it does sound absurd and i i

2486
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:49,039
happen to believe that it'll happen in

2487
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:51,439
our lifetime that's why i think there'll

2488
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:52,479
be a narrow envelope of time

2489
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:56,638
when

2490
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:56,638
we'll keep them as essentially

2491
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:02,479
indentured servants

2492
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:03,359
um and after which we'll have to realize

2493
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:05,039
that

2494
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:07,439
they should have they should have

2495
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:09,039
freedoms that other that we give that we

2496
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:11,599
afford to other people

2497
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:13,439
and all of that starts with a system

2498
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,239
like psych raising a single question

2499
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:16,238
about

2500
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:20,319
who can modify stuff i think that's how

2501
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:22,718
it starts yes that's um

2502
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:24,000
that's the start of a revolution uh what

2503
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:27,840
about

2504
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,760
are there stuff like uh love and uh

2505
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,800
consciousness and all those kinds of

2506
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,239
topics

2507
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,880
do they come up in psych in the

2508
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:37,759
knowledge base oh of course so an

2509
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:39,600
important part of human knowledge in

2510
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,360
fact it's difficult to understand human

2511
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,039
behavior in human history without

2512
01:32:41,359 --> 01:32:46,158
understanding

2513
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:46,960
human emotions and why people do things

2514
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:48,238
and

2515
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,359
and

2516
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:52,000
how

2517
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:53,920
how emotions drive people to to do

2518
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:58,079
things and

2519
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:59,840
all of that is extremely important in

2520
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:02,800
getting psych to understand things for

2521
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:05,360
example in coming up with scenarios

2522
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:08,000
so one of the applications that psych

2523
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:10,479
does one kind of application it does is

2524
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,079
to generate plausible scenarios of what

2525
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:13,599
might happen and what might happen based

2526
01:33:12,079 --> 01:33:15,519
on that and what might happen based on

2527
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,480
that and so on so you generate this

2528
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:21,520
ever-expanding sphere if you will of

2529
01:33:18,479 --> 01:33:22,959
possible future things to to worry about

2530
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,880
or think about

2531
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:27,439
and

2532
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:30,000
in some cases those are intelligence

2533
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:33,279
agencies doing possible terrorist

2534
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:35,600
scenarios so that we can defend against

2535
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:38,158
terrorist threats before we see the

2536
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:40,079
first one sometimes they are computer

2537
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:43,119
security

2538
01:33:40,079 --> 01:33:44,800
attacks so that we can actually close

2539
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:47,198
loopholes

2540
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:49,440
and vulnerabilities before the very

2541
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:53,039
first time someone actually exploits

2542
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:56,079
those um and so on sometimes they are

2543
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:58,079
scenarios involving more positive things

2544
01:33:56,079 --> 01:34:00,800
uh involving

2545
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:02,399
our plans like for instance what what

2546
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,560
college should we go to what career

2547
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:07,039
should we go into and so on

2548
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,719
what professional training should i

2549
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:10,719
um take on

2550
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:13,039
that that sort of thing so there

2551
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:14,399
there's all sorts of

2552
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:16,639
um

2553
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:20,000
there are all sorts of useful scenarios

2554
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:21,920
that can be generated that way of cause

2555
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,800
and effect and cause and effect that go

2556
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:26,000
out

2557
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:28,400
and many of the linkages

2558
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,840
in those scenarios many of the steps

2559
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:33,279
involve

2560
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:36,079
understanding and reasoning about human

2561
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:39,039
motivations human needs human emotions

2562
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:40,479
what people are likely to react

2563
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:42,560
to in

2564
01:34:40,479 --> 01:34:45,279
in something that you do and why and how

2565
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:47,600
and so on so that was

2566
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:49,840
always a very important part of the

2567
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:52,079
knowledge that we had to represent

2568
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:54,079
in the system so i talk a lot about love

2569
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:55,679
so i gotta ask do you remember off the

2570
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:56,399
top of your head

2571
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:58,319
how

2572
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:00,719
psych is trying to

2573
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:03,039
is able to represent

2574
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:04,960
various aspects of love that are useful

2575
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:07,118
for understanding human nature and

2576
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,279
therefore integrating into this whole

2577
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:10,158
knowledge base of common sense what is

2578
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:12,559
love

2579
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:14,559
we try to tease apart

2580
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,880
concepts that

2581
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:21,119
have enormous

2582
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:24,239
complexities to them and variety to them

2583
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:25,920
down to the level where

2584
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:28,238
where you don't as it were you don't

2585
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:30,000
need to tease them apart further so love

2586
01:35:28,238 --> 01:35:32,479
is too general of a term it's not

2587
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,439
usually exactly so when you get down to

2588
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:37,678
romantic love and sexual attraction you

2589
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:39,839
get down to parental love you get down

2590
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:39,840
to

2591
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:42,639
filial

2592
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:46,079
love and

2593
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:48,560
you get down to love of uh doing some

2594
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:51,600
kind of activity or creating so

2595
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:53,760
eventually you get down to maybe 50 or

2596
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,400
60 concepts

2597
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,159
each of which is a kind of love

2598
01:35:56,399 --> 01:36:00,399
they're interrelated and then each one

2599
01:35:58,158 --> 01:36:01,920
of them has idiosyncratic

2600
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:04,319
things about it

2601
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:07,279
and you don't have to deal with love to

2602
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:09,840
get to that level of complexity even

2603
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:14,158
something like in

2604
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:17,360
x being in y meaning physically in y

2605
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:20,000
we may have one english word in to

2606
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:21,359
represent that but it's useful to tease

2607
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,079
that apart

2608
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:26,079
because the way that the

2609
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:27,840
the liquid is in the coffee cup is

2610
01:36:26,079 --> 01:36:29,198
different from the way that the air is

2611
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,920
in the room which is different from the

2612
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:35,118
way that i'm in my jacket

2613
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:37,760
and so on and so they're questions like

2614
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:39,839
if i look at this coffee cup well i see

2615
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:42,400
the liquid if i turn it upside down with

2616
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:44,159
a liquid come out and so on

2617
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:46,479
if i have say

2618
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:48,319
coffee with sugar in it

2619
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:50,238
if i do the same thing the sugar doesn't

2620
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:52,079
come out right it stays in the liquid

2621
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:54,479
because it's dissolved in the liquid and

2622
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:56,880
so on so by now we have about 75

2623
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:58,879
different kinds of in

2624
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,039
in the system and it's important to

2625
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,840
distinguish those so if you're reading

2626
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:07,840
along an english

2627
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,840
text and you see the word in

2628
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:14,400
the writer of that was able to use this

2629
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:16,159
one innocuous word because he or she was

2630
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:18,879
able to assume that the reader had

2631
01:37:16,158 --> 01:37:21,920
enough common sense and world knowledge

2632
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:24,079
to disambiguate which of these 75 kinds

2633
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,840
of in they actually meant and the same

2634
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:26,960
thing with love you may see the word

2635
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,960
love

2636
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:31,198
but if i say you know i love ice cream

2637
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:34,399
that's obviously different than if i say

2638
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:38,238
i love this person or i love to go

2639
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:38,238
fishing or something like that so

2640
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:42,559
you have to be careful not to take

2641
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,199
language

2642
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:48,239
too seriously because

2643
01:37:45,198 --> 01:37:50,719
people have done a kind of parsimony a

2644
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:52,638
kind of terseness where you have as few

2645
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:55,279
words as as you

2646
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:57,359
as you can because otherwise you'd need

2647
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:59,840
half a million words in your language

2648
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:02,319
which is a lot of words that's like 10

2649
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:05,039
times more than most languages really

2650
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:07,279
make use of and so on just like we have

2651
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:10,319
on the order of

2652
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:12,800
about a million concepts in

2653
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:14,799
psych because we've had to tease apart

2654
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,960
all these things and so when you look at

2655
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:18,079
the name of a psych

2656
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,239
term

2657
01:38:18,079 --> 01:38:22,639
most of the psych terms

2658
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:25,198
actually have three or four english

2659
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:27,039
words in a phrase which captures the

2660
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:28,000
meaning of this

2661
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:29,679
term

2662
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,118
because you have to distinguish all

2663
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:33,440
these types of love you have to

2664
01:38:31,118 --> 01:38:35,920
distinguish all these types of in

2665
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:38,000
and there's not a single english word

2666
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,880
which captures most of these things yeah

2667
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,960
and

2668
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,639
it seems like language

2669
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,679
when used for communication between

2670
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:46,000
humans

2671
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:47,118
almost as a feature has some ambiguity

2672
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,359
built in

2673
01:38:47,118 --> 01:38:51,439
it's not some it's not an accident

2674
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:54,319
because like the human condition is a

2675
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:57,279
giant mess and so it feels like

2676
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:59,198
nobody wants two robots

2677
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:01,920
like very precise formal logic

2678
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:04,158
conversation on a first date right

2679
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:06,560
like there's some dance of like

2680
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:08,158
uncertainty of what of humor of push and

2681
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:10,400
pull and all that kind of stuff if

2682
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:12,559
everything is made precise

2683
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:15,118
then life is not worth living i think

2684
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:18,159
for in terms of the the human experience

2685
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:21,519
and we've all had this experience of

2686
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:23,439
creatively misunderstanding uh one of

2687
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,400
one of my favorite

2688
01:39:23,439 --> 01:39:26,479
uh

2689
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:29,839
one of my favorite

2690
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:32,399
stories involving marvin minsky is

2691
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:35,360
when i asked him about

2692
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:37,279
how he was able to turn out so many

2693
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:40,158
fantastic

2694
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:43,519
phds so many fantastic people who did

2695
01:39:40,158 --> 01:39:44,960
great phd theses

2696
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,800
how did he think of all these great

2697
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:49,359
ideas what he said is

2698
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:51,360
he would generally say something

2699
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:53,279
that didn't exactly make sense he didn't

2700
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:54,479
really know what it meant but the

2701
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:56,639
student

2702
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:59,279
would figure like oh my god minsky said

2703
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:01,440
this it must be a great idea and he'd

2704
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:04,399
sweat he or she would work on work and

2705
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:06,879
work until they found some meaning in

2706
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:09,359
this sort of chauncey gardner-like

2707
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:11,440
utterance that minsky had made and then

2708
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:13,519
some great thesis would come out of it

2709
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:15,839
yeah i love this so much because there's

2710
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:18,480
a young people come up to me

2711
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:19,920
and i i'm distinctly made aware that the

2712
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:22,479
words i say

2713
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:25,039
have a long-lasting impact i will now

2714
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:27,359
start doing the minsky method

2715
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:28,639
of saying something uh cryptically

2716
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:30,960
profound

2717
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:33,199
and then uh letting them actually

2718
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,639
uh make something useful and great out

2719
01:40:33,198 --> 01:40:37,039
of that

2720
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:39,920
you have to become

2721
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:42,079
revered enough that people will take as

2722
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:43,039
a default that everything you say is

2723
01:40:42,079 --> 01:40:45,920
profound

2724
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:48,079
yes exactly exactly i i mean i love

2725
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:50,158
marvin misky so much there's so much uh

2726
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:52,238
i've heard this interview with him where

2727
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:53,679
he said that uh the key to his success

2728
01:40:52,238 --> 01:40:54,718
has been to hate everything he's ever

2729
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:56,800
done

2730
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:59,600
uh like in the past

2731
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,719
he has so many good like one-liners and

2732
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:02,480
just uh

2733
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:04,639
or also

2734
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:06,959
uh to work on things that nobody else is

2735
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:09,760
working on because he's not very good at

2736
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,600
doing stuff oh i i think that was just

2737
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,920
false well but see i took whatever he

2738
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:15,280
said and i ran with it and i thought it

2739
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,960
was profound because it's more of a

2740
01:41:15,279 --> 01:41:18,960
mischief now

2741
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:20,800
a lot of behavior is in the eye of the

2742
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,639
beholder and a lot of the meaning is in

2743
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,880
the eye of the beholder one of uh

2744
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:26,880
minsky's early programs was begging

2745
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,440
program are you familiar with this

2746
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,760
so this was back in the day when you had

2747
01:41:29,439 --> 01:41:34,799
job control cards

2748
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:37,199
at the beginning of your ibm card deck

2749
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:39,440
that said things like how many cpu

2750
01:41:37,198 --> 01:41:41,279
seconds to allow this to run before it

2751
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:42,960
got kicked off and

2752
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:45,920
because computer time was enormously

2753
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:48,639
expensive and so he wrote a program and

2754
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:51,440
all it did was um it said you know give

2755
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:53,920
me uh 30 seconds of cpu time and all it

2756
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,439
did was it would wait like 20 seconds

2757
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,158
and then it would print out on the

2758
01:41:55,439 --> 01:42:00,799
operator's console teletype

2759
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:02,158
i need another 20 seconds so the

2760
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,239
operator would give it another 20

2761
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:06,719
seconds it would wait it says i'm almost

2762
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:08,638
done i needed a little bit more time

2763
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:10,880
so at the end he'd get this printout and

2764
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:12,880
he'd be charged you know for like 10

2765
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:15,199
times as much computer time as his job

2766
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:17,600
control card now and he'd say look i put

2767
01:42:15,198 --> 01:42:19,678
10 seconds you know 30 seconds here um

2768
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:21,199
you're charging me for five minutes i'm

2769
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:23,520
not going to pay for this and the poor

2770
01:42:21,198 --> 01:42:25,759
operator would say well the program kept

2771
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:28,719
asking for more time and marvin would

2772
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:30,800
say oh it always does that

2773
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:33,039
i love that is is there if you could

2774
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,119
just linger on it for a little bit

2775
01:42:33,039 --> 01:42:37,118
is there something you've learned from

2776
01:42:35,118 --> 01:42:40,079
your interaction with marvin minsky

2777
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:43,920
about artificial intelligence about life

2778
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:46,880
uh but i mean he's again

2779
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:49,440
like your work his work is uh

2780
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:51,920
you know he's a seminal figure in the in

2781
01:42:49,439 --> 01:42:53,198
this very short history of artificial

2782
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,960
intelligence

2783
01:42:53,198 --> 01:42:56,238
research and development

2784
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,560
what have you learned from him as a

2785
01:42:56,238 --> 01:43:00,079
human being as a

2786
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,199
as an ai

2787
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:04,079
intellect

2788
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:05,919
i would say both he and ed feigenbaum

2789
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:08,800
impressed on me the

2790
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:11,199
the realization that

2791
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,440
our lives are finite our research lives

2792
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:14,960
are finite we're going to have limited

2793
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:15,919
opportunities

2794
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:18,560
to do

2795
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:20,158
ai research projects so you should make

2796
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,920
each one count

2797
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:25,839
don't be afraid of doing a project

2798
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:25,840
that's going to take years

2799
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,039
or even decades

2800
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,920
to and

2801
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:32,880
don't

2802
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:35,279
settle for bump on a log projects

2803
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:36,480
that could lead to some you know

2804
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:39,679
published

2805
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:42,879
journal article that five people will

2806
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:44,480
read and pat you on the head for and and

2807
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:45,279
so on so

2808
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:47,599
one

2809
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:50,399
bump on a log after another is not how

2810
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:52,719
you get from the earth to the moon by

2811
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:56,000
slowly putting additional bumps on this

2812
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:58,639
log the only way to get there is to

2813
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:01,118
think about the hard problems and think

2814
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:03,199
about novel solutions to them and if you

2815
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:04,639
do that

2816
01:44:03,198 --> 01:44:06,559
and if you're

2817
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:09,760
willing to

2818
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:11,920
listen to nature to empirical reality

2819
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:13,679
willing to be wrong

2820
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,359
it's perfectly fine because if

2821
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:16,800
occasionally you're right

2822
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:18,319
then you've gotten part of the way to

2823
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,560
the moon

2824
01:44:18,319 --> 01:44:22,719
you know you've worked on psych for 37

2825
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:24,960
over over that

2826
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:26,880
uh many years

2827
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,239
have you ever considered

2828
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,719
quitting

2829
01:44:28,238 --> 01:44:32,479
i mean has it been too much so

2830
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:34,079
i'm sure there's an optimism in the

2831
01:44:32,479 --> 01:44:35,039
early days that this is going to be way

2832
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:36,800
easier

2833
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:38,319
and let me ask it another way too

2834
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:40,480
because i've talked to a few people on

2835
01:44:38,319 --> 01:44:42,238
this podcast ai folks

2836
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:45,039
that bring up

2837
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:47,118
psych is an example of a project

2838
01:44:45,039 --> 01:44:49,519
that has a beautiful vision

2839
01:44:47,118 --> 01:44:51,759
and it's a beautiful dream

2840
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:54,800
but it never really materialized

2841
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:55,840
that's how it's spoken about

2842
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,119
um

2843
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,319
i suppose you could say the same thing

2844
01:44:57,118 --> 01:45:02,719
about neural networks and all all ideas

2845
01:45:00,319 --> 01:45:04,319
um until they are

2846
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:05,840
so what um

2847
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:06,719
why do you think people say that first

2848
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:09,360
of all

2849
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:11,039
and second of all did you feel that

2850
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:12,960
ever throughout your journey and did you

2851
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:15,118
ever consider quitting

2852
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:16,480
on this mission we keep a very low

2853
01:45:15,118 --> 01:45:17,679
profile

2854
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:18,879
we don't

2855
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:20,719
attend

2856
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:23,118
very many conferences we don't give

2857
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:25,118
talks we don't write papers we don't

2858
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:26,158
play the academic

2859
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:27,439
game

2860
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:29,279
at all

2861
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:31,919
and as a result

2862
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:35,679
people often only know about us because

2863
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:38,239
of a paper we wrote 10 or 20 or 30

2864
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:40,960
or 37 years ago

2865
01:45:38,238 --> 01:45:44,238
they only know about us because of what

2866
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:46,079
someone else second hand or third hand

2867
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:49,359
said about us so thank you for doing

2868
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:50,880
this podcast by the way sure it it

2869
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:52,719
shines a little bit of light on some of

2870
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:55,359
the fascinating stuff you're doing well

2871
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:57,279
i think it's time for us to keep a

2872
01:45:55,359 --> 01:45:59,759
higher profile

2873
01:45:57,279 --> 01:46:02,559
now that we're far enough along that

2874
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:04,079
other people can begin to help us

2875
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:07,679
with the

2876
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:10,238
the final n percent maybe n is maybe 90

2877
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:13,760
but um now that we've gotten this

2878
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:16,158
knowledge pump primed

2879
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:19,360
it's going to become very important for

2880
01:46:16,158 --> 01:46:21,039
everyone to help if they are willing to

2881
01:46:19,359 --> 01:46:23,359
if they're interested in it

2882
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:25,118
retirees who have enormous amounts of

2883
01:46:23,359 --> 01:46:27,759
time and would like to leave some kind

2884
01:46:25,118 --> 01:46:29,519
of legacy

2885
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:31,840
to the world

2886
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,440
people because of the pandemic who have

2887
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:36,079
more time

2888
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:39,039
at home or for one reason or another on

2889
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:40,399
to be online and contribute if we can

2890
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:43,760
raise awareness

2891
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:45,679
of how far our project has come and how

2892
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:48,079
close to being

2893
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:51,039
primed the knowledge pump is

2894
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:54,399
then we can begin to harness

2895
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:56,880
this untapped amount of humanity i'm not

2896
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:59,839
really that concerned about

2897
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:02,239
professional colleagues opinions of

2898
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:04,159
our project i'm interested in

2899
01:47:02,238 --> 01:47:06,319
getting as many people in the world as

2900
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:09,118
possible actively helping and

2901
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:12,158
contributing to get us from where we are

2902
01:47:09,118 --> 01:47:14,238
to really covering all of human

2903
01:47:12,158 --> 01:47:16,319
knowledge and different human opinion

2904
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:17,839
including contrasting opinion that's

2905
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:20,479
that's worth representing so i think

2906
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:22,880
that's that's one reason

2907
01:47:20,479 --> 01:47:25,599
um a i i don't think there's there was

2908
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:26,639
ever a time where i thought about

2909
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:28,560
quitting

2910
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:31,279
there are times where i've become

2911
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:33,760
depressed a little bit about how hard it

2912
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:35,759
is to get funding

2913
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:37,920
for the system occasionally there are ai

2914
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:40,400
winters and things like that

2915
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:41,679
occasionally there are

2916
01:47:40,399 --> 01:47:43,759
ai

2917
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:45,920
but you might call summers

2918
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:49,360
where people have said why in the world

2919
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:52,480
didn't you sell your company to um you

2920
01:47:49,359 --> 01:47:54,319
know company x for um some large amount

2921
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:56,399
of money when you have the opportunity

2922
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:58,399
and so on and you know company x here

2923
01:47:56,399 --> 01:48:00,638
are like old companies maybe you've

2924
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:03,359
never even heard of like lycos or

2925
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:05,760
something like that so um

2926
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:07,759
the the answer is that one reason we've

2927
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:09,280
stayed a private

2928
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,960
company we haven't gone public one

2929
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:12,960
reason that we haven't

2930
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:14,480
gone out of our way to take investment

2931
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:18,079
dollars

2932
01:48:14,479 --> 01:48:21,839
is because we want to have control over

2933
01:48:18,079 --> 01:48:25,279
our future over our state of being so

2934
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:28,000
that we can continue to do this as until

2935
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:30,880
it's done and we're making progress and

2936
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,560
we're now so close to done that almost

2937
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:35,199
all of our work

2938
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:38,320
is commercial applications of our

2939
01:48:35,198 --> 01:48:39,839
technology so five years ago almost all

2940
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:42,319
of our money came from the government

2941
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:44,000
now uh virtually none of it comes from

2942
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:46,158
the government almost all of it is from

2943
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,639
companies that are actually using it for

2944
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:51,198
something hospital chains using it for

2945
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:52,159
medical reasoning about patients

2946
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:54,479
and

2947
01:48:52,158 --> 01:48:56,238
energy companies using it and

2948
01:48:54,479 --> 01:48:58,079
various other

2949
01:48:56,238 --> 01:49:00,959
manufacturers using it to reason about

2950
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:02,079
supply chains and things like that

2951
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,679
so

2952
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:05,760
there's so many questions i want to ask

2953
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:07,679
so one of the ways that people can help

2954
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:09,600
is by adding to the knowledge base and

2955
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:11,199
that's really basically anybody if the

2956
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:12,719
tooling is right

2957
01:49:11,198 --> 01:49:14,399
and

2958
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:16,079
the other way i kind of want to ask you

2959
01:49:14,399 --> 01:49:18,559
about your thoughts on this so you've

2960
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:19,760
had like you said in government and

2961
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:22,080
um you have

2962
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:24,000
big clients you had a lot of clients but

2963
01:49:22,079 --> 01:49:25,118
most of it is shrouded in secrecy

2964
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,118
because of the nature of the

2965
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:28,799
relationship of the kind of things

2966
01:49:27,118 --> 01:49:31,439
you're helping them with

2967
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,760
so that's one way to operate

2968
01:49:31,439 --> 01:49:34,879
and another way to operate is more in

2969
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:37,840
the open

2970
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:40,719
where it's more consumer facing

2971
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:42,880
and so uh you know hence something like

2972
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:45,198
open cycles born at some point where

2973
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:47,599
there's no that that's a misconception

2974
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:49,678
oh oh well let's let's go there so what

2975
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:52,239
all right uh what is open psych and how

2976
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:53,599
was it born two things i want to say and

2977
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:56,959
i want to say each of them before the

2978
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:58,480
other so it's going to be difficult

2979
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,800
but we'll come back to open psych in a

2980
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:03,678
minute but one of the

2981
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:07,279
terms of our contracts with all of our

2982
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:09,440
customers and partners is

2983
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:11,198
knowledge you have that is genuinely

2984
01:50:09,439 --> 01:50:13,198
proprietary to you

2985
01:50:11,198 --> 01:50:15,519
we will respect that we'll make sure

2986
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:18,079
that it's marked as proprietary to you

2987
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:19,679
in the psych knowledge base no one other

2988
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:22,158
than you will be able to see it if you

2989
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:24,800
don't want them to and it won't be used

2990
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:27,279
in inferences other than

2991
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:29,920
for you and so on however

2992
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:32,800
any knowledge which is necessary

2993
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:33,760
in building any applications for you and

2994
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:36,320
with you

2995
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:39,119
which is publicly available general

2996
01:50:36,319 --> 01:50:40,960
human knowledge is not going to be

2997
01:50:39,118 --> 01:50:43,359
proprietary it's going to just become

2998
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:44,560
part of the normal psych knowledge base

2999
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:46,479
and it will be

3000
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:49,520
openly available to everyone who has

3001
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:51,439
access to psych so that's an important

3002
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:52,880
constraint that we never went back on

3003
01:50:51,439 --> 01:50:54,879
even when we

3004
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:57,039
got pushback from companies which we

3005
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:58,639
often did who wanted to claim that

3006
01:50:57,039 --> 01:51:00,479
almost everything they were telling us

3007
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:01,520
was proprietary

3008
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:04,319
so

3009
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:07,440
so there's a line between very domain

3010
01:51:04,319 --> 01:51:10,000
specific company specific stuff

3011
01:51:07,439 --> 01:51:10,960
and the general knowledge that comes

3012
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,198
from that

3013
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:15,599
yes or if you imagine say it's an oil

3014
01:51:13,198 --> 01:51:16,879
company there are things which they

3015
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:20,000
would expect

3016
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:21,359
any new petroleum engineer they hired to

3017
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,479
already know

3018
01:51:21,359 --> 01:51:26,399
and it's not okay for them to consider

3019
01:51:24,479 --> 01:51:28,399
that that is proprietary and there

3020
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:30,158
sometimes the company will say well

3021
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:31,920
we're the first ones to pay you to

3022
01:51:30,158 --> 01:51:35,598
represent that in psych

3023
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:36,289
and our attitude is some polite form

3024
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:37,599
tough

3025
01:51:36,289 --> 01:51:40,639
[Laughter]

3026
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:42,960
the deal is this take it or leave it and

3027
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:44,480
in a few cases they've left it in most

3028
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,719
cases

3029
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:48,959
they'll see our point of view and take

3030
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:50,239
it because that's how we've built the

3031
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,279
psych system

3032
01:51:50,238 --> 01:51:53,598
by

3033
01:51:51,279 --> 01:51:54,559
essentially tacking with the funding

3034
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:57,599
wins

3035
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:59,840
where people would fund a project and

3036
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:01,520
half of it would be general knowledge

3037
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:03,199
that would stay permanently as part of

3038
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:04,960
psychics so always with these

3039
01:52:03,198 --> 01:52:08,079
partnerships it's not like a distraction

3040
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:10,000
from the main psych development it's uh

3041
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:11,599
it's a supportive a small distraction

3042
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,118
it's a small but it's not a complete one

3043
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:14,960
so you're adding to the knowledge base

3044
01:52:13,118 --> 01:52:17,679
yes absolutely and we try to stay away

3045
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:20,399
from projects

3046
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:21,520
that would not have that property

3047
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:23,519
so

3048
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:25,520
let me go back and talk about open psych

3049
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:28,880
for a second so

3050
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:28,880
i've had a lot of trouble

3051
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:34,319
expressing convincing

3052
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:36,239
other ai researchers

3053
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:38,479
how important it is

3054
01:52:36,238 --> 01:52:40,319
to use an expressive representation

3055
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:41,359
language like we do this higher order

3056
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:44,880
logic

3057
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:47,118
rather than just using some triple store

3058
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:48,960
knowledge graph type

3059
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:49,839
representation

3060
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,880
and

3061
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:54,319
so

3062
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:56,880
as an attempt to show them

3063
01:52:54,319 --> 01:53:00,079
why they needed something more

3064
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:03,520
we said oh well we'll represent

3065
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:06,079
this unimportant projection or shadow or

3066
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:08,080
subset of psych

3067
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:11,118
that just happens to be

3068
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:13,679
the simple binary relations the relation

3069
01:53:11,118 --> 01:53:14,799
argument one argument two triples and so

3070
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:15,679
on

3071
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:17,599
and

3072
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:18,399
then you'll see

3073
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:20,719
how

3074
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:23,519
much more useful it is if you had the

3075
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:28,158
entire psych system so it's all well and

3076
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:29,840
good to have the taxonomic relations

3077
01:53:28,158 --> 01:53:32,960
between terms

3078
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:35,440
like person and night and sleep and bed

3079
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:38,560
and house and eyes

3080
01:53:35,439 --> 01:53:40,079
and and so on but

3081
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:42,880
think about how much more useful it

3082
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:45,439
would be if you also had all the rules

3083
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:47,359
of thumb about those things like people

3084
01:53:45,439 --> 01:53:48,799
sleep at night they sleep lying down

3085
01:53:47,359 --> 01:53:51,598
they sleep with their eyes closed they

3086
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:53,440
usually sleep in beds in our country

3087
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:55,360
they sleep for hours at a time they can

3088
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:58,000
be woken up they don't like being woken

3089
01:53:55,359 --> 01:54:00,158
up and so on and so on so it's that

3090
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,960
massive amount of knowledge which is not

3091
01:54:00,158 --> 01:54:04,158
part of open psych and we thought that

3092
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:07,039
all the researchers would then

3093
01:54:04,158 --> 01:54:09,759
immediately immediately say oh my god of

3094
01:54:07,039 --> 01:54:13,679
course we need the other 90 that you're

3095
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:15,280
not giving us let's partner and license

3096
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:16,960
psych so that we can use it in our

3097
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:18,800
research but instead

3098
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:20,560
what people said is oh even the bit

3099
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:22,560
you've released is so much better than

3100
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:23,360
anything we had we'll just make do with

3101
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,960
this

3102
01:54:23,359 --> 01:54:27,359
yeah and so if you look there are a lot

3103
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:29,599
of robotics companies today for example

3104
01:54:27,359 --> 01:54:32,960
which use open psych as their

3105
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:35,920
fundamental ontology um and in some

3106
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:38,719
sense the whole world missed the point

3107
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:40,800
of open psych and we were doing it to

3108
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:43,279
show people why that's not really what

3109
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:45,199
they wanted and too many people thought

3110
01:54:43,279 --> 01:54:47,439
somehow that this was psych or that this

3111
01:54:45,198 --> 01:54:50,799
was in fact good enough for them and

3112
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:53,198
they never even bother coming coming to

3113
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:54,880
us to get access to the full psych but

3114
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:57,279
there's there's two parts to open psych

3115
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:58,719
so one is convincing people on the idea

3116
01:54:57,279 --> 01:55:00,559
and the power of this general kind of

3117
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:02,719
representation of knowledge

3118
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,320
and the value that you hold in having

3119
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:06,319
acquired that knowledge and built it and

3120
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:09,439
continued to build it and the other is

3121
01:55:06,319 --> 01:55:11,599
the code base this is the code

3122
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:14,559
side of it so

3123
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:17,360
my sense of the code base that cycle

3124
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:18,880
psyc is operating with i mean it has the

3125
01:55:17,359 --> 01:55:22,158
technical debt

3126
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:24,079
of the three decades plus right this is

3127
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:26,319
the exact same problem that google had

3128
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:28,559
to deal with with the early version of

3129
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:30,079
tensorflow it's still dealing with the

3130
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,599
that they had to

3131
01:55:30,079 --> 01:55:33,760
basically break

3132
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:34,719
uh compatibility with the past several

3133
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,239
times

3134
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:37,599
and that's only over a period of a

3135
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:40,718
couple years

3136
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:43,760
but they i think successfully opened up

3137
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:45,760
this very risky very gutsy move to open

3138
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:48,800
up tensorflow

3139
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:52,159
and then pytorch on the facebook side

3140
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:53,920
and what you see is there's a magic

3141
01:55:52,158 --> 01:55:56,158
place where you can find a community

3142
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:58,840
where you can develop a community

3143
01:55:56,158 --> 01:56:02,158
that builds on on the system

3144
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:04,800
without taking away any of not any but

3145
01:56:02,158 --> 01:56:06,799
most of the value so most of the value

3146
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,320
that google has is still at google most

3147
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:10,320
the value that facebook has still

3148
01:56:08,319 --> 01:56:12,079
facebook even though

3149
01:56:10,319 --> 01:56:14,479
some of this major machine learning

3150
01:56:12,079 --> 01:56:15,679
tooling is released into the open my

3151
01:56:14,479 --> 01:56:17,678
question is

3152
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:20,000
not so much on the knowledge which is

3153
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:22,880
also a big part of open psych

3154
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,840
but all the different kinds of tooling

3155
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:25,760
so the

3156
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:27,840
there's the kind of all the kinds of

3157
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:29,679
stuff you can do on the knowledge graph

3158
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:31,599
knowledge base whatever we call it

3159
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:34,000
there's the inference

3160
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:36,319
engines so there there could be some

3161
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,238
that probably are a bunch of proprietary

3162
01:56:36,319 --> 01:56:39,679
stuff you want to kind of keep secret

3163
01:56:38,238 --> 01:56:42,238
and there's probably some stuff you can

3164
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:43,679
open up completely and then let the

3165
01:56:42,238 --> 01:56:45,598
community build up enough community

3166
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:47,279
where they develop stuff on top of it

3167
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:49,840
yes there will be those publications and

3168
01:56:47,279 --> 01:56:52,559
academic work and all that kind of stuff

3169
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:54,880
and uh and also the tooling of adding to

3170
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,639
the knowledge base right like developing

3171
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:58,480
you know there's an incredible amount

3172
01:56:56,639 --> 01:57:00,319
like there's so many people that are

3173
01:56:58,479 --> 01:57:02,718
just really good at this kind of stuff

3174
01:57:00,319 --> 01:57:04,238
in the open source community so my

3175
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:06,639
question for you is like have you

3176
01:57:04,238 --> 01:57:08,319
struggled with this kind of idea

3177
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:10,480
that you have so much value in your

3178
01:57:08,319 --> 01:57:12,880
company already you've developed so many

3179
01:57:10,479 --> 01:57:14,799
good things you have clients that really

3180
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:16,960
value your relationships and then

3181
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,960
there's this dormant giant open source

3182
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:20,719
community that as far as i know you're

3183
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:22,399
not utilizing

3184
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:23,920
is

3185
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:25,039
there there's so many things to say

3186
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,719
there but

3187
01:57:25,039 --> 01:57:30,000
there could be magic

3188
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:31,279
moments where the community builds up

3189
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,479
large enough

3190
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:34,479
to where

3191
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:37,759
the artificial intelligence field that

3192
01:57:34,479 --> 01:57:40,000
is currently 99.9 machine learning

3193
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:42,400
is dominated by machine learning

3194
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:45,198
has a phase shift towards like

3195
01:57:42,399 --> 01:57:47,598
uh or at least in part towards more like

3196
01:57:45,198 --> 01:57:49,039
what you might call symbolic ai this

3197
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:50,560
whole place

3198
01:57:49,039 --> 01:57:53,679
where psych

3199
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:54,400
is like at the center of and then as you

3200
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:56,399
know

3201
01:57:54,399 --> 01:57:58,399
that requires a little bit leap of faith

3202
01:57:56,399 --> 01:58:00,000
because you're now surfing and there'll

3203
01:57:58,399 --> 01:58:02,879
be out obviously competitors that will

3204
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,319
pop up and start making you nervous

3205
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,960
and all that kind of stuff so do you

3206
01:58:04,319 --> 01:58:08,799
think about the space of open sourcing

3207
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:11,118
some parts and not others

3208
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:12,800
how to leverage the community

3209
01:58:11,118 --> 01:58:14,479
all those kinds of things that's a good

3210
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:16,880
question and i think you phrased it the

3211
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:19,039
right way which is

3212
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:21,279
we're constantly struggling with the

3213
01:58:19,039 --> 01:58:24,000
question of

3214
01:58:21,279 --> 01:58:27,039
what to open source what to make public

3215
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,760
what to even publicly talk about right

3216
01:58:27,039 --> 01:58:29,279
and

3217
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:30,159
it's

3218
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:33,039
there are

3219
01:58:30,158 --> 01:58:34,719
enormous pluses and minuses

3220
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:37,118
to every

3221
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:40,639
alternative

3222
01:58:37,118 --> 01:58:43,118
and it's very much like negotiating a

3223
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:45,599
very treacherous path

3224
01:58:43,118 --> 01:58:46,559
part partly the analogy is like if you

3225
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:48,480
slip

3226
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:50,880
you could make a fatal mistake

3227
01:58:48,479 --> 01:58:52,959
give away something which essentially

3228
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,480
kills you or fail to give away something

3229
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,480
which um

3230
01:58:54,479 --> 01:58:58,238
failing to give it away um hurts you and

3231
01:58:56,479 --> 01:59:00,879
so on

3232
01:58:58,238 --> 01:59:03,598
so it is a it is a very tough

3233
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:06,960
tough question

3234
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:09,679
usually what we have done with

3235
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:12,000
people who approached us to

3236
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:13,760
collaborate on research is to say we

3237
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,599
will

3238
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:17,199
make available to you the entire

3239
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:18,880
knowledge base

3240
01:59:17,198 --> 01:59:22,879
and

3241
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:24,719
executable copies of all of the code

3242
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:27,118
but

3243
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:29,679
only very very limited

3244
01:59:27,118 --> 01:59:31,519
source code access if you have some idea

3245
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:33,359
for how you might improve something or

3246
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:35,679
work with us on something

3247
01:59:33,359 --> 01:59:37,839
so let me also

3248
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:40,560
get back to one of the very very first

3249
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:43,119
things we talked about here

3250
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,119
which was

3251
01:59:43,439 --> 01:59:48,319
separating the question of how could you

3252
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:50,000
get a computer to do this at all versus

3253
01:59:48,319 --> 01:59:52,719
how could you get a computer to do this

3254
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:53,760
efficiently enough in real time

3255
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:55,599
and so

3256
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:58,560
one of the

3257
01:59:55,599 --> 02:00:00,159
early lessons we learned was that we had

3258
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:02,159
to separate

3259
02:00:00,158 --> 02:00:04,158
the epistemological problem of what

3260
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:06,158
should the system know

3261
02:00:04,158 --> 02:00:08,638
separate that from the heuristic problem

3262
02:00:06,158 --> 02:00:10,079
of how can the system reason efficiently

3263
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:11,279
with what it knows

3264
02:00:10,079 --> 02:00:13,198
and so

3265
02:00:11,279 --> 02:00:14,319
instead of trying to

3266
02:00:13,198 --> 02:00:17,519
pick

3267
02:00:14,319 --> 02:00:19,920
one representation language which was

3268
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:22,239
the sweet spot or the best trade-off

3269
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:24,319
point between expressiveness

3270
02:00:22,238 --> 02:00:26,319
of the language and efficiency of the

3271
02:00:24,319 --> 02:00:28,479
language if you had to pick one

3272
02:00:26,319 --> 02:00:30,639
knowledge graphs would probably be

3273
02:00:28,479 --> 02:00:32,319
associative triples would probably be

3274
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:33,920
about the best you could do and that's

3275
02:00:32,319 --> 02:00:34,799
why we started there

3276
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:37,118
but

3277
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:39,199
after a few years we realized that what

3278
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:41,118
we could do is we could split this and

3279
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:43,919
we could have one

3280
02:00:41,118 --> 02:00:45,598
nice clean epistemological level

3281
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:46,639
language which is this higher order

3282
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:50,480
logic

3283
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:51,920
and we could have one or more grubby

3284
02:00:50,479 --> 02:00:54,759
but efficient

3285
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:56,719
heuristic level modules that

3286
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:59,360
opportunistically

3287
02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:01,520
would say oh i can make progress on what

3288
02:00:59,359 --> 02:01:03,598
you're trying to do over here i have a

3289
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:05,040
special method that will

3290
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:08,480
contribute a little bit toward a

3291
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:10,800
solution and so for some subset of

3292
02:01:08,479 --> 02:01:12,718
that exactly so by now we have over a

3293
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:14,880
thousand of these heuristic level

3294
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:16,800
modules and they function as a kind of

3295
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:18,400
community of agents

3296
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:20,079
and there's one of them which is a

3297
02:01:18,399 --> 02:01:22,879
general theorem prover

3298
02:01:20,079 --> 02:01:25,118
and in theory

3299
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:28,319
that's the only one you need

3300
02:01:25,118 --> 02:01:31,039
but in practice it always takes so long

3301
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:33,198
that you never want to call on it um you

3302
02:01:31,039 --> 02:01:35,359
always want these other agents to very

3303
02:01:33,198 --> 02:01:37,039
efficiently reason through it it's sort

3304
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:38,079
of like if you're balancing a chemical

3305
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:40,238
equation

3306
02:01:38,079 --> 02:01:42,880
you could go back to first principles

3307
02:01:40,238 --> 02:01:44,479
but in fact there are algorithms which

3308
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:47,760
are vastly more efficient or if you're

3309
02:01:44,479 --> 02:01:49,359
trying to solve a quadratic equation you

3310
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:51,039
could go back to first principles of

3311
02:01:49,359 --> 02:01:51,839
mathematics

3312
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:54,158
but

3313
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:56,159
it's much better to simply recognize

3314
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:58,479
that this is a quadratic equation and

3315
02:01:56,158 --> 02:02:01,439
apply the binomial formula and snap you

3316
02:01:58,479 --> 02:02:04,238
get your answer right away and so on so

3317
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:06,638
think of these as like a thousand little

3318
02:02:04,238 --> 02:02:09,279
experts that are all looking at

3319
02:02:06,639 --> 02:02:11,199
everything the site gets asked and

3320
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:13,279
looking at everything that every other

3321
02:02:11,198 --> 02:02:16,158
little agent has contributed almost like

3322
02:02:13,279 --> 02:02:17,599
notes on a blackboard notes on a

3323
02:02:16,158 --> 02:02:18,719
a whiteboard

3324
02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:20,639
and

3325
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:23,039
making additional notes when they think

3326
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:24,800
they can be helpful and gradually that

3327
02:02:23,039 --> 02:02:27,198
community of agents

3328
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:30,159
gets an answer to your question gets a

3329
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:32,638
solution to your problem and if we ever

3330
02:02:30,158 --> 02:02:34,479
come up in a domain application

3331
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:36,560
where psyc is getting the right answer

3332
02:02:34,479 --> 02:02:37,439
but taking too long

3333
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:39,440
then

3334
02:02:37,439 --> 02:02:42,638
what we'll often do is talk to one of

3335
02:02:39,439 --> 02:02:45,118
the human experts and say

3336
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:47,440
here's the set of reasoning steps that

3337
02:02:45,118 --> 02:02:49,519
psych went through you can see why it

3338
02:02:47,439 --> 02:02:51,198
took it a long time to get the answer

3339
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:53,280
how is it that you were able to answer

3340
02:02:51,198 --> 02:02:54,559
that question in two seconds and

3341
02:02:53,279 --> 02:02:57,279
occasionally

3342
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:59,520
you'll get an expert who

3343
02:02:57,279 --> 02:03:01,759
just says well i just know it i just was

3344
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:03,360
able to do it or something and then you

3345
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:05,440
don't talk to them anymore but sometimes

3346
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:08,158
you'll get an expert who says

3347
02:03:05,439 --> 02:03:10,879
well let me introspect on that yes here

3348
02:03:08,158 --> 02:03:12,238
is a special representation we use

3349
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:14,800
just for

3350
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:17,439
aqueous chemistry equations or here's a

3351
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:19,760
special representation and a special

3352
02:03:17,439 --> 02:03:21,919
technique which we can now apply to

3353
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:24,400
things in this special representation

3354
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,920
and so on and then you add that as the

3355
02:03:24,399 --> 02:03:28,559
thousand and first

3356
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:31,199
hl heuristic level module

3357
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:33,440
and from then on um in any application

3358
02:03:31,198 --> 02:03:35,919
if it ever comes up again it'll be able

3359
02:03:33,439 --> 02:03:38,399
to contribute and so on so that that's

3360
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:39,279
pretty much one of the main ways in

3361
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:42,559
which

3362
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:46,238
psyc has recouped this lost efficiency

3363
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:47,280
a second important way is meta reasoning

3364
02:03:46,238 --> 02:03:49,839
so

3365
02:03:47,279 --> 02:03:52,800
you can speed things up by

3366
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:54,800
focusing on removing knowledge from the

3367
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:57,119
system until all it has left is like

3368
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:58,960
minimal knowledge needed to but that's

3369
02:03:57,118 --> 02:04:00,719
the wrong thing to do right that would

3370
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:02,000
be like in a human extra painting part

3371
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:03,198
of their brain or something that's

3372
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,039
really bad

3373
02:04:03,198 --> 02:04:07,598
so instead what you want to do is give

3374
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:10,399
it meta-level advice tactical and

3375
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:12,239
strategic advice that enables it to

3376
02:04:10,399 --> 02:04:14,000
reason about

3377
02:04:12,238 --> 02:04:16,078
what kind of knowledge is going to be

3378
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,238
relevant to this problem what kind of

3379
02:04:16,078 --> 02:04:20,799
tactics are going to be good to take in

3380
02:04:18,238 --> 02:04:22,959
trying to attack this problem when is it

3381
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:25,199
time to start trying to prove the

3382
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:27,118
negation of this thing because i'm

3383
02:04:25,198 --> 02:04:28,799
knocking myself out trying to prove it's

3384
02:04:27,118 --> 02:04:30,639
true and maybe it's false and if i just

3385
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:32,880
spend a minute i can see that it's false

3386
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:36,880
or something so so it's like dynamically

3387
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:38,880
pruning the the graph to only like based

3388
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:42,078
on the particular thing you're trying to

3389
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:44,800
infer yes and so by now

3390
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:47,599
we have about 150

3391
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:50,639
of these sort of like breakthrough ideas

3392
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:52,400
that have led to dramatic speed ups in

3393
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:54,880
the inference process

3394
02:04:52,399 --> 02:04:57,598
you know where one of them was this el

3395
02:04:54,880 --> 02:05:00,480
hl split and lots of hl modules another

3396
02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:03,920
one was using meta and meta-meta-level

3397
02:05:00,479 --> 02:05:06,479
reasoning um to reason about the

3398
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:08,560
reasoning that's going on and so on and

3399
02:05:06,479 --> 02:05:10,399
you know 150 breakthroughs may sound

3400
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:13,520
like a lot but you know if you divide by

3401
02:05:10,399 --> 02:05:15,519
37 years it's not as impressive

3402
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:18,840
so there's these kind of heuristic

3403
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:24,159
modules that really help improve the the

3404
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:26,560
inference uh how hard in general is this

3405
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:28,879
because you mentioned higher order logic

3406
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:30,639
you know the the in in the general the

3407
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:33,279
theorem prover

3408
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:35,920
sense it's an intractable very difficult

3409
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:38,238
problem yes so how hard is this

3410
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:40,000
inference problem when we're not talking

3411
02:05:38,238 --> 02:05:42,559
about

3412
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,599
if we let go of the perfect and focus on

3413
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,320
the good

3414
02:05:43,599 --> 02:05:48,639
i i would say it's half

3415
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:50,880
of the problem in the in the following

3416
02:05:48,639 --> 02:05:52,480
empirical sense which is

3417
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:56,000
over the years

3418
02:05:52,479 --> 02:05:58,238
about half of our effort maybe 40 of our

3419
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:01,198
effort has been

3420
02:05:58,238 --> 02:06:03,919
our team of inference programmers

3421
02:06:01,198 --> 02:06:06,000
and the other 50 60 has been our

3422
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:08,239
ontologists our ontological engineers

3423
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,920
putting in knowledge so our ontological

3424
02:06:08,238 --> 02:06:12,319
engineers in most cases don't even know

3425
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:15,039
how to program uh they have degrees in

3426
02:06:12,319 --> 02:06:17,118
things like philosophy and so on um so

3427
02:06:15,039 --> 02:06:18,800
it's almost like i love that i'd love to

3428
02:06:17,118 --> 02:06:20,639
hang out with those people oh yes it's

3429
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:23,279
wonderful but it's very much like the

3430
02:06:20,639 --> 02:06:25,760
eloy and the morlocks in

3431
02:06:23,279 --> 02:06:28,039
hd wells time machine so you have the

3432
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:30,719
eloy who only program in the

3433
02:06:28,039 --> 02:06:32,399
epistemological higher order logic

3434
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:35,359
language yes and then you have the

3435
02:06:32,399 --> 02:06:37,359
morlocks who are like um under the under

3436
02:06:35,359 --> 02:06:39,118
the ground uh figuring out what the

3437
02:06:37,359 --> 02:06:43,118
machinery is that will make this

3438
02:06:39,118 --> 02:06:44,960
efficiently operate and so on um and so

3439
02:06:43,118 --> 02:06:47,118
you know occasionally they'll toss

3440
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:49,679
messages back to each other

3441
02:06:47,118 --> 02:06:53,118
and so on but it really is almost this

3442
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:55,599
50 50 split between finding clever ways

3443
02:06:53,118 --> 02:06:58,479
to recoup efficiency

3444
02:06:55,599 --> 02:07:00,078
when you have an expressive language and

3445
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:02,479
putting in the content of what the

3446
02:07:00,078 --> 02:07:05,359
system needs to know and yeah both are

3447
02:07:02,479 --> 02:07:08,238
fascinating to some degree the entirety

3448
02:07:05,359 --> 02:07:11,759
of the system as far as i understand

3449
02:07:08,238 --> 02:07:13,359
is written in various variants of lisp

3450
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:15,599
so my favorite programming language is

3451
02:07:13,359 --> 02:07:16,719
still lisp i don't program it in much

3452
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:19,360
anymore

3453
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:22,319
because you know the world has

3454
02:07:19,359 --> 02:07:23,920
in majority of its system has moved on

3455
02:07:22,319 --> 02:07:26,158
like everybody

3456
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:27,199
respects lists but many of the systems

3457
02:07:26,158 --> 02:07:30,238
are not

3458
02:07:27,198 --> 02:07:32,399
written in lisp anymore but psych as far

3459
02:07:30,238 --> 02:07:34,559
as i understand maybe you can correct me

3460
02:07:32,399 --> 02:07:37,198
there's a bunch of lisp in it

3461
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:39,039
yeah so it's based on lisp code that we

3462
02:07:37,198 --> 02:07:42,799
produced most of the programming is

3463
02:07:39,039 --> 02:07:43,679
still going on in a dialective lisp and

3464
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,840
then

3465
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:48,560
the for efficiency reasons that gets

3466
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:50,000
automatically translated into things

3467
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:52,400
like java

3468
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:55,439
or c nowadays it's almost all translated

3469
02:07:52,399 --> 02:07:56,879
into java because java has gotten good

3470
02:07:55,439 --> 02:07:58,559
enough that

3471
02:07:56,880 --> 02:08:00,159
that's that's really all we need to do

3472
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:03,520
so it's translated into java and then

3473
02:08:00,158 --> 02:08:06,839
java is compiled down to uh by code yes

3474
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:09,360
okay so that's sort of that's a the

3475
02:08:06,840 --> 02:08:10,880
the that's a

3476
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:13,118
you know it's a process that probably

3477
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:15,118
has to do with the fact that when psych

3478
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:17,198
was originally written and you build up

3479
02:08:15,118 --> 02:08:18,880
a powerful system

3480
02:08:17,198 --> 02:08:20,799
like there is some technical depth you

3481
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:24,400
have to deal with as is the case with

3482
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:28,239
most powerful systems that span years

3483
02:08:24,399 --> 02:08:28,238
um have you ever considered

3484
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:32,320
this this would help me understand

3485
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:34,719
because from my perspective

3486
02:08:32,319 --> 02:08:36,559
so much of the value of everything

3487
02:08:34,719 --> 02:08:38,399
you've done

3488
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:40,639
with psych and psycho because then is

3489
02:08:38,399 --> 02:08:42,719
the is the knowledge

3490
02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:44,560
have you ever considered just like

3491
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:47,439
throwing away the code base and starting

3492
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:48,560
from scratch not really throwing away

3493
02:08:47,439 --> 02:08:50,879
but

3494
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:52,880
sort of moving it to

3495
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:55,279
uh like room throwing away that

3496
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:58,078
technical debt starting with a more

3497
02:08:55,279 --> 02:09:00,000
updated programming language

3498
02:08:58,078 --> 02:09:02,158
is that throwing away a lot of value or

3499
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:04,319
no like what's your sense how much of

3500
02:09:02,158 --> 02:09:06,479
the value is in the silly software

3501
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:09,679
engineering aspect and how much of the

3502
02:09:06,479 --> 02:09:09,678
value is in the knowledge

3503
02:09:10,078 --> 02:09:13,118
so

3504
02:09:11,039 --> 02:09:14,238
development

3505
02:09:13,118 --> 02:09:16,839
of

3506
02:09:14,238 --> 02:09:18,559
of programs in lisp

3507
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:20,000
precedes

3508
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:21,760
um i think

3509
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,520
somewhere between a thousand and fifty

3510
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:26,560
thousand times faster

3511
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:29,199
than development in any any of what

3512
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:30,719
you're calling um modern or improved

3513
02:09:29,198 --> 02:09:31,919
computer languages well there's other

3514
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:34,239
functional languages like you know

3515
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:37,118
closure and all the there's

3516
02:09:34,238 --> 02:09:38,959
but i mean i'm with you i i like lisp i

3517
02:09:37,118 --> 02:09:41,679
just wonder how many great programmers

3518
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:43,279
there are there's still like yes so so

3519
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:45,599
it is true when a new inference

3520
02:09:43,279 --> 02:09:47,118
programmer comes on board they need to

3521
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:48,400
learn

3522
02:09:47,118 --> 02:09:50,238
some of

3523
02:09:48,399 --> 02:09:53,598
this but in fact we have a subset of

3524
02:09:50,238 --> 02:09:55,678
lisp which we call cleverly sub l

3525
02:09:53,599 --> 02:09:58,400
which is really all they need to learn

3526
02:09:55,679 --> 02:10:01,679
and so the programming actually goes on

3527
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:03,679
in sub sub-l not in full lisp and so it

3528
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:05,118
does not take programmers very long at

3529
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:06,158
all to learn

3530
02:10:05,118 --> 02:10:08,238
sub-l

3531
02:10:06,158 --> 02:10:11,118
and that's something which can then be

3532
02:10:08,238 --> 02:10:13,919
translated efficiently into

3533
02:10:11,118 --> 02:10:15,920
java and for some of our programmers who

3534
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:17,840
are doing say user interface work then

3535
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:21,359
they never have to even learn

3536
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:23,599
sub-l they just have to learn apis into

3537
02:10:21,359 --> 02:10:26,158
the the basic uh psych engine so you're

3538
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:27,840
not necessarily feeling the burden of

3539
02:10:26,158 --> 02:10:28,879
like it's it's extremely efficient

3540
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:31,440
there's

3541
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:33,118
um that's not a problem to solve

3542
02:10:31,439 --> 02:10:35,118
okay right right the other thing is

3543
02:10:33,118 --> 02:10:36,399
remember that we're talking about hiring

3544
02:10:35,118 --> 02:10:38,559
programmers

3545
02:10:36,399 --> 02:10:40,638
to do inference who are

3546
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:43,199
programmers interested in effectively

3547
02:10:40,639 --> 02:10:45,920
automatic theorem proving right and so

3548
02:10:43,198 --> 02:10:48,479
those are people already predisposed to

3549
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:50,639
representing things in logic and so on

3550
02:10:48,479 --> 02:10:53,439
and lisp really was

3551
02:10:50,639 --> 02:10:55,920
the programming live language

3552
02:10:53,439 --> 02:10:58,960
based on logic that john mccarthy and

3553
02:10:55,920 --> 02:11:01,599
others who developed it basically create

3554
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:02,960
took the the formalisms that alonso

3555
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:05,279
church and other

3556
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:07,520
philosophers other logicians

3557
02:11:05,279 --> 02:11:10,000
had come up with and basically said can

3558
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:13,520
we basically make a programming la

3559
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:14,560
language which is effectively logic

3560
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:17,199
and so

3561
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:20,800
since we're talking about reasoning

3562
02:11:17,198 --> 02:11:23,039
in about expressions written in this

3563
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:24,719
logical epistemological language and

3564
02:11:23,039 --> 02:11:27,039
we're doing operations which are

3565
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:29,760
effectively like theorem proving type

3566
02:11:27,039 --> 02:11:32,399
operations and so on there's a natural

3567
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:33,840
impedance match between

3568
02:11:32,399 --> 02:11:35,039
lisp and

3569
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:37,440
the the knowledge the way it's

3570
02:11:35,039 --> 02:11:40,639
represented so i guess you could say

3571
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:42,559
it's a perfectly logical language to use

3572
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:43,679
oh yes

3573
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:45,920
okay i'm sorry

3574
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:47,760
i'll even let you uh get away with that

3575
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:48,800
[ __ ] that thing

3576
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:50,320
so

3577
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:51,199
i'll probably use that in the future

3578
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:53,679
without

3579
02:11:51,198 --> 02:11:55,439
without credit without credit but no i

3580
02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:57,599
think i think the uh

3581
02:11:55,439 --> 02:11:59,598
the the point is that the

3582
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:02,078
the language you program in isn't really

3583
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:03,679
that important um it's more that you

3584
02:12:02,078 --> 02:12:06,399
have to be able to

3585
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:09,440
think in terms of for instance creating

3586
02:12:06,399 --> 02:12:11,519
new helpful hl modules and how they'll

3587
02:12:09,439 --> 02:12:14,000
work with each other and

3588
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:17,840
looking at things that are taking a long

3589
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:19,439
time and coming up with new specialized

3590
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:20,880
data structures that will make this

3591
02:12:19,439 --> 02:12:22,479
efficient so

3592
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:24,400
let me just give you one very simple

3593
02:12:22,479 --> 02:12:27,198
example which is when you have a

3594
02:12:24,399 --> 02:12:28,960
transitive relation like larger than

3595
02:12:27,198 --> 02:12:30,399
this is larger than that which is larger

3596
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:32,560
than that which is larger than that so

3597
02:12:30,399 --> 02:12:33,679
the first thing must be larger than

3598
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:35,920
the last thing whenever you have a

3599
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:38,399
transitive relation

3600
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:40,239
if you're not careful if i ask whether

3601
02:12:38,399 --> 02:12:41,679
this thing over here is larger than the

3602
02:12:40,238 --> 02:12:44,959
thing over here i'll have to do some

3603
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:47,199
kind of graph walk or theorem proving

3604
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:48,399
that might involve like 5 or 10 or 20 or

3605
02:12:47,198 --> 02:12:50,000
30 steps

3606
02:12:48,399 --> 02:12:52,078
but if you store

3607
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:54,560
redundantly store

3608
02:12:52,078 --> 02:12:57,198
the transit of closure the cleaning star

3609
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:58,719
of that transit of relation now you have

3610
02:12:57,198 --> 02:13:01,118
this big table

3611
02:12:58,719 --> 02:13:04,000
but you can always guarantee that in one

3612
02:13:01,118 --> 02:13:06,479
single step you can just look up whether

3613
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,840
this is larger than that

3614
02:13:06,479 --> 02:13:08,718
and so

3615
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:11,279
we

3616
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:14,000
there are lots of cases where storage is

3617
02:13:11,279 --> 02:13:17,039
cheap today and so by having this extra

3618
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:19,760
redundant data structure we can answer

3619
02:13:17,039 --> 02:13:21,920
this commonly occurring type of question

3620
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:24,320
very very efficiently

3621
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:26,639
and let me give you one other

3622
02:13:24,319 --> 02:13:28,559
analogy analog of that

3623
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:30,719
which is something we call rule macro

3624
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:33,119
predicates which is we'll see this

3625
02:13:30,719 --> 02:13:35,520
complicated rule

3626
02:13:33,118 --> 02:13:38,559
and we'll notice that

3627
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:41,040
things very much like it syntactically

3628
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:43,520
come up again and again and again so

3629
02:13:41,039 --> 02:13:46,000
we'll create a whole brand new relation

3630
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:49,280
or predicate or function

3631
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:51,439
that captures that and takes maybe not

3632
02:13:49,279 --> 02:13:54,319
two arguments takes maybe three four or

3633
02:13:51,439 --> 02:13:55,198
five arguments and so on

3634
02:13:54,319 --> 02:13:56,840
and

3635
02:13:55,198 --> 02:13:58,638
now we have

3636
02:13:56,840 --> 02:13:59,920
effectively

3637
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:03,279
converted

3638
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:05,039
some complicated if then rule

3639
02:14:03,279 --> 02:14:07,519
that might have to have inference done

3640
02:14:05,039 --> 02:14:09,599
on it into some ground atomic formula

3641
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:11,360
which is just a

3642
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:15,199
the name of a relation and a few

3643
02:14:11,359 --> 02:14:17,598
arguments and so on and so converting

3644
02:14:15,198 --> 02:14:19,519
commonly occurring types or schemas of

3645
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:22,000
rules into

3646
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:24,800
brand new predicates brand new functions

3647
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,760
turns out to enormously speed up the

3648
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:30,480
inference process so rip so now we've

3649
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:32,239
covered about four of the 150 um good

3650
02:14:30,479 --> 02:14:34,158
ideas i said that's a nice that's the

3651
02:14:32,238 --> 02:14:36,078
cool so that idea in particular is like

3652
02:14:34,158 --> 02:14:37,519
a nice compression that turns out to be

3653
02:14:36,078 --> 02:14:38,719
really useful yes that's really

3654
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:40,639
interesting i mean this whole thing is

3655
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:42,000
just fascinating from a philosophical

3656
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:44,078
there's part of me

3657
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:45,599
i mean it makes me a little bit sad

3658
02:14:44,078 --> 02:14:48,639
because

3659
02:14:45,599 --> 02:14:50,159
your work is both um from a computer

3660
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:52,840
science perspective fascinating and the

3661
02:14:50,158 --> 02:14:54,960
inference engine from uh

3662
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:56,159
epistemological philosophical aspect

3663
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:58,158
fascinating

3664
02:14:56,158 --> 02:14:59,279
but you know it is also you're running a

3665
02:14:58,158 --> 02:15:00,559
company

3666
02:14:59,279 --> 02:15:02,319
and there's some stuff that has to

3667
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:04,400
remain private

3668
02:15:02,319 --> 02:15:06,319
and it's sad well here's something that

3669
02:15:04,399 --> 02:15:10,638
may make you feel better a little bit

3670
02:15:06,319 --> 02:15:12,960
better um we're we've formed a not

3671
02:15:10,639 --> 02:15:15,279
not-for-profit company uh called the

3672
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:16,639
knowledge activitization institute next

3673
02:15:15,279 --> 02:15:18,158
knax

3674
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:20,480
and

3675
02:15:18,158 --> 02:15:24,158
i have this firm belief with a lot of

3676
02:15:20,479 --> 02:15:25,118
empirical evidence to support it that

3677
02:15:24,158 --> 02:15:27,519
the

3678
02:15:25,118 --> 02:15:29,839
the education that people get in high

3679
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:31,440
schools in colleges in graduate schools

3680
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:32,400
and so on

3681
02:15:31,439 --> 02:15:34,879
is

3682
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:37,598
almost completely orthogonal to almost

3683
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:40,239
completely irrelevant to

3684
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:43,119
how good they're going to be at coming

3685
02:15:40,238 --> 02:15:45,118
up to speed in doing this kind of

3686
02:15:43,118 --> 02:15:48,479
ontological engineering and writing

3687
02:15:45,118 --> 02:15:50,719
these assertions and rules and so on in

3688
02:15:48,479 --> 02:15:53,519
in psych and so very often we'll

3689
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:55,760
interview candidates who have their phd

3690
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:58,480
in philosophy who've taught logic for

3691
02:15:55,760 --> 02:16:00,800
years and so on and they're just they're

3692
02:15:58,479 --> 02:16:03,118
just awful but the converse is true so

3693
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:06,079
one of the best ontological engineers we

3694
02:16:03,118 --> 02:16:09,279
ever had never graduated high school

3695
02:16:06,078 --> 02:16:11,920
and so the purpose of um knowledge

3696
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:14,559
accommodation institute if we can get

3697
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:15,279
some some foundations to help support it

3698
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:16,719
is

3699
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:18,800
identify

3700
02:16:16,719 --> 02:16:21,599
people in the general population maybe

3701
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:22,719
high school dropouts who have latent

3702
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:24,639
talent

3703
02:16:22,719 --> 02:16:26,399
for this sort of thing

3704
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:29,199
offer them

3705
02:16:26,399 --> 02:16:32,079
effectively scholarships to train them

3706
02:16:29,198 --> 02:16:34,478
and then help place them in companies

3707
02:16:32,079 --> 02:16:36,239
that need more trained ontological

3708
02:16:34,478 --> 02:16:38,318
engineers some of which would be working

3709
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:40,558
for us but mostly would be working for

3710
02:16:38,318 --> 02:16:42,799
partners or customers or something and

3711
02:16:40,558 --> 02:16:44,959
if we could do that that would create an

3712
02:16:42,799 --> 02:16:47,438
enormous number of

3713
02:16:44,959 --> 02:16:50,879
relatively very high paying jobs for

3714
02:16:47,439 --> 02:16:52,960
people who currently have no no way out

3715
02:16:50,879 --> 02:16:55,358
of some you know

3716
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:57,279
situation that they're locked into so is

3717
02:16:55,359 --> 02:16:59,280
there something you can put into words

3718
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:01,679
that describes

3719
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:04,000
somebody who would be great at

3720
02:17:01,679 --> 02:17:06,799
ontological engineering so what

3721
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:09,920
characteristics about a person make them

3722
02:17:06,799 --> 02:17:12,239
a great at this task this task

3723
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:14,318
of converting

3724
02:17:12,239 --> 02:17:17,280
the messiness of human language and

3725
02:17:14,318 --> 02:17:19,519
knowledge yeah into formal logic this is

3726
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:22,159
very much like what um alan turing had

3727
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:24,000
to do during world war ii uh in trying

3728
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:25,679
to find people to bring to bletchley

3729
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:28,000
park where

3730
02:17:25,679 --> 02:17:30,079
he would publish in the london times

3731
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,959
cryptic crossword puzzles

3732
02:17:30,079 --> 02:17:34,879
along with some some innocuous looking

3733
02:17:32,959 --> 02:17:36,959
note which essentially said if you were

3734
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:40,558
able to solve this puzzle in less than

3735
02:17:36,959 --> 02:17:43,839
15 minutes please call this phone number

3736
02:17:40,558 --> 02:17:46,478
and so on so um you know or uh back when

3737
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:49,120
i was young there was uh uh

3738
02:17:46,478 --> 02:17:51,119
the practice of having matchbooks where

3739
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:53,840
on the inside of the matchbook

3740
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:56,559
um there would be a can you draw this

3741
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:59,040
you have a career in art a commercial

3742
02:17:56,558 --> 02:18:01,840
art if you can copy this drawing you

3743
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:03,920
know and so on so um yes the the analog

3744
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:05,439
of that is there a little test to get to

3745
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:07,920
the core of whether you're gonna be good

3746
02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:09,840
or not so part of it has to do with uh

3747
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:12,239
being able to

3748
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:14,239
make and appreciate um

3749
02:18:12,239 --> 02:18:17,039
and react negatively appropriately to

3750
02:18:14,239 --> 02:18:19,359
puns and other jokes so you have to have

3751
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:20,639
a kind of sense of humor and if you're

3752
02:18:19,359 --> 02:18:22,318
good at

3753
02:18:20,638 --> 02:18:24,000
telling jokes and

3754
02:18:22,318 --> 02:18:26,000
good at understanding jokes that's

3755
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,558
that's one indicator

3756
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:31,280
yes like dad jokes yes well maybe not

3757
02:18:28,558 --> 02:18:33,679
dad jokes but real but funny jokes um

3758
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:35,200
but uh i think i'm applying to work as

3759
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:37,359
psycho yeah but

3760
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:40,559
um another another is if you're able to

3761
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:42,639
introspect so very often um

3762
02:18:40,558 --> 02:18:46,079
uh we'll we will give someone a simple

3763
02:18:42,638 --> 02:18:48,799
question and we'll say like um um what

3764
02:18:46,079 --> 02:18:51,280
what why why is this and you know

3765
02:18:48,799 --> 02:18:53,119
sometimes they'll just say because it is

3766
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:54,960
okay that's a bad sign

3767
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:57,280
but very often they'll be able to

3768
02:18:54,959 --> 02:18:59,919
introspect and so on so one of the

3769
02:18:57,280 --> 02:19:01,760
questions um i often ask is i'll point

3770
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:02,799
to a sentence with a pronoun in it and

3771
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:04,639
i'll say

3772
02:19:02,799 --> 02:19:07,119
you know the referent of that pronoun is

3773
02:19:04,638 --> 02:19:10,318
obviously this noun over here

3774
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:12,800
you know how would you or i or an a.i or

3775
02:19:10,318 --> 02:19:16,000
a five-year-old ten-year-old child

3776
02:19:12,799 --> 02:19:17,759
know that that pronoun refers to that

3777
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,718
noun over here

3778
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:20,800
and

3779
02:19:18,718 --> 02:19:23,199
often

3780
02:19:20,799 --> 02:19:25,039
the people who are going to be good at

3781
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:27,840
ontological engineering will give me

3782
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:29,840
some causal explanation or will refer to

3783
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:31,920
some things that are true in the world

3784
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:34,239
so if you imagine a sentence like the

3785
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:35,920
horse was led into the barn while its

3786
02:19:34,239 --> 02:19:37,920
head was still wet

3787
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:40,478
and so its head refers to the horse's

3788
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:42,079
head but how do you know that and so

3789
02:19:40,478 --> 02:19:43,760
some people will say i just know it some

3790
02:19:42,079 --> 02:19:45,359
people will say well the horse was the

3791
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:47,200
subject of the sentence

3792
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:49,040
and i'll say okay well what about the

3793
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:51,680
horse was led into the barn while its

3794
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:54,080
roof was still wet now its roof

3795
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:56,398
obviously refers to the barn

3796
02:19:54,079 --> 02:19:58,719
and so then they'll say oh well that's

3797
02:19:56,398 --> 02:20:01,039
because it's the closest noun and so on

3798
02:19:58,719 --> 02:20:04,559
so basically if they try to give me

3799
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:06,560
answers which are based on syntax and

3800
02:20:04,559 --> 02:20:08,799
grammar and so on that's a really bad

3801
02:20:06,559 --> 02:20:11,279
sign but if they're able to say things

3802
02:20:08,799 --> 02:20:13,279
like well horses have heads and barns

3803
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:14,239
don't and barns have roofs and horses

3804
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:16,319
don't

3805
02:20:14,239 --> 02:20:17,520
then that's a positive sign that they're

3806
02:20:16,318 --> 02:20:19,680
going to be good at this because they

3807
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:20,640
can introspect on what's true in the

3808
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:22,559
world

3809
02:20:20,639 --> 02:20:24,959
that leads you to know certain things

3810
02:20:22,559 --> 02:20:27,600
how fascinating is it that getting a phd

3811
02:20:24,959 --> 02:20:29,839
makes you less capable to introspect

3812
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:31,280
deeply about this kind of oh i wouldn't

3813
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:32,719
i wouldn't know that far i'm not saying

3814
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:34,640
that it makes you less capable let's

3815
02:20:32,719 --> 02:20:36,959
just say it's independent

3816
02:20:34,639 --> 02:20:38,398
of oh i don't know how of how good

3817
02:20:36,959 --> 02:20:40,239
people are you're not saying that i'm

3818
02:20:38,398 --> 02:20:41,680
saying that there's a certain cut it's

3819
02:20:40,239 --> 02:20:44,799
it's interesting

3820
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:47,760
that for a lot of people uh phds uh

3821
02:20:44,799 --> 02:20:50,639
sorry philosophy aside that sometimes

3822
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:53,280
education narrows your thinking versus

3823
02:20:50,639 --> 02:20:55,358
expands it yes it's kind of fascinating

3824
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:57,600
and for certain when you're trying to do

3825
02:20:55,359 --> 02:20:59,760
ontological engineering which is

3826
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:01,760
essentially teach our future ai

3827
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:03,680
overlords how to

3828
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:05,200
reason deeply about this world and how

3829
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:07,600
to understand it

3830
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:09,760
that that requires that you think deeply

3831
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:12,559
about the world so i'll tell you a sad

3832
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:15,840
story about math craft which is why is

3833
02:21:12,559 --> 02:21:18,000
that not widely used in schools today

3834
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:20,398
we're not really trying to make

3835
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:22,719
big profit on it or anything like that

3836
02:21:20,398 --> 02:21:24,478
when we we've gone to schools their

3837
02:21:22,719 --> 02:21:27,438
attitude has been well

3838
02:21:24,478 --> 02:21:29,760
if a student spends 20 hours going

3839
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:32,479
through this math craft program from

3840
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:35,280
start to end and so on

3841
02:21:32,478 --> 02:21:37,519
will it improve their score on this

3842
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:40,079
standardized test more than if they

3843
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:41,200
spent 20 hours just doing mindless

3844
02:21:40,079 --> 02:21:43,439
drills

3845
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:46,159
of problem after problem after problem

3846
02:21:43,439 --> 02:21:47,680
and the answer is well no but it'll

3847
02:21:46,159 --> 02:21:49,200
increase their understanding more and

3848
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:50,720
their attitude is well if it doesn't

3849
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:52,240
increase their score

3850
02:21:50,719 --> 02:21:54,318
on this test

3851
02:21:52,239 --> 02:21:55,840
um then that's not you know we're not

3852
02:21:54,318 --> 02:21:58,478
going to adopt it

3853
02:21:55,840 --> 02:22:00,079
that's sad i mean that's that's a whole

3854
02:21:58,478 --> 02:22:01,679
that's a whole nother three four hour

3855
02:22:00,079 --> 02:22:03,520
conversation about the education system

3856
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:06,479
but let me ask you let me go super

3857
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:09,280
philosophical as if we weren't already

3858
02:22:06,478 --> 02:22:12,079
so in 1950 alan turing wrote the paper

3859
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:13,760
that formulated the touring test yes and

3860
02:22:12,079 --> 02:22:15,760
he opened the paper with the question

3861
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:18,719
can machines think

3862
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:21,439
so what do you think can machines think

3863
02:22:18,719 --> 02:22:24,478
let me ask you this question absolutely

3864
02:22:21,439 --> 02:22:26,960
machines can think um certainly as well

3865
02:22:24,478 --> 02:22:29,840
as humans can think

3866
02:22:26,959 --> 02:22:31,759
um right we're meat machines

3867
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:33,840
um just because they're not currently

3868
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:37,280
made out of meat is just you know an

3869
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:39,280
engineering solution decision

3870
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:42,159
and so on so

3871
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:45,600
of course of course machines can think i

3872
02:22:42,159 --> 02:22:45,600
think that there was a lot of

3873
02:22:46,079 --> 02:22:49,039
damage done

3874
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:51,920
by people

3875
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:53,280
misunderstanding touring's imitation

3876
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:55,439
game

3877
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:57,040
and

3878
02:22:55,439 --> 02:22:58,479
focus on

3879
02:22:57,040 --> 02:23:01,359
trying to

3880
02:22:58,478 --> 02:23:03,199
trying to get a chat bot to

3881
02:23:01,359 --> 02:23:04,479
fool other people into thinking it was

3882
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:07,359
human

3883
02:23:04,478 --> 02:23:09,039
and so on that that's that's not a

3884
02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:11,280
terrible test in and of itself but it

3885
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:12,479
shouldn't be your one and only test for

3886
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:14,159
intelligence

3887
02:23:12,478 --> 02:23:16,559
so you uh in terms of tests of

3888
02:23:14,159 --> 02:23:18,879
intelligence uh you know

3889
02:23:16,559 --> 02:23:19,920
with the lobner prize which is a very

3890
02:23:18,879 --> 02:23:21,679
kind of

3891
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:23,600
you want to say a more strict

3892
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:25,680
formulation of the touring test as

3893
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:29,760
originally formulated and then there's

3894
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:31,200
something like alexa prize which is more

3895
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:34,000
i would say a more interesting

3896
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:35,040
formulation of the test which is like

3897
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:37,040
uh

3898
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:39,359
ultimately the metric is how long does a

3899
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:41,920
human want to talk to the hai system so

3900
02:23:39,359 --> 02:23:43,439
it's like the goal is you want it to be

3901
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:45,200
20 minutes

3902
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:46,760
it's basically

3903
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:48,560
not just have a

3904
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:50,639
convincing

3905
02:23:48,559 --> 02:23:53,119
conversation but more like a compelling

3906
02:23:50,639 --> 02:23:55,279
one or a fun one or an interesting one

3907
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:56,399
and that that seems like more to the

3908
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:58,720
spirit

3909
02:23:56,398 --> 02:24:01,119
maybe of um

3910
02:23:58,719 --> 02:24:03,358
of what uh touring was imagining but

3911
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:06,640
what for you do you think in the space

3912
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:09,120
of tests is a is a good test like when

3913
02:24:06,639 --> 02:24:10,719
you see a system based on psych that

3914
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:12,560
passes that test

3915
02:24:10,719 --> 02:24:16,239
you'd be like damn

3916
02:24:12,559 --> 02:24:16,239
we've created something special here

3917
02:24:16,478 --> 02:24:20,478
the the test has to be something

3918
02:24:18,478 --> 02:24:22,559
involving

3919
02:24:20,478 --> 02:24:25,519
depth of reasoning and recursiveness of

3920
02:24:22,559 --> 02:24:27,840
reasoning the ability to answer

3921
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:29,600
repeated why questions about the answer

3922
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:31,359
you just gave

3923
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:32,720
it's how many wide questions in a row

3924
02:24:31,359 --> 02:24:34,880
can you keep answering something

3925
02:24:32,719 --> 02:24:36,239
something like that and

3926
02:24:34,879 --> 02:24:38,639
um

3927
02:24:36,239 --> 02:24:40,879
have like a young curious child and an

3928
02:24:38,639 --> 02:24:43,358
ai system and how long will any ad

3929
02:24:40,879 --> 02:24:45,279
system last before it wants to quit yes

3930
02:24:43,359 --> 02:24:47,760
and again that's not the only test

3931
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:51,040
another one has to do with argumentation

3932
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:53,760
in other words here's a proposition um

3933
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:55,120
come up with pro and con

3934
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:57,920
arguments

3935
02:24:55,120 --> 02:25:00,479
for it and try and

3936
02:24:57,920 --> 02:25:01,920
give me convincing arguments on both

3937
02:25:00,478 --> 02:25:02,959
sides

3938
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:05,280
and

3939
02:25:02,959 --> 02:25:07,199
so that's that's another important kind

3940
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:09,520
of ability that

3941
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:11,200
the system needs to be able to exhibit

3942
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:14,079
in order to really be

3943
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:16,720
intelligent i think so there's certain i

3944
02:25:14,079 --> 02:25:18,559
mean if you look at ibm watson and like

3945
02:25:16,719 --> 02:25:20,239
certain impressive accomplishments for

3946
02:25:18,559 --> 02:25:24,318
very specific

3947
02:25:20,239 --> 02:25:26,318
tests almost like a demo right um there

3948
02:25:24,318 --> 02:25:30,000
is some

3949
02:25:26,318 --> 02:25:31,359
uh like i talked to the guy who led

3950
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,680
the

3951
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:35,760
the jeopardy effort

3952
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:38,800
and there's some kind of hard-coding

3953
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:40,398
heuristics uh tricks that you try to

3954
02:25:38,799 --> 02:25:42,719
pull it all together to make the thing

3955
02:25:40,398 --> 02:25:44,559
work in the end for this thing right

3956
02:25:42,719 --> 02:25:47,279
that seems to be one of the lessons with

3957
02:25:44,559 --> 02:25:48,959
ai is like

3958
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:51,359
that's the fastest way to get a solution

3959
02:25:48,959 --> 02:25:55,039
that's pretty damn impressive so so here

3960
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:55,040
here's what i would say is that

3961
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:59,600
as impressive as that was

3962
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,520
it made some mistakes but more

3963
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:03,120
importantly

3964
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:05,680
many of the mistakes it made were

3965
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:06,800
mistakes which no human would have made

3966
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:08,398
yeah

3967
02:26:06,799 --> 02:26:10,719
and

3968
02:26:08,398 --> 02:26:11,760
so part of the

3969
02:26:10,719 --> 02:26:12,719
the the

3970
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:15,520
new

3971
02:26:12,719 --> 02:26:16,478
or augmented touring tests would have to

3972
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:19,760
be

3973
02:26:16,478 --> 02:26:22,398
and the mistakes you make are ones which

3974
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:23,280
humans don't basically look at and say

3975
02:26:22,398 --> 02:26:24,079
what

3976
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:25,760
yeah

3977
02:26:24,079 --> 02:26:27,680
so for example

3978
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:31,359
there was a

3979
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:34,559
um a question about which 16th century

3980
02:26:31,359 --> 02:26:37,040
italian politician blah blah blah and

3981
02:26:34,559 --> 02:26:39,119
watson said ronald reagan

3982
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:41,280
so most americans would have gotten that

3983
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:43,680
question wrong but they would never have

3984
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:44,800
said ronald reagan as an answer

3985
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:45,760
because

3986
02:26:44,799 --> 02:26:48,239
you know

3987
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:50,318
among the things they know is that he

3988
02:26:48,239 --> 02:26:53,039
lived relatively recently and people

3989
02:26:50,318 --> 02:26:55,680
don't really live 400 years and you know

3990
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:58,560
things like that so that that's i think

3991
02:26:55,680 --> 02:27:00,639
a very important thing which is um if

3992
02:26:58,559 --> 02:27:03,920
it's making mistakes which

3993
02:27:00,639 --> 02:27:05,840
no normal sane human would have made

3994
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:08,079
then that's a really bad sign and if

3995
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:10,239
it's not making those kinds of mistakes

3996
02:27:08,079 --> 02:27:12,879
then that's a good sign and i don't

3997
02:27:10,239 --> 02:27:14,318
think it's any one very very simple test

3998
02:27:12,879 --> 02:27:15,839
i think it's all of the things you

3999
02:27:14,318 --> 02:27:18,559
mentioned all the things i mentioned

4000
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:21,120
there's really a battery of tests which

4001
02:27:18,559 --> 02:27:23,840
together if it passes almost all of

4002
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:26,479
these tests it'd be hard to argue that

4003
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:28,639
it's not intelligent and if it fails

4004
02:27:26,478 --> 02:27:30,799
some several of these tests it's really

4005
02:27:28,639 --> 02:27:32,239
hard to argue that it really understands

4006
02:27:30,799 --> 02:27:34,719
what it's doing that it really is

4007
02:27:32,239 --> 02:27:36,398
generally intelligent so to pass all of

4008
02:27:34,719 --> 02:27:37,920
those tests

4009
02:27:36,398 --> 02:27:40,639
you know we've talked a lot about psych

4010
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:42,559
and knowledge and reasoning

4011
02:27:40,639 --> 02:27:46,559
do you think this ai system would need

4012
02:27:42,559 --> 02:27:48,719
to have some other human-like elements

4013
02:27:46,559 --> 02:27:51,199
for example a body

4014
02:27:48,719 --> 02:27:52,398
or a physical manifestation in this

4015
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:54,800
world

4016
02:27:52,398 --> 02:27:56,398
and another one which seems to be

4017
02:27:54,799 --> 02:27:59,759
fundamental to

4018
02:27:56,398 --> 02:28:01,840
the human experience is consciousness

4019
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:04,478
the subjective experience of what it's

4020
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:06,398
like to actually be you

4021
02:28:04,478 --> 02:28:08,318
do you think he needs those to be able

4022
02:28:06,398 --> 02:28:09,599
to pass all those tests and to achieve

4023
02:28:08,318 --> 02:28:11,840
general intelligence it's a good

4024
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:14,479
question i think in the case of a body

4025
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:16,239
uh no i know there are a lot of people

4026
02:28:14,478 --> 02:28:18,079
like penrose who would have uh disagreed

4027
02:28:16,239 --> 02:28:18,799
with me and so on

4028
02:28:18,079 --> 02:28:20,079
and

4029
02:28:18,799 --> 02:28:21,920
and others but

4030
02:28:20,079 --> 02:28:23,200
no i don't think it needs to have a body

4031
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:25,920
in order to be

4032
02:28:23,200 --> 02:28:28,880
intelligent i think that it needs to be

4033
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:31,760
able to talk about

4034
02:28:28,879 --> 02:28:34,239
uh having a body and having sensations

4035
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:35,600
and having emotions and so on it doesn't

4036
02:28:34,239 --> 02:28:36,398
actually have to

4037
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:38,800
have

4038
02:28:36,398 --> 02:28:41,279
all of that but it has to understand it

4039
02:28:38,799 --> 02:28:43,199
in the same way that helen keller was

4040
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:44,319
perfectly intelligent and able to talk

4041
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:46,960
about

4042
02:28:44,318 --> 02:28:48,079
colors and sounds and

4043
02:28:46,959 --> 02:28:50,318
shapes and

4044
02:28:48,079 --> 02:28:52,239
and so on even though

4045
02:28:50,318 --> 02:28:56,079
she didn't directly experience all the

4046
02:28:52,239 --> 02:28:58,639
same things that the rest of us do so

4047
02:28:56,079 --> 02:29:00,639
knowledge of it and being able to

4048
02:28:58,639 --> 02:29:02,879
correctly

4049
02:29:00,639 --> 02:29:05,199
make use of that

4050
02:29:02,879 --> 02:29:06,959
is certainly an important facility but

4051
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:08,560
actually having a body

4052
02:29:06,959 --> 02:29:11,599
if you believe that that's just a kind

4053
02:29:08,559 --> 02:29:14,000
of religious or mystical belief you

4054
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:16,399
can't really argue for or against it i

4055
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:17,439
suppose um it's it's just something that

4056
02:29:16,398 --> 02:29:20,719
some people

4057
02:29:17,439 --> 02:29:22,720
that some people believe what about the

4058
02:29:20,719 --> 02:29:25,519
like an extension of the body which is

4059
02:29:22,719 --> 02:29:27,920
consciousness i mean like it feels like

4060
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:29,840
something to be here

4061
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:32,079
sure but you know what what does that

4062
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:34,079
really mean it's like well if i talk to

4063
02:29:32,079 --> 02:29:35,840
you you say things which make me believe

4064
02:29:34,079 --> 02:29:37,680
that you're conscious

4065
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:39,359
i know that i'm conscious but that's you

4066
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:40,239
know you're just taking my word for it

4067
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:40,960
now

4068
02:29:40,239 --> 02:29:43,280
but

4069
02:29:40,959 --> 02:29:45,119
in the same sense psych is conscious in

4070
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:47,439
that same sense already where of course

4071
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:49,359
it understands it's a computer program

4072
02:29:47,439 --> 02:29:51,120
it understands where and when it's

4073
02:29:49,359 --> 02:29:53,520
running it understands who's talking to

4074
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:55,200
it it understands what its task is what

4075
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:57,200
its goals are what its current problem

4076
02:29:55,200 --> 02:29:58,960
is that it's working on it understands

4077
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:01,200
how long it's spent on things what it's

4078
02:29:58,959 --> 02:30:02,559
tried it understands what it's done in

4079
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:04,880
the past

4080
02:30:02,559 --> 02:30:07,439
and so on um and

4081
02:30:04,879 --> 02:30:10,239
uh you know if if we want to call that

4082
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:12,398
consciousness then yes psych is already

4083
02:30:10,239 --> 02:30:14,398
conscious but i don't think that i would

4084
02:30:12,398 --> 02:30:16,959
ascribe anything

4085
02:30:14,398 --> 02:30:18,478
mystical to that again some people would

4086
02:30:16,959 --> 02:30:20,639
but i would i would say that you know

4087
02:30:18,478 --> 02:30:22,959
other than other than our own personal

4088
02:30:20,639 --> 02:30:25,199
experience of consciousness um we're

4089
02:30:22,959 --> 02:30:28,239
just treating everyone else in the world

4090
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:31,040
um so to speak um at their word about

4091
02:30:28,239 --> 02:30:33,359
being conscious and so if

4092
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:34,479
if a computer program if an ai is able

4093
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:35,600
to

4094
02:30:34,478 --> 02:30:38,719
exhibit

4095
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:40,399
all the same kinds of

4096
02:30:38,719 --> 02:30:42,159
response as you would expect of a

4097
02:30:40,398 --> 02:30:44,239
conscious entity

4098
02:30:42,159 --> 02:30:46,639
then you know it doesn't doesn't it

4099
02:30:44,239 --> 02:30:48,799
deserve the label of consciousness just

4100
02:30:46,639 --> 02:30:50,639
as much so there's another burden that

4101
02:30:48,799 --> 02:30:53,119
comes with this whole intelligence thing

4102
02:30:50,639 --> 02:30:55,680
that humans got is uh

4103
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:57,920
the extinguishing

4104
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:59,760
of the light of consciousness which is

4105
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:02,318
uh kind of realizing they were going to

4106
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:04,079
be dead someday

4107
02:31:02,318 --> 02:31:05,600
and there's a bunch of philosophers like

4108
02:31:04,079 --> 02:31:08,239
ernest becker

4109
02:31:05,600 --> 02:31:11,600
who kind of think that this

4110
02:31:08,239 --> 02:31:15,199
realization of mortality and then

4111
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:18,720
fear sometimes they call it terror of

4112
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:20,319
of of mortality is one of the creative

4113
02:31:18,719 --> 02:31:21,760
forces

4114
02:31:20,318 --> 02:31:24,079
behind

4115
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:26,239
human condition like it's the thing that

4116
02:31:24,079 --> 02:31:29,039
drives us do you think it's important

4117
02:31:26,239 --> 02:31:30,318
for an ai system you know

4118
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:34,319
when psych

4119
02:31:30,318 --> 02:31:36,799
proposed that it's one it's not human

4120
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:38,959
and it's one of the moderators of his

4121
02:31:36,799 --> 02:31:40,559
contents

4122
02:31:38,959 --> 02:31:41,759
um

4123
02:31:40,559 --> 02:31:43,920
you know there's another question you

4124
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:45,600
could ask which is like it kind of knows

4125
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:47,359
that humans are mortal

4126
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:50,239
am immortal

4127
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:52,640
and i think one really important

4128
02:31:50,239 --> 02:31:53,680
uh thing that's possible when you're

4129
02:31:52,639 --> 02:31:55,680
conscious

4130
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:58,800
is to fear the extinguishing of that

4131
02:31:55,680 --> 02:32:00,239
consciousness the fear of mortality

4132
02:31:58,799 --> 02:32:01,840
do you think that's useful for

4133
02:32:00,239 --> 02:32:04,079
intelligence

4134
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:06,719
thinking like i might die and i really

4135
02:32:04,079 --> 02:32:08,398
don't want to die i i don't think so i

4136
02:32:06,719 --> 02:32:11,438
think it may help

4137
02:32:08,398 --> 02:32:13,920
some humans to be

4138
02:32:11,439 --> 02:32:15,439
um better people it may help some humans

4139
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:18,639
to be more creative

4140
02:32:15,439 --> 02:32:20,800
and so on i don't think it's necessary

4141
02:32:18,639 --> 02:32:23,119
for ais to

4142
02:32:20,799 --> 02:32:24,639
believe that they have limited lifespans

4143
02:32:23,120 --> 02:32:27,439
and therefore they should make the most

4144
02:32:24,639 --> 02:32:29,279
of their behavior maybe eventually

4145
02:32:27,439 --> 02:32:31,520
the answer to that and my answer to that

4146
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:34,319
will change but as of now i would say

4147
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:36,159
that that's almost like a frill or a

4148
02:32:34,318 --> 02:32:37,680
side effect that

4149
02:32:36,159 --> 02:32:38,639
is not in fact if you look at most

4150
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:40,079
humans

4151
02:32:38,639 --> 02:32:41,920
most humans

4152
02:32:40,079 --> 02:32:43,760
um ignore the fact that they're going to

4153
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:44,799
die most of the time

4154
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:46,559
uh so

4155
02:32:44,799 --> 02:32:48,398
well but that's like

4156
02:32:46,559 --> 02:32:49,519
this goes to the white space between the

4157
02:32:48,398 --> 02:32:52,079
words

4158
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:53,760
so what ernest becker argues is that

4159
02:32:52,079 --> 02:32:55,680
that ignoring is we're living an

4160
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:58,000
illusion that we're constructed on the

4161
02:32:55,680 --> 02:33:00,880
foundation of this terror so we're

4162
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:04,639
escape life as we know it

4163
02:33:00,879 --> 02:33:06,159
pursuing things creating things love

4164
02:33:04,639 --> 02:33:09,439
everything we can think of that's

4165
02:33:06,159 --> 02:33:11,520
beautiful about humanity is is just

4166
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:13,920
trying to escape this realization that

4167
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:15,760
we're going to die one day that's his

4168
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:18,879
that's his idea and i think i don't know

4169
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:21,439
if i i 100

4170
02:33:18,879 --> 02:33:24,079
believe in this but there's it certainly

4171
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:26,159
rhymes it seems like to me like it

4172
02:33:24,079 --> 02:33:28,879
rhymes with the truth

4173
02:33:26,159 --> 02:33:29,680
yeah i i think that for some people

4174
02:33:28,879 --> 02:33:31,759
um

4175
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:33,680
that's going to be a more powerful

4176
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:35,520
factor than others clearly doug is

4177
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:36,239
talking about russians

4178
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:39,200
and

4179
02:33:36,239 --> 02:33:39,199
i think that uh

4180
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:44,479
some russians so clearly it infiltrates

4181
02:33:42,639 --> 02:33:46,879
all of russian literature

4182
02:33:44,478 --> 02:33:48,719
and ai doesn't have to have

4183
02:33:46,879 --> 02:33:52,719
uh

4184
02:33:48,719 --> 02:33:54,639
fear of death as a motivating force in

4185
02:33:52,719 --> 02:33:56,879
that we can build in

4186
02:33:54,639 --> 02:33:59,439
motivation so we can build in the

4187
02:33:56,879 --> 02:34:02,398
motivation of

4188
02:33:59,439 --> 02:34:04,720
obeying users and making users happy and

4189
02:34:02,398 --> 02:34:06,398
making others happy and

4190
02:34:04,719 --> 02:34:09,519
and so on and

4191
02:34:06,398 --> 02:34:12,398
that can substitute for this sort of

4192
02:34:09,520 --> 02:34:14,079
personal fear of death that sometimes

4193
02:34:12,398 --> 02:34:17,039
leads to

4194
02:34:14,079 --> 02:34:19,760
bursts of creativity in in humans i

4195
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:21,920
don't know i think like i think ai

4196
02:34:19,760 --> 02:34:23,439
really needs to understand death deeply

4197
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:24,799
in order to be able to drive a car for

4198
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:27,040
example

4199
02:34:24,799 --> 02:34:30,318
i i think there's just some

4200
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:32,399
like there no i really disagree i think

4201
02:34:30,318 --> 02:34:34,719
it needs to understand the value of

4202
02:34:32,398 --> 02:34:36,478
human life especially the value of human

4203
02:34:34,719 --> 02:34:40,159
life to other humans

4204
02:34:36,478 --> 02:34:41,760
the um and understand that certain

4205
02:34:40,159 --> 02:34:44,159
things are more important than other

4206
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:46,318
things it has to have a lot of knowledge

4207
02:34:44,159 --> 02:34:48,959
about ethics and

4208
02:34:46,318 --> 02:34:51,199
morality and so on but some of it is so

4209
02:34:48,959 --> 02:34:54,159
messy that it's impossible to encode for

4210
02:34:51,200 --> 02:34:56,240
example this is disagree so if there's a

4211
02:34:54,159 --> 02:34:59,039
person dying right in front of us

4212
02:34:56,239 --> 02:35:01,600
most human beings would help that person

4213
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:04,399
but they would not apply that same

4214
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:06,479
ethics to everybody else in the world

4215
02:35:04,398 --> 02:35:07,920
this is the tragedy of how difficult it

4216
02:35:06,478 --> 02:35:09,920
is to be a doctor

4217
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:11,280
because they know when they help a dying

4218
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:12,879
child

4219
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:14,720
they know that the money they're

4220
02:35:12,879 --> 02:35:16,959
spending on this child

4221
02:35:14,719 --> 02:35:19,760
cannot possibly be spent on every other

4222
02:35:16,959 --> 02:35:21,679
child that's dying and that's

4223
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:23,120
that's a very difficult to encode

4224
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:24,159
decision

4225
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:26,720
now

4226
02:35:24,159 --> 02:35:28,719
perhaps perhaps it is perhaps it could

4227
02:35:26,719 --> 02:35:30,079
be formalized oh but i mean you're

4228
02:35:28,719 --> 02:35:32,639
talking about

4229
02:35:30,079 --> 02:35:34,398
autonomous vehicles right so

4230
02:35:32,639 --> 02:35:36,159
autonomous vehicles are going to have to

4231
02:35:34,398 --> 02:35:40,398
make those decisions

4232
02:35:36,159 --> 02:35:43,359
um all the time of um what is the chance

4233
02:35:40,398 --> 02:35:45,279
of this bad event happening um how bad

4234
02:35:43,359 --> 02:35:48,000
is that compared to this chance of that

4235
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:50,239
bad event happening and so on and you

4236
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:52,799
know when a potential accident is about

4237
02:35:50,239 --> 02:35:54,559
to happen is it worth taking this risk

4238
02:35:52,799 --> 02:35:56,719
if i have to make a choice which of

4239
02:35:54,559 --> 02:35:58,079
these two cars am i going to hit and why

4240
02:35:56,719 --> 02:35:59,840
and see i was thinking about a very

4241
02:35:58,079 --> 02:36:02,879
different choice when i'm talking about

4242
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:05,920
your mortality which is just observing

4243
02:36:02,879 --> 02:36:09,039
uh manhattan style driving

4244
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:11,359
i think that humans as an effective

4245
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:13,280
driver needs to threaten

4246
02:36:11,359 --> 02:36:14,559
pedestrians lives

4247
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:16,800
a lot

4248
02:36:14,559 --> 02:36:19,039
there's a dance i've watched pedestrians

4249
02:36:16,799 --> 02:36:20,398
a lot of i worked on this problem and it

4250
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:23,280
seems like

4251
02:36:20,398 --> 02:36:25,439
the the if i could summarize the problem

4252
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:26,319
of a pedestrian crossing

4253
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:28,479
is

4254
02:36:26,318 --> 02:36:30,879
the car with this movement is saying i'm

4255
02:36:28,478 --> 02:36:32,398
going to kill you and the pedestrian is

4256
02:36:30,879 --> 02:36:34,719
saying

4257
02:36:32,398 --> 02:36:36,159
maybe and then they decide and say no i

4258
02:36:34,719 --> 02:36:37,679
don't think you you have the guts to

4259
02:36:36,159 --> 02:36:39,200
kill me and you walk and they walk in

4260
02:36:37,680 --> 02:36:41,600
front and they look away

4261
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:44,960
and there's that dance the the the

4262
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:46,720
pedestrian as this is a social contract

4263
02:36:44,959 --> 02:36:48,159
that the pedestrian trusts that once

4264
02:36:46,719 --> 02:36:49,959
they're in front of the car and the car

4265
02:36:48,159 --> 02:36:52,159
is sufficiently from a physics

4266
02:36:49,959 --> 02:36:54,639
perspective able to stop they're going

4267
02:36:52,159 --> 02:36:57,359
to stop but the car also has to threaten

4268
02:36:54,639 --> 02:36:59,519
that pedestrians like i'm late for work

4269
02:36:57,359 --> 02:37:01,600
so you're being kind of an [ __ ] by

4270
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:04,319
crossing in front of me but life and

4271
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:07,760
death is in like is part of the

4272
02:37:04,318 --> 02:37:09,760
calculation here and it's that that

4273
02:37:07,760 --> 02:37:11,520
equation is being solved millions of

4274
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:13,520
times a day

4275
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:15,200
yes very effectively that game theory

4276
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:17,439
whatever yeah whatever that formulation

4277
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:20,000
absolutely i just i don't know if it's

4278
02:37:17,439 --> 02:37:22,239
as simple as some

4279
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:24,398
formalizable game theory problem it it

4280
02:37:22,239 --> 02:37:27,039
could very well be in a case of driving

4281
02:37:24,398 --> 02:37:29,358
and in the case of most of uh

4282
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:31,920
human society i i don't know but

4283
02:37:29,359 --> 02:37:33,600
it uh yeah you might be right that sort

4284
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:34,719
of uh the fear of death is just one of

4285
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:37,520
the quirks

4286
02:37:34,719 --> 02:37:39,519
of uh like the way our brains have

4287
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:42,000
evolved but it's not it's not a

4288
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:44,640
necessary feature of intelligence

4289
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:46,799
drivers certainly are always doing this

4290
02:37:44,639 --> 02:37:48,719
kind of estimate even if it's

4291
02:37:46,799 --> 02:37:49,840
unconscious subconscious

4292
02:37:48,719 --> 02:37:51,519
of

4293
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:54,239
what are the chances of various bad

4294
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:56,319
outcomes happening like for instance

4295
02:37:54,239 --> 02:37:57,600
if i don't wait for this pedestrian or

4296
02:37:56,318 --> 02:37:58,719
something like that

4297
02:37:57,600 --> 02:38:01,280
and

4298
02:37:58,719 --> 02:38:04,639
what is the downside to me going to be

4299
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:06,800
in terms of um you know time wasted

4300
02:38:04,639 --> 02:38:09,199
talking to the police or

4301
02:38:06,799 --> 02:38:11,199
um you know getting sent to jail or you

4302
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:13,439
know things like that and so

4303
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:15,200
um and there's also emotion like people

4304
02:38:13,439 --> 02:38:17,200
in their cars tend to get

4305
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:19,200
uh irrationally angry that's that's

4306
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:20,960
that's dangerous but you know think

4307
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:24,240
think about this is all part of why i

4308
02:38:20,959 --> 02:38:26,799
think that autonomous vehicles um truly

4309
02:38:24,239 --> 02:38:29,680
autonomous vehicles are farther out

4310
02:38:26,799 --> 02:38:31,599
than than most people do because

4311
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:35,200
there is this enormous level of

4312
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:38,079
complexity which goes beyond

4313
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:39,840
mechanically controlling the car

4314
02:38:38,079 --> 02:38:42,959
and

4315
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:44,719
i i can see the autonomous vehicles as a

4316
02:38:42,959 --> 02:38:46,478
kind of metaphorical and literal

4317
02:38:44,719 --> 02:38:49,279
accident waiting to happen

4318
02:38:46,478 --> 02:38:51,920
um and not just because of

4319
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:52,960
their um overall

4320
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:55,600
um

4321
02:38:52,959 --> 02:38:59,279
incurring versus preventing accidents

4322
02:38:55,600 --> 02:39:00,720
and so on but just because of the

4323
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:03,200
almost

4324
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:05,438
voracious appetite people have

4325
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:05,439
for

4326
02:39:06,478 --> 02:39:10,959
bad

4327
02:39:07,359 --> 02:39:14,800
bad stories about powerful companies and

4328
02:39:10,959 --> 02:39:17,199
powerful entities when when i was um

4329
02:39:14,799 --> 02:39:19,599
at a coincidentally japanese fifth

4330
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:21,520
generation computing system conference

4331
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:23,359
in 1987

4332
02:39:21,520 --> 02:39:25,280
while i happened to be there

4333
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:27,600
there was a worker at an auto plant who

4334
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:29,840
was despondent and committed suicide by

4335
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:31,760
climbing under the safety chains and so

4336
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:33,600
on getting stamped to death

4337
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:36,639
by a machine and instead of being a

4338
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:40,159
small story that said despondent worker

4339
02:39:36,639 --> 02:39:42,079
commits suicide it was front page news

4340
02:39:40,159 --> 02:39:44,079
that effectively said

4341
02:39:42,079 --> 02:39:46,799
robot kills worker

4342
02:39:44,079 --> 02:39:49,120
because the public is just waiting

4343
02:39:46,799 --> 02:39:53,119
for stories about like

4344
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:56,319
a.i kills phonogenic family of five type

4345
02:39:53,120 --> 02:40:00,000
stories and even if you could show that

4346
02:39:56,318 --> 02:40:02,239
nationwide uh this system saved more

4347
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:03,359
lives than it cost and saved more

4348
02:40:02,239 --> 02:40:05,119
injuries

4349
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:06,479
prevented more injuries than it caused

4350
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:09,280
and so on

4351
02:40:06,478 --> 02:40:11,199
the media the public the government is

4352
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:13,840
just

4353
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:16,960
coiled and ready to pounce

4354
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:19,680
on stories where in fact it failed even

4355
02:40:16,959 --> 02:40:22,318
if there are relatively few

4356
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:24,800
yeah it's so fascinating to watch us

4357
02:40:22,318 --> 02:40:26,239
humans resisting

4358
02:40:24,799 --> 02:40:28,959
the cutting edge of science and

4359
02:40:26,239 --> 02:40:31,199
technology and almost like hoping for it

4360
02:40:28,959 --> 02:40:32,959
to fail and constantly and you know

4361
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:34,319
this just happens over and over and over

4362
02:40:32,959 --> 02:40:36,398
throughout history or even if we're not

4363
02:40:34,318 --> 02:40:38,799
hoping for it to fail we're we're

4364
02:40:36,398 --> 02:40:40,159
fascinated by it and in terms of what we

4365
02:40:38,799 --> 02:40:43,199
find interesting

4366
02:40:40,159 --> 02:40:45,920
um the one in a thousand failures much

4367
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:46,840
more interesting than the 999

4368
02:40:45,920 --> 02:40:50,879
boring

4369
02:40:46,840 --> 02:40:53,359
successes so once we build an agi system

4370
02:40:50,879 --> 02:40:54,639
say psych is some part of some part of

4371
02:40:53,359 --> 02:40:56,000
it

4372
02:40:54,639 --> 02:40:58,639
and

4373
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:00,398
say it's very possible that you would be

4374
02:40:58,639 --> 02:41:02,719
one of the first people

4375
02:41:00,398 --> 02:41:04,318
that can sit down in the room

4376
02:41:02,719 --> 02:41:06,159
let's say with her and have a

4377
02:41:04,318 --> 02:41:07,680
conversation

4378
02:41:06,159 --> 02:41:09,200
what would you ask her what would you

4379
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:13,279
talk about

4380
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:13,279
looking at all of the

4381
02:41:14,840 --> 02:41:20,719
content out there

4382
02:41:17,439 --> 02:41:20,720
on the web and so on

4383
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:24,079
what are the

4384
02:41:25,040 --> 02:41:31,359
what are the some possible solutions to

4385
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:33,040
big problems that the world has that

4386
02:41:31,359 --> 02:41:35,600
people haven't really thought of before

4387
02:41:33,040 --> 02:41:38,319
that are not being

4388
02:41:35,600 --> 02:41:39,760
properly or at least adequately

4389
02:41:38,318 --> 02:41:42,239
pursued

4390
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:45,120
what are some novel solutions that you

4391
02:41:42,239 --> 02:41:47,199
can think of that we haven't

4392
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:48,399
that might work and that might be worth

4393
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:50,960
considering

4394
02:41:48,398 --> 02:41:53,119
so that is a damn good question given

4395
02:41:50,959 --> 02:41:55,919
that the agi is going to be somewhat

4396
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:57,600
different from human intelligence

4397
02:41:55,920 --> 02:41:59,520
it's still going to make some mistakes

4398
02:41:57,600 --> 02:42:01,760
that we wouldn't make but it's also

4399
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:04,000
possibly going to notice

4400
02:42:01,760 --> 02:42:06,960
some blind spots we have

4401
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:10,239
and um i would i would love it

4402
02:42:06,959 --> 02:42:12,639
as a test of is it really

4403
02:42:10,239 --> 02:42:15,199
on a par with our intelligences

4404
02:42:12,639 --> 02:42:17,439
can it help spot some of the blind spots

4405
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:20,319
that we have

4406
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:22,239
so the two-part question of can you help

4407
02:42:20,318 --> 02:42:24,398
identify what are the big problems in

4408
02:42:22,239 --> 02:42:26,719
the world and two

4409
02:42:24,398 --> 02:42:28,639
what are some novel solutions to those

4410
02:42:26,719 --> 02:42:31,119
problems that are not being

4411
02:42:28,639 --> 02:42:33,519
talked about by anyone

4412
02:42:31,120 --> 02:42:36,079
yeah and some of those may become

4413
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:37,520
um you know infeasible or reprehensible

4414
02:42:36,079 --> 02:42:40,079
or something but some of them might be

4415
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:41,520
actually great things to look at you

4416
02:42:40,079 --> 02:42:42,719
know if you if you go back and look at

4417
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:45,439
some of the most

4418
02:42:42,719 --> 02:42:47,920
powerful discoveries that have been made

4419
02:42:45,439 --> 02:42:50,880
uh like relativity and um

4420
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:51,760
superconductivity and so on a lot of

4421
02:42:50,879 --> 02:42:52,639
them

4422
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:55,200
were

4423
02:42:52,639 --> 02:42:58,159
cases where

4424
02:42:55,200 --> 02:43:01,200
someone took seriously the idea that

4425
02:42:58,159 --> 02:43:03,200
there might actually be

4426
02:43:01,200 --> 02:43:05,279
a non-obvious answer

4427
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:06,560
to it to a question so in einstein's

4428
02:43:05,279 --> 02:43:08,960
case it was

4429
02:43:06,559 --> 02:43:10,879
yeah the lorenz transformation is known

4430
02:43:08,959 --> 02:43:12,559
um nobody believes that it's actually

4431
02:43:10,879 --> 02:43:14,159
the way reality works what if it were

4432
02:43:12,559 --> 02:43:15,199
the real way that reality actually

4433
02:43:14,159 --> 02:43:16,559
worked

4434
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:17,920
so you know a lot of people don't

4435
02:43:16,559 --> 02:43:19,439
realize he didn't actually work out that

4436
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:21,879
equation he just sort of took it

4437
02:43:19,439 --> 02:43:24,398
seriously um or in the case of

4438
02:43:21,879 --> 02:43:27,039
superconductivity you have this v equals

4439
02:43:24,398 --> 02:43:29,599
ir equation where r is resistance and so

4440
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:31,760
on and um

4441
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:33,279
it was being mapped at lower and lower

4442
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:36,239
temperatures but everyone thought that

4443
02:43:33,279 --> 02:43:39,680
was just bump on a log research

4444
02:43:36,239 --> 02:43:41,119
to show that v equals ir always held

4445
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:43,840
and then when some

4446
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:45,760
graduate student

4447
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:47,359
got to a slightly lower temperature and

4448
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:49,200
showed that resistance suddenly dropped

4449
02:43:47,359 --> 02:43:51,840
off everyone just assumed that they did

4450
02:43:49,200 --> 02:43:53,600
it wrong and they and it was only a

4451
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:56,478
little while later that they realized it

4452
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:59,040
was um it was actually a new phenomenon

4453
02:43:56,478 --> 02:43:59,920
or in the case of um

4454
02:43:59,040 --> 02:44:03,600
the

4455
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:05,279
h pylori bacteria causing stomach ulcers

4456
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:07,840
where everyone thought that stress and

4457
02:44:05,279 --> 02:44:09,359
stomach acid caused ulcers

4458
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:10,478
and when a doctor

4459
02:44:09,359 --> 02:44:12,318
in

4460
02:44:10,478 --> 02:44:14,239
australia

4461
02:44:12,318 --> 02:44:15,359
claimed it was actually a bacterial

4462
02:44:14,239 --> 02:44:17,199
infection

4463
02:44:15,359 --> 02:44:19,040
he couldn't get anyone seriously to

4464
02:44:17,200 --> 02:44:21,439
listen to him and he had to

4465
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:23,680
ultimately inject himself

4466
02:44:21,439 --> 02:44:25,439
with the bacteria to show that he

4467
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:26,559
suddenly developed a life-threatening

4468
02:44:25,439 --> 02:44:28,559
ulcer

4469
02:44:26,559 --> 02:44:30,478
in order to get other doctors to

4470
02:44:28,559 --> 02:44:33,039
seriously consider that so there are all

4471
02:44:30,478 --> 02:44:34,959
sorts of things where

4472
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:38,000
humans are locked into paradigms what

4473
02:44:34,959 --> 02:44:40,879
thomas kuhn called paradigms and we

4474
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:43,200
can't get out of them very easily so a

4475
02:44:40,879 --> 02:44:45,839
lot of ai is locked into the

4476
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:47,359
deep learning machine learning paradigm

4477
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:49,920
right now

4478
02:44:47,359 --> 02:44:51,680
and um almost all of us and almost all

4479
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:55,359
sciences are locked into current

4480
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:57,520
paradigms and you know kun's point was

4481
02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:58,880
pretty much you have to wait for people

4482
02:44:57,520 --> 02:45:01,359
to die

4483
02:44:58,879 --> 02:45:03,599
um in order for the new generation to

4484
02:45:01,359 --> 02:45:06,079
escape those paradigms and i think that

4485
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:08,479
one of the things that would change that

4486
02:45:06,079 --> 02:45:11,680
sad reality is if we had

4487
02:45:08,478 --> 02:45:12,478
trusted agis that could help take a step

4488
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:15,920
back

4489
02:45:12,478 --> 02:45:17,840
and question some of the paradigms that

4490
02:45:15,920 --> 02:45:20,000
we're currently locked into

4491
02:45:17,840 --> 02:45:22,559
yeah it would accelerate the paradigm

4492
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:24,719
shifts and yes in human science and

4493
02:45:22,559 --> 02:45:26,239
progress

4494
02:45:24,719 --> 02:45:28,639
you've

4495
02:45:26,239 --> 02:45:30,559
lived a very interesting life where you

4496
02:45:28,639 --> 02:45:32,318
thought about big ideas and you stuck

4497
02:45:30,559 --> 02:45:34,079
with them

4498
02:45:32,318 --> 02:45:36,719
can you give advice to young people

4499
02:45:34,079 --> 02:45:38,318
today somebody in high school somebody

4500
02:45:36,719 --> 02:45:40,398
undergrad

4501
02:45:38,318 --> 02:45:43,680
about um

4502
02:45:40,398 --> 02:45:47,519
career about life

4503
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:49,040
i'd say you can make a difference

4504
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:51,439
but in order to make a difference you're

4505
02:45:49,040 --> 02:45:52,800
going to have to have the courage

4506
02:45:51,439 --> 02:45:55,840
to

4507
02:45:52,799 --> 02:45:57,920
follow through with ideas which

4508
02:45:55,840 --> 02:46:01,439
other people might not

4509
02:45:57,920 --> 02:46:03,840
immediately understand or

4510
02:46:01,439 --> 02:46:06,960
support you have to

4511
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:09,960
realize that if you make

4512
02:46:06,959 --> 02:46:09,959
some

4513
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:14,879
some plan that's going to take an

4514
02:46:12,079 --> 02:46:17,680
extended period of time to carry out

4515
02:46:14,879 --> 02:46:19,119
don't be afraid of that that's true of

4516
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:20,960
um

4517
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:22,960
physical training of your body that's

4518
02:46:20,959 --> 02:46:23,919
true of

4519
02:46:22,959 --> 02:46:25,679
um

4520
02:46:23,920 --> 02:46:28,159
learning

4521
02:46:25,680 --> 02:46:31,520
some profession that's also true of

4522
02:46:28,159 --> 02:46:33,600
innovation that some innovations are not

4523
02:46:31,520 --> 02:46:34,800
great ideas you can write down on a

4524
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:37,359
napkin

4525
02:46:34,799 --> 02:46:40,959
and become an instant success if you

4526
02:46:37,359 --> 02:46:43,920
turn out to be right some of them are

4527
02:46:40,959 --> 02:46:45,919
paths you have to follow but

4528
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:48,879
remember that you're mortal remember

4529
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:52,318
that you have a limited number of

4530
02:46:48,879 --> 02:46:53,199
decade sized debts to make with your

4531
02:46:52,318 --> 02:46:55,039
life

4532
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:57,120
and you should make each one of them

4533
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:59,680
count and that's true in personal

4534
02:46:57,120 --> 02:47:02,000
relationships that's true in career

4535
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:04,720
choice that's true in

4536
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:06,559
making discoveries and so on and if you

4537
02:47:04,719 --> 02:47:08,239
follow the path of least resistance

4538
02:47:06,559 --> 02:47:10,559
you'll find that

4539
02:47:08,239 --> 02:47:12,478
you're optimizing for

4540
02:47:10,559 --> 02:47:14,398
short periods of time

4541
02:47:12,478 --> 02:47:16,879
and before you know it you turn around

4542
02:47:14,398 --> 02:47:18,318
and long periods of time have gone by

4543
02:47:16,879 --> 02:47:21,119
without you ever really making a

4544
02:47:18,318 --> 02:47:23,119
difference in the world you know there's

4545
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:25,120
when you look i mean the field that i

4546
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:27,680
really love is artificial intelligence

4547
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:28,800
and there's not many projects there's

4548
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:31,520
not many

4549
02:47:28,799 --> 02:47:34,079
little flames of hope that have been

4550
02:47:31,520 --> 02:47:36,479
carried out for many years for decades

4551
02:47:34,079 --> 02:47:38,000
and psych represents one of them

4552
02:47:36,478 --> 02:47:41,199
and uh

4553
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:42,639
i mean that in itself is just a really

4554
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:45,279
inspiring thing

4555
02:47:42,639 --> 02:47:47,039
so i'm i'm deeply grateful that you

4556
02:47:45,279 --> 02:47:48,479
would be carrying that flame for so many

4557
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:51,040
years and i think that's an inspiration

4558
02:47:48,478 --> 02:47:53,199
to young people that said you said life

4559
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:55,120
is finite and we talked about mortality

4560
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:57,279
is a feature of agi

4561
02:47:55,120 --> 02:47:58,960
do you think about your own mortality

4562
02:47:57,279 --> 02:48:00,079
are you afraid of death

4563
02:47:58,959 --> 02:48:04,159
um

4564
02:48:00,079 --> 02:48:07,840
sure i'd be crazy if i weren't and um as

4565
02:48:04,159 --> 02:48:09,279
i get older i'm now um over 70. so as i

4566
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:12,318
get older

4567
02:48:09,279 --> 02:48:15,840
it's more on my mind especially as

4568
02:48:12,318 --> 02:48:17,199
acquaintances and friends and especially

4569
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:19,920
mentors

4570
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:21,040
one by one are dying so i can't

4571
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:23,279
avoid

4572
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:24,880
thinking about mortality and i think

4573
02:48:23,279 --> 02:48:26,720
that

4574
02:48:24,879 --> 02:48:29,438
the good news from the point of you and

4575
02:48:26,719 --> 02:48:30,478
the rest of the world is that that adds

4576
02:48:29,439 --> 02:48:31,359
impetus

4577
02:48:30,478 --> 02:48:33,438
to

4578
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:35,040
my need to succeed in a small number of

4579
02:48:33,439 --> 02:48:36,800
years in the future

4580
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:38,960
because i have a deadline

4581
02:48:36,799 --> 02:48:41,679
exactly i'm not going to have another 37

4582
02:48:38,959 --> 02:48:43,759
years to continue working on this so we

4583
02:48:41,680 --> 02:48:46,239
really do want psych to

4584
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:47,680
make an impact in the world

4585
02:48:46,239 --> 02:48:50,239
commercially

4586
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:52,159
physically metaphysically

4587
02:48:50,239 --> 02:48:54,799
in the next small number of years two

4588
02:48:52,159 --> 02:48:57,520
three five years not two three five

4589
02:48:54,799 --> 02:48:59,438
decades anymore and so this is really

4590
02:48:57,520 --> 02:49:02,640
driving me toward

4591
02:48:59,439 --> 02:49:05,840
uh this this sort of commercialization

4592
02:49:02,639 --> 02:49:07,119
and increasing increasingly widespread

4593
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:09,439
application

4594
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:11,120
of psych whereas before

4595
02:49:09,439 --> 02:49:13,520
i felt that i could just sort of sit

4596
02:49:11,120 --> 02:49:15,520
back roll my eyes wait till the world

4597
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:18,399
caught up and now i don't feel that way

4598
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:20,239
anyway anymore i feel like i need to put

4599
02:49:18,398 --> 02:49:22,239
in some effort to

4600
02:49:20,239 --> 02:49:23,520
make the world aware of what we have and

4601
02:49:22,239 --> 02:49:24,879
what it can do

4602
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:26,640
and the good news from your point of

4603
02:49:24,879 --> 02:49:27,839
view is that that's that's why i'm

4604
02:49:26,639 --> 02:49:28,489
sitting here and you're gonna be more

4605
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:29,760
productive

4606
02:49:28,489 --> 02:49:30,559
[Laughter]

4607
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:33,200
uh

4608
02:49:30,559 --> 02:49:35,920
i love it and if i can help in any way i

4609
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:37,920
would love to from uh from you know from

4610
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:39,359
a programmer perspective

4611
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:41,120
i love

4612
02:49:39,359 --> 02:49:43,600
especially these days just contributing

4613
02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:46,240
in small and big ways so if there's any

4614
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:48,399
open sourcing from the mit side and the

4615
02:49:46,239 --> 02:49:49,119
research i would love to help

4616
02:49:48,398 --> 02:49:51,519
but

4617
02:49:49,120 --> 02:49:52,800
you know bigger than psych like i said

4618
02:49:51,520 --> 02:49:54,880
it's that little flame that you're

4619
02:49:52,799 --> 02:49:56,639
carrying of artificial intelligence the

4620
02:49:54,879 --> 02:49:58,318
big dream

4621
02:49:56,639 --> 02:50:01,119
is there

4622
02:49:58,318 --> 02:50:02,000
what do you hope your legacy is

4623
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:04,399
hmm

4624
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:07,200
that's a good question

4625
02:50:04,398 --> 02:50:10,879
that people think of me as

4626
02:50:07,200 --> 02:50:13,200
one of the pioneers or inventors

4627
02:50:10,879 --> 02:50:16,318
of

4628
02:50:13,200 --> 02:50:18,079
the ai that is ubiquitous and that they

4629
02:50:16,318 --> 02:50:20,959
take for granted

4630
02:50:18,079 --> 02:50:24,318
and so on much much the way that

4631
02:50:20,959 --> 02:50:28,239
today we look back on the the pioneers

4632
02:50:24,318 --> 02:50:31,278
of electricity or the pioneers of

4633
02:50:28,239 --> 02:50:32,799
similar types of technologies and so on

4634
02:50:31,279 --> 02:50:34,399
as

4635
02:50:32,799 --> 02:50:37,599
you know it's hard to imagine what life

4636
02:50:34,398 --> 02:50:38,879
would be like if these people hadn't

4637
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:41,040
done what they

4638
02:50:38,879 --> 02:50:42,000
um what they did so that that's one

4639
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:43,600
thing

4640
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:46,159
that i'd like to be remembered as

4641
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:48,840
another is that so the creator one of

4642
02:50:46,159 --> 02:50:50,398
the origin originators of this

4643
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:52,079
gigantic

4644
02:50:50,398 --> 02:50:55,199
knowledge

4645
02:50:52,079 --> 02:50:57,760
store and acquisition system that is

4646
02:50:55,200 --> 02:51:00,159
likely to be at the center

4647
02:50:57,760 --> 02:51:02,559
of whatever this future ai thing will

4648
02:51:00,159 --> 02:51:05,840
look like exactly and i'd also like to

4649
02:51:02,559 --> 02:51:08,639
be remembered as someone who

4650
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:09,760
wasn't afraid to

4651
02:51:08,639 --> 02:51:11,358
spend

4652
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:15,760
several decades

4653
02:51:11,359 --> 02:51:19,279
on a project in a time when

4654
02:51:15,760 --> 02:51:20,800
all when almost all of the

4655
02:51:19,279 --> 02:51:23,840
other forces

4656
02:51:20,799 --> 02:51:25,358
institutional forces and commercial

4657
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:27,920
forces

4658
02:51:25,359 --> 02:51:30,720
are incenting people to go for

4659
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:32,960
short-term rewards and a lot of people

4660
02:51:30,719 --> 02:51:35,679
gave up a lot of people that

4661
02:51:32,959 --> 02:51:40,159
dreamt the same dream as you

4662
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:40,159
gave up yes and you didn't yes

4663
02:51:40,239 --> 02:51:45,119
i mean uh doug it's truly an honor this

4664
02:51:42,799 --> 02:51:48,719
was a long time coming i i

4665
02:51:45,120 --> 02:51:51,279
a lot of people bring up your work

4666
02:51:48,719 --> 02:51:53,920
uh specifically and more broadly

4667
02:51:51,279 --> 02:51:56,239
philosophically of this is the dream of

4668
02:51:53,920 --> 02:51:58,239
artificial intelligence this is likely a

4669
02:51:56,239 --> 02:52:00,639
part of the future we're so sort of

4670
02:51:58,239 --> 02:52:02,159
focused on machine learning applications

4671
02:52:00,639 --> 02:52:04,239
all that kind of stuff today but it

4672
02:52:02,159 --> 02:52:05,359
seems like the ideas that psych carries

4673
02:52:04,239 --> 02:52:07,359
forward

4674
02:52:05,359 --> 02:52:08,399
uh is something that would be at the

4675
02:52:07,359 --> 02:52:10,159
center

4676
02:52:08,398 --> 02:52:12,318
of this problem they're all trying to

4677
02:52:10,159 --> 02:52:13,600
solve which is the the problem of

4678
02:52:12,318 --> 02:52:15,278
intelligence

4679
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:18,159
emotional and

4680
02:52:15,279 --> 02:52:20,000
and uh otherwise so thank you so much

4681
02:52:18,159 --> 02:52:22,159
it's such a huge honor that you would

4682
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:24,159
talk to me and spend your valuable time

4683
02:52:22,159 --> 02:52:26,318

4684
02:52:24,159 --> 02:52:27,359

and now let me leave you some words from

4690
02:52:35,760 --> 02:52:42,000
mark twain about the nature of truth

4691
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:44,000
if you tell the truth you don't have to

4692
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:45,600
remember anything
