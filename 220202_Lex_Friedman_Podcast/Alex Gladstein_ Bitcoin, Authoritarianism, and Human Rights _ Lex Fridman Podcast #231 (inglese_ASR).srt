00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,639
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,960
alex gladstein chief strategy officer at

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,399
the human rights foundation and the oslo

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,879
freedom forum

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,120
in recent times alex has focused on how

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,440
cryptocurrency and especially bitcoin

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,079
can be a tool for empowering democracy

8
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,239
and civil liberties in the world most

9
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,439
crucially parts of the world that are

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:25,518
living under authoritarian regimes

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,518
as a side note let me say that i have

12
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:30,399
been learning a lot about the ways in

13
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,640
which money can be used to amass power

14
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,399
and in the same way the decentralization

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,799
of money can be used to resist the

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,759
corrupting nature of this power

17
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,599
alex and i do not agree on everything

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,679
but we strive for the same betterment of

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,000
humanity he is sensitive to the

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,238
suffering in the world and is dedicating

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,719
his life to finding solutions that

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,280
lessen that suffering whether bitcoin is

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,439
one such solution i don't know

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,399
but i think it has a chance and that

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,320
means it is worth exploring deeply

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,640
i'm staying in this path of learning

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,959
patiently and with as little ego as

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,040
possible i hope you come along with me

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,280
on this journey as well

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
this is the lex friedman podcast to

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,799
support it please check out our sponsors

32
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,959
in the description

33
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,600
we recorded this conversation a while

34
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,478
ago and i thought i lost the audio and

35
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,879
was

36
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,438
really disappointed with myself for

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,199
messing this thing up but luckily last

38
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,478
week i found it

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,719
and so

40
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,239
rescued from out of the abyss of

41
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,719
non-existence

42
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,560
here's my conversation with alex

43
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,798
glastine

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,759
what are some universal human rights

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,439
that you believe all people should have

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,040
so free speech

47
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,478
freedom of assembly

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,680
freedom of belief

49
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,159
freedom to participate in your

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,000
government the freedom to have privacy

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,960
the freedom to own things property

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
rights

53
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,519
these are all basic fundamental negative

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,599
rights what we call them

55
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,959
these are the basic fundamental human

56
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,158
freedoms

57
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,158
what does negative rights mean

58
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,920
negative rights are

59
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,118
liberties and positive rights are

60
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,920
entitlements

61
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,759
so after world war ii when the un came

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,919
together it was largely a compromise

63
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,239
between the communist soviet union and

64
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,759
the you know free united states right so

65
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,080
the u.s had

66
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,280
uh on its side of the u.n declaration of

67
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,520
human rights

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,840
a bunch of liberties essentially things

69
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,319
like free speech freedom of association

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,560
freedom of assembly the soviets wanted

71
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,159
entitlements uh like the right to work

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,000
the right to have housing the right to

73
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,000
water the right to a vacation

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,080
so you actually read the un declaration

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,400
for human rights it's a negotiation

76
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,280
between the soviets and the americans

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,959
later

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
there was another document in the 70s

79
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,640
released called the international

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,640
covenant on civil and political rights

81
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,639
and this is what ahref uses as its sort

82
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,719
of like lodestar

83
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,318
it's founding document and this is like

84
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,560
essentially an international agreement

85
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,479
on the negative rights those are the

86
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,800
things we choose to focus on because

87
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,280
essentially authoritarian regimes can

88
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,280
commit fraud and claim they're giving

89
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,199
the positive rights the entitlements

90
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,120
without having any of the negative

91
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,878
liberties and they can do that because

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,360
they don't have any like free speech or

93
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:15,359
press freedom um when you when you take

94
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,040
people's basic fundamental freedoms away

95
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,200
it's quite easy to make like a potemkin

96
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,679
village and pretend that there's the

97
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,598
entitlements and that we have good uh

98
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,719
health care and you know

99
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,719
it's the same sort of thing that

100
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,120
authoritarians have done for decades uh

101
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,878
cuba and venezuela and and the soviet

102
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,759
union do you think it's possible for

103
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,679
authoritarian regimes to manipulate to

104
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,759
kind of lie about the negative rights as

105
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,959
well by saying that the people have free

106
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,959
speech

107
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,799
uh the people have the freedom to for

108
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,439
assembly and all those kinds of things

109
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,599
can't you still manipulate

110
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,039
the idea that the citizenry still has

111
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,839
those rights

112
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,560
the opposition leader of malaysia anwar

113
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,560
ibrahim he once told me

114
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,400
that the funny joke that you know in my

115
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,039
country we have freedom of speech we

116
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,200
don't have freedom after speech so yeah

117
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,679
they can absolutely manipulate whatever

118
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,919
they want but i've done research into

119
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,200
socioeconomic data and i guess what i'm

120
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,759
telling you is that authoritarian

121
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,318
regimes which make up

122
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:18,319
53 of the world's population across 95

123
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:20,478
countries um about 4.3 billion people

124
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,478
those who live under those regimes are

125
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,319
subject to

126
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,478
massive fraud when it comes to things

127
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,120
like literacy rates

128
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,599
life expectancy um any sort of

129
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,199
socio-economic data economic growth

130
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,160
they can do this because there's no free

131
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,000
press

132
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,400
um so for us at the human rights

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,319
foundation and for people like me

134
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,159
we believe that the negative rights the

135
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,079
liberties the things that are in for

136
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,320
example uh the bill of rights in the u.s

137
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,918
constitution these things are the table

138
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,439
and then we can build on top of that we

139
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,439
can build the rest of our societies on

140
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,000
top of that the freest countries in the

141
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,600
world have both the negative liberties

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,399
and the entitlements like norway for

143
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,680
example

144
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,159
but there's a big difference between

145
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,319
norway and north korea in north korea

146
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,439
they only claim to have the entitlements

147
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,800
and they definitely don't have the

148
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,319
liberties

149
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,759
do you think there's one right that's

150
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,759
more important than others you kind of

151
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,759
suggested the freedom of the press

152
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,840
maybe freedom of speech

153
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,160
that if you take that away all the other

154
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,000
ones kind of collapse along with like

155
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,680
from a ripple effect is there something

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,918
fundamental that you

157
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,319
like to focus your attention on to

158
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,399
defend to protect to make sure it's

159
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,680
there yeah i think i think free speech

160
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,519
is probably the most fundamental it's

161
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,439
probably why the founders chose to make

162
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,319
it into the first amendment

163
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,680
um

164
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,478
a lot of things are downstream from

165
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,918
there

166
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,519
property rights are also very very

167
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,680
important

168
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,918
obviously we've seen the the toll of

169
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,680
violent redistributionism you know in

170
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,560
over the last hundred years

171
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,600
uh whether it was uh lenin or stalin or

172
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,600
mao

173
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
or other regimes and everywhere from

174
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,520
ethiopia to

175
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,560
colonial colonialists everywhere to

176
00:05:53,519 --> 00:06:00,318
north korea it's not a pretty legacy

177
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,839
is free speech clear to you as a concept

178
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,000
there's been quite a few debates

179
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,359
especially in the digital age

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,038
what it means to violate freedom of

181
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,000
speech there's

182
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,439
been a lot of new like novel mechanisms

183
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,160
for people to communicate with each

184
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,879
other like especially on social networks

185
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,720
and it seems that uh unclear

186
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,478
because a lot of times those are managed

187
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,280
by private companies

188
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,199
it's unclear how much protection do the

189
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,959
citizens have to have

190
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,639
when they're communicating a lot of

191
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,038
people are being censored on these

192
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,680
social platforms some people even

193
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,199
presidents get removed from those social

194
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,038
platforms

195
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,439
have you thought about the freedom of

196
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,159
speech in the united states but in in

197
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,160
the world

198
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,879
as it

199
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,560
as it's implemented in the 21st century

200
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,239
given the internet and all those kinds

201
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,038
of things

202
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,120
there is a soviet dissident

203
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,120
named natan sharonsky who

204
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,918
survived the regime

205
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,680
and he wrote a book

206
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,000
in which his thesis was essentially the

207
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,280
way that you can define a free society

208
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,079
is through something called the town

209
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,239
square test can you go to a public space

210
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,598
where you live and criticize your ruler

211
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,240
loudly

212
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,159
without fear of retribution if you can

213
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,240
do that you have you have free speech i

214
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,759
think that's a pretty good litmus test

215
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,439
most people in this world cannot do that

216
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,479
if you live in havana if you live in

217
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:29,519
moscow if you live in beijing you cannot

218
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:32,639
do that and that's not a free society

219
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,758
in austin texas in boston massachusetts

220
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,879
in london

221
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,960
in santiago chile and tokyo japan in

222
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,560
many democracies you can do that and i

223
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,478
think that that's a really helpful basic

224
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,759
sort of litmus test

225
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,758
does the content of the criticism matter

226
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,879
can it be complete

227
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,400
lies

228
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,039
meaning

229
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,399
conspiracy theories that involve

230
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:59,918
claiming that the leader is let's say

231
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,038
a lizard slash pedophile

232
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,000
slash

233
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:03,839
you know

234
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,598
i'm not saying that those are lies look

235
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:10,638
into it but uh they're very unlikely

236
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,478
phenomena so like does that matter i i

237
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,199
think it ends poorly when

238
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:17,038
the state tries to restrict speech

239
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,560
um i think that's kind of how i would

240
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,478
define censorship

241
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,399
i think censorship and de-platforming

242
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:25,360
are two different things

243
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,560
private companies

244
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,240
you know they get to make up their own

245
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,839
rules about what's allowed on their

246
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,519
platforms and i think that's very

247
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,879
different from a government with guns

248
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,519
and an army

249
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,278
restricting the speech of its citizens

250
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,879
with threats of violence these things

251
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,639
are different for me

252
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,320
that violence is a fundamental

253
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,879
difference

254
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,519
i don't know i i um i've gotten a chance

255
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:50,080
to have dinner with alex jones

256
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,120
and uh i've talked to him a few times

257
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,600
offline

258
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,519
and it does i understand why people are

259
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,440
so off-put by him

260
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,000
but it does bother me that he's

261
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,959
universally removed from every platform

262
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,639
it feels like there's many more

263
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,838
evil people

264
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,600
bad people

265
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,480
compared to alex jones who still

266
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,360
are given a voice on these platforms

267
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,759
and so i'm uncomfortable

268
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,360
with the universality of the application

269
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,799
of the censorship

270
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,120
by uh

271
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,199
by these platforms but on the flip side

272
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,799
you're right there's not a violence

273
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,360
there's not tanks

274
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,439
there's not guns behind that censorship

275
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,399
yeah it's a bit of a generalization but

276
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,279
alex jones would be in prison or dead if

277
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,679
he were in north korea or in cuba or in

278
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:42,159
russia or in china the the authorities

279
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,958
would not tolerate him to do what he did

280
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,799
and here he can kind of do what he wants

281
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,119
he's encountering some resistance in the

282
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,679
marketplace of ideas

283
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,240
large organizations corporations

284
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:57,199
and a lot of public sentiment

285
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,959
uh in different parts of our country

286
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,120
don't like him and they're doing their

287
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,759
best to drown out his voice but that's

288
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,440
very different from a violent threat of

289
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,200
censorship from the state and that's

290
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,360
what we study that's what i study are

291
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,680
these you know what is the state doing

292
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,039
that's kind of paramount for for me yeah

293
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,559
and that's true because in the

294
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,399
marketplace of ideas there could be a

295
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,639
company that springs up that gives alex

296
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,399
jones a platform and

297
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,199
the united states is not going to

298
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,879
prevent those companies from functioning

299
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,200
of course there's uh from a

300
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,320
technological tech from a technology

301
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,360
perspective

302
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,680
there is uh aws removing parlor from the

303
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,839
platform and gets a little weird

304
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,519
you know as you get closer and closer to

305
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,120
the computer infrastructure because then

306
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,078
you get closer and closer to the state

307
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,959
actually

308
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,278
the

309
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,359
the more you get to the infrastructure

310
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,360
that's usually managed by the state the

311
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,240
closer it gets to the control of the

312
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,720
state

313
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,480
i would argue aws is pretty damn close

314
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,920
to infrastructure that's kind of

315
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,320
controlled by the state if you

316
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,958
especially look at other nations

317
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,760
uh china russia

318
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,278
there's uh i don't know who runs the

319
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,519
compute infrastructure for russia and

320
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,120
china but i bet the state has complete

321
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,480
oversight over that

322
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,480
and so

323
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,320
that level of compute infrastructure

324
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,639
having control

325
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,040
about which social networks can and

326
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,039
cannot operate is very uncomfortable to

327
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,278
me but you're right i think

328
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,879
it's good to focus on the obvious

329
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,439
violations of these principles as

330
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:28,159
opposed to the the gray areas of course

331
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,839
the gray areas are fascinating

332
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,639
you mentioned hrf

333
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,240
human rights foundation what is it uh

334
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,799
what is its mission

335
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,600
yeah so i've been working for href

336
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:43,439
since 2007 um

337
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,000
we are a charity a non-profit a 501c3

338
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,720
based in new york and our mission is to

339
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,200
promote and protect individual rights

340
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,600
and freedoms in authoritarian societies

341
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,680
around the world so again we we define

342
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,000
about 95 countries as authoritarian

343
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,879
meaning it's either a one-party state or

344
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,799
opposition politicians are outlawed or

345
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,240
persecuted there's no real free speech

346
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,919
there's no press freedom there's no

347
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,600
independent judiciary there really

348
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,039
aren't checks and balances and even

349
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,278
trying to create like a human rights

350
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:14,240
organization or like an environmental

351
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,679
group would be illegal um and the

352
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,639
majority of the world's population lives

353
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,120
in that environment that's very

354
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,039
important you said 53.63

355
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,639
4.3 billion people and i saw you

356
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:27,439
outlined a lot of different um

357
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,039
sources of suffering in the world

358
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,760
and then you sort of put

359
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,679
people living under authoritarian

360
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,039
governments as like more than all of

361
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,039
them

362
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,399
i i forget i forget all the examples you

363
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,240
provided but

364
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,078
sure i mean it's uh yeah maybe a

365
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,600
convention if you remember the number of

366
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,359
people who are refugees the number of

367
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
people who suffer from natural disasters

368
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,320
the number of people who live under

369
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,159
abject poverty the number of people who

370
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
don't have access to clean drinking

371
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,958
water all of these are dwarfed by the

372
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,720
number of people who live under

373
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,559
authoritarianism

374
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,680
and yet it's not something that we talk

375
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,679
about a lot

376
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,239
because people are mercantilist and the

377
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,958
powers that be are happy to sacrifice

378
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,278
freedoms and privacy for money we live

379
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,039
in a profit-seeking world

380
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,360
to get evidence of this take a look at

381
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:14,078
the list of sponsors of the upcoming

382
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,440
olympics in in china where the ccp is

383
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,359
currently committing genocide against

384
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,279
the weaker population or look at the

385
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,200
number of people and the famous

386
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,958
investors who went to saudi arabia a

387
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,959
couple months ago for the davos in the

388
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,479
desert i mean ray dalio was there all

389
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,919
kinds of people were there

390
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,440
and or at least they were invited and

391
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,078
they said they were going to go

392
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,639
and this is a government that

393
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,799
at the time was torturing a female

394
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,079
activist who just wanted to drive a car

395
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,078
this is a government that had murdered

396
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,559
jamal khashoggi uh

397
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,078
in a brutal fashion uh just a couple

398
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,759
years earlier

399
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,799
so i mean at the end of the day when

400
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:51,120
when it comes down to brass tacks i mean

401
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,759
you know the powers that be the even the

402
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,879
free countries are led by people um who

403
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,319
are very very happy to sacrifice all

404
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,000
these pretty words about human rights

405
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,639
when it when it comes down to profits

406
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,078
unfortunately so do you think capitalism

407
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,879
that's maybe one of the flaws of

408
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,359
capitalism as it turns a blind eye to

409
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,519
injustices against human nature

410
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,039
against the human rights

411
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,879
like it turns a blind eye to

412
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,799
authoritarian governments

413
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,639
look i think that at the end of the day

414
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,919
like

415
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,959
free trade

416
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,719
is actually really good um and you can

417
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,638
just look at france and germany as an

418
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,720
example of of how like a capitalist

419
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,639
structure would develop if you have two

420
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,680
capitalist actors they're very unlikely

421
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,519
to fight each other there's very

422
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,198
unlikely to be violence right these are

423
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,759
two countries which

424
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,439
basically murdered some large percentage

425
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,720
of each other's male population three

426
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,279
times in a hundred years in three

427
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,399
different wars right and now today war

428
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:46,000
is like unthinkable

429
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,639
and a lot of that is because of

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,278
increased collaboration increased trade

431
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,560
so when you have two capitalist actors

432
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,720
they act

433
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,319
in a very productive way with each other

434
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
um but as soon as you introduce an

435
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,120
authoritarian actor you know all bets

436
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,519
are off so i think what you have is a

437
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,360
conflict between capitalist actors and

438
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,759
authoritarian actors

439
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,800
and at the end of the day people

440
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,039
need to

441
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,479
yes have more than just capitalist

442
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,198
intentions

443
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,639
in in the geopolitical

444
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:18,958
level i'm talking about they need to

445
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,000
actually take a stand for principles

446
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,159
otherwise you have athletes and

447
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,078
businesses and governments that are all

448
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,600
too happy to to do business with the

449
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,278
chinese communist party for example

450
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,240
right now i think that there is a little

451
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,000
more than just kind of the pure um

452
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,120
the pure profit yes

453
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,919
you mentioned what are the signs

454
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,600
that uh the state is an authoritarian

455
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,039
state

456
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,278
how do you know if you're living in the

457
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,958
authoritarian state or when you study

458
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,559
another nation or analyze the behavior

459
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,599
of another nation how do you know that's

460
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:53,439
an authentic authoritarian state

461
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,199
is it as simple as them

462
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,800
having a dictator is it as simple as

463
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:58,399
them as declaring that they don't have a

464
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,159
democracy or is there something more

465
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,120
subtle there's a couple good litmus

466
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,639
tests

467
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,560
one is actually can you have a gay pride

468
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,480
parade

469
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,599
that's a good serious it actually lines

470
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,920
up perfectly it doesn't matter what

471
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,040
religion the dictatorship is yeah they

472
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,958
don't like minor they don't like

473
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,480
minorities and they love to scapegoat

474
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,559
whether it's gays or religious

475
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,560
minorities etc so it lines up pretty

476
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,559
well that's really if you cannot have a

477
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,319
gay pride parade in your country because

478
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,239
you're fearful that you're going to get

479
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,120
the crap kicked out of you probably live

480
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,759
in an authoritarian regime um

481
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,078
i'm sure that it's not just about some

482
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,759
kind of homophobia why is that that's

483
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,838
really interesting because that's right

484
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,240
i'm going through so the fascism

485
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,959
scapegoats minorities there's an other

486
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,120
you create another group and then you

487
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:46,319
yeah i mean uganda is a great example of

488
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,519
this but so is saudi arabia so is china

489
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,120
um i mean

490
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,639
so is cuba i mean these are all regimes

491
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,519
which demonize

492
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,360
the you know lgbt communities

493
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,839
it's interesting because maybe you can

494
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,680
correct me but from my very distant

495
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,240
outsider perspective

496
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,239
uh the

497
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:08,720
sort of the way that uh certain

498
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
authoritarian governments speak about uh

499
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,519
gay people

500
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,599
is it's almost like

501
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,759
what is it um

502
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,240
we don't have gay people in our country

503
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,798
kind of idea as opposed to scapegoating

504
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,798
scapegoating which is like

505
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,400
well denial is the most powerful form of

506
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,959
demonization i mean this is what the

507
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,759
iranian dictatorship does

508
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,279
a few years ago when ahmadinejad who was

509
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,798
who was then sort of the de facto later

510
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,319
he came to columbia university and he

511
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,839
tried to give a speech which you can

512
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,079
look up and he tried to claim that there

513
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,079
were no gays in iran and that's the most

514
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,918
powerful form of demonization is trying

515
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:45,359
to just wipe out your utter existence

516
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,600
there's other good litmus tests too um

517
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,558
you know for example you you can think

518
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,918
about comedy um can you make money

519
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,079
making fun of your government on

520
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,160
television if you cannot you live in a

521
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,399
dictatorship most likely i mean it's

522
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,000
shocking to people that i work with

523
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,720
who live in dictatorships when i tell

524
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,558
them that not only are comedians

525
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,079
uh able to safely make fun of our

526
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,240
government but they get paid very well

527
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,000
to do so that's a hallmark of a free

528
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,519
society so that's another good litmus

529
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,038
test

530
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,119
hear that tim dillon you should go to

531
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:17,519
north korea check it out yeah and look

532
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,798
there are tons of flaws with democracies

533
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,240
these are really good tests by the way

534
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,240
the united states is a deeply flawed

535
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,038
country in many ways our prison system

536
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,919
is a disaster um there's you know a

537
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,679
horrible war on drugs we committed a

538
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,520
grievous uh

539
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,280
crime in my opinion by invading iraq

540
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,599
like we did a lot of

541
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,480
problematic things but our core

542
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:41,359
architecture is still an open society um

543
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,919
the people who criticize the us the most

544
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,879
usually live within it

545
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,400
and

546
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,640
if they were to move to a different

547
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,240
country and try to use that criticism

548
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,919
against their new rulers they wouldn't

549
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,000
fare so well so whether it's chomsky

550
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,919
or whomever if they were to go to cuba

551
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,679
and live in cuba and try to criticize

552
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,038
cuba like they do america it wouldn't

553
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,640
last very long

554
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,240
so i think what's important to

555
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,320
distinguish between

556
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,919
open societies and closed ones or like

557
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,319
like free societies and authoritarian

558
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,160
regimes it doesn't mean that your

559
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,038
government's going to be good all the

560
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,960
time

561
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,119
what it means is that the citizens have

562
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,960
a way to push for reform have a way to

563
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,119
hold the rulers accountable so even if

564
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,038
you don't like what the u.s government

565
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,719
does whether it was under biden or trump

566
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,038
or obama or bush

567
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,200
we can rotate them through voting and we

568
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,279
have an independent supreme court

569
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,440
that rotates over time and we have

570
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,119
people that we can elect directly to

571
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,679
serve our interests and then there's

572
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,439
like a free press and there's lobbyists

573
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,000
and all kinds of people that jostle for

574
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,558
power so there's a separation of powers

575
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,640
and i like to think about a free society

576
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,879
really as like at the bottom

577
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,400
of the foundation of the pyramid really

578
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,240
would be free speech

579
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,320
and then you would have civil society

580
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,240
like for example um human rights

581
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,240
organizations environmental groups stamp

582
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,359
collectors athletes any groups that come

583
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,359
together you know beyond the

584
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,798
government's sort of strict instruction

585
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,639
and then on top of that in the third

586
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,558
level you have separation of powers

587
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,840
again what i'm describing

588
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,158
so authoritarian regimes don't really

589
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,678
have any of these layers to them right

590
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,600
and then at the top

591
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,640
then you put elections but the elections

592
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,719
are meaningless if you don't have the

593
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,200
foundation below every dictator gets

594
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,038
elected kim jong-un gets elected he's

595
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,519
the only person on the ballot

596
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,599
every dictator from hitler to chavez

597
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,839
they all got elected elections on their

598
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,678
own mean literally nothing you have to

599
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,599
have these other layers beneath to

600
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,798
actually be an open and free society i

601
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,279
think it's very important for people to

602
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,759
understand

603
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,440
although hitler in an interesting way at

604
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,679
a certain point just said i'm going to

605
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,279
be a ruler forever which is interesting

606
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,679
the there's an important switch that

607
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,599
happens when you as opposed to having a

608
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,759
facade of elections you even you just

609
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,199
put that aside and saying basically like

610
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,038
we're not even doing this yeah there's

611
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,720
like a ladder that you climb the

612
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,960
election and you pull the ladder up and

613
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,400
then no one else can climb up this sadly

614
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,640
it happened in egypt and it was quite

615
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,960
predictable after mubarak was ousted

616
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,840
after the arab spring you know morsi

617
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,279
came in and it looked like you know the

618
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,759
muslim brotherhood was not really going

619
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,038
to be very democratic um but it didn't

620
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,558
really matter because then the military

621
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,798
came back and now we have cece who's

622
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,399
even worse than mubarak so

623
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,240
a lot of times in these regimes

624
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,080
unfortunately it's very difficult for

625
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,919
people to build that democratic society

626
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,599
afterwards um

627
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,038
some people have told me that when you

628
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,319
live in a totalitarian or an

629
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:27,919
authoritarian regime it's kind of like a

630
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,798
political desert what grows in the

631
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,799
desert scorpions and cacti right so

632
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,038
basically people with very extreme views

633
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:37,119
because you as an authoritarian ruler

634
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,879
your best method for control is to get

635
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,558
rid of the moderates you have to crush

636
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,320
the moderates that's very important you

637
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,399
want to have the only opposition to you

638
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,399
be extremists that way when you go and

639
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,919
have negotiations with the united states

640
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,759
you can kind of hold up the terrorists

641
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,440
or whomever the extremists and say it's

642
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,879
either us or them right and then the

643
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,880
realists who run the us government are

644
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,159
going to choose you and that's why one

645
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,000
of the reasons why the u.s government

646
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,480
has supported so many dictators around

647
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,759
the world over the last few decades

648
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,480
do you think

649
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,720
authoritarian systems emerge naturally

650
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,919
like that's the natural state of things

651
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,079
if you take

652
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,759
if you incorporate what human nature is

653
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,399
will there go is there always going to

654
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,480
be

655
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,320
corrupt people that rise to the top and

656
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,558
we almost have to um

657
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,000
construct systems that protect us

658
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:21,599
against ourselves

659
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
kind of thing

660
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,798
another way to ask that um

661
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,599
is

662
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:30,558
what kind of systems protect

663
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,879
us from our own human nature

664
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,759
we started with authoritarianism or

665
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,799
autocracy right ruled by one or or a

666
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,599
small group

667
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:42,079
oligarchy and all humans lived under

668
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:44,319
this structure for you know the the

669
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,319
virtual you know bulk of all human

670
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:49,038
existence only until pretty recently did

671
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,200
we start having actual democracy uh the

672
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,000
idea that we should be ruled by rules

673
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,798
not by rulers very powerful

674
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,119
invented in many places across the world

675
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,798
western africa had this idea and so did

676
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,479
the ancient greeks

677
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,158
and they started to implement it

678
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,240
although as most know we didn't have

679
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,919
full democracy for a long long time

680
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,319
because it was only property owners or

681
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,200
only men only per people of a certain

682
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,359
race

683
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,679
but this idea that that we can like

684
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,319
rotate our rulers and that we could be

685
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,080
ruled by rules is extremely powerful and

686
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,558
it really like for me

687
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,639
the ideas behind this um i think

688
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,399
unlocked a lot of the industrial

689
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,759
revolution these small personal freedoms

690
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,600
that were allowed in some countries but

691
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,038
not others and they unlocked a lot of

692
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,399
the scientific innovation over the last

693
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,240
few hundred years

694
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,840
um and to me there's like a really

695
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,159
straight line between like scientific

696
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:41,278
inquiry free speech freedoms and then

697
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:44,480
more prosperity and more effectiveness

698
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:46,960
as a civilization so i i think that

699
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,599
democracy you know ruled by the people

700
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,600
is definitely an upgrade from autocracy

701
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,158
or oligarchy you know which would be

702
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,199
rule by by one or a rule by a small

703
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,960
group

704
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,319
and i think that the the democratic

705
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,919
revolution

706
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:01,038
has been an incredible thing for our

707
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,880
world

708
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,640
and it's it's you know you could do half

709
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,240
class full half class empty the half

710
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,919
class full is that almost half the world

711
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,640
lives under democracy like that that's

712
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,559
an incredible achievement

713
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,480
but just under half

714
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,558
yeah just under half so

715
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,720
uh but that's billions of people is

716
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,960
billions of people and if you look at

717
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,519
the progress of things it's getting

718
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,480
better and better and better i mean if

719
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:29,759
you know yeah we're a little bit of a um

720
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,200
stalemate here uh democracy's really

721
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:35,200
blossomed uh between world war ii and

722
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,759
the year 2000 especially in the 80s and

723
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,558
90s you had an incredible

724
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:42,319
wave of fault you know where many many

725
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,399
authoritarian regimes fell and were

726
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,960
replaced by democracies i think around

727
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,200
20 2015 the

728
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,159
the acceleration kind of

729
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,240
came to a standstill a little bit um

730
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,200
there's some good news in some countries

731
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,880
and there's bad news in others um like

732
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,960
in the last 10 years you've had for

733
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,320
example the philippines has gone

734
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,240
backwards um thailand has come backwards

735
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,759
bangladesh has gone backwards turkey has

736
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,759
gone backwards that's that's like a half

737
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,200
billion people right there so you've had

738
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,319
some positives

739
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,720
um

740
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,798
like you know there was positive

741
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,120
movement forward in armenia malaysia

742
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,759
some other countries um but we're kind

743
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,678
of at a stalemate right now and

744
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,919
what most people fear them

745
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,519
about where we are right now

746
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,038
who i respect

747
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,038
is what does the digital transformation

748
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:34,240
of the world do to this like progress of

749
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,798
democracy uh or of open societies and

750
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,679
and that's what concerns me the most oh

751
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,879
interesting so i've and we'll talk about

752
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,038
well one of the most fascinating

753
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,640
technologies which is bitcoin how it can

754
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:48,798
help but

755
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,799
i have a sense that technology like most

756
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,798
technological innovations will give

757
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,000
power to the individuals

758
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:55,200
we'll give

759
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,679
will

760
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,200
fight fight authoritarian governments

761
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,880
supposed to give more power to

762
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,600
authoritarian governments but your sense

763
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,799
is there's ways to give

764
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:09,199
for technology to be utilized as a tool

765
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:12,639
for the abuse of the citizenry i've seen

766
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,319
both in my work at href i started by

767
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,400
helping to put together backpacks with

768
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,720
foreign information that we sent to the

769
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,360
cuban underground library movement so in

770
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,558
cuba you know to own a book at the time

771
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,158
you had to have the government's

772
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,200
permission there's very little internet

773
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,360
penetration okay so we would send in

774
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,600
movies you know v for vendetta dubbed

775
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,918
into spanish and people would sit inside

776
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,359
their homes yeah and they'd watch it and

777
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,038
they would answer questions with each

778
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,558
other it was very powerful and then

779
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,640
after that i worked with people inside

780
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,000
north korea we would send in flash

781
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,679
drives we have this program called flash

782
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,839
drives for freedom we've sent over a

783
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,840
hundred thousand flash drives

784
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,759
in our work into north korea a country

785
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,439
of about 25 million people that's a lot

786
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:52,960
it's a big big difference that's you

787
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,519
know many many millions of hours of

788
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,840
films books movies etc so i've seen the

789
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,079
power that technology can have where you

790
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,678
know in the 60s and 70s

791
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,199
you know to get to break an information

792
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,840
blockade you had to like send in crates

793
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,200
of books into a communist country so now

794
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:09,199
all of a sudden you can send the entire

795
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,360
contents of what was once the library of

796
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,200
alexandria on something the size of your

797
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,558
thumbnail like that's remarkable so

798
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,159
obviously i've seen the positives of

799
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,558
technology we'll certainly get into

800
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,039
bitcoin but i'm you know very concerned

801
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,200
about essentially big data analysis like

802
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,839
or what people call ai or general you

803
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,200
know specific specific kinds of ai like

804
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,439
very concerning i think these are very

805
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,840
authoritarian i mean it's very hard to

806
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,600
make a case that ai

807
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,759
is going to be good for human rights

808
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,519
very difficult in my opinion

809
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,319
it may be good for health it may be good

810
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,480
for

811
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,879
our efforts to protect the planet it may

812
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,240
be good for a lot of scientific things

813
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,559
i find it very hard to believe it'll be

814
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,720
good for civil liberties oh that's fun

815
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,359
this is fun because i disagree

816
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,839
uh give me your examples

817
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,359
i'm serious what what ai applications

818
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,439
will improve civilization

819
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,599
i thought you meant

820
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,200
examples of stuff that's already out

821
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,519
there because i can give you examples

822
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,120
that for for example the kind of things

823
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,599
that i would like to work on but also

824
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,519
the kind of things i'm hoping to see

825
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,759
which is

826
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:15,359
ai could be used by

827
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,200
centralized powers by governments by big

828
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,719
organizations like facebook and twitter

829
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,440
and so on

830
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:26,640
to collect data about people right right

831
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,480
but i believe there's a huge hunger

832
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,278
among people

833
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,519
to have control over their own data

834
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,000
so instead you can have

835
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,000
ai that's distributed where people have

836
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,119
complete ownership of their little ai

837
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,038
systems

838
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:44,158
so like the kind of stuff that i would

839
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,960
like to build or like to see to be built

840
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,240
is

841
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,360
you could think of it as personal

842
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
assistance

843
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,278
or

844
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,599
ai that's owned by you

845
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,440
and you get to give it out you have

846
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,519
complete control over all of your data

847
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,519
you have complete control over

848
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,119
everything that's uh

849
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,599
learnable about your day-to-day

850
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,839
experiences that could be useful in this

851
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,759
in the market of um

852
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,158
goods and ideas and all those kinds of

853
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,240
things so it has to do with

854
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,480
so you i know you talk about the

855
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,720
surveillance which is very interesting

856
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,839
it's who gets to have control of the

857
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,919
data and i think i i believe there's a

858
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:25,119
lot of hunger

859
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,919
in among regular people

860
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,359
to have control over their data

861
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,520
such that

862
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,359
if you want to create a business you

863
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,759
have a lot of money to be made from a

864
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:37,759
capitalist perspective by providing

865
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,480
products that let people control their

866
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,480
data where you have no control

867
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,640
it sounds like to me you're describing

868
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,038
encryption or at least the the ability

869
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,759
to encrypt the ability to use

870
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:53,038
uh digital keys to secure your property

871
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,879
and i that to me is a very powerful uh

872
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,879
individual right force for individual

873
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,640
rights very powerful and it's what's

874
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,000
what animates bitcoin ultimately which

875
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,919
we'll get into

876
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,839
but for me at least the way i look at it

877
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,038
today in 2021

878
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,639
the threat from big data analysis

879
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,879
used by governments and authoritarian

880
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,480
regimes is terrifying i mean to actually

881
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,240
see what the chinese communist party is

882
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,120
doing where they have hundreds of

883
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,278
millions of cameras overseeing society

884
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,398
cameras that can tell who's a uyghur and

885
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,398
who's ahan

886
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,639
that to me is terrifying and and

887
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,719
everything is sorted instantly there are

888
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,520
there are super computers that are built

889
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,839
in urumqi in xinjiang for this explicit

890
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,918
purpose and you know it allows the

891
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,918
government to quickly sort and basically

892
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,679
commit genocide a lot faster and it's

893
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,919
really scary so

894
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,320
i do agree and i've seen personally how

895
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,038
powerful technology can be as a force

896
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,960
for freedom um but i'm i'm very very

897
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,640
worried about big data analysis in the

898
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,038
hands of governments see that's funny

899
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,200
because i i tend to see governments as

900
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:54,960
ultimately incompetent in the space of

901
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,600
technology to where there will always be

902
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,919
lagging behind so you look at what the

903
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:02,158
chinese surveillance systems are doing

904
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,840
i i believe when once you start getting

905
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,760
bad

906
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:06,558
enough that

907
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:08,240
like

908
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:11,038
technologies would be created to resist

909
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,278
that so to mess with it from from the

910
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,440
hacker community but also from the

911
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:16,640
individual community so surveillance is

912
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,000
actually very difficult from a

913
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,600
centralized perspective to detect uh you

914
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,119
know to collect data about you to detect

915
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,199
everything you are because you can spoof

916
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,879
a lot of that information so i believe

917
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,038
you can put power in the hands of the

918
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,600
citizens to sort of

919
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:34,158
feed the government fake data to confuse

920
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,839
it at a mass scale to where

921
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,240
it will make their surveillance less

922
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,398
effective but that okay that could be

923
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,319
very sort of hopeful yeah i mean the

924
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,479
practical application in xinjiang which

925
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,918
is a territory the size of alaska

926
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,278
where a large percentage of the

927
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,159
population has been put into prison

928
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,000
camps

929
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,399
um the current issue of the new yorker

930
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,240
has an absolutely harrowing uh essay

931
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:55,119
that that tells the story of one such

932
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,558
woman

933
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,719
who in i believe 20 2017 got sucked into

934
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,639
one of these camps and it took her a

935
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,159
year or more to get out um and and she's

936
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,559
talking about how

937
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,399
in each home in xinjiang each home has a

938
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:11,839
qr code on it that the police can scan

939
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:13,199
and get like a quick instant download of

940
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,678
who lives there

941
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,200
each car has you know like a scannable

942
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,600
code

943
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,759
every every single person has their dna

944
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,079
taken and the dna is being sifted

945
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,440
through and analyzed by algorithms so

946
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,079
this is like the chinese government's

947
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,038
laboratory for how can we use technology

948
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,119
to

949
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,319
oppress a sort of like digital leninism

950
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,918
and that to me is one of the biggest uh

951
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,918
risks in our world today and it's not

952
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,159
talked about enough that's interesting

953
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,320
so technologies basically

954
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,320
enables the automation of oppression

955
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,879
absolutely so like

956
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:49,439
but to define technology

957
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,399
big data analysis and you know maybe

958
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,000
specific ai etc does but encryption

959
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:55,119
allows us to fight back it's very

960
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,038
important people understand we have

961
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,879
tools to fight back

962
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,240
you know big brother

963
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,559
can only grow

964
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,038
if it can feed on your data if it can't

965
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:08,079
get your data it can't grow so you have

966
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:10,558
to willingly give up stuff to the cloud

967
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:12,639
um for this monster to grow we can we

968
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,960
can we can like make the monster hungry

969
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,080
and shrink it if we give it less data

970
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,600
and i think that's where i would agree

971
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,918
with you in terms of like wanting to

972
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,959
empower people to be able to do stuff on

973
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,640
their own terms in a sovereign way and

974
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,159
yeah maybe you're you're kind of

975
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,679
thinking like the personal assistant who

976
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,679
helps out tony stark or something like

977
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,038
that and and that's yeah as long as

978
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,559
there's no back doors and that's a

979
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,798
sovereign thing that you've popped up

980
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:38,240
and created and you have the keys to

981
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,639
absolutely but practically speaking if

982
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,839
we're talking about the world today as

983
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,440
is

984
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,439
we need to be concerned about the way

985
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,200
that authoritarian regimes are using big

986
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,798
data analysis and they're going to buy

987
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,319
the software and this equipment from the

988
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,319
chinese government they're already doing

989
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,000
it street level surveillance has already

990
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:55,918
been purchased by governments everywhere

991
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,240
from latin america to sub-saharan africa

992
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,320
to the heart of europe um there's been

993
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,599
huge scandals in britain over their

994
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,720
purchase of chinese surveillance

995
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,639
technology

996
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,839
um part of the chinese government's belt

997
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,000
and road campaign which is basically to

998
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,159
build the infrastructure of this century

999
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,719
and to be in control of it is this idea

1000
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,440
part of that idea is to is to ship out

1001
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,199
and install surveillance technology

1002
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,960
both at the telecom level and at the

1003
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,799
surveillance level across dozens of

1004
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,559
countries around the world and have that

1005
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,399
back door right there's this national

1006
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,398
security law in china which states that

1007
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,559
like companies that are chinese which

1008
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:32,319
are abroad are mandated to send data

1009
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,000
back to beijing right so they're

1010
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,399
building this like huge global

1011
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,320
surveillance state and again not talked

1012
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,319
about enough you should go google and

1013
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,679
research the belt and road i think it's

1014
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,679
very important that we confront this

1015
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,119
yeah i'm really glad you're talking

1016
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,639
about it because it's probably important

1017
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:53,838
to understand i'm also hopeful that

1018
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,159
as people get educated about

1019
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:58,880
how much their data when collected

1020
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,880
unencrypted but in general

1021
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,880
can be used to harm them

1022
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,280
i mean it's almost like an education i

1023
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,280
feel like

1024
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,039
if you know

1025
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,039
it's a double-edged sword because i feel

1026
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,480
like people become fearful too easily

1027
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,480
and that actually has a very negative

1028
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,480
effect on the quality of life

1029
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,159
in some sense you want to have tools

1030
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,639
that allow you to live freely as opposed

1031
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,799
to living fear if you live in fear

1032
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,960
it's not a good way to live so it's a

1033
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,960
it's a balance um it's a free society

1034
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,079
versus a fear society yeah

1035
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,519
people are

1036
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,519
it's all about the trade-offs you make

1037
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:34,400
in your daily life like living more

1038
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:37,440
privately with more freedom is

1039
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,240
less convenient you trade freedom and

1040
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,480
privacy for convenience and comfort and

1041
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:45,519
speed absolutely it's an engineering

1042
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,119
decision in everything that you do um

1043
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:50,800
in the west

1044
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,280
we in advanced democracies we have not

1045
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,800
necessarily personally seen

1046
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,720
the results of that trade-off because

1047
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,160
we've we live in these free societies

1048
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,159
that have these checks and balances and

1049
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,598
freedoms but as soon as you step into an

1050
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,199
authoritarian state and you make those

1051
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,720
trade-offs your life you know

1052
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,719
immediately becomes more more

1053
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:09,838
restrictive and and what people are

1054
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:13,439
worried about is that even in advanced

1055
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:15,039
economies market democracies etc

1056
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,000
the people are worried that they might

1057
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:20,639
not survive the the great social

1058
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,960
digital transformation um you know look

1059
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:24,319
at what the nsa is capable of doing i

1060
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,199
mean for now

1061
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,720
it's

1062
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,199
not that big of a problem because we

1063
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,519
still have free speech um but it's

1064
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,759
deeply concerning what snowden revealed

1065
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,759
and it's a nice reminder

1066
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,920
that we need to be focused on on privacy

1067
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,320
and encryption and on helping users

1068
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,760
become more more sovereign regardless of

1069
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,079
where you live it's kind of like a

1070
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,520
crutch to live in a free society like

1071
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,440
you know it's almost like a free lunch

1072
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,719
in a way um

1073
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,639
you're not going to be sent to a prison

1074
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,480
camp because of the color of your skin

1075
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,838
or your beliefs or what you say about

1076
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,320
the government

1077
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:58,159
and you're very lucky again most people

1078
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,400
do live in a society where you you can

1079
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,639
be persecuted for those things

1080
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,720
and i feel like especially in america we

1081
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,838
we forget that we're we're distanced

1082
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:10,959
from that really strong reality you know

1083
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:12,960
on the topic of snowden and then nsa

1084
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,880
what should we be thinking about because

1085
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,880
that feels like a already an outdated

1086
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,280
set of conversations because of the

1087
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,039
information we've gotten from the past

1088
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,400
it feels like everything's gotten quiet

1089
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,880
now in terms of how much we actually

1090
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,920
know about the hugely important i i

1091
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,519
think the two lessons from snowden are a

1092
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,760
the the patriot act and the war on

1093
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:34,000
terror and mass surveillance are

1094
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,040
not necessary for our democracy and for

1095
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,639
our freedoms um this was a false choice

1096
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,599
we never had to sacrifice them to be

1097
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,838
safer

1098
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,039
um and and we've seen that government

1099
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:44,400
has spent hundreds and hundreds of

1100
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,400
millions of dollars on these like

1101
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,720
surveillance programs that you can read

1102
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,720
about and amounted to very little except

1103
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,838
for tremendous bureaucratic waste and

1104
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:54,000
you know

1105
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,078
you know erosion of our freedoms

1106
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,119
but at the same time we need to practice

1107
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:01,599
more privacy and the dramatic increase

1108
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,000
in the usage of signal for example has

1109
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,599
been really really great to see it's

1110
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,119
it's fantastic that tens of millions of

1111
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,079
people are downloading signal and using

1112
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,079
it um you should try to be onboarding

1113
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,920
more and more of your conversations onto

1114
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,079
signal for example where governments

1115
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,920
can't see what you're saying

1116
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,760
maybe they can see the metadata maybe

1117
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,920
they can see that you sent your phone

1118
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,760
number sent a message to someone else's

1119
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,000
phone number at this time but they can't

1120
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,599
see what's inside so using encryption in

1121
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,440
your life is very very important that's

1122
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,240
a good starting point i would say that's

1123
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,159
kind of step a

1124
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:37,358
the ideas of democracy

1125
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,399
the ideas of the balance of power

1126
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,239
um

1127
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,639
the all the ideas that we were talking

1128
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:44,879
about the constructs

1129
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:47,519
were inventions i wonder if there's

1130
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,800
other inventions that will allow us to

1131
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,920
sort of

1132
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,280
not engage not give governments or any

1133
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,680
centralized institutions so much power

1134
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,119
like why why do citizens have to use

1135
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:00,960
signal

1136
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,119
why because that's an effort you have to

1137
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,639
be because you have to like understand

1138
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,000
exactly why so that's a nice little

1139
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:07,358
solution for a particular set of

1140
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,199
problems but like there's a million

1141
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:11,759
other ways that data i'm sure

1142
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,118
is being collected constantly if we

1143
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,760
don't create

1144
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,599
a system that

1145
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,680
prevents the establishments of these

1146
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,280
centralized powers then we'll always

1147
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:22,799
have this problem yeah i think we can

1148
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,560
keep it simple for the purposes of this

1149
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,160
conversation you have politics

1150
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,759
information and money those are the

1151
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,559
three things i would encourage us to

1152
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,720
focus on in politics yes someone

1153
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,358
invented democracy i mean whether it was

1154
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:37,199
the greeks um the west africans or many

1155
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,639
others around the world around the same

1156
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,118
time invented this idea that we should

1157
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,639
be ruled by uh rules and not by rulers

1158
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,760
right um

1159
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,759
and that has

1160
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,800
evolved dramatically right and now you

1161
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,160
and then you have information

1162
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,720
information also used to be highly

1163
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:52,799
centralized right you know think about

1164
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,039
how rich you had to be to gain access to

1165
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,720
a library before the printing press or

1166
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,880
you know how much money you had to have

1167
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,879
or how close to the king or the you know

1168
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,440
feudal lord you had to be to be able to

1169
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,800
have that ability but now

1170
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,240
you know

1171
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,920
the majority of the world billions of

1172
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,118
people have access to all information in

1173
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,480
their pocket and they can set up an

1174
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,440
account on social media and get their

1175
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,280
word out so not only politics but

1176
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,960
information has been dramatically

1177
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,760
decentralized

1178
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,159
and i would say that encrypted messaging

1179
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,480
is kind of a corollary to that second

1180
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:26,639
innovation and as much as now people are

1181
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,440
like more effortlessly like signal is a

1182
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:31,279
lot easier to use than pgp for example

1183
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,599
they're more easily able to practice

1184
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,480
privacy when it comes to having private

1185
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,480
messages globally um these are all good

1186
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,079
things and we need to keep pushing and i

1187
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,400
think money is like

1188
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,000
honestly maybe the most important piece

1189
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,960
and that's why i spent so much time

1190
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,159
thinking about bitcoin okay so

1191
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,039
politics information money yes let's

1192
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:55,199
talk about money what is money and why

1193
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,318
is it important to think about

1194
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,919
in the context of human rights

1195
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:00,960
i have witnessed

1196
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,358
money

1197
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,000
be

1198
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:05,920
peripheralized

1199
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
take it has taken a back seat in the

1200
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,240
human rights conversation the idea of

1201
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,400
currency who makes the money who makes

1202
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,559
the rules who issues it who sets the

1203
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,318
interest rates all these things

1204
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,759
it is not on the menu of human rights

1205
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:19,199
activists if you just do like a

1206
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,720
systematic study of like the human

1207
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,000
rights discourse over the last several

1208
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,000
decades

1209
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,838
money is not there it's also not really

1210
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,119
taught in schools like children don't

1211
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:29,599
really learn about money where does it

1212
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,079
come from it's it's kind of hidden from

1213
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,440
from our from a lot of our discourse

1214
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:35,119
um

1215
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,280
only really when i got into bitcoin did

1216
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,960
i start learning more about money

1217
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,480
um i spent 10 years at the human rights

1218
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,318
foundation

1219
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,000
and we we did all kinds of programs

1220
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:45,679
around the world we convened oslo

1221
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,920
freedom forums in different places and i

1222
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,440
got to meet hundreds of dissidents and

1223
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,680
very rarely did they ever speak about

1224
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,519
currency or bank accounts or moving

1225
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,598
money from one place to another

1226
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,519
but when i started asking them they

1227
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,200
always had amazing stories about money

1228
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:02,480
always i mean my friend ivan muire who

1229
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,239
started the this flag movement in

1230
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,480
zimbabwe which ended up toppling robert

1231
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,759
mugabe when i asked him to come to san

1232
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,159
francisco to give a talk about

1233
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,440
hyperinflation which he lived through

1234
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:12,480
he said no one's ever asked me to do

1235
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,079
that before

1236
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,280
but i'll come and he came this was about

1237
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,560
three years ago

1238
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,000
and the first thing he did when he got

1239
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:19,920
on the stage is he opened up a shirt and

1240
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,639
he brought out a necklace that had the

1241
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,039
1980 zimbabwean dollar on it and he said

1242
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,799
we in the activist community wear this

1243
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,480
as a symbol of where our country used to

1244
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,640
be because the zimbabwean dollar used to

1245
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,559
be worth two british pounds and then of

1246
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:34,318
course over the next

1247
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:36,880
two and a half decades of economic

1248
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,400
mismanagement and corruption by mugabe

1249
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,599
it got inflated out of existence right

1250
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,358
you've seen those like hundred trillion

1251
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,039
dollar zimbabwean notes

1252
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,199
um so he had to live through that which

1253
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:47,358
was terrible and crushing

1254
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,480
but he you know is an expert on money if

1255
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,799
you actually talk to human rights

1256
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,400
activists about money they know a lot

1257
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,039
about money they're just not usually

1258
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,838
asked to talk about it so you know for

1259
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,639
me

1260
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,639
um money you know when i study money or

1261
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:02,639
look at money it's really about control

1262
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:04,480
you know who who's creating it and how

1263
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,879
much does the population know about the

1264
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,639
creation of that money and when it comes

1265
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,440
to bitcoin it's really the people's

1266
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:14,000
money like there is no shadowy force in

1267
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,440
charge of it we all know the rules we

1268
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,599
all know how it's going to get minted

1269
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,960
and how it's going to get printed and

1270
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:21,039
you know that information is out there

1271
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,960
for everybody to see and there's no like

1272
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:25,039
special group of rules for one group of

1273
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,440
people or another group

1274
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,920
you know a billionaire and a refugee are

1275
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,960
the same in the eyes of the protocol

1276
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,720
this is a rather revolutionary concept

1277
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,480
and in the same way that

1278
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,639
democracy allowed us to decentralize

1279
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,318
politics and have checks and balances

1280
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,400
and in the same way that the internet is

1281
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,559
this culmination of technologies that

1282
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,880
allowed us to decentralize information

1283
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:49,759
access to and control over it

1284
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,920
bitcoin you know decentralizes money i

1285
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,680
mean no longer again is there one group

1286
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,760
of people who can just change it

1287
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:57,838
arbitrarily we're all in the same

1288
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,880
playing field and i think that is a

1289
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,880
tremendous innovation

1290
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,680
you know from one perspective money and

1291
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,838
inflation hyperinflation is a kind of

1292
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,358
symptom of

1293
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,519
corruption as opposed to the core of the

1294
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,838
corruption

1295
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,318
and at this at the flip side in terms of

1296
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,358
resisting the corruption resisting the

1297
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,159
abuse

1298
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:22,719
of human rights

1299
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,639
it's interesting to think that

1300
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:25,358
fighting inflation

1301
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:26,879
or

1302
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,199
funny uh

1303
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,680
fighting the mismanagement of the money

1304
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,679
supply

1305
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:35,679
uh is a way to fight back

1306
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:37,919
authoritarianism or to fight

1307
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:39,039
authoritarianism

1308
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,800
and

1309
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,199
that's an interesting concept that i

1310
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,039
think was introduced to me by just

1311
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,559
plugging myself in intellectually into

1312
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,400
the bitcoin community but also just

1313
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:50,639
cryptocurrency in general

1314
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,960
it's it's to like

1315
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,639
it's not that money

1316
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,280
is a symptom

1317
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:58,639
you know money is a tool to fight back

1318
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,079
too

1319
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:02,000
absolutely

1320
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,760
so in in what way

1321
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,880
can bitcoin be used to um

1322
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,640
to fight authoritarianism

1323
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,640
not just in the united states but all of

1324
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:15,519
those 53 percent that you're referring

1325
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:17,358
to what how can bitcoin help so we

1326
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:20,079
talked about authoritarianism

1327
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,039
we talked about the surveillance state

1328
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,359
to me

1329
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,759
bitcoin has two kind of key mechanisms

1330
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:28,559
through which it can help us

1331
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,640
number one uh it's a sovereign savings

1332
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,838
account it's debasement proof meaning

1333
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:33,519
the government cannot print more

1334
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:35,199
whenever they want

1335
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:37,679
this is very very different from fiat

1336
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:40,078
currency which by its very name its very

1337
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,679
nature can be issued on sort of demand

1338
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,000
right by the rulers

1339
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:46,639
and while i live in a country where the

1340
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,800
rulers do a reasonable job of managing

1341
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:51,440
the money most people aren't so lucky so

1342
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,720
only 13 percent of humans in the world

1343
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,800
live in a country that's a liberal

1344
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:57,118
democracy with property rights and has

1345
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,039
what we call a reserve currency meaning

1346
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,480
a currency so stable and desirable that

1347
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,480
other countries save in it at the

1348
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,159
central bank level right you basically

1349
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,000
have the us

1350
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:09,679
the uk australia switzerland the euro

1351
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,119
and canada i mean those are like reserve

1352
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:12,559
currencies and these are liberal

1353
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,160
democracies where people have reasonable

1354
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,400
guarantees over property rights

1355
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,559
everybody else either lives under like a

1356
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,480
weaker currency or an authoritarian

1357
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,719
regime that's 87 of the world's

1358
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,159
population almost 7 billion people so

1359
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,159
for them

1360
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,519
a sovereign savings account that's

1361
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:30,239
permissionless meaning you don't have to

1362
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,838
have id to use it is a big big deal and

1363
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:34,719
a lot of people talk about zimbabwe or

1364
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:36,400
venezuela as some like isolated cases oh

1365
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,799
well you know hyperinflation only

1366
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,318
happens in in those two countries

1367
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,359
um i actually did some research into

1368
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:44,318
this and

1369
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:46,480
there's about one point uh

1370
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,000
over you know close to 1.3 billion

1371
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,240
people who live under double or triple

1372
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,639
digit inflation this is not an isolated

1373
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:55,838
instance we're talking huge countries

1374
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:56,879
nigeria 200 million people 15 inflation

1375
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:59,279
turkey

1376
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,559
15 insulation for 100 million people

1377
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,480
argentina 40 inflation for a country 45

1378
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:06,639
million people um so you can go down the

1379
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,519
list there's about 35 countries where

1380
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:11,279
like people's earnings their wages um

1381
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:13,199
are literally disappearing in front of

1382
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,440
their eyes over a matter of weeks or

1383
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:18,559
months against things like the dollar

1384
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,480
gold real estate right so this is a huge

1385
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:21,920
issue it absolutely is a human rights

1386
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,000
issue for me i mean when it comes to

1387
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,159
your time and energy having control over

1388
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,679
that or having it stolen from you i

1389
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,159
think this is pretty clear

1390
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:33,039
and bitcoin is like an immediate uh

1391
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:35,920
low-cost easily accessible solution for

1392
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:38,400
people and i've learned this not from my

1393
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,720
own assumptions but by talking to people

1394
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,119
by interviewing dozens of people

1395
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:46,959
whether it's in sudan which currently

1396
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,880
has triple digit inflation um or

1397
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,639
people who've escaped from syria who

1398
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,079
have used bitcoin to get their wealth

1399
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:54,558
out of the country and then also to make

1400
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,800
payments back to people inside um or

1401
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,160
venezuela or elsewhere it's very very

1402
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,760
powerful

1403
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,480
i think some very small percentage of

1404
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,240
people who have used have owned bitcoins

1405
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,199
was something like one percent right of

1406
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:06,959
the world

1407
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:08,480
whatever whatever the number is a small

1408
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,880
call it two percent for the purposes of

1409
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,159
our okay about a little under 200

1410
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,000
million people

1411
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:15,519
wow yeah

1412
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
at most right now so if we look at

1413
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:20,480
zimbabwe sudan if we look at small

1414
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,400
percentages of people do you think the

1415
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,079
technology's mature enough because it's

1416
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,880
not just about the idea it's also about

1417
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,640
the implementation of it like you know

1418
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,519
bitcoin

1419
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:34,480
for the most part requires access to

1420
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,639
to the internet yeah and

1421
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,159
what do you think

1422
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:40,400
about

1423
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:42,799
accessibility of this technology now as

1424
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,400
a method of activism in the worst parts

1425
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,160
of the world we often think like all the

1426
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,440
conversations we've had about bitcoin is

1427
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,118
essentially

1428
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,400
middle class like wealthy people

1429
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,480
relative to the

1430
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,920
world they're kind of talking sort of

1431
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,358
investment and high concept ideas then

1432
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,280
there's also the people in the world who

1433
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,199
are suffering who are

1434
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,640
living through hyperinflation they may

1435
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,399
not have a computer or access to the

1436
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:06,960
internet like what how do you think

1437
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,838
bitcoin can help there yeah so again we

1438
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,599
have

1439
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:11,358
one clear use case which is a sovereign

1440
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,119
savings account that you can control

1441
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:15,279
right the other use case is an

1442
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,559
unstoppable payments network this is

1443
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,400
very important for people who live

1444
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,040
behind for example sanctions

1445
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,800
like the us like basically um weaponizes

1446
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,639
the dollar and it like sanctions

1447
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,960
different countries and instead of

1448
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,480
sanctioning like a handful of rulers for

1449
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,559
example which i would support this is

1450
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,760
like a magnitsky or smart sanctions

1451
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,040
sometimes we'll just say we're just

1452
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,960
going to shut off this whole country so

1453
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:37,679
the people suffer cuba or iran are good

1454
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,199
examples average people suffer right so

1455
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,679
people in those two countries i just

1456
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,480
mentioned cuba iran or even palestine

1457
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,480
which is

1458
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,599
also sort of like blockaded by the

1459
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,960
israelis so you have cuba iran palestine

1460
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,720
are three good examples where people

1461
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,800
inside all three of those countries now

1462
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,399
are using bitcoin to do commerce do

1463
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,720
their business send money back

1464
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,559
enforcement sanction resistant sanctions

1465
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,719
resistant it does not get stopped by

1466
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,119
sanctions right um

1467
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,480
and also it's again remittances are

1468
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,760
extortionate i mean the average

1469
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,559
remittance

1470
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,880
you know costs uh has a high fee takes

1471
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,319
several days if your family is in ghana

1472
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,680
or something like that or nigeria and

1473
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:15,838
you live in the united states it can

1474
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,919
take time to use western union um

1475
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:19,119
sometimes you know oh it gets paused it

1476
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,639
gets lost there's issues you have to

1477
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,720
deal with customer service

1478
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:25,279
screw that i mean you know if the person

1479
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:27,598
has a cell phone which increasingly is

1480
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,880
the case i mean by the end of next year

1481
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,720
uh

1482
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,838
more than five or six billion people

1483
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,000
depending on different estimates will

1484
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:37,199
have smartphones basically by the end of

1485
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,838
2022 uh we're talking like the vast

1486
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,039
majority of humans will have access to

1487
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:43,838
smartphones they can all have sovereign

1488
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:47,039
bitcoin wallets and there's even ways to

1489
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:48,799
access bitcoin without the internet um

1490
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:50,558
but i mean we can get into that there's

1491
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,400
like hardware wallets and so on what do

1492
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:55,200
you mean by sovereign

1493
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,680
uh bitcoin wallet

1494
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,239
you know most users today are using

1495
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,679
bitcoin in a in a custodial manner so

1496
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:02,639
this is kind of like having a bank

1497
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,679
account

1498
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:08,239
um where you have a deposit uh account

1499
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:09,759
at a bank right so you have a claim

1500
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,598
right you go to the bank and they have

1501
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,000
some of your money and you take it out

1502
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:17,119
right with an atm so

1503
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,960
uh what i would call uh non-custodial

1504
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,200
bitcoin use would be similar to

1505
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,599
withdrawing cash from an atm you have it

1506
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:25,279
it's a bear instrument okay so when i

1507
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,960
it's what's called the bearer instrument

1508
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,640
i know i'm so apologize i'm outside this

1509
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,000
community just sounds funny no no yeah

1510
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,400
so like a bear instrument would be like

1511
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,039
a bar gold or yes um

1512
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,119
a banknote or bitcoin that you control

1513
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,400
meaning you have the seed phrase right

1514
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,318
which

1515
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,920
for the listeners essentially is 12 to

1516
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:43,838
24 english words that you write down on

1517
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,200
a piece of paper that's your like

1518
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:46,078
password to get into your bitcoin

1519
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:47,279
account

1520
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,200
and that gives you that bearer

1521
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,800
instrument quality right

1522
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,639
but unfortunately most users uh still

1523
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,960
use bitcoin in a custodial way meaning

1524
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,879
they buy it on coinbase so coinbase

1525
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,679
where something like that you would put

1526
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,680
into into the custodial into the

1527
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,598
category like a bank yeah

1528
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:08,159
and look the good news is you can

1529
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,680
withdraw to your own control and in the

1530
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:11,440
bitcoin community we try to teach this

1531
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:12,480
idea that it's not your keys not your

1532
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,760
coins

1533
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,119
in the same way that if you deposit your

1534
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,280
money at the bank you might not get it

1535
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,920
back i mean it's low likelihood but it's

1536
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,440
but it's very possible same thing in

1537
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,358
bitcoin like if you want to get the full

1538
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,880
experience you want to actually custody

1539
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:26,799
your own bitcoin you want to you want to

1540
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,640
put it whether it's on an open source

1541
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,880
software wallet like the blue wallet is

1542
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:32,799
a good one for people to check out um or

1543
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,318
a hardware wallet like cold card for

1544
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,800
example there's different ways to do

1545
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:39,599
this um but essentially like around the

1546
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,760
world uh people are innovating like

1547
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,039
don't think so low of of your fellow man

1548
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,960
you know what i mean like people are

1549
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,318
able to figure this out you know i get a

1550
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,159
lot of flack from people saying oh

1551
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:49,358
bitcoin's so hard to use i've read this

1552
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:50,960
article in new york times saying this

1553
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:52,880
guy in silicon valley lost all of his

1554
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,880
bitcoin that's because he was a

1555
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,318
and didn't care about it this guy lost

1556
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,318
all this bitcoin because it wasn't worth

1557
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:00,000
much 10 years ago and he you know he

1558
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,079
forgot the password but if you're like

1559
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,358
receiving your remittance from a family

1560
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,359
member you're not going to lose the

1561
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,960
password right and you trust in the

1562
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:09,920
basic intelligence of people to figure

1563
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,559
this out and to innovate and so on and

1564
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,480
figure out we're watching it man

1565
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,800
yeah you know i'm

1566
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,480
it's kind of funny that but people in in

1567
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,760
the united states are not very savvy

1568
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,440
with money

1569
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,200
it's exactly the way you're describing

1570
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,480
it's like when you have very little

1571
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:26,799
money

1572
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,800
you're going to be savvy with money

1573
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,400
you're going to understand exactly the

1574
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,160
mechanisms that work

1575
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,800
that are resistant to the corruption

1576
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:36,159
that's around you i mean i remember

1577
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,240
instead of growing up in the soviet

1578
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:40,078
union

1579
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:42,159
the general bureaucracy and the

1580
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,240
corruption of everything around you you

1581
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:46,078
figure out ways around that you figure

1582
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,000
out ways how to function within that

1583
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,079
kind of system to survive

1584
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,039
under inflation under hyperinflation

1585
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,440
under

1586
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,119
all like basically being unable to trust

1587
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,559
any kind of even the police force and

1588
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,280
all those kinds of things you figure it

1589
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,400
out and that same way perhaps bitcoin

1590
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,480
could be

1591
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,079
all the different ways to store

1592
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,280
and uh gain

1593
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,359
bitcoin

1594
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,960
these mechanisms could be something

1595
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:10,799
that's figured out in the third world as

1596
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,039
opposed to in the oh i mean i mean the

1597
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,960
capital of bitcoin could easily be lagos

1598
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:17,039
and not san francisco yes in terms of

1599
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,358
users in terms of people using it and

1600
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:21,279
again the two use cases as a savings

1601
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,880
account and as an unstoppable payment

1602
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,920
rail these are the two ones that that

1603
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,559
you should really think about this is

1604
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,159
how people are using it today now

1605
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,079
when it comes to

1606
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,639
could it possibly be adopted by like a

1607
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,640
sufficient majority of the population i

1608
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,239
say yes and it's very similar to the way

1609
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:38,798
the mobile phone spread

1610
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:40,399
at the beginning the cell phone was only

1611
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:42,159
for rich people it was only for the

1612
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,480
elite it was huge it didn't work very

1613
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:47,118
well the interface sucked it was clunky

1614
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,880
over time it got smaller and smaller and

1615
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,880
cheaper and cheaper and easier to use

1616
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,640
and easier to use and today everyone

1617
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,798
benefits so you're going to watch a

1618
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:57,118
similar technology upgrade process with

1619
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:59,280
bitcoin already in the last 10 years

1620
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,880
bitcoin has gotten so much easier to use

1621
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,440
i mean there are now mobile wallets that

1622
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,240
are so slick there's one called moon

1623
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,079
m-u-n wallet from a team in argentina

1624
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:10,318
and these these guys created it because

1625
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,559
they saw their own currency devalued

1626
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:14,000
like three times in the last 20 years

1627
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,200
and they've had a hell of a time trying

1628
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,639
to get their money back and forth from

1629
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,199
different countries so they were like

1630
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,719
let's make this easy for people um again

1631
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:22,399
you know this is

1632
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:23,919
this is the people's money this is this

1633
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,400
is something that cannot be controlled

1634
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,639
by by governments or corporations and

1635
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,480
that makes it very powerful and i think

1636
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:32,798
it's actually quite exciting to be here

1637
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,039
in the adoption phase in the early days

1638
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:36,719
yeah man this is the early days and uh

1639
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,798
you also mentioned that sort of bitcoin

1640
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:41,919
is uh this is the mechanism of a

1641
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:44,639
peaceful revolution so it's a way to

1642
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,200
to resist authoritarianism in a peaceful

1643
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,358
way it's ultimately a mec you know you

1644
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,480
mentioned sort of um

1645
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:51,838
politics

1646
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,280
information

1647
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:55,199
and money

1648
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,640
it uh it seems like in the space of

1649
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:59,598
money this is one of the peaceful

1650
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,960
mechanisms it's a way to opt out

1651
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,519
you can opt out

1652
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,960
peacefully from the system

1653
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:05,920
and yeah it's it's beautiful it's

1654
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,480
beautiful

1655
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,880
so so bitcoin is currently by far the

1656
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,440
most uh popular sort of dominant

1657
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,039
cryptocurrency that said

1658
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,960
and i look forward to your letters

1659
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,679
bitcoin maximalists

1660
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,920
uh that said you know internet explorer

1661
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,000
was the most popular

1662
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,960
browser yeah for quite a long time and

1663
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,798
then

1664
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,440
other browsers came along that out

1665
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:30,719
competed it like chrome

1666
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,400
firefox

1667
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,719
people should check out brave it's a

1668
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,119
great browser um i think it's my

1669
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:38,719
favorite browser at this point anyway so

1670
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,200
why bitcoin why not another

1671
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:44,159
cryptocurrency if you look in the next

1672
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:46,639
10 20 50 100 years do you think it's

1673
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:48,639
possible for another cryptocurrency like

1674
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:49,759
ethereum or something that it's not even

1675
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:53,199
here yet

1676
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,119
to overtake bitcoin as a mechanism

1677
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:56,318
when you say overtake

1678
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,519
um

1679
00:56:56,318 --> 00:56:59,358
what do you mean what do you mean

1680
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:01,599
overtake you mean number of users do you

1681
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:03,119
mean a price per coin

1682
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,318
then yeah the number of users because

1683
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,240
we're talking about one percent two

1684
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,358
percent yeah and if we are serious about

1685
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:10,399
this being

1686
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:14,480
um

1687
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,280
in the space of money as a way to

1688
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,960
give

1689
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,960
individuals power

1690
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,000
yeah fight the centralized powers that

1691
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,480
you use the money system and so on

1692
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,400
how do we get from 2 to 50

1693
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,719
right to 60

1694
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,680
to 80 percent

1695
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,959
that that jump is it obvious to you not

1696
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:34,159
obvious but

1697
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,240
do you think

1698
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,159
bitcoin is the way to get from two

1699
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:40,078
percent to 50

1700
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:42,318
or are there going to be other

1701
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,640
cryptocurrencies they may emerge that

1702
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:46,880
get us to 50 no i mean bitcoin is the

1703
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,440
innovation the innovation is in having

1704
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,599
the decentralized mint no one can change

1705
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,760
the monetary policy everything else is

1706
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,838
downstream from there in bitcoin the

1707
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,680
meme would be 21 million there's never

1708
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,920
going to be any more than 21 million

1709
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:01,919
every other cryptocurrency either has an

1710
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,358
inflationary policy i mean there's going

1711
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,079
to continue to be more and more of it

1712
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:08,078
over time or its monetary policy can be

1713
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,000
changed by a small group of people this

1714
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,680
is vividly on display in ethereum which

1715
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,920
is like the second largest and second

1716
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:17,039
most robust cryptocurrency right

1717
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,240
i've talked to senior ethereum engineers

1718
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:19,358
over the last couple weeks trying to

1719
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,759
figure out

1720
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:24,078
what is the monetary policy of ethereum

1721
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,240
no one can tell me no one knows how much

1722
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,119
eath is going to be minted in 2022 and

1723
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:31,279
2023 after they shift to proof of stake

1724
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,599
it i've seen estimates that range from

1725
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,798
100 000 to 2 million so at the end of

1726
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,000
the day you're going to be trusting a

1727
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:38,159
small group of people to make those

1728
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,079
decisions that is what we are escaping

1729
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:41,920
with bitcoin so all these other

1730
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,400
cryptocurrencies they might have their

1731
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,838
use cases virtually all of them are not

1732
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,599
it's very important for people to know

1733
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:50,000
that if you take like the 4 500

1734
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:52,640
cryptocurrencies on coin market cap

1735
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,318
almost all of them are scams straight up

1736
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:55,598
even the ones that have like noble

1737
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:57,279
intentions

1738
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:00,318
i just don't think are gonna add that

1739
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,960
much value um ultimately i think bitcoin

1740
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:05,119
to me is the innovation and and you know

1741
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,440
that's because it has a monetary policy

1742
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,960
and an issuance schedule that cannot be

1743
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,318
changed and that's what gets me so

1744
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,159
excited about i mean that's why it's

1745
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:13,679
such an important tool for human rights

1746
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:15,838
yeah it's it's interesting because when

1747
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:16,558
you grow from two percent when you grow

1748
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:18,558
in

1749
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,200
the number of people using it at the

1750
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:24,559
scale they're using it

1751
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:26,558
it it's going to need to be resistant to

1752
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,440
governments and institutions messing

1753
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,079
with it

1754
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,318
so it's interesting to see what kind of

1755
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,720
um what kind of cryptocurrency would be

1756
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:38,079
resistant to that obviously dogecoin is

1757
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:39,199
going to win let's be honest

1758
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,839
well i mean looking forward to the

1759
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:44,000
number two cryptocurrency in the world

1760
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:46,400
probably by like how useful it is to

1761
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,440
people is tether which is totally

1762
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,280
centralized has blacklists so i'm not

1763
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,679
saying there won't be like new digital

1764
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,240
assets that are lumped into this

1765
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:58,078
category that have usage but they're not

1766
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:00,639
they're not it's not the same innovation

1767
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,480
as bitcoin it's just sort of building on

1768
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,639
this idea of like a euro dollar maybe

1769
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,880
like a dollar that is minted outside of

1770
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:08,078
the control of the us federal reserve

1771
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,200
right it would be a euro dollar so

1772
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,960
stable coins are kind of like euro

1773
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,558
dollars just minted by private actors in

1774
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,480
a way right but they're still tied to

1775
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,640
the dollar they're pegged to the dollar

1776
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,960
they're not escaping the system escaping

1777
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:21,920
the system is bitcoin we we aren't

1778
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,400
reliant on the dollar we we have our own

1779
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,720
you know full um store value medium of

1780
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,720
exchange unit of account eventually and

1781
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:30,558
you know the bitcoin world will be

1782
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,000
denominated in different terms and i

1783
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,319
think everyone everything else will be

1784
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,039
tied to it i really do it does feel

1785
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:38,880
currently like bitcoin is like like

1786
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:40,318
pirates or something like that and

1787
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,640
they're still like the central banks

1788
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:44,880
that are like the main navies of the of

1789
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,960
the different nations yeah it's just if

1790
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,200
you talk about scale so there's going to

1791
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,798
be a moment if bitcoin continues to grow

1792
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:52,558
in its impact

1793
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:55,039
when governments are going to seriously

1794
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:56,559
contend with you know what do we do with

1795
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:58,880
this

1796
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:01,359
do you think about those moments is uh

1797
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,000
bitcoin is the cryptocurrency world in

1798
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:04,880
general going to be able to withstand

1799
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
the

1800
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,559
serious legal pushback from countries

1801
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,039
from nations especially authoritarian

1802
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,319
nations yeah so it's been interesting

1803
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:16,719
it's been

1804
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:19,119
12 years okay more than 12 years since

1805
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:21,199
satoshi nakamoto created bitcoin

1806
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,680
and they haven't been able to stop it

1807
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:25,519
they have tried they've tried a lot i

1808
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,199
wrote a long essay for quillette on this

1809
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:29,599
like like why haven't governments been

1810
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:30,879
able to stop bitcoin and my thesis is

1811
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,838
essentially that there's been like this

1812
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,640
mix of

1813
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:36,639
different kind of technical social uh

1814
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:38,000
and economic and political incentives

1815
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:39,358
and disincentives that make it very

1816
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,358
difficult

1817
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:42,960
and i think to me the the the best way

1818
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:46,159
to think about it is that bitcoin's like

1819
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,679
a trojan horse so just just to actually

1820
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:48,960
tell that story just a little bit

1821
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:51,118
because i think it's important to

1822
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,838
understand the classical mythology

1823
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,519
tale um i find this very interesting of

1824
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:57,759
the actual the actual trojan horse yeah

1825
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:59,599
which was told in in the aeneid actually

1826
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,920
by by virgil right and the idea was the

1827
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:03,760
greeks had been like trying to take the

1828
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,358
city of troy for like a decade at these

1829
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,520
like impregnable walls and they couldn't

1830
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:08,880
do it and ulysses and the rest of the

1831
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:12,239
greek army were like we don't know what

1832
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,318
to do um so minerva the the the god of

1833
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,479
strategy and war you know kind of like

1834
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:17,920
to get this idea from her i guess to to

1835
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,400
actually try to use subterfuge and

1836
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,480
trickery to take over the city so the

1837
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,358
idea is and this was sort of hatched by

1838
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,599
ulysses right to put this horse together

1839
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:30,078
that would kind of be like a gift so the

1840
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,318
idea was the greeks just like pretended

1841
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,640
to leave right they they deserted they

1842
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:35,920
left behind one soldier and this horse

1843
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:38,078
and the trojans looked at it and they

1844
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,358
were like what's going on here and they

1845
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,519
brought in the soldier and the soldier's

1846
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:43,440
like look they left they're so sorry for

1847
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:45,519
all of the desecration and blood spill

1848
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,440
this is their gift to you it's you know

1849
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:50,239
honoring minerva you know it's like this

1850
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,880
like you know trophy for you guys and

1851
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:55,199
there were actually people inside troy

1852
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,720
uh cassandra a prophet as well as lao

1853
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:58,239
quan who was like a priest who said no

1854
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:00,318
no this is obviously a trick this is

1855
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:02,558
obviously a trick um but they were like

1856
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:04,480
dispatched and ignored because the horse

1857
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:06,240
was like it was just like so badass so

1858
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:07,760
that the trojans were like

1859
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,759
bringing it in the city so they brought

1860
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,039
it in themselves no blood spilled at all

1861
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,960
right in the middle of the night of

1862
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:14,240
course what you realize is the horses

1863
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,440
back to the greek soldiers and they come

1864
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,000
out they let the army in which was like

1865
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,358
hiding behind an island so this idea

1866
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,599
that like

1867
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:23,358
something could be so attractive that

1868
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,119
you really can't say no even if you know

1869
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:27,199
what's inside of it is it played with in

1870
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,559
bitcoin so like

1871
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:30,798
in bitcoin has this number go up

1872
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,839
technology right is what we call it in

1873
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:36,318
sort of shorthand ngo ngu right but what

1874
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:38,719
people don't realize is that ngu is like

1875
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:41,519
the trojan horse inside the trojan horse

1876
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:43,439
is fgu freedom go up technology so

1877
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:47,038
dictators and rogue regimes and

1878
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,039
corporations are gonna buy mine tax

1879
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:50,720
accumulate this thing because it's the

1880
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:53,440
best performing financial asset in the

1881
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:55,199
world what they don't realize or

1882
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,798
they're gonna have to ignore is that

1883
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:58,239
they're also aiding and abetting this

1884
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,239
freedom technology which allows

1885
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:02,239
individuals to be sovereign and

1886
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:03,679
eventually erodes their power there's no

1887
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:05,358
question that rogue regimes and bad

1888
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:07,038
actors i've already used and will

1889
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:08,558
continue to use bitcoin the thing is

1890
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:10,079
when you think about a north korea or

1891
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:11,839
venezuela

1892
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,280
and that government instructs some of

1893
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:16,159
its bureaucrats and cronies and

1894
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,920
officials to start stealing bitcoin or

1895
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:19,679
accumulating it or whatever

1896
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,440
for short-term gain to get around

1897
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:22,639
sanctions and and use it to buy dollars

1898
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,639
or something like that right which they

1899
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:25,838
can't get normally well guess what all

1900
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:27,519
those people who the regime has

1901
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:28,960
instructed to like figure this thing out

1902
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:30,318
and use it they're all going to realize

1903
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,838
oh my god this is money the government

1904
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:33,838
doesn't control and it's going to spread

1905
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:35,920
like a virus okay so this is like the

1906
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:37,119
idea of the trojan horse allegory i

1907
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,039
think it's so important and powerful

1908
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,519
with bitcoin all the people talking

1909
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:43,520
about bitcoin today on tv they don't

1910
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,199
care about freedom or privacy they just

1911
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:47,038
care about number go up but what they

1912
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:49,838
don't realize is what's concealed within

1913
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:52,000
and that's very very powerful to me

1914
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:54,719
so the people talking about bitcoin and

1915
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,079
tv are maybe investor types professional

1916
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:58,318
investors

1917
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:00,960
corporations and soon governments i mean

1918
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:01,759
you just had today this morning on cnbc

1919
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,199
the

1920
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,039
leader of

1921
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:07,038
the republican leader of the house of

1922
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,799
representatives a congressman saying

1923
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,720
like we need to be pro bitcoin as a

1924
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:12,480
country and the other day peter thiel

1925
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:14,078
had a very interesting comment where he

1926
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,039
was basically like let's not fall behind

1927
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:19,760
china in this race so you have

1928
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:22,400
influential people in our government

1929
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,160
like sort of posturing for this like you

1930
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,519
know bitcoin race that's going to happen

1931
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:27,440
in the next 10 years you're going to see

1932
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:30,400
this countries are going to compete to

1933
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:32,240
stack bitcoin absolutely so you believe

1934
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,639
the the thing that's

1935
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:37,759
shiny and sexy like the trojan horse the

1936
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:40,798
number go up uh too hard to ignore

1937
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:42,559
it and for to to uh

1938
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:43,280
to define that a little further meaning

1939
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,119
it's

1940
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,798
it does seem like the more people get

1941
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,039
excited and start using bitcoin the more

1942
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:51,038
of its value grows so it's just a good

1943
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,960
feedback loop yeah it's a feedback loop

1944
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:56,480
and then the reason you're excited about

1945
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,880
it especially is is that uh f g yeah

1946
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,199
freedom go up freedom go up

1947
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,680
which is it uh ultimately gives power to

1948
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:05,598
the individuals to just so decentralized

1949
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:06,639
yeah i mean like when tesla stacks

1950
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,318
bitcoin

1951
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:09,279
they're just doing that as self-interest

1952
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:12,159
they think it's going to be a good

1953
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,760
inflation hedge fund but what they maybe

1954
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:15,199
don't care about don't realize or they

1955
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,839
don't need to care i mean bitcoin's

1956
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:19,598
power is it like co-opts people

1957
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:20,880
into promoting a freedom tool even if

1958
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,119
they don't care about or even if they

1959
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,039
hate freedom it doesn't matter so when

1960
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,960
tesla stacks bitcoin and the price goes

1961
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:28,400
up and more interest goes up and more

1962
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,960
people around the world are like wow

1963
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,880
bitcoin then more people get involved

1964
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,960
again more adoption more price more

1965
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,200
developers better user interface more

1966
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,039
privacy tools more mining more network

1967
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:40,879
security it's just this like positive

1968
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:42,720
feedback loop that continues to grow and

1969
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,079
it will it will grow intensely in the

1970
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:46,239
next decade as we go through the

1971
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,680
adoption cycle and the reason why i'm so

1972
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:49,199
excited about this is the human rights

1973
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,399
world again to get back to our previous

1974
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:52,639
conversation

1975
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,240
is very hard to find people who who have

1976
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:56,000
you know the empathy

1977
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:57,759
or the altruism to actually make a

1978
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,760
difference abroad in places like china

1979
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,680
or saudi arabia or north korea

1980
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,119
people are very quick to just like

1981
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:04,879
they'll just quickly

1982
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,559
toss off the pretty words that they care

1983
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,400
about human rights as soon as profits

1984
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,160
come into play so there's no alignment

1985
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,838
of incentives right the reason why

1986
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:14,318
bitcoin is so powerful is that it aligns

1987
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:16,400
the incentives all of a sudden they can

1988
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:18,400
be as greedy as they want they are being

1989
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,079
forced to promote a freedom tool this

1990
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,519
i've never seen before and it makes me

1991
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,760
it gives me a lot of like excitement

1992
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:25,519
it's very refreshing because we've been

1993
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,960
laboring in the human rights space you

1994
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:28,480
have to like raise money and it's all

1995
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,000
like non-profit work and you're like

1996
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,880
begging for people to make a difference

1997
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,280
for you

1998
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,798
here you have this like incredible asset

1999
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,480
which people will accumulate out of

2000
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:38,880
self-preservation self-interest and

2001
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,798
greed and yet it will strengthen the

2002
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,960
power of the individual that is what we

2003
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:44,798
need to fight big brother that's what we

2004
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,720
need to fight like what i'm scared is

2005
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:48,559
happening in china like this growing

2006
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:50,239
authoritarian state which is powered by

2007
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,880
big data analysis

2008
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:54,479
this is our way to fight back and and it

2009
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,640
runs on this like

2010
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,240
really interesting engine again that

2011
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,318
like takes advantage of our base nature

2012
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:02,399
as humans and i know that it sounds

2013
01:08:00,318 --> 01:08:05,440
terrible for me to say this but i mean

2014
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,680
ultimately we are self-interested

2015
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,280
and it is hard to to get people to care

2016
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:11,679
about others living a thousand miles

2017
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,839
away you know we are kind of

2018
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:16,318
localized in our empathy

2019
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:17,679
speaking as someone who works to help

2020
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,440
people who live in

2021
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:21,199
like 100 different countries it's very

2022
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:22,639
difficult to get americans to care about

2023
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:25,599
what's happening in belarus or in

2024
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,719
kashmir it just is but guess what

2025
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,560
they're going to definitely care about

2026
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,480
bitcoin because they want to see their

2027
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,920
their net worth go up they want to do

2028
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,919
better for their family etc they're

2029
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,838
going to get into this thing and it's

2030
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,920
really going to like make that powerful

2031
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:41,119
tool for everyone else who's using it so

2032
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,079
this interplay dynamic is fascinating to

2033
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:45,439
me

2034
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:47,039
yeah i have to um so i'm somebody who

2035
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:50,639
doesn't like

2036
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:52,960
there are corrupting effects of greed

2037
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,960
but it is also human nature

2038
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,079
yeah i don't like it either but it we

2039
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,279
have to be realistic you have to

2040
01:08:56,079 --> 01:09:00,960
acknowledge it and then maybe use it

2041
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,440
for your advantage and it's not just

2042
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,798
bitcoin itself like exchanges today are

2043
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,719
adopting something called lightning

2044
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:08,640
network which is a way to scale bitcoin

2045
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:10,399
on a second layer much like we had gold

2046
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,239
bars which we scaled with paper money

2047
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:14,639
and then we had visa credit cards which

2048
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:16,399
were a way of scaling the paper notes

2049
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:19,119
bitcoin scales through lightning network

2050
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,879
it's a private instant globally final

2051
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:21,920
settlement network it's something you

2052
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,239
all should

2053
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,838
check out it's very very interesting

2054
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:28,238
the exchanges aren't adopting lightning

2055
01:09:25,838 --> 01:09:29,920
for its privacy benefits like lightning

2056
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:31,599
operates off the chain meaning

2057
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,039
surveillance companies can't see they

2058
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,719
can't do chain analysis on lightning

2059
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:36,158
because it's on an onion routed second

2060
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:38,399
layer kind of that works kind of like

2061
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:40,798
the tour tour project

2062
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,960
the exchanges don't care about privacy

2063
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:45,278
they're doing it because it reduces fees

2064
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,480
lightning is cheaper and faster so again

2065
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:48,000
we have this really interesting

2066
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:49,838
alignment of incentives where like the

2067
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,520
freedom tech is being promoted by people

2068
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:53,359
who don't i don't it doesn't matter what

2069
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,199
their incentives are i could care less

2070
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,880
if they were altruistic or not

2071
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:58,559
and i think this is and you're going to

2072
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,079
maybe see this even in the future

2073
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,440
there's more things coming in bitcoin

2074
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:03,198
down the pike

2075
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:04,799
lightning was enabled by an upgrade

2076
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:05,759
called segwit right which had took place

2077
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,079
a few years ago which was the

2078
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,520
culmination of the block size conflict

2079
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:11,840
there's another thing coming up called

2080
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,159
cross input signature aggregation which

2081
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,279
may if it takes effect in the next few

2082
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:17,359
years

2083
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:19,119
it may compel exchanges to

2084
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:20,559
collaboratively spend all their bitcoin

2085
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:22,960
together in a way that really protects

2086
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,400
our privacy and fights surveillance

2087
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,520
but they're not going to do it for for

2088
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:26,559
moral reasons they're going to do it

2089
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,400
because it's going to save them money

2090
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,760
and improve their bottom line can you

2091
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:31,839
speak to that kind of collaborative so

2092
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,360
you can have multiple parties in a

2093
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,480
single transaction kind of thing yeah

2094
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:36,399
like

2095
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:38,079
you could do that today absolutely it's

2096
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:39,279
called the coin join for example but

2097
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,559
right now it's more expensive to

2098
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:42,719
coinjoin a bitcoin you have to pay a

2099
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,400
premium for your privacy this would flip

2100
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:46,640
that on its head and would basically say

2101
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:48,158
if you have one transaction hey pile

2102
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,440
them all in have as many parties as you

2103
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:51,599
want the more parties you get in the

2104
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:53,279
cheaper it's going to be per party okay

2105
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,120
and and that's not possible in bitcoin

2106
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:57,119
today but it might be in the future but

2107
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:58,479
again the beauty the beauty in bitcoin

2108
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:00,079
are these like

2109
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:01,759
these ways that it just aligns human

2110
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:04,079
incentives and it aligns our like most

2111
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,920
based desires and needs

2112
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:08,319
and realities

2113
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:10,079
with like freedom and privacy and that

2114
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:10,960
i've never seen before and that's why i

2115
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,600
think it's

2116
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,359
so interesting so something that i'm

2117
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,360
like somebody like eric weinstein

2118
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,119
actually spoke to this

2119
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:21,198
the you know the idea of blockchain in

2120
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:23,439
general

2121
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:24,639
from like a 10 000 foot

2122
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,879
view

2123
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,400
the blockchain is a centralized place to

2124
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,079
keep the record of everything that ever

2125
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:31,198
happened

2126
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:32,880
and

2127
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:34,399
does that concern you

2128
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,480
from a privacy perspective from a

2129
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:37,679
control perspective even though it's

2130
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:39,919
managed

2131
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:42,079
especially you know given the low

2132
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:45,119
frequency of transactions for bitcoin

2133
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:47,119
you can like you you can have a lot of

2134
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:48,800
you know small computers across the

2135
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:50,319
globe contain the entirety set of

2136
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,159
transactions

2137
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:53,920
you know all of those kinds of features

2138
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:57,439
does that concern you that there's one

2139
01:11:53,920 --> 01:12:00,079
place where everything is made public in

2140
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:02,079
terms of everything that ever happened

2141
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:03,679
no i and i'll give you two reasons

2142
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,679
number one

2143
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,440
the bitcoin blockchain is ultimately a

2144
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,039
settlement layer it's kind of like

2145
01:12:07,439 --> 01:12:10,799
something like

2146
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:12,079
fedwire in the united states it's a way

2147
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,840
for like

2148
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:14,960
institutions to settle with each other

2149
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,360
that's what i think it's going to be

2150
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,800
like in 20 30 years from now the average

2151
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:20,719
person is never going to touch the

2152
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,960
bitcoin blockchain probably they're

2153
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:24,719
going to use things like lightning or

2154
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,640
unfortunately they may use bitcoin banks

2155
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,800
but they'll either use custodians or

2156
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,800
they'll use second layer non-custodial

2157
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,400
solutions to interact the main chain is

2158
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,079
going to get very expensive it's going

2159
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:36,000
to be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

2160
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:37,279
of dollars or even more if the dollar

2161
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,960
starts to weaken

2162
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:41,198
uh to make a transaction on the main

2163
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,840
chain and that will be reserved for like

2164
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:46,719
very large transactions or transactions

2165
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,920
that need final final settlement etc etc

2166
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:49,760
um

2167
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,279
and i think that that's

2168
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,960
that's fine

2169
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:56,319
and and that's okay

2170
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:58,239
and it's very important that that ledger

2171
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:00,399
that settlement layer

2172
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:02,319
be kept by thousands of people around

2173
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:04,719
the world the bitcoin blockchain is not

2174
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:06,399
centralized it is it is decentralized it

2175
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,399
is run by people like me who run a node

2176
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:10,719
at home i run a personal server i run

2177
01:13:08,399 --> 01:13:12,639
the bitcoin blockchain no one else you

2178
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,000
run it that person runs it there's no

2179
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,239
there's no one in where you have a full

2180
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,840
node yeah i run a full node

2181
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:19,678
it's great i mean it's pretty easy man

2182
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,840
you run it and that way you can be

2183
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,600
sovereign over all of your usage right

2184
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,840
and you can run it on a raspberry pi

2185
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,440
with less than 150 bucks of equipment

2186
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,199
and that's so important because again

2187
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:31,119
there is no amazon web service

2188
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:32,799
vulnerability here that is a problem and

2189
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:34,319
i agree with you we're trending in a bad

2190
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,079
direction where like the government

2191
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:37,759
could just turn off you know a big

2192
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:39,039
important website or a news source well

2193
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,280
they can't turn off bitcoin because it

2194
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:43,039
doesn't live on aws it lives with us we

2195
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:45,359
are bitcoin and i think that that's

2196
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:47,600
that's very very powerful um and then

2197
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:49,759
you can have this the something like a

2198
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,280
lightning network where you can

2199
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,560
escape some of the constraints of the

2200
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:54,639
blockchain

2201
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,920
depending on your needs of the privacy

2202
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,360
and all those kinds of things

2203
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,640
everything's an engineering tradeoff but

2204
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:00,960
yeah you can trade off some of the

2205
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:02,960
assurances of the base layer to go into

2206
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,480
lightning for example and and there you

2207
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,000
can get more speed and more privacy and

2208
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:08,959
the things that bitcoin

2209
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,560
lacks speed and privacy for example um

2210
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,158
you can get on these second layers so

2211
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,320
there's all kinds of cool engineering

2212
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:15,920
things that people are coming up with um

2213
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:18,000
but i also would just say

2214
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,600
anyone who says the blockchain like

2215
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,719
that's a red flag for that person

2216
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:22,239
doesn't really know what they're talking

2217
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,880
about like satoshi didn't use the

2218
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:26,959
blockchain in the the white paper

2219
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,400
blockchain was a marketing term com that

2220
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,079
people came up with later

2221
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:32,879
to try and do this thing

2222
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:35,679
that was kind of like it peaked in 2015

2223
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:38,000
and it continues to be an issue today of

2224
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:40,640
it's blockchain not bitcoin and that was

2225
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,039
like a very corporate um kind of social

2226
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,880
attack on bitcoin to say we could take

2227
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:46,479
this like ledger part of this radical

2228
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,239
thing that's for criminals and all these

2229
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:50,079
bad people but we could take one part of

2230
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:52,799
it out and we could bring it over here

2231
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:54,800
and we could make it safe for everybody

2232
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,400
the real mccoy's bitcoin

2233
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,679
i mean satoshi referred to it as the

2234
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:59,279
time chain i mean really what they're

2235
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:00,880
talking about is just these like blocks

2236
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:02,559
that are connected chronologically of

2237
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,800
transactions it's really not that

2238
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:07,120
exciting the exciting part of bitcoin is

2239
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:09,360
is the proof of work you know where the

2240
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:11,039
transaction processing is done by mining

2241
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:13,119
and by energy and by real world

2242
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:15,359
expenditures instead of like

2243
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:16,880
you know some central ledger

2244
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:19,519
and you know when you remove the

2245
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,199
blockchain from bitcoin it's not very

2246
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,520
to me it's just not it's it's just not

2247
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:25,439
that interesting i don't know to me

2248
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,880
blockchain or time chain whatever does

2249
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:28,639
it philosophically is it's pretty

2250
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,319
beautiful idea i mean

2251
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,320
it's pretty simple but

2252
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:34,000
nevertheless is beautiful from a

2253
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:36,000
i'm a big database person it's an

2254
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,319
interesting way to store information

2255
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,359
that especially that's totally publicly

2256
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:40,238
accessible

2257
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,359
it's

2258
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:45,519
um i know that to bitcoin proof of work

2259
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:46,319
is the fundamental idea yes

2260
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,159
but

2261
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:50,158
to cryptocurrency and digital money in

2262
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:52,000
general into money the blockchain is a

2263
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:54,000
really interesting idea to me the way i

2264
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,238
think about it is it's kind of

2265
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,560
you know physics and i like that there's

2266
01:15:56,238 --> 01:16:00,559
a place that you can rely on

2267
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,400
that's very difficult to mess with but

2268
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,640
it's not though like it's outside of

2269
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:07,039
maybe ethereum every other blockchain is

2270
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:09,440
easy to mess with so i you're saying

2271
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:11,279
that for work is what makes it hard to

2272
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:13,039
absolutely proof of work is the key

2273
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:15,119
right and ethereum's about to leave

2274
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:16,800
proof of work so

2275
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:18,559
it's about to go to proof of stake

2276
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,679
which is literally the existing system

2277
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,199
where a small group of people get to

2278
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:22,480
decide the monetary policy yeah

2279
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:24,158
reputation

2280
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:24,959
has a lot of value there and that you

2281
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:26,238
could be

2282
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,520
it could be manipulation it may sound

2283
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:29,198
brutal but i'm coming at it from a

2284
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,800
political science perspective for me

2285
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:33,039
it's all about freedom versus

2286
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,400
dictatorship and that's why i find it's

2287
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:36,479
so compelling that

2288
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:38,639
that regardless of how much power or

2289
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,718
might or how many armies you have you

2290
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,520
can't change the rules of bitcoin

2291
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,760
if

2292
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,360
you're wrong about bitcoin

2293
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,960
what would that look like

2294
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:50,639
what kind of thing

2295
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:53,198
that uh in 10 20 years

2296
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:55,039
that you you're not wrong

2297
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:57,279
right but it doesn't pan out it doesn't

2298
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:59,039
pan out but other things that actually

2299
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,359
make you feel good about all the hard

2300
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:03,679
work you've done do pan out something

2301
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:05,920
you haven't expected what what might

2302
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,760
that be well as we've talked about my

2303
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,359
career started in human rights and in

2304
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:11,039
promoting individual freedom and

2305
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:13,279
fighting authoritarianism that fight

2306
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:15,519
will will continue on no matter what

2307
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:18,399
happens with bitcoin um i think it would

2308
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:21,040
be a massive failure and a tragedy if

2309
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:22,719
this project like didn't work bitcoin

2310
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:24,479
yes if the bitcoin project didn't work

2311
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:25,279
we would it would honestly it's one of

2312
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:27,279
the only

2313
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:28,880
things that gives me hope because it is

2314
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:31,359
an effective way to push back against

2315
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:33,279
creeping centralized control

2316
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:34,719
if for whatever reason and i can't

2317
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:36,238
really see one of the reasons i'm so

2318
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,760
into it is i can't really see how it's

2319
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:39,519
not going to work again i think the

2320
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,119
trojan horse allegory

2321
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,880
is too powerful

2322
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:43,920
these big centralized actors are going

2323
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,920
to be too greedy and they're going to

2324
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,359
want some as opposed to banning it it's

2325
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,560
way easier for them to buy it than to

2326
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:50,158
ban it i think it's just what's going to

2327
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,920
happen but if but if whatever for

2328
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:53,599
whatever reason it failed i would have

2329
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,440
very little hope left because really i

2330
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,360
mean the chinese model of like

2331
01:17:55,439 --> 01:18:00,238
centralizing all of your data and

2332
01:17:57,359 --> 01:18:03,198
controlling it i mean ultimately is is a

2333
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:04,559
very very powerful um sort of like arch

2334
01:18:03,198 --> 01:18:06,238
force and

2335
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:09,120
i i i would be concerned that that would

2336
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:10,799
be all of our of our sort of destiny

2337
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:12,559
i do have to sort of push back the style

2338
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,400
of communication and you you're not

2339
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,239
doing it today you're doing you're being

2340
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:17,198
exceptionally eloquent and arguing these

2341
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:19,759
ideas

2342
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:22,000
but me especially just

2343
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,760
from studying history

2344
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,399
and being very skeptical from growing up

2345
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,920
in the soviet union

2346
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:30,238
i'm very

2347
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:33,840
skeptical and cautious when i see a

2348
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:35,759
community of people being very sure

2349
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:37,600
of an idea doesn't matter what that idea

2350
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:40,400
is and there's a huge amount of

2351
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:42,400
certainty around bitcoin part of it is

2352
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:45,039
an important feature because you it's

2353
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:45,039
number go up

2354
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,199
so far

2355
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:52,639
number go up is a really important part

2356
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:54,799
of the mechanism to make sure that it uh

2357
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,480
it grows in impact

2358
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,000
network effects because i mean it's

2359
01:18:56,479 --> 01:18:59,759
really important to get excited about

2360
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:04,640
idea for take hold that's the way human

2361
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:06,880
nature works and so on but i also get um

2362
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,520
even something that you mentioned

2363
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:11,039
that you know others

2364
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:12,960
may not you know if you mention

2365
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:15,198
blockchain you're sensitive to the

2366
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,198
attacks that have been

2367
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:18,639
that have been mounted where the word

2368
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:20,799
blockchain has been used people have

2369
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,239
been fooled i mean like yeah and people

2370
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,360
in the humanitarian sector have been

2371
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:24,879
fooled into thinking that some

2372
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:27,279
centralized blockchain project is going

2373
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,199
to help some refugee all collapsed

2374
01:19:27,279 --> 01:19:30,639
there's a yeah there's a huge chat it

2375
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:32,399
makes me sad that there's a huge number

2376
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,560
of scams like you know what makes me

2377
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:37,119
really sad and just a tiny little

2378
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,480
tangent there's been recently i guess

2379
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:40,238
with the growing platform or something

2380
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:41,839
there's been a bunch of fake lex

2381
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:42,718
friedman accounts

2382
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,279
yeah

2383
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:47,279
and have a million but not only do they

2384
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:49,759
do stupid stuff

2385
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:51,679
but they've been messaging people oh

2386
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,440
bitcoin and stuff i looked in totally

2387
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:56,239
and people write to me

2388
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:58,319
and they're saying like tough man

2389
01:19:56,238 --> 01:20:00,079
i think it gets people i think they

2390
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:01,599
click on stuff i think they they were

2391
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:04,719
not sure and

2392
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:07,440
it it makes me think like

2393
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:08,480
people are gullible or not gullible but

2394
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:09,839
like

2395
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:11,759
they're uh

2396
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,800
just like i am which is they're like

2397
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,159
hopeful about the world they're

2398
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,239
optimistic about the world you know

2399
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:17,759
almost like naive about evil that's not

2400
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:19,359
what goes wrong with bitcoin and i've

2401
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:21,520
seen it um

2402
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:22,719
people fall for these like i mean like

2403
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,400
in these different countries i'm trying

2404
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,920
to like talk to to different people

2405
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:28,319
about bitcoin and like the amount of

2406
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,760
like mlm schemes pyramid schemes ponzi

2407
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:31,359
schemes

2408
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,199
they're just so many of them and there's

2409
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:34,799
plenty here too but like

2410
01:20:33,198 --> 01:20:37,198
in zimbabwe i was talking to this guy

2411
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:39,119
who is a reporter who studies the fx

2412
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:40,799
like the foreign currency exchange

2413
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:41,920
markets he's just saying one of the main

2414
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,679
reasons people don't want to get into

2415
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,679
bitcoin is because they've been scammed

2416
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,039
so hard by all these other things so i

2417
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:48,800
would say that that's one one way it

2418
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:50,399
could go wrong is that like people just

2419
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:53,039
continue to be like

2420
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:54,960
um afraid of it because of things that

2421
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:56,719
are like that in the past well that not

2422
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,880
it's not just the volatility it's just

2423
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:00,399
the the na you know uh

2424
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,359
yeah having if you think it's a pyramid

2425
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:02,479
scheme you're not going to want to get

2426
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:03,519
involved

2427
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:05,678
and

2428
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:07,280
in some sense if i were to speak to the

2429
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,679
bitcoin maximalist

2430
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:11,679
community is to maybe ease up on the

2431
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:14,560
certainty because that gives me the

2432
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:16,880
signal that it's a scam to be honest so

2433
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:19,679
whenever somebody whenever there's a lot

2434
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:22,960
of people being

2435
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:24,880
cultishly excited about something

2436
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,880
i start being very skeptical it's like

2437
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:29,119
uh you know i used to like green day

2438
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,639
before they became really popular and

2439
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:32,238
then the moment they became really

2440
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:33,679
popular i'm like i don't know he started

2441
01:21:32,238 --> 01:21:35,839
wearing mascara and it's like and i

2442
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:37,760
don't like him anymore so like i i'm

2443
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,719
very skeptical about

2444
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:42,239
uh evangelists of an idea because i

2445
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:44,480
think bitcoin on its own is just a

2446
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:46,879
powerful idea that stands but i also

2447
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:49,198
understand that in a world of a lot of

2448
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,480
competing ideas where there's a lot of

2449
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:52,158
scams

2450
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:54,638
and a lot of money to be made through

2451
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:56,158
those scams that you have to be that you

2452
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:58,239
have to be innovative in the kind of

2453
01:21:56,158 --> 01:22:00,638
mechanisms you use to break through the

2454
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:03,119
scam the ocean of scams

2455
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:06,960
i took this personality test and i'm a

2456
01:22:03,119 --> 01:22:08,079
99 skepticism so i was first sadly

2457
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,239
because i was first introduced to

2458
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:12,238
bitcoin in 2013.

2459
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:15,198
and i was like yeah whatever and it took

2460
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:16,879
me four years to actually get into it to

2461
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:18,479
go down the rabbit hole i didn't really

2462
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:22,000
start to grasp it and start getting

2463
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:24,079
excited about it until 2017. so i was

2464
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,679
regrettably very very skeptical for a

2465
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:28,479
long time and i just thought it was like

2466
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:30,960
whatever so i i appreciate that and you

2467
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:32,959
should be skeptical um but ultimately

2468
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,399
you got to believe in things like i

2469
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,679
believe in democracy i believe it's good

2470
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:37,759
for people i believe it's better than

2471
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,039
tyranny i believe in the internet i i

2472
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,560
know that we've had issues with

2473
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:42,079
centralization of the internet but i

2474
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,679
still believe it's better to be

2475
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:44,319
connected than to have bridges between

2476
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:46,480
us

2477
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:49,279
and i believe in bitcoin and to me it's

2478
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:52,638
like a very similar progressive force

2479
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:56,399
that we're encountering um but but i i

2480
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:57,920
yeah be skeptical nothing nothing um

2481
01:22:56,399 --> 01:22:59,519
nothing will befall you that's bad if

2482
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,600
you're like cautious and skeptical

2483
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,800
that's like a good good good mentality

2484
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,199
to have

2485
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,400
one thing we haven't talked about

2486
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:08,238
all the

2487
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:10,399
violations of the human rights that

2488
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:11,839
authoritarian regimes

2489
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:13,359
do

2490
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,119
there's a

2491
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:16,960
not a positive

2492
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:19,760
but there is a you mentioned that

2493
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:21,520
nationalism is a drug yeah

2494
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:22,719
there's something beautiful about loving

2495
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,800
your country

2496
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:26,399
having pride in your country

2497
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,760
uh loving

2498
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:30,079
the

2499
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,159
there's a feeling of belonging

2500
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:33,600
it could be country it could be tribe it

2501
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,599
could be family

2502
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,360
that's really powerful and that speaks

2503
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,280
to human nature as well

2504
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:40,559
and that can sometimes overpower

2505
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:43,519
everything else

2506
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:44,719
patriotism patriotism yeah and you know

2507
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,880
sometimes

2508
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:49,119
it can be seen when you study history

2509
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,719
when you look at

2510
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:52,880
stalinist

2511
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:56,719
the soviet union or you can even look at

2512
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:58,639
hitler and nazi germany we tend to paint

2513
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,480
patriotism in a negative light and then

2514
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:01,679
maybe when we look at the united states

2515
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:02,879
but even here in the united states

2516
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,560
people often

2517
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:06,560
paint um

2518
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,199
patriotism in a bad light you know every

2519
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:12,080
time i say i love america so as an

2520
01:24:09,198 --> 01:24:13,919
immigrant i love this country

2521
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:14,840
it's funny how that's taken as a

2522
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:18,000
political

2523
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:20,079
statement uh that

2524
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,679
you know people i guess on the right has

2525
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:23,119
been have been more active in saying

2526
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:24,480
that they love the country and people on

2527
01:24:23,119 --> 01:24:26,559
their left

2528
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:28,000
uh have not

2529
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:31,440
sort of it's almost become a weird

2530
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,359
slogan as opposed to a statement of just

2531
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:36,158
love and i understand that patriotism

2532
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,920
can be a slippery slope into uh letting

2533
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:39,679
your government i mean it's exactly what

2534
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,800
you're saying the value of freedom of

2535
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:42,880
speech is

2536
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,360
you hold your government to account for

2537
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,400
all the ways they mess up i mean look

2538
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:48,319
you have patriotism and then you have

2539
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:50,158
jingoism right it's very important we

2540
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:52,319
stay on the patriotic side like as an

2541
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:54,319
american i'm very patriotic in terms of

2542
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:55,920
i love the values that this country was

2543
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:57,359
founded on if you read the bill of

2544
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,719
rights and i love the fact that it was

2545
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:01,039
just flexible enough that we were able

2546
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:03,439
to change it to grant or at least to try

2547
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:04,560
to grant all people the same rights it

2548
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:06,559
was not the original plan of the

2549
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:10,080
founders right it had to be changed but

2550
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:12,320
since you know then we've remained um

2551
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,880
you know like you know those laws have

2552
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:16,639
have remained and they're very good uh

2553
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,560
and i'm very proud of that what i'm not

2554
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:20,560
proud of is the jingoistic part of our

2555
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,920
country where we invade other countries

2556
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,159
and bomb other countries and not proud

2557
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,760
of our prison system i think it's a huge

2558
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:27,119
stain on our nation i'm not proud of a

2559
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,039
lot of things so i think you can be

2560
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:31,198
patriotic but you can be you know

2561
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:33,279
critical of your country um and that's

2562
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:34,960
important you know i feel like the

2563
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:36,479
jingoistic thing is is the thing that we

2564
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,439
need to watch out for

2565
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:40,079
um

2566
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:41,759
that's just my own personal take

2567
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,840
out of all the projects that the human

2568
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,679
rights foundation works on what's the

2569
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,760
most important one to you right now like

2570
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:49,679
that's been occupying your mind

2571
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,280
yeah i just read again this new yorker

2572
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:54,560
piece that just came out that you should

2573
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,920
read it's called ghost walls and it's

2574
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,360
the story of

2575
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,520
how the chinese communist party is

2576
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:01,679
committing genocide right now just like

2577
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,920
other regimes did in the turks did to

2578
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:05,920
the armenians and the nazis did to the

2579
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:08,158
jews and it's happening again right now

2580
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,679
he said never again and you know that's

2581
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:10,638
just not true we're letting it happen

2582
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:12,079
and

2583
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:14,319
again with the business stuff like

2584
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:16,238
people are like airbnb is like a sponsor

2585
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:18,639
of the olympics like what at the

2586
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:20,718
individual level at a business level how

2587
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:23,119
does somebody like me who's just one

2588
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:25,439
little aunt how does somebody

2589
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:26,960
uh like elon musk who's in charge of ten

2590
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:28,799
thousand ants

2591
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:31,119
uh fight it

2592
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:34,079
like what how do we yeah how do we push

2593
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:36,639
back a great blueprint is the the fight

2594
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:38,639
against the south african apartheid so i

2595
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:41,119
we did a few events down in johannesburg

2596
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,400
um and i've had the pleasure of being

2597
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:44,319
able to go to the apartheid museum

2598
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:45,519
several times um and it really does a

2599
01:26:44,319 --> 01:26:47,359
good job of chronicling how they were

2600
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,600
able to do it it took a while there's no

2601
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:53,279
doubt but the way it was done was good

2602
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,880
um peaceful action from abroad was very

2603
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:58,079
important so there was like the sullivan

2604
01:26:54,880 --> 01:27:01,199
principles so like um you can peacefully

2605
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:02,479
protest as a company uh particular

2606
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:04,319
regimes

2607
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:07,039
and it's very effective and not just

2608
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:08,799
corporations but like the olympics is a

2609
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:09,920
great example like

2610
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,920
chinese government should not be able to

2611
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,359
host the olympics the ioc should say no

2612
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,520
not until you close down those prison

2613
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:18,079
camps this is a perfect peaceful way to

2614
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:19,600
push back no one gets hurt same thing

2615
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:21,198
when we had the korean olympics a few

2616
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,880
years ago north korea should not have

2617
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:25,198
been allowed any sort of symbolistic

2618
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,880
kind of hosting rights there they have

2619
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:29,119
prison camps gulags that we can see from

2620
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,239
outer space very clearly and their

2621
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:32,238
regime is

2622
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:34,158
the cruelest one on the planet probably

2623
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:35,919
why were they able to sit and cheer and

2624
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:38,238
and you know get to sort of co-host

2625
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:40,880
those at the olympics this is spineless

2626
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:43,198
like the the ioc the olympics and major

2627
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,719
corporations should stand up um

2628
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:47,039
especially in the cultural sector where

2629
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:49,039
you don't lose anything like you know or

2630
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:51,119
you shouldn't have to lose anything

2631
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:53,359
so i think if we look at the way that we

2632
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:54,319
forced the apartheid regime

2633
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:55,839
out

2634
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:57,840
this international solidarity of

2635
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,679
musicians athletes performers

2636
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,360
celebrities is very very powerful

2637
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:03,520
unfortunately today's celebrities are

2638
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:04,880
doing the opposite we just you know have

2639
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:07,280
this press release go out yesterday

2640
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,960
about akon and he's he's off

2641
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:11,119
whitewashing the crimes of the dictator

2642
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,719
of uganda and

2643
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:16,079
trying to build a future city there with

2644
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:18,158
him you know if this was the 1980s akon

2645
01:28:16,079 --> 01:28:19,519
would be raising his fist and saying we

2646
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:21,519
need to you know fight the apartheid

2647
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,040
regime how do we get back to that you

2648
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,360
know we need to think about that we have

2649
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:27,679
to figure out how to harness celebrities

2650
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:29,279
influencers and companies and get them

2651
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:31,279
to actually stand up for something for

2652
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:34,639
once i mean that's something we've lost

2653
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:37,119
we've really had a spine against that um

2654
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:38,800
and and you know we've lost it you know

2655
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:41,119
and and you lose things you lose them

2656
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,880
forever look at tibet tibet was a big

2657
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:44,238
cause for people in the 90s used to go

2658
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,000
to colleges and kids would have the

2659
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:47,198
tibetan flags all over the dorm rooms it

2660
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,359
was like

2661
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:51,039
radiohead would have tibet on the stage

2662
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:52,479
and everybody wanted to you know free

2663
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:53,760
tibet was a big thing

2664
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:55,519
guess what like

2665
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:57,039
we lost it for some reason it's not a

2666
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:59,199
thing anymore and tibet has been totally

2667
01:28:57,039 --> 01:29:01,679
colonized you know so i think it's

2668
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:03,439
important that we find a way to unlock

2669
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:05,279
um an interest

2670
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:07,198
of in the celebrity classes among

2671
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:09,039
athletes singers

2672
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:11,119
presidents you know we need to find a

2673
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:13,198
way to punish these people

2674
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:14,000
yeah it's surprising because the

2675
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:15,519
we've

2676
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,119
become more and more connected so we can

2677
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,880
communicate more effectively at a large

2678
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:20,238
scale and yet

2679
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,480
we seem to be

2680
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:25,039
worse and worse at real activism it

2681
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:26,879
seems like the outrage that's overtaken

2682
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:29,679
the communication channels has been very

2683
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:32,639
us focused and often

2684
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:34,960
more about outrage and less about uh

2685
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:37,199
productive activism i'm very jaded i

2686
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:39,359
mean it's very difficult to to do these

2687
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:41,599
things at scale effectively i do not

2688
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:43,359
believe we will be successful in

2689
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,280
boycotting the chinese olympics we

2690
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:46,960
weren't in 2008 i don't think and

2691
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:48,158
they're much more evil now and i don't

2692
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,198
think we're going to be able to do it

2693
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:51,439
this time

2694
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:53,198
and again to go back to the the bitcoin

2695
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:54,319
piece that's why i'm like very

2696
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:56,079
interested in this thing because it

2697
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:57,439
doesn't require my altruism it doesn't

2698
01:29:56,079 --> 01:30:00,479
require some famous singer or some

2699
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:02,158
corporation to to sacrifice anything

2700
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:03,279
they're literally just going to follow

2701
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:04,960
their own prophet seeking

2702
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:06,800
self-interested motives and they're

2703
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,880
going to end up making a stronger human

2704
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:11,600
rights tool for other people uh freedom

2705
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:13,920
go up fgu man

2706
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:15,760
do you think we're

2707
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,199
it's kind of a dark question but you

2708
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:20,400
think we're headed towards a war with

2709
01:30:17,198 --> 01:30:21,839
china the united states versus china

2710
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:24,238
i hope not

2711
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,679
i hope not in the cyber space and

2712
01:30:24,238 --> 01:30:27,279
potentially even a hot war i think

2713
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:29,840
there's too many people with too much

2714
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:31,920
money to be lost to go to a hot war

2715
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:33,119
on both sides but

2716
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,319
eventually we're just gonna someone's

2717
01:30:33,119 --> 01:30:36,079
gonna have to stand up i mean the

2718
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:37,439
subjugation of hong kong and the

2719
01:30:36,079 --> 01:30:39,760
genocide of the uyghurs and the

2720
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:41,439
colonization of tibet i mean taiwan is

2721
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,440
the next big thing i mean xi jinping has

2722
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:45,039
made it very clear you know xinjiang

2723
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:46,799
tibet hong kong

2724
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:47,840
taiwan so

2725
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,159
we're going to have to stand up for

2726
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:51,920
taiwan for different reasons both for

2727
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:54,479
moral reasons but also for semiconductor

2728
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:56,800
reasons we need tsmc to be on our side

2729
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:58,638
to not have china take over tsmc

2730
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,960
so um there's different reasons why

2731
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,800
we're going to have to protect taiwan

2732
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,639
and you just hope it's not a hot war i

2733
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,079
mean at this point

2734
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:08,159
well but also from inside the

2735
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:10,319
governments of china and russia as well

2736
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:12,559
but china i guess is is the powerhouse

2737
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:14,238
here is how do how do these governments

2738
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,920
get reformed is it is there hope for

2739
01:31:14,238 --> 01:31:17,439
them to become democracies like true

2740
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,199
democracies

2741
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:20,158
of representative democracies and sort

2742
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:22,158
of

2743
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:23,759
reform them

2744
01:31:22,158 --> 01:31:24,638
to be

2745
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,960
to be

2746
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:29,440
ethical players on the world stage no

2747
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:31,039
empire lasts forever and it's impossible

2748
01:31:29,439 --> 01:31:33,039
to predict when these regimes fall i

2749
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:34,399
mean no one no one thought the soviet

2750
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:36,560
union was going to fall when it fell

2751
01:31:34,399 --> 01:31:39,039
like that like if you studied like the

2752
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:41,199
news and the scholarship of the era

2753
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:43,119
no one knew that the tunisian government

2754
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:44,879
was going to fall after muhammad bozizi

2755
01:31:43,119 --> 01:31:46,479
laid himself on fire no one no one

2756
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,480
really no one predicted that that would

2757
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:50,319
become what we now know as the arab

2758
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:51,839
spring right these things are impossible

2759
01:31:50,319 --> 01:31:53,920
to predict

2760
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:55,199
and one day the chinese regime will fall

2761
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,440
i just

2762
01:31:55,198 --> 01:31:58,799
we don't know when um yes

2763
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:00,638
you know but and there's quite a few

2764
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,400
folks who talk about the fall of the

2765
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:05,039
american empire

2766
01:32:02,399 --> 01:32:07,359
and it also concerns me that we don't

2767
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:10,158
know when that might fall you assume me

2768
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:12,559
as a very excited naive american i'm

2769
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:14,638
very excited by this project that i

2770
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,520
think is the beacon of hope in the world

2771
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,520
still

2772
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:20,400
but uh

2773
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:22,000
that's probably how do you you know

2774
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:24,638
uh that's how that's probably how you

2775
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,158
feel before it's the end it's a

2776
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:28,239
party you want to leave the party before

2777
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:30,879
it starts to deteriorate um

2778
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:32,718
i i think america could continue to have

2779
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,520
like a major major leadership role for a

2780
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:37,119
long long time um i think certain things

2781
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,400
we do will become maybe no longer

2782
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:40,479
possible in terms of the way we

2783
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:41,839
intimidate people on the world stage and

2784
01:32:40,479 --> 01:32:43,439
the term especially the way we use our

2785
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,960
currency as a weapon

2786
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:46,559
i think that that's going to decline

2787
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:49,520
over time as we become more of a

2788
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:51,520
multi-polar world um but i do still

2789
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:53,440
believe in america and the values that

2790
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:56,080
were founded on despite all the warts i

2791
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:58,158
do believe in us and i would prefer us

2792
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:01,119
absolutely to be the most prominent of

2793
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:02,960
the multi-polar world vis-a-vis a regime

2794
01:33:01,119 --> 01:33:04,399
like russia or china absolutely there's

2795
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,039
no question so we've been talking about

2796
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:08,879
states and nations yeah but can we just

2797
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:10,719
briefly talk about facebook and twitter

2798
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,239
and companies that have a huge impact on

2799
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:13,679
the world as well and actually one of

2800
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:15,198
the things that make america a great

2801
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:17,520
nation is

2802
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:20,000
it is the place from which these great

2803
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:22,480
companies have sprung up is there

2804
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,920
from a human rights perspective

2805
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:25,519
is there something that bothers you

2806
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,480
about facebook about these large

2807
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,960
companies

2808
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:31,839
uh is there something we need to fix

2809
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:33,520
something we need to

2810
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:36,319
be upset about

2811
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:39,280
fight back on reform

2812
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:41,679
do some sort of real activism about

2813
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:44,079
i'm very concerned about social media

2814
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:45,440
platforms and companies it almost feels

2815
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:46,880
like we're losing the golden age of the

2816
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:49,039
internet you know we could like go

2817
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,119
online and enter and you know interact

2818
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:52,639
with each other and share and not be

2819
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:54,559
worried about censorship it feels like

2820
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:56,880
that that was a golden age like in the

2821
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:58,639
late 90s 2000s

2822
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,639
and now everything is is becoming very

2823
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:02,480
politicized and i'm not sure that

2824
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:05,199
there's a solution like i don't think

2825
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:06,399
there's a button we can press to fix it

2826
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:08,319
i'm kind of

2827
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:09,759
uh afraid that this is sort of just what

2828
01:34:08,319 --> 01:34:10,880
happens when

2829
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:13,840
uh

2830
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:17,039
societies digitize like like i think

2831
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:20,079
that certain opinions just become

2832
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:21,760
demonized in in the sort of

2833
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:23,519
um

2834
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:25,360
in the room in the social room that we

2835
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,360
have on the internet

2836
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:29,759
and i don't know if there's a magical

2837
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:32,399
solution there i do know that there's

2838
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:35,360
technological solutions that will allow

2839
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:37,279
us to continue to communicate and for

2840
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:39,039
creators to reach their audiences

2841
01:34:37,279 --> 01:34:41,198
without censorship

2842
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:43,359
um and that's very exciting like right

2843
01:34:41,198 --> 01:34:44,118
now you could be de-platformed

2844
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:47,279
from

2845
01:34:44,118 --> 01:34:49,839
your uh you know from like whether it's

2846
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:51,118
uh patreon or youtube or whatever um and

2847
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:54,400
your your bank account can be closed

2848
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:56,399
down right there are emerging ways

2849
01:34:54,399 --> 01:34:57,279
that adam curry like the pod father and

2850
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:58,960
a bunch of other people are

2851
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:01,279
experimenting with where you can

2852
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:04,000
essentially have your audio podcast

2853
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:05,599
across a whole bunch of different um

2854
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,520
you know platforms so you know it's

2855
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:10,480
censorship resistant and then your

2856
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:12,320
audience can pay you over lightning in

2857
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:14,399
streaming money like they can stream you

2858
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:16,238
money as they listen so you're removing

2859
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:18,479
the whole advertising piece you don't

2860
01:35:16,238 --> 01:35:20,718
need to do advertising anymore you have

2861
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,599
this direct relationship with

2862
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:23,520
um

2863
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:25,280
your uh

2864
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,040
you know your audience and this is

2865
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:28,399
possible with something like lightning

2866
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:30,238
where you can do streaming money that's

2867
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:31,839
censorship resistant

2868
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:33,599
and a lot of the people who are building

2869
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:36,480
a lightning network

2870
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:38,320
for example elizabeth stark who you know

2871
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:39,599
started lightning labs and

2872
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:41,118
has done

2873
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,119
in her within her company that people

2874
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:44,000
that work work with her have built a

2875
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:46,000
huge part of the lightning

2876
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,238
infrastructure you know what animates

2877
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,158
her is this idea of like

2878
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:52,079
again artists and creators being able to

2879
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:54,479
have that direct

2880
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:56,000
um ability to reach out and have that

2881
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:58,319
peer-to-peer relationship with their

2882
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,639
with their audience and i i'm excited

2883
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:02,319
for that and i do think that's coming

2884
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:04,560
but but i i am

2885
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:06,479
very worried that the golden age of like

2886
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,400
like what centralized social media

2887
01:36:06,479 --> 01:36:10,079
platforms is kind of behind us

2888
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:11,198
um and i'm not sure how to fix that i

2889
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:14,000
don't know if that's like a fixable

2890
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:16,479
problem interesting i i have a hope that

2891
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,719
it's a fixable problem i think i think

2892
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:20,158
it's fixable because there's demand for

2893
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:22,239
it to be fixed that's the way i think

2894
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:23,839
about it well is twitter that bad right

2895
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:26,158
now like i mean it's fixable in as much

2896
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:27,840
as you can do a verification so you can

2897
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:30,079
give a blue check to someone and then

2898
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,520
that person is like more credible and

2899
01:36:30,079 --> 01:36:33,279
they go to the top of the comments and

2900
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:35,119
there's like tweaks you can do you can

2901
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:36,960
continue to improve it but it's not

2902
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:38,399
going to fix the fact that like twitter

2903
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,920
can decide to

2904
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:41,279
kick off the president and like a lot of

2905
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,960
people are going to be upset by that you

2906
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:46,079
know like there's ways you can improve

2907
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:49,279
the ux over time and they continue to do

2908
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:51,760
so like clubhouse is a is a lot of fun

2909
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:54,319
great phenomenon so it's twitter spaces

2910
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:56,400
so they continue to iterate but the the

2911
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:58,639
censorship to platforming piece i'm not

2912
01:36:56,399 --> 01:36:59,920
sure is fixable because if you i mean

2913
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:02,159
you watch the us government hall these

2914
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:03,840
people hall um

2915
01:37:02,158 --> 01:37:05,279
zuckerberg and dorsey and whatever in

2916
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,520
front of congress

2917
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:08,639
they want more censorship i mean our

2918
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:12,320
elected

2919
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:13,520
leaders want more censorship right see i

2920
01:37:12,319 --> 01:37:16,079
just believe

2921
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:17,280
censorship is a really harsh word

2922
01:37:16,079 --> 01:37:19,118
i believe it's possible to create

2923
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:20,719
technologies where it's not twitter

2924
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:21,439
doing the censorship

2925
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:24,079
but

2926
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:25,759
it's individuals doing their own

2927
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:28,158
selection of what they want and don't

2928
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:30,239
want to see so for example if you get

2929
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:32,238
sick and tired of donald trump and

2930
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:35,279
whatever he says or you love donald

2931
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:38,079
trump you get to select yourself

2932
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:40,399
like you get to have more control over

2933
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:42,399
what you consume twitter tries to do

2934
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:43,279
that a little bit but they obviously

2935
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:45,519
fail

2936
01:37:43,279 --> 01:37:49,519
where ideas

2937
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:52,480
infiltrate our view that we that

2938
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,320
like misinformation spreads really fast

2939
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:56,638
and conspiracy theories spread really

2940
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:59,439
fast to where the immune system that

2941
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:02,159
twitter has created to try to censor

2942
01:37:59,439 --> 01:38:03,279
conspiracy theories and misinformation

2943
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:06,479
is

2944
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:09,920
over firing and you're now censoring

2945
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:11,839
too many people so that to it's exactly

2946
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,760
the same intuition as you said before if

2947
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,520
the state is doing it

2948
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:16,400
in this case twitter is kind of the

2949
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,719
state

2950
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:20,238
it's not going to work out well but if

2951
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:22,880
it individu if you give power to the

2952
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:25,359
individuals to do this sort of the

2953
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,960
not even censorship but

2954
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:28,639
uh incentivization and

2955
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:29,600
de-incentivization

2956
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:33,199
of

2957
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:34,960
great thoughtful content and terrible

2958
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:36,559
low effort content

2959
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,319
uh then

2960
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,159
i feel like that's going to create a

2961
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:42,319
system where there's going to be a much

2962
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:44,879
more open discourse of ideas dangerous

2963
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:46,880
ideas difficult ideas controversial

2964
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:49,199
ideas and people

2965
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:50,800
in a decentralized way will be able to

2966
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:53,439
use their own intelligence to select

2967
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:55,760
content to share content spread content

2968
01:38:53,439 --> 01:38:58,399
let's keep it simple um let's look at

2969
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:01,039
one example uh twitter and jack dorsey

2970
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:03,679
and i think it's quite clear that what

2971
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:06,920
he believes is the solution is as you're

2972
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:10,079
kind of hinting at a more kind of like

2973
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:12,480
regionalized uh system which is not have

2974
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:13,840
one we call federated system right which

2975
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:15,678
does not just have like one company in

2976
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,199
charge of everything but there's an open

2977
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:20,399
protocol and then there's like different

2978
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:22,479
instances right so twitter make you know

2979
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:24,879
jack's dream for twitter is that twitter

2980
01:39:22,479 --> 01:39:26,079
is this open protocol that the russian

2981
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,279
government can use and the chinese

2982
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:28,319
government can use and the iranian

2983
01:39:27,279 --> 01:39:30,000
government can use and the american

2984
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:31,840
government can use and then twitter as a

2985
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,679
company is going to use two and you as

2986
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:35,520
the customer decide which implementation

2987
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:38,319
you want to join and there's going to be

2988
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:41,199
different censorship on each instance or

2989
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:43,679
each federation but uh the protocol

2990
01:39:41,198 --> 01:39:45,198
itself would be like untouchable this is

2991
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,880
kind of like the idea behind the

2992
01:39:45,198 --> 01:39:48,238
internet right there's like

2993
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,960
different parts of the internet that are

2994
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:52,959
censored but like at the very bottom of

2995
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:55,760
the very bottom of the backbone of it

2996
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:58,639
it's like this this globally connected

2997
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:00,239
um relatively unstoppable thing right

2998
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:01,600
so i think that's a pretty good vision

2999
01:40:00,238 --> 01:40:04,158
and twitter's working towards that with

3000
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,760
the blue blue sky like initiative we'll

3001
01:40:04,158 --> 01:40:07,279
see i'm a little skeptical that it like

3002
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,520
works out because i've used i use

3003
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:13,039
mastodon for example mastodon is an

3004
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:15,360
example of a um federated social media

3005
01:40:13,039 --> 01:40:16,880
now it's it's ruled by a benevolent each

3006
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:18,719
instance is ruled by a benevolent

3007
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:21,920
dictator it's just like i happen to like

3008
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:24,880
this one so i know so rather than trust

3009
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:26,399
one dictator twitter you could you could

3010
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,520
you could choose which dictator you want

3011
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:29,519
to trust and that's kind of the

3012
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:31,040
federated model and maybe we head that

3013
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,159
way but you lose things when it's

3014
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:36,238
federated you lose the ux you lose the

3015
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:37,759
slickness and the feel and all the

3016
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:40,319
millions of dollars they spend on

3017
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,320
developers like mastodon is like not

3018
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:44,799
anywhere close to as nice to use as

3019
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:46,000
twitter so i feel like it's again it's

3020
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,279
this trade-off that we make with

3021
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,359
everything where it's convenience

3022
01:40:47,279 --> 01:40:51,439
comfort speed versus privacy and freedom

3023
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:53,599
right it's very hard to have something

3024
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:55,279
that gives you both i don't know i think

3025
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,639
i think uh yeah it is a trade-off have

3026
01:40:55,279 --> 01:40:58,960
you used one of these things that i have

3027
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:00,239
not as good as the federator

3028
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,000
they're not they're not but the

3029
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:05,039
federation i don't think it's it's a

3030
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,719
good i i think uh it requires genius to

3031
01:41:05,039 --> 01:41:09,279
require skill it requires great design

3032
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:10,560
to come up with a way to

3033
01:41:09,279 --> 01:41:12,880
that you know it's

3034
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,560
there's a pareto front here

3035
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:16,639
the trade there's a right way to hit

3036
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,600
that trade-off and i honestly think

3037
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:19,760
there's

3038
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:22,000
the ux

3039
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:24,480
the experience

3040
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:28,479
should be centralized should be designed

3041
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:31,118
by the company but the data yeah and

3042
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:33,359
like a lot of stuff that could be used

3043
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:34,799
to violate your basic rights should be

3044
01:41:33,359 --> 01:41:36,799
owned by the individual and i think

3045
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:40,560
there's a way to decouple those that

3046
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:43,360
create an incredible experience to where

3047
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,480
you go there and you enjoy the market

3048
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:46,719
where you can

3049
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:49,118
share your data and have complete

3050
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:52,158
control over it and always have i mean

3051
01:41:49,118 --> 01:41:53,759
there's a lot of basic ux ideas like

3052
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:56,638
just as an example

3053
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,480
i think there should always be

3054
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:00,400
in everything you design

3055
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:03,678
a one button that's always there that

3056
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:06,319
says forget i ever existed

3057
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:09,279
delete everything you know about me yeah

3058
01:42:06,319 --> 01:42:11,679
and maybe it's maybe it's one button you

3059
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:13,840
click and it asks are you sure and you

3060
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:16,079
have to be able to say yes like that's a

3061
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:18,639
feature that's fundamental to a good

3062
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:20,960
social network i believe like

3063
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:22,719
that currently social networks first of

3064
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,719
all most of them don't allow you to do

3065
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:26,480
that they don't make it transparent how

3066
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:28,639
much data they had who they shared it

3067
01:42:26,479 --> 01:42:30,479
with and they also make it exceptionally

3068
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:33,199
difficult to delete accounts so like

3069
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:36,479
that's a very basic starting point

3070
01:42:33,198 --> 01:42:38,559
but that that having that button means

3071
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:40,079
that you have control but that's step

3072
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:43,039
one of the control there's a

3073
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:45,840
transparency of knowing exactly when

3074
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:47,840
what data is being shared about you how

3075
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:50,319
much data is already being recorded

3076
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:52,560
about you all that is transparency and i

3077
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:54,319
believe in the i believe that's a really

3078
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,719
good business model because when there's

3079
01:42:54,319 --> 01:42:59,198
transparency and control people would be

3080
01:42:56,719 --> 01:43:01,198
willing to give over a lot more data as

3081
01:42:59,198 --> 01:43:02,960
long as they know what they're giving

3082
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:05,599
over as long as they know what they can

3083
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:08,079
delete yeah i guess maybe you're more

3084
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,039
optimistic about people caring about i

3085
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:10,800
feel like

3086
01:43:09,039 --> 01:43:12,319
not ever so few people actually care

3087
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,079
about their their privacy and freedom

3088
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:16,799
i've just watched everybody give it up

3089
01:43:14,079 --> 01:43:19,039
you know um but but we'll see i guess

3090
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,079
just to to bookend that i i think we're

3091
01:43:19,039 --> 01:43:21,840
at this moment where obviously the

3092
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:24,238
centralized platforms are just so much

3093
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:26,319
easier and better to use and to to

3094
01:43:24,238 --> 01:43:28,718
strike it out and and and you know

3095
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:30,799
venture out and use a uh like a

3096
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:32,079
federated instance or something even

3097
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:33,679
like key base which is kind of like a

3098
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:36,719
cool encrypted way to like have group

3099
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:38,639
chats um it just requires like a lot of

3100
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:40,560
your time and a lot of people don't have

3101
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:43,359
that time but i will say one thing like

3102
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:45,280
i do think there's this future where um

3103
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:47,839
we do go into more of this like

3104
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:51,359
uh try it's called a tribal model or

3105
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:52,800
like tribes um which is this social

3106
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:55,920
environment being built on top of

3107
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:57,840
lightning um by uh

3108
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,960
an app called sphinx and the idea is

3109
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,719
like kind of like it's like a

3110
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,960
decentralized slack like you have your

3111
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:04,158
slack instance which has like a bunch of

3112
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:06,239
people in the community and you have

3113
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:08,079
different ways to um message each other

3114
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:10,158
and it's all encrypted and then it has

3115
01:44:08,079 --> 01:44:12,559
like plug-ins for like things like jitsi

3116
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:15,359
instead of zoom so like an open source

3117
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:17,199
encrypted video messenger it has ways to

3118
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:20,799
like plug in the content you want to get

3119
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:22,238
from like uh like different um platforms

3120
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,159
that you follow like podcasts things

3121
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:26,158
like that and again it allows you to pay

3122
01:44:24,158 --> 01:44:27,839
those people directly in a censorship

3123
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:29,599
resistant private way so it's really

3124
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,800
nice to connect to the lighting network

3125
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:32,239
yeah so it's all sort of built on

3126
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,600
lightning but the idea you can think

3127
01:44:32,238 --> 01:44:35,519
about it is like

3128
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,440
you're slowly starting to build up the

3129
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:38,880
idea of a wechat but with freedom

3130
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:40,559
principles right because right now

3131
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:41,920
wechat's like the king of convenience

3132
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,360
and comfort but of course it's feeding

3133
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:45,600
all that data to the big brother and the

3134
01:44:43,359 --> 01:44:47,039
surveillance state um and then we have

3135
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:49,039
like our own versions over here in

3136
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:51,198
america that are not quite as convenient

3137
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:53,359
or amazing but like we give up slightly

3138
01:44:51,198 --> 01:44:55,118
less you know privacy and freedom but

3139
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:56,719
this thing has a lot of promising

3140
01:44:55,118 --> 01:44:58,479
features to it it's worth checking out

3141
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:00,719
it's very like early days like it feels

3142
01:44:58,479 --> 01:45:03,359
like i mean i was pretty young but it

3143
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:05,439
feels like the 90s in the internet like

3144
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:06,799
it has that feeling

3145
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:09,198
yeah you know it's rough around the

3146
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:11,360
edges but you can feel the magic it's

3147
01:45:09,198 --> 01:45:13,678
pretty cool i i'm very much like with

3148
01:45:11,359 --> 01:45:15,439
steve jobs on this uh i think the

3149
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,440
founding principles are exceptionally

3150
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:18,638
important but at the end of the day the

3151
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:20,799
design

3152
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:22,239
of how sleek it is how well how easy it

3153
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,960
is to use

3154
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:26,638
and and that that's not just like pretty

3155
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,158
icing on the cake

3156
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:30,560
that is

3157
01:45:28,158 --> 01:45:32,879
the icing is the cake yeah because like

3158
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:34,880
how easy it is to use how natural it is

3159
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:36,079
it's the trojan horse thing like you

3160
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,400
don't get

3161
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:40,399
it has to be pretty and shiny it has to

3162
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:42,079
have it has to fundamentally connect to

3163
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:44,238
the basics of human nature which is what

3164
01:45:42,079 --> 01:45:45,439
is pleasant to use what feels good to

3165
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:47,439
use

3166
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:49,118
you have to you know to get to trick

3167
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:51,519
people into eating the broccoli you have

3168
01:45:49,118 --> 01:45:53,599
to put like a delicious look at whatever

3169
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:55,679
ptp is the kind of a pain to use right

3170
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:57,600
for you you want privacy yeah so signals

3171
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:58,960
are upgraded way better yep i mean and

3172
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:02,320
it's way better than it was five years

3173
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:04,158
ago and it's it's not quite as good as

3174
01:46:02,319 --> 01:46:07,359
like not quite as seamless right as like

3175
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:09,519
a whatsapp yet um but it's almost there

3176
01:46:07,359 --> 01:46:11,759
and they were able to do it and and

3177
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:13,280
you're gonna see that with with bitcoin

3178
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:15,280
wallets as well i mean they're they're

3179
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:17,359
almost there they're like if you use

3180
01:46:15,279 --> 01:46:18,960
like a moon wallet is like

3181
01:46:17,359 --> 01:46:20,719
i mean it's so cool looking and it's so

3182
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,639
seamless and they've spent so many hours

3183
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:24,560
thinking about your experience

3184
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:26,079
we're getting there whereas 10 years ago

3185
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,920
it's like impossible to use one of the

3186
01:46:26,079 --> 01:46:30,079
things that signal doesn't have and i

3187
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:31,440
believe

3188
01:46:30,079 --> 01:46:33,679
these kinds of

3189
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:35,839
applications need to have it's like a i

3190
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:37,039
hate the term but killer app which is

3191
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,880
like

3192
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:41,198
a dumb

3193
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:42,319
but very viral and popular reason to

3194
01:46:41,198 --> 01:46:44,879
switch

3195
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:48,719
it i didn't see exactly i mean i've been

3196
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:51,600
using signal but i haven't you seen a um

3197
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:53,039
you know uh a big reason to

3198
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:54,480
well you're on it man

3199
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:56,000
i mean the the reason but i haven't

3200
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:58,718
switched everything to it you know what

3201
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,520
i mean like yeah the exodus to signal

3202
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:02,319
was in

3203
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:04,560
in january they had a huge user uh

3204
01:47:02,319 --> 01:47:06,319
surge for two main reasons one

3205
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,239
hilariously enough of course was elon

3206
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:09,198
tweeted like you should use signal right

3207
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:10,959
um

3208
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:13,439
which is not insignificant and then the

3209
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:14,960
other one was that like whatsapp changed

3210
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:16,799
kind of some of its terms of service and

3211
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:19,359
like you know announced to all of its

3212
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,400
users in this little pop-up um that it

3213
01:47:19,359 --> 01:47:22,158
was gonna be sort of like changing the

3214
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:24,479
way it handled your data that spooked a

3215
01:47:22,158 --> 01:47:26,719
lot of people so these two things really

3216
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:28,879
combined um and tens of millions of

3217
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:30,719
people in the following weeks between

3218
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:32,480
january and february joined signal it's

3219
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:33,920
like it really has had its day in the

3220
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:35,839
sun um

3221
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:37,920
and they are like frantically trying to

3222
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:40,239
keep up with it like and it's really

3223
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:42,000
nice to see that uh

3224
01:47:40,238 --> 01:47:44,879
that this encrypted messaging service

3225
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,118
which which prioritizes your privacy

3226
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:49,039
um in a way that you know you know the

3227
01:47:47,118 --> 01:47:50,559
government again may know like the

3228
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:51,760
metadata but doesn't know exactly what

3229
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,440
you're saying unless they can get your

3230
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:55,840
hands on your phone i think that's very

3231
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:57,439
very powerful so it can be done i i

3232
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:59,600
don't want to be uh too jaded here i

3233
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:01,519
think it can be done yeah i think um i

3234
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:03,280
think we can fight back and i think we

3235
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:06,239
can make continue to make these digital

3236
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:08,960
communications tools and platforms um in

3237
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:11,118
a way that that that really benefits us

3238
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:13,920
yeah i'm not i'm not sure but i'm

3239
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:15,519
hopeful as well

3240
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:17,440
i'm hopeful that if you look at the

3241
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:19,920
trend of technologies they ultimately

3242
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:21,279
are ones that respect privacy respect

3243
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:24,158
security

3244
01:48:21,279 --> 01:48:25,679
and um basic human rights i mean that's

3245
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:28,319
at least the hope

3246
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:30,800
so gary kasparov i'm russian

3247
01:48:28,319 --> 01:48:33,439
he means a lot to me on a personal level

3248
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:35,279
he's the chairman of uh human rights

3249
01:48:33,439 --> 01:48:36,799
foundation

3250
01:48:35,279 --> 01:48:39,039
what does gary have to do with anything

3251
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:40,639
what's your relationship like with him

3252
01:48:39,039 --> 01:48:43,039
do you like chess

3253
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:45,520
what what are his specific focuses and

3254
01:48:43,039 --> 01:48:47,118
ideas around the hrf can you just speak

3255
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:49,199
to it in general

3256
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:52,399
yeah so our chairman at the human rights

3257
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:54,719
foundation was vast level uh who of

3258
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:56,399
course was like the famous czech

3259
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,719
democracy activist

3260
01:48:56,399 --> 01:49:01,279
uh who you know helped lead the velvet

3261
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:03,520
revolution and then ended up becoming

3262
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:04,479
the first democratically elected

3263
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:06,159
leader

3264
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:07,839
of the czech republic after the soviet

3265
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:10,319
union fell

3266
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:11,520
he passed away in 2011

3267
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:12,479
and

3268
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:14,800
it was very difficult to find a

3269
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:16,319
replacement uh because who can fill

3270
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,960
hovel's shoes you know

3271
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:20,960
but if one could it would be gary right

3272
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:23,359
so we like really tried to get gary to

3273
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:24,880
join then thankfully he agreed and

3274
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:27,198
we've had an amazing relationship with

3275
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:28,960
gary over the years i mean he's been

3276
01:49:27,198 --> 01:49:30,879
relentless in his pursuit of freedom i

3277
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:32,719
mean he could have retired and taken his

3278
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,239
career in a different direction and he

3279
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:36,239
could be hanging out with putin and have

3280
01:49:34,238 --> 01:49:38,559
a pleasure yacht and all kinds of stuff

3281
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:41,118
but he decided to risk it

3282
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:43,039
and if you actually study like the times

3283
01:49:41,118 --> 01:49:45,039
when he was running for uh president in

3284
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:46,479
russia masha gessen followed him around

3285
01:49:45,039 --> 01:49:48,960
in the man without a face it's a great

3286
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:50,879
great book about putin um there's a

3287
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:53,039
fabulous chapter where she's following

3288
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,880
around gary when he's campaigning and

3289
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:56,399
i mean that he risked a lot i mean he

3290
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,800
can't go back to russia anymore he gave

3291
01:49:56,399 --> 01:50:01,439
up his country um he's given up a huge

3292
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:03,679
amount to be able to speak his mind and

3293
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:05,198
to have this dream this beautiful vision

3294
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:06,960
of a free and democratic russia he

3295
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:08,960
really believes in it it's been a great

3296
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:12,158
experience i work very closely with gary

3297
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:13,920
uh we talk a lot we do different things

3298
01:50:12,158 --> 01:50:15,439
around the world together he's

3299
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,840
he's come out to a lot of events in

3300
01:50:15,439 --> 01:50:19,439
different cities around the world um

3301
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:21,360
and he's been a very active chairman

3302
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:23,359
this isn't some figurehead he's very

3303
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:26,000
involved and it's really really great i

3304
01:50:23,359 --> 01:50:27,598
mean everything he's involved with is uh

3305
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,359
it's you know as one journalist who

3306
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:30,960
attends our events says when he walks in

3307
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:33,839
the room you know the average iq of the

3308
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:35,760
room goes up pretty significantly uh i'm

3309
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:37,279
not i'm not i'm not a big chess person

3310
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,639
unfortunately so i have not been able to

3311
01:50:37,279 --> 01:50:40,079
connect with him on that but i think he

3312
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:41,679
probably would prefer it that way you

3313
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:43,359
know all he gets is people who want to

3314
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:44,880
talk to him about chess you know yeah so

3315
01:50:43,359 --> 01:50:47,439
here we can we can talk about kind of

3316
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,440
human rights strategy and like uh how to

3317
01:50:47,439 --> 01:50:52,079
you know improve our fight against uh

3318
01:50:49,439 --> 01:50:54,559
against dictators but um he he really

3319
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:57,279
you know has that moral clarity that i

3320
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:59,280
that i that i really uh appreciate so

3321
01:50:57,279 --> 01:51:01,279
yeah he's uh so he has a lot of

3322
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:03,840
fascinating ideas about uh artificial

3323
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:07,599
intelligence as well he's opened

3324
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:09,520
my eyes a little bit to the

3325
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:12,719
to the state of russia today because

3326
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:15,040
i've read most books on putin

3327
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:17,679
uh in the english language and sort of

3328
01:51:15,039 --> 01:51:19,039
on trying to understand things

3329
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:20,719
and

3330
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:22,719
i try to look at it from a historical

3331
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:24,560
perspective like almost like

3332
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:27,279
we're living a hundred years from now

3333
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:29,039
and i look at putin as a

3334
01:51:27,279 --> 01:51:32,880
important figure in the history of human

3335
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:34,639
civilization and study it in that way

3336
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:36,079
i think the way gary looks at it he

3337
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:38,800
probably doesn't appreciate me looking

3338
01:51:36,079 --> 01:51:41,519
at the way i do but the way he looks at

3339
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:43,199
it is

3340
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:45,040
we can still

3341
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:46,319
change the direction

3342
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:48,399
of russia

3343
01:51:46,319 --> 01:51:50,719
and we individual human beings and we

3344
01:51:48,399 --> 01:51:51,920
communities and we nations can take

3345
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:53,760
actions

3346
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:56,639
have policies that can change the

3347
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:59,039
direction of russia to me i take a uh

3348
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:01,440
sort of going to the library passive

3349
01:51:59,039 --> 01:52:03,760
view of studying fascinating aspects of

3350
01:52:01,439 --> 01:52:05,759
russia to me russia means

3351
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:07,760
like most of my family suffered through

3352
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:10,000
the soviet union and

3353
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:12,480
i see beauty and suffering the the

3354
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,880
poetry the music the stories

3355
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:17,039
and just there's so much love that

3356
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:19,440
emerged from the pain that i just enjoy

3357
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:20,639
that the music of that but

3358
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:23,759
to gary

3359
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:24,960
and to many activists that i speak to to

3360
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,760
them

3361
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:27,599
they

3362
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:28,800
they love not just the russia of the

3363
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:31,199
past

3364
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:33,440
they have a vision and a hope for russia

3365
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:35,198
of the future and that

3366
01:52:33,439 --> 01:52:37,359
and they criticize me a little bit for

3367
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:39,759
being a little bit too scholarly about

3368
01:52:37,359 --> 01:52:41,679
the past and ignoring the future and

3369
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:43,520
there's something to that so he's he's

3370
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:46,000
he opens my eyes

3371
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:47,360
uh to look to the future of russia gary

3372
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,800
and

3373
01:52:47,359 --> 01:52:50,559
a handful of other russian activists

3374
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,800
that we work closely with including

3375
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:54,400
vladimir kara murza who again i mean

3376
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:57,039
it's just incredibly heroic the man has

3377
01:52:54,399 --> 01:52:58,960
survived two poisonings by putin

3378
01:52:57,039 --> 01:53:01,279
um they like to say that you know

3379
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:03,118
russians will bring democracy

3380
01:53:01,279 --> 01:53:05,359
to russia on their own terms they don't

3381
01:53:03,118 --> 01:53:06,799
need our help this is what vladimir

3382
01:53:05,359 --> 01:53:08,238
especially says

3383
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:10,400
but what he does say is that we should

3384
01:53:08,238 --> 01:53:12,319
stop propping up putin like that that's

3385
01:53:10,399 --> 01:53:14,399
kind of his uh stop uh kind of

3386
01:53:12,319 --> 01:53:15,920
legitimizing him that that's kind of his

3387
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:17,839
argument he's like we don't need your

3388
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:19,279
foreign interference we don't need your

3389
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:20,880
ideas we don't you know we don't need

3390
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:23,039
your help we can do it on our own but

3391
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:24,639
please stop like propping up our you

3392
01:53:23,039 --> 01:53:26,639
know illegitimate ruler that's kind of

3393
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:28,800
like his point of view which which i

3394
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:30,159
think is interesting um

3395
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:33,520
and fair

3396
01:53:30,158 --> 01:53:34,960
yeah let me just say on one unrelated

3397
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,800
comment

3398
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:39,279
some people criticize me

3399
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:42,320
and others like joe rogan for giving

3400
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:42,319
people a platform

3401
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:49,039
i think in some cases that's applicable

3402
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:50,880
but i think in most cases

3403
01:53:49,039 --> 01:53:51,760
knowledge is power

3404
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:53,279
and

3405
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:55,440
there's no such thing as giving a

3406
01:53:53,279 --> 01:53:56,559
platform the conversation just shines a

3407
01:53:55,439 --> 01:53:58,879
light

3408
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:02,080
as long as you shine the light well and

3409
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:03,840
uh as long as in shining the light and

3410
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:05,760
having the conversation you reveal

3411
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:07,360
something fundamental

3412
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:08,400
about the state of things about the

3413
01:54:07,359 --> 01:54:10,719
people

3414
01:54:08,399 --> 01:54:12,079
whether that's putin or some of the

3415
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:13,920
other controversial figures that have

3416
01:54:12,079 --> 01:54:17,198
come up

3417
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:19,920
in possible future conversations so um i

3418
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:22,319
don't like this kind of platforming idea

3419
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:24,079
i think conversations save us don't they

3420
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:25,920
don't destroy us

3421
01:54:24,079 --> 01:54:28,158
yeah i mean that's that's journalism

3422
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:30,239
though i mean that's very different from

3423
01:54:28,158 --> 01:54:31,118
you know advocacy or strategic thinking

3424
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:33,598
about

3425
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:35,279
what to do with russia um absolutely

3426
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:36,639
yeah we should interview everybody and

3427
01:54:35,279 --> 01:54:38,559
everybody should know exactly what

3428
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:40,400
they're thinking yeah you know but i you

3429
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:42,159
know journalism to me has become a dirty

3430
01:54:40,399 --> 01:54:44,479
word because

3431
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:47,598
because it's done so poorly by so many

3432
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:47,598
people that um

3433
01:54:48,238 --> 01:54:52,959
you know i listen to sometimes certain

3434
01:54:50,319 --> 01:54:55,759
programs like i don't know

3435
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:58,158
like uh meet the press and the fox

3436
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:00,400
sunday program just certain things just

3437
01:54:58,158 --> 01:55:01,679
to tune in and see what different news

3438
01:55:00,399 --> 01:55:03,279
medias

3439
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:05,279
are paying attention to and the kind of

3440
01:55:03,279 --> 01:55:07,519
interviews they do you know

3441
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:09,279
is like f five minutes at most but

3442
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:12,000
usually it's like one minute it's these

3443
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:13,759
quick clip things

3444
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,880
and it's very gotcha and they're looking

3445
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:18,639
for ways to to sort of grab almost a

3446
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:19,679
misstatement they want to catch you off

3447
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:22,239
guard

3448
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:23,760
they want to ask the quote like like the

3449
01:55:22,238 --> 01:55:26,638
harsh question

3450
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:28,960
but without any of the like the dance of

3451
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:30,800
conversation that reveals the truth

3452
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,679
you know you can't just get to the truth

3453
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:33,520
by

3454
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:34,639
asking it

3455
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:36,400
you have to

3456
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:39,039
sneak up on it

3457
01:55:36,399 --> 01:55:41,598
and i think that's an art form and i

3458
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:43,599
think that art form involves long-form

3459
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,639
conversation like i'm a huge believer in

3460
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:46,079
just

3461
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:48,159
i guess that's what's called i don't

3462
01:55:46,079 --> 01:55:50,319
know in-depth journal or whatever like

3463
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:52,719
where you spend months or years on the

3464
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:55,439
story yeah and then in that same way i

3465
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:57,118
think of long-form conversation is like

3466
01:55:55,439 --> 01:55:58,719
you spend many hours and you spend

3467
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:01,439
months and years preparing for those

3468
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:03,760
many hours but like it's not this

3469
01:56:01,439 --> 01:56:05,359
like short form trying to

3470
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:07,280
trying to get the most controversial

3471
01:56:05,359 --> 01:56:09,598
little tidbit of a story out and

3472
01:56:07,279 --> 01:56:11,599
unfortunately the funding mechanisms

3473
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:14,480
behind journalism are such that they are

3474
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:15,279
incentivized clickbait journalism versus

3475
01:56:14,479 --> 01:56:18,079
like

3476
01:56:15,279 --> 01:56:19,679
in-depth right long-form digging for the

3477
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:21,439
truth i have a conflicted relationship

3478
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:23,520
with journalism because to me press

3479
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:24,559
freedom is so core right and independent

3480
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:26,960
journalists around the world are so

3481
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:30,719
brave yes um and especially in countries

3482
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:32,000
like russia or china et cetera and um

3483
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:34,158
really good journalism is still

3484
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,560
something i absolutely i love and i

3485
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:38,000
enjoy like this especially like to say

3486
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,520
again this new yorker piece on what's

3487
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,679
happening to the uyghurs is incredibly

3488
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:43,040
well reported however

3489
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:44,319
by the you know on the other hand you

3490
01:56:43,039 --> 01:56:46,158
have um

3491
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:47,198
in this sort of clickbaity

3492
01:56:46,158 --> 01:56:49,198
journalism that's all about

3493
01:56:47,198 --> 01:56:52,238
sensationalism and and that gets used as

3494
01:56:49,198 --> 01:56:54,319
a tool i mean you know whether it be

3495
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:56,079
against things like privacy or bitcoin

3496
01:56:54,319 --> 01:56:58,479
or whatever you have like people who

3497
01:56:56,079 --> 01:57:00,639
sensationalize and it gets used in the

3498
01:56:58,479 --> 01:57:02,559
service of the surveillance state the

3499
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:04,960
war on terror whatever you know it's

3500
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:06,239
it's difficult but you know i think

3501
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:09,439
journalism is essential to a free

3502
01:57:06,238 --> 01:57:11,439
society um but

3503
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:13,598
it can it can sometimes be it can wear

3504
01:57:11,439 --> 01:57:15,359
my patients thin sometimes like it's

3505
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:17,279
been uh to be honest has been a huge

3506
01:57:15,359 --> 01:57:18,799
burden on me personally if i were to

3507
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:21,039
just turn this into a therapy session

3508
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:22,880
for a brief moment when i look at people

3509
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:24,880
when i interact with people i'd like to

3510
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:27,039
see the best in them

3511
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:28,960
and

3512
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:32,238
the burden that weighs heavy on me is

3513
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:33,760
sometimes people i talk to may not be

3514
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:35,678
good people

3515
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:38,159
and i don't

3516
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:41,199
i'd love to i believe everybody has good

3517
01:57:38,158 --> 01:57:43,359
in them and i try to focus on that

3518
01:57:41,198 --> 01:57:45,359
the burden that weighs on me

3519
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:47,439
is sometimes that

3520
01:57:45,359 --> 01:57:49,759
there may be conversations where that's

3521
01:57:47,439 --> 01:57:50,799
irresponsible

3522
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:53,440
where

3523
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:55,520
i have to also call people out

3524
01:57:53,439 --> 01:57:58,000
i have to do enough the hard lifting and

3525
01:57:55,520 --> 01:58:00,000
the hard work of knowing exactly

3526
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,520
what are the bad things that that person

3527
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,679
has done

3528
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:05,920
and i also have the responsibility to

3529
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:07,359
call them out on it and that's for me

3530
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:08,639
personally just not an unpleasant

3531
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:10,000
feeling that's where speaking to

3532
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:12,079
journalism

3533
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:14,639
like i think journalists are too much

3534
01:58:12,079 --> 01:58:16,719
focused on the

3535
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:19,118
the bad things a person has done

3536
01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:22,800
and not enough on the digging into the

3537
01:58:19,118 --> 01:58:24,399
the the full complexity of the human

3538
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:27,199
being behind all the things that have

3539
01:58:24,399 --> 01:58:29,279
been done but at the same time

3540
01:58:27,198 --> 01:58:30,960
you know i can't have a conversation

3541
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:34,000
with hitler

3542
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:35,599
and not ask about the prison camps yeah

3543
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,279
yeah yeah no so from the human rights

3544
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:39,360
perspective one of our programs is we

3545
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:41,039
like we try to

3546
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:43,920
go after people who do like pr for

3547
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:45,599
dictators so like

3548
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:47,118
like then a lot of people do like pr

3549
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:48,480
firms in washington get hired by all

3550
01:58:47,118 --> 01:58:49,439
these dictators

3551
01:58:48,479 --> 01:58:51,039
um

3552
01:58:49,439 --> 01:58:52,399
and they make a lot of money to make

3553
01:58:51,039 --> 01:58:54,079
them look good it's called whitewashing

3554
01:58:52,399 --> 01:58:55,679
or putting lipstick on a pig or whatever

3555
01:58:54,079 --> 01:58:57,118
you want to do astroturfing is like the

3556
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:58,319
fake make like fake social media

3557
01:58:57,118 --> 01:58:59,359
accounts to make it seem like you're

3558
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:01,920
popular

3559
01:58:59,359 --> 01:59:04,799
um but whitewashing is a huge issue so

3560
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:06,719
um i think it's completely fair to

3561
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:09,199
interview like dictators and stuff like

3562
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:11,679
that amanpour does a pretty good job

3563
01:59:09,198 --> 01:59:13,359
she's she's really good she

3564
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:15,359
she makes sure that there's no messing

3565
01:59:13,359 --> 01:59:17,598
around i mean her interviews of

3566
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:19,039
mussolini recently the ugandan dictator

3567
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:21,039
was very good i mean she's basically

3568
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:22,560
like well like

3569
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:24,560
why are you rigging another election

3570
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:26,639
please tell us you know and she's

3571
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:28,480
fearless and she's good and that can be

3572
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:30,960
a helpful thing to have on youtube as a

3573
01:59:28,479 --> 01:59:32,319
resource um but it's it's it's quite

3574
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:35,359
clear when

3575
01:59:32,319 --> 01:59:36,960
when it descends into a pr session and

3576
01:59:35,359 --> 01:59:39,679
you just have to be like very careful

3577
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:41,359
about it like asma al-assad the wife of

3578
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:43,359
the butcher in syria

3579
01:59:41,359 --> 01:59:45,118
you know was like profiled by by vogue

3580
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:47,359
and it was this whole rose in the desert

3581
01:59:45,118 --> 01:59:50,158
things a bunch of nonsense terrible

3582
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:53,519
terrible terrible uh total propaganda

3583
01:59:50,158 --> 01:59:55,198
but a like honest interview where

3584
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:57,199
you uh you know you're asking about all

3585
01:59:55,198 --> 01:59:58,960
the tough questions

3586
01:59:57,198 --> 02:00:00,960
um very important you know so i think i

3587
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:02,880
think it's just a matter of like content

3588
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:05,679
is there a good resource to study

3589
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:07,199
washing like to know what manipulative

3590
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:09,520
pr looks like

3591
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:11,039
i think you just you should know if

3592
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:13,360
you've researched the topic you should

3593
02:00:11,039 --> 02:00:15,439
know it inside you because it would be

3594
02:00:13,359 --> 02:00:16,960
is there anything you're afraid to ask

3595
02:00:15,439 --> 02:00:18,399
that would be make sure you're asking

3596
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:19,840
all the questions as long as you're

3597
02:00:18,399 --> 02:00:21,439
asking all the questions that you have

3598
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:23,199
you're good but if there's something

3599
02:00:21,439 --> 02:00:25,359
you're afraid to ask

3600
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:27,678
then then maybe you're self-censoring

3601
02:00:25,359 --> 02:00:29,519
right that's a good way it's it takes us

3602
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:31,279
back to that like uh what is it that

3603
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:32,960
litmus test about

3604
02:00:31,279 --> 02:00:35,759
uh is your country allowed to have a gay

3605
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:35,760
pride parade yeah

3606
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:39,360
so there's like obvious things that

3607
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:41,119
might be on your mind that you just want

3608
02:00:39,359 --> 02:00:42,238
to ask and uh you shouldn't you

3609
02:00:41,118 --> 02:00:43,519
shouldn't run for that as long as you

3610
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:44,799
feel like you're a free person when

3611
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,000
you're interviewing

3612
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:48,560
i think you're good

3613
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:50,319
that's beautifully put

3614
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:52,639
are there books

3615
02:00:50,319 --> 02:00:55,039
technical fiction philosophical that had

3616
02:00:52,639 --> 02:00:57,279
a impact on your life

3617
02:00:55,039 --> 02:00:58,719
that you recommend or even resources

3618
02:00:57,279 --> 02:00:59,840
like blogs

3619
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:01,439
films

3620
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:03,279
i have

3621
02:01:01,439 --> 02:01:06,319
four books i'll briefly mention

3622
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:08,399
um number one is the fear the fear had a

3623
02:01:06,319 --> 02:01:10,399
deep impact on me the fear was written

3624
02:01:08,399 --> 02:01:12,638
by peter godwin it's about the

3625
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:16,000
systematic dismantling of zimbabwe under

3626
02:01:12,639 --> 02:01:18,159
robert mugabe peter zimbabwean and it is

3627
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:20,238
a riveting book i think everyone should

3628
02:01:18,158 --> 02:01:21,679
read it because it helps you understand

3629
02:01:20,238 --> 02:01:24,319
what it's like to go through not just

3630
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:26,319
authoritarianism but also hyperinflation

3631
02:01:24,319 --> 02:01:28,238
and i mean really you know at the end of

3632
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:30,158
the day what the fear describes is how

3633
02:01:28,238 --> 02:01:32,399
mugabe took this country

3634
02:01:30,158 --> 02:01:35,039
in the 1980s and he actually brought it

3635
02:01:32,399 --> 02:01:37,198
back in time to the 1920s in terms of

3636
02:01:35,039 --> 02:01:39,359
infrastructure literacy rates health

3637
02:01:37,198 --> 02:01:41,439
rates all these things he stole so much

3638
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:44,158
from the people and it's a heartbreaking

3639
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:46,879
book but it's a very important book um

3640
02:01:44,158 --> 02:01:49,118
and it's a it's a way to do

3641
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:51,359
excellent excellent journalism

3642
02:01:49,118 --> 02:01:52,559
so the fear is a good one isn't this a

3643
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:55,359
personal story

3644
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:57,199
absolutely yeah because he he was it's

3645
02:01:55,359 --> 02:01:58,399
part of his whole family story and he's

3646
02:01:57,198 --> 02:02:00,319
in there he's interviewing people

3647
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:02,559
personally um

3648
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:04,399
so i i would say that one is it also

3649
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:06,400
connected and sorry to interrupt is it

3650
02:02:04,399 --> 02:02:08,559
is it from the inflation perspective is

3651
02:02:06,399 --> 02:02:09,759
it is a good study of hyperinflation and

3652
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:12,320
the effects

3653
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:14,480
does uh does bitcoin at all come as a as

3654
02:02:12,319 --> 02:02:14,479
a

3655
02:02:14,719 --> 02:02:19,279
no you know a discussion of money does

3656
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:20,960
that come into this or is it purely the

3657
02:02:19,279 --> 02:02:22,800
experience of inflation is almost a

3658
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:24,399
symptom of an authoritarian a little bit

3659
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:25,840
a little bit i would say it's not deep i

3660
02:02:24,399 --> 02:02:27,759
have another book on on that which i'll

3661
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:30,079
recommend in a second but

3662
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:31,599
i would just say that it's it's a very

3663
02:02:30,079 --> 02:02:34,158
powerfully written

3664
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:35,360
book about how society can

3665
02:02:34,158 --> 02:02:37,359
uh

3666
02:02:35,359 --> 02:02:40,479
basically deteriorate and how you can

3667
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:42,000
lose everything um the second book is i

3668
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:44,319
just mentioned it but the man without a

3669
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,399
face by masha gessen incredible book

3670
02:02:44,319 --> 02:02:47,599
about modern russia and putin just a

3671
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:49,359
masterpiece

3672
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:51,039
so that would be one of your favorite

3673
02:02:49,359 --> 02:02:53,279
books about putin in russia that one's

3674
02:02:51,039 --> 02:02:55,039
the best i mean she's just so fearless

3675
02:02:53,279 --> 02:02:55,840
incredible she interviews putin in the

3676
02:02:55,039 --> 02:02:58,880
book

3677
02:02:55,840 --> 02:03:00,400
at the end it's really good um

3678
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:03,199
third one is a fiction book

3679
02:03:00,399 --> 02:03:04,638
uh called the mandibles uh written by

3680
02:03:03,198 --> 02:03:06,000
lionel shriver

3681
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:08,560
this one's good it's a good gift book

3682
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:10,880
it's funny it's dark it's witty but it's

3683
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:12,480
about the united states

3684
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:14,719
losing its status as the reserve

3685
02:03:12,479 --> 02:03:15,919
currency and going into hyperinflation

3686
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:17,920
and what's interesting is that the

3687
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:19,840
characters in the book map

3688
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:21,118
where we are today the book itself is

3689
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:24,159
about the late i think it's the late

3690
02:03:21,118 --> 02:03:26,479
2020s and we have a populist president

3691
02:03:24,158 --> 02:03:27,759
who decides to announce that the united

3692
02:03:26,479 --> 02:03:29,439
states is like basically going to

3693
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:31,840
default on its debts and the rest of the

3694
02:03:29,439 --> 02:03:33,439
world comes up with like a new currency

3695
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:34,880
and everybody switches to that one and

3696
02:03:33,439 --> 02:03:37,678
the dollar like overnight becomes

3697
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:39,840
worthless and all these like economists

3698
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:41,440
are saying no it's fine like inflation

3699
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:43,119
won't be a problem

3700
02:03:41,439 --> 02:03:45,919
and there's this one character who's an

3701
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:47,198
icon who's like an economist and he he's

3702
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:49,039
basically he gets to the point where

3703
02:03:47,198 --> 02:03:50,799
he's living as a refugee in prospect

3704
02:03:49,039 --> 02:03:52,880
park in brooklyn and he's still saying

3705
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:55,199
everything's fine you know so it's like

3706
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:57,440
it's dry it's witty but it's also about

3707
02:03:55,198 --> 02:04:00,158
um the surveillance state it's about

3708
02:03:57,439 --> 02:04:01,919
centralization of power it's really good

3709
02:04:00,158 --> 02:04:04,638
so the mandibles i would highly

3710
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:06,880
recommend um so those three books and

3711
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:08,319
then on the topic of bitcoin because we

3712
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:10,239
talked about it a lot i would just say

3713
02:04:08,319 --> 02:04:12,078
that my portal into bitcoin was the

3714
02:04:10,238 --> 02:04:15,279
internet of money by andreas

3715
02:04:12,078 --> 02:04:17,198
antonopoulos oh wow and i did it by

3716
02:04:15,279 --> 02:04:18,639
audiobook and

3717
02:04:17,198 --> 02:04:20,158
i just think this is an important one

3718
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:22,000
for people to start with

3719
02:04:20,158 --> 02:04:25,439
because he goes through all the main

3720
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:27,198
concepts whether it be proof of work or

3721
02:04:25,439 --> 02:04:29,198
you know how the network functions but

3722
02:04:27,198 --> 02:04:31,759
he does it in a way that's extremely

3723
02:04:29,198 --> 02:04:33,519
engaging and really fascinating and it

3724
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:36,159
really just kind of like sparked my

3725
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:37,440
curiosity is it is it discussing the

3726
02:04:36,158 --> 02:04:38,799
the technical sides are also the

3727
02:04:37,439 --> 02:04:40,559
philosophical because a lot of people

3728
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:42,239
mention sort of the bitcoin standard is

3729
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:44,159
the philosophical entry into the whole

3730
02:04:42,238 --> 02:04:46,078
bitcoin world very different from the

3731
02:04:44,158 --> 02:04:48,399
bitcoin standard it's it's more for like

3732
02:04:46,078 --> 02:04:50,319
the average person um it's not a history

3733
02:04:48,399 --> 02:04:52,319
book it's a collection of his talks that

3734
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:54,559
he gave over like two or three years

3735
02:04:52,319 --> 02:04:56,880
it's not very technical it's very

3736
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:58,239
approachable yeah um and some of it

3737
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:00,159
might be dated now because it's like

3738
02:04:58,238 --> 02:05:02,158
2015 2016.

3739
02:05:00,158 --> 02:05:04,719
but i mean it's great it's great to hear

3740
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:06,319
a shout out for andres because he he

3741
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:07,679
seems to be one of the seminal figures

3742
02:05:06,319 --> 02:05:10,479
to sort of uh

3743
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:12,319
make bitcoin ideas accessible oh andre

3744
02:05:10,479 --> 02:05:14,238
this is the ghost he's the

3745
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:15,439
trace is the ghost trace is the ghost i

3746
02:05:14,238 --> 02:05:17,279
know a lot of people have issues with

3747
02:05:15,439 --> 02:05:18,960
some of his like more recent work but

3748
02:05:17,279 --> 02:05:20,078
andres is the goat i mean yeah he's the

3749
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:21,840
reason i'm in bitcoin i mean he's the

3750
02:05:20,078 --> 02:05:23,759
reason i'm in bitcoin so yeah that's

3751
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:25,520
that's fascinating it's and it's it's

3752
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:28,639
funny it's funny to watch the bitcoin

3753
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:31,360
maximalist immune system also attacking

3754
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:33,520
uh attacking him and and this whole

3755
02:05:31,359 --> 02:05:34,719
feedback mechanism is working together

3756
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:36,960
it's fascinating well i probably

3757
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:38,960
consider myself a maximalist but i

3758
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:41,359
really like andreas so i think there's

3759
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:43,760
room for nuance there's room for nuance

3760
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:46,839
in this world i'm glad to hear that uh

3761
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:50,960
if people are fascinated by your work

3762
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:52,639
what is the way to get more of alex

3763
02:05:50,960 --> 02:05:54,560
so two years ago

3764
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:56,000
i came together with seven other people

3765
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:57,760
from around the world and we wrote a

3766
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,880
book in a book sprint we lived in a

3767
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:00,400
house for four days we wrote a book

3768
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:02,239
together it was really cool it's like a

3769
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:05,118
design sprint but we did it in book

3770
02:06:02,238 --> 02:06:06,319
format and my co-authors are from

3771
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:09,198
nigeria

3772
02:06:06,319 --> 02:06:10,960
venezuela the philippines from former

3773
02:06:09,198 --> 02:06:13,439
soviet union from all over and it's

3774
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:15,359
called the little bitcoin book and

3775
02:06:13,439 --> 02:06:16,559
i'm still proud of it it's 100 pages

3776
02:06:15,359 --> 02:06:18,719
it's something you give to somebody who

3777
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:20,719
knows nothing about the topic and it's

3778
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:22,480
not a technical book it's about the sort

3779
02:06:20,719 --> 02:06:24,719
of social political

3780
02:06:22,479 --> 02:06:26,399

3792
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,359

3793
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,400
that

3794
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:57,359
um

3795
02:06:54,399 --> 02:06:59,198
i also made a video that did very well

3796
02:06:57,359 --> 02:07:00,639
for reason magazine called why is

3797
02:06:59,198 --> 02:07:02,960
bitcoin protecting human rights around

3798
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:04,639
the world it's five minutes and it just

3799
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:05,920
i feel like i tried to boil everything

3800
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:07,520
that i

3801
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:08,719
that i want to tell you into this five

3802
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:10,880
minute video

3803
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:13,359
so there's that um i would recommend

3804
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:15,199
that and then if you're interested in

3805
02:07:13,359 --> 02:07:17,198
the

3806
02:07:15,198 --> 02:07:18,879
why have governments not stopped it

3807
02:07:17,198 --> 02:07:20,719
which i think is really intriguing i

3808
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:22,078
wrote this long essay in quillette in

3809
02:07:20,719 --> 02:07:23,760
february called

3810
02:07:22,078 --> 02:07:25,920
you know um

3811
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,920
why haven't governments banned bitcoin

3812
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:29,359
and um maybe that'll be a helpful guide

3813
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:31,118
to some folks is this speaking to the

3814
02:07:29,359 --> 02:07:33,679
trojan horse idea that there's something

3815
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:35,359
uh enticing about it yeah at the end it

3816
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:36,719
does get into that but it really also

3817
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:39,439
just kind of goes through technically

3818
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:41,439
why is it hard to do a 51 attack like

3819
02:07:39,439 --> 02:07:43,279
why would like if a government wanted to

3820
02:07:41,439 --> 02:07:44,879
could it really get all that equipment

3821
02:07:43,279 --> 02:07:46,800
there's a semiconductor shortage like it

3822
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:48,319
can't like there's like certain things

3823
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:50,639
that stop governments from doing it

3824
02:07:48,319 --> 02:07:52,840
right and same thing with like this idea

3825
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:55,679
of a 6102 which would be

3826
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:58,880
um based on the idea of the executive

3827
02:07:55,679 --> 02:08:00,399
order 6102 which is from 1933 when fdr

3828
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:02,159
made holding gold illegal in the united

3829
02:08:00,399 --> 02:08:03,920
states the idea is that like banks would

3830
02:08:02,158 --> 02:08:05,759
go around now with governments and try

3831
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:08,239
to like steal everybody's bitcoin well

3832
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:09,920
in bitcoin we have like a practice um

3833
02:08:08,238 --> 02:08:11,118
called proof of keys day every january

3834
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:12,480
3rd

3835
02:08:11,118 --> 02:08:14,238
you know which is coinciding with the

3836
02:08:12,479 --> 02:08:15,598
launch of the bitcoin blockchain where

3837
02:08:14,238 --> 02:08:17,519
we all like withdraw our keys from

3838
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:19,119
exchanges and we'd be sovereign users

3839
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:20,800
what we're doing is we're preparing for

3840
02:08:19,118 --> 02:08:23,118
a 6102 attack which will one day

3841
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:24,880
probably come right so

3842
02:08:23,118 --> 02:08:26,960
the essay just goes through all of the

3843
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:28,480
like possible attacks and it runs

3844
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:29,679
through like the ones that happened like

3845
02:08:28,479 --> 02:08:31,279
the chinese and indian governments the

3846
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:33,840
two largest governments in the world

3847
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:35,519
both tried to attack bitcoin by banning

3848
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:37,679
their citizens from exchanging fiat for

3849
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:39,440
bitcoin it didn't work interest instead

3850
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:41,279
exploded it's like the barbra streisand

3851
02:08:39,439 --> 02:08:43,279
effect where

3852
02:08:41,279 --> 02:08:45,118
ins when you know by

3853
02:08:43,279 --> 02:08:47,279
by making something public and saying

3854
02:08:45,118 --> 02:08:50,880
you shouldn't do x it actually increases

3855
02:08:47,279 --> 02:08:52,559
attention about x a lot more right um

3856
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:53,760
so i i think there's a lot of

3857
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:56,000
interesting game theory there that

3858
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:58,239
people would enjoy do you think uh

3859
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,078
are you do you seriously concerned about

3860
02:08:58,238 --> 02:09:02,399
this kind of thing where

3861
02:09:00,078 --> 02:09:04,319
the ideas of sovereignty and that

3862
02:09:02,399 --> 02:09:05,920
bitcoin espouses would would actually

3863
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:08,880
one day be tested

3864
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:10,639
do you have a like a legitimate concern

3865
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:12,239
because you said like one day very well

3866
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:14,400
might

3867
02:09:12,238 --> 02:09:16,319
do you think it might

3868
02:09:14,399 --> 02:09:19,359
yeah well first of all bitcoin has been

3869
02:09:16,319 --> 02:09:20,799
attacked again many times and

3870
02:09:19,359 --> 02:09:22,319
we talk about the

3871
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:23,920
you spoke about this with nick carter on

3872
02:09:22,319 --> 02:09:26,078
your show um

3873
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:27,440
the sort of protocol wars or conflict or

3874
02:09:26,078 --> 02:09:28,799
whatever right and

3875
02:09:27,439 --> 02:09:30,719
bitcoin almost died a whole bunch of

3876
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:32,480
times during that and ended up surviving

3877
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:34,639
oh wow i didn't i didn't know how bad

3878
02:09:32,479 --> 02:09:35,359
the box oh it got blocked really bad it

3879
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:37,520
was

3880
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:39,679
it was a sort of a very existential

3881
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:42,560
threat and um bitcoin survived and

3882
02:09:39,679 --> 02:09:44,960
that's why i'm so intrigued by it is

3883
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:46,400
that it it basically survived

3884
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:48,239
an attack

3885
02:09:46,399 --> 02:09:49,679
in an environment several years ago when

3886
02:09:48,238 --> 02:09:52,158
bitcoin was much more vulnerable than it

3887
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:54,000
is today um it survived an attack by a

3888
02:09:52,158 --> 02:09:57,359
conglomeration of chinese billionaires

3889
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,639
silicon valley corporations and a ton of

3890
02:09:57,359 --> 02:10:00,799
people who owned the majority of the

3891
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:03,039
hash rate and all this infrastructure

3892
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:04,639
they had 83 of all the hash rate and

3893
02:10:03,039 --> 02:10:06,319
they couldn't get what they wanted and

3894
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:08,239
that was so intriguing to me like why

3895
02:10:06,319 --> 02:10:10,479
didn't it why i didn't get killed

3896
02:10:08,238 --> 02:10:12,799
so as nick said i think you should read

3897
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:14,319
the block size war which is a book on

3898
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:16,880
that you can get on amazon by jonathan

3899
02:10:14,319 --> 02:10:18,639
beer really good kind of like really

3900
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:20,960
important to understand

3901
02:10:18,639 --> 02:10:22,800
the the the scaling conflict and the

3902
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:24,239
visions over the different visions of

3903
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:25,520
what bitcoin should be

3904
02:10:24,238 --> 02:10:27,118
and you know again people like me

3905
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:29,679
believe it should be a freedom tool not

3906
02:10:27,118 --> 02:10:31,519
like a payments technology for retail

3907
02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:33,920
and i'm just i'm glad it worked out the

3908
02:10:31,520 --> 02:10:36,639
way it did because it almost didn't

3909
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:38,158
do you think uh humans civilization will

3910
02:10:36,639 --> 02:10:41,520
destroy itself

3911
02:10:38,158 --> 02:10:42,799
so if we think about all the threats

3912
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:45,920
facing

3913
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:48,639
human civilization uh nuclear war

3914
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:50,639
natural or engineer pandemics

3915
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:53,920
you know we talk about human rights

3916
02:10:50,639 --> 02:10:56,719
violations we talk about uh

3917
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:58,639
authoritarian governments yeah uh taking

3918
02:10:56,719 --> 02:11:01,359
control of the money supply yeah but do

3919
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:03,920
you have great grander concerns for the

3920
02:11:01,359 --> 02:11:05,279
future of human civilization

3921
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:07,760
do you have hope for us becoming

3922
02:11:05,279 --> 02:11:09,840
multi-planetary species

3923
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:11,760
yeah i mean i i guess long term we'd

3924
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:13,520
want to decentralize right we don't want

3925
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:14,800
a single point of failure in a physical

3926
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:16,079
speech because the earth is a single

3927
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:17,679
point of failure

3928
02:11:16,078 --> 02:11:20,799
um but no i mean you look at all this

3929
02:11:17,679 --> 02:11:22,399
kind of like space uh fiction and i mean

3930
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:24,079
who would want to live on mars man it's

3931
02:11:22,399 --> 02:11:25,920
like a freaking desert i mean the earth

3932
02:11:24,078 --> 02:11:28,238
is so beautiful i hope we can

3933
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:29,520
save it you know it's just so gorgeous

3934
02:11:28,238 --> 02:11:31,519
when you look at the earth compared to

3935
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:33,360
any other like exoplanet or whatever you

3936
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:36,320
look at it i mean the earth is so

3937
02:11:33,359 --> 02:11:38,000
spectacular and wondrous and singular i

3938
02:11:36,319 --> 02:11:39,359
think we've got to do everything we can

3939
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,599
to save it here

3940
02:11:39,359 --> 02:11:43,359
that's funny i mean i uh

3941
02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:46,000
sure a lot of people would have said

3942
02:11:43,359 --> 02:11:48,000
that about europe uh before the

3943
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:50,719
explorers ventured out

3944
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,880
uh columbus and the rest on to the

3945
02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:55,118
unknown the the thing about human nature

3946
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:58,000
is that we are explorers too

3947
02:11:55,118 --> 02:12:00,799
some small fraction of us are insane

3948
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:02,800
enough to explore in the most dangerous

3949
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,960
uh grounds and i'm pretty sure there's

3950
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:06,960
quite a few people that would love

3951
02:12:04,960 --> 02:12:08,719
to take the first step on mars the first

3952
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:10,560
few steps on mars

3953
02:12:08,719 --> 02:12:13,840
in the harshest of environments even

3954
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:16,639
when the odds of survival extremely low

3955
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:19,039
and i'm thankful for those people

3956
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:20,560
as i sit back and drink my vodka back

3957
02:12:19,039 --> 02:12:23,359
here on earth and enjoy

3958
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:25,520
friendships because i think ultimately

3959
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:29,759
that step to mars

3960
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:32,400
is going to be a first step into a multi

3961
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:35,039
into uh exploring and colonizing the

3962
02:12:32,399 --> 02:12:38,479
rest of the galaxy mars might be a harsh

3963
02:12:35,039 --> 02:12:39,760
environment but maybe space is not

3964
02:12:38,479 --> 02:12:42,718
uh like

3965
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:45,199
uh other planets other exoplanets but

3966
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:48,078
also forget planets just creating

3967
02:12:45,198 --> 02:12:49,759
colonies that flow about in space

3968
02:12:48,078 --> 02:12:51,039
there's exciting technologies that are

3969
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:52,560
yet to be discovered yet to be

3970
02:12:51,039 --> 02:12:54,560
engineered and built

3971
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:55,360
that i think require that first painful

3972
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:57,599
step

3973
02:12:55,359 --> 02:12:59,519
like uh yeah the journey of a thousand

3974
02:12:57,599 --> 02:13:02,480
miles starts with one step i think mars

3975
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:04,239
is that first step yeah no i was born

3976
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:06,799
the day before the challenger blew up

3977
02:13:04,238 --> 02:13:08,078
and it was always so tragic for me to

3978
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:10,719
look back on that because that really

3979
02:13:08,078 --> 02:13:12,799
like altered our arc in terms of space

3980
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:14,399
exploration like that had not happened

3981
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:16,480
we'd be in a very different arc and i do

3982
02:13:14,399 --> 02:13:18,719
respect and admire people pushing

3983
02:13:16,479 --> 02:13:20,879
for exploration but i at the same time i

3984
02:13:18,719 --> 02:13:22,719
just i want to recognize like the we

3985
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:24,000
just you know we know how unique earth

3986
02:13:22,719 --> 02:13:25,439
is and

3987
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,719
i do think we got to do everything we

3988
02:13:25,439 --> 02:13:28,839
can to uh

3989
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:31,118
to protect

3990
02:13:28,840 --> 02:13:32,319
it i think you avoid answering the

3991
02:13:31,118 --> 02:13:34,639
question if we're going to destroy

3992
02:13:32,319 --> 02:13:36,880
ourselves

3993
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:38,639
yeah yeah i guess are you if you do not

3994
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:40,560
you're okay fine if we do not

3995
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:42,719
decentralize properly

3996
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:45,599
out into different

3997
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:47,118
physical spaces probably i guess yeah

3998
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:49,039
and then i mean do you do you have

3999
02:13:47,118 --> 02:13:49,920
concerns that are immediately facing you

4000
02:13:49,039 --> 02:13:51,039
so

4001
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:53,359
um

4002
02:13:51,039 --> 02:13:55,840
not in terms of the injustices on the

4003
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:57,439
world but nuclear war yeah look i'm a

4004
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:59,920
lot more concerned about what's

4005
02:13:57,439 --> 02:14:01,598
happening right now like like what is

4006
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:03,279
destroying ourselves

4007
02:14:01,599 --> 02:14:05,199
if you were to go and see what's

4008
02:14:03,279 --> 02:14:07,359
happening in xinjiang or north korea

4009
02:14:05,198 --> 02:14:09,198
right now or eritrea

4010
02:14:07,359 --> 02:14:10,880
that is destroying ourselves yeah and

4011
02:14:09,198 --> 02:14:13,519
it's already happened so i guess the end

4012
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:15,359
that's why i said that is yes i mean if

4013
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:17,119
you don't decentralize and power is

4014
02:14:15,359 --> 02:14:20,238
completely under one

4015
02:14:17,118 --> 02:14:22,799
person um life is destroyed as we know

4016
02:14:20,238 --> 02:14:24,839
it and and you know you don't have to go

4017
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:28,000
into science fiction to know what a

4018
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:29,920
totalitarian hellscape dystopia is

4019
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,920
there's several that exist already and

4020
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:33,920
and you know let's try to like help

4021
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:36,158
those people at the same time as we're

4022
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:38,719
trying to like push out into space would

4023
02:14:36,158 --> 02:14:40,479
be my like counter i guess yeah i agree

4024
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:42,639
with you in my mind the sort of

4025
02:14:40,479 --> 02:14:44,399
destruction and suffering are next-door

4026
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:46,719
neighbors so yeah we don't need to

4027
02:14:44,399 --> 02:14:49,519
destroy all of human civilization if

4028
02:14:46,719 --> 02:14:51,118
much a large fraction lives in

4029
02:14:49,520 --> 02:14:53,440
conditions that we would equate to

4030
02:14:51,118 --> 02:14:55,759
suffering that's uh that's not a good

4031
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:58,238
world

4032
02:14:55,760 --> 02:15:00,800
is there advice that you would give to

4033
02:14:58,238 --> 02:15:03,039
uh young people today about life about

4034
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:04,960
career about how they can help a world

4035
02:15:03,039 --> 02:15:06,639
where 53 percent

4036
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:08,399
are living uh

4037
02:15:06,639 --> 02:15:10,239
are living under authoritarian

4038
02:15:08,399 --> 02:15:11,519
governments but in general a world

4039
02:15:10,238 --> 02:15:14,718
that's full of

4040
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:16,320
injustice but also full of opportunity

4041
02:15:14,719 --> 02:15:17,920
just thinking about my own

4042
02:15:16,319 --> 02:15:21,279
upbringing i went to a public school

4043
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:24,560
here and um we never learned about money

4044
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:26,479
it was never part of our curriculum um

4045
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:28,239
even personal finances was not part of

4046
02:15:26,479 --> 02:15:29,359
our curriculum you could take like an

4047
02:15:28,238 --> 02:15:31,039
optional course to learn about like

4048
02:15:29,359 --> 02:15:33,039
business or something

4049
02:15:31,039 --> 02:15:34,238
um and i think that that would be really

4050
02:15:33,039 --> 02:15:36,960
valuable

4051
02:15:34,238 --> 02:15:38,158
as a young person or as a teenager

4052
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,480
to start

4053
02:15:38,158 --> 02:15:42,879
incorporating into your children's lives

4054
02:15:40,479 --> 02:15:44,319
is like a curiosity about what is money

4055
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:46,000
i think would be very health healthy

4056
02:15:44,319 --> 02:15:48,078
regardless of what path that takes them

4057
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,000
down um because we don't think about it

4058
02:15:48,078 --> 02:15:51,519
enough either from an administrative

4059
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:54,800
sort of personal finance thing about

4060
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:56,639
like responsibility uh or

4061
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:58,639
more fundamentally like what is it and

4062
02:15:56,639 --> 02:16:00,000
who creates it where did it come from

4063
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:01,679
both of those things are very important

4064
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,439
so my advice to a young person would be

4065
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:04,480
to get to the point where you feel like

4066
02:16:03,439 --> 02:16:05,869
you can

4067
02:16:04,479 --> 02:16:07,359
answer the question what is money

4068
02:16:05,869 --> 02:16:09,279
[Laughter]

4069
02:16:07,359 --> 02:16:12,158
so you ultimately see money as a as kind

4070
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:14,158
of power and freedom and um

4071
02:16:12,158 --> 02:16:15,198
a mechanism is suffering so core to

4072
02:16:14,158 --> 02:16:16,479
everything

4073
02:16:15,198 --> 02:16:18,319
the united states

4074
02:16:16,479 --> 02:16:20,718
whether you want to call it the pax

4075
02:16:18,319 --> 02:16:22,399
americana the empire the hyper power

4076
02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:23,840
whatever you want to call this moment in

4077
02:16:22,399 --> 02:16:26,319
time where the us is dominant around the

4078
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:28,400
world it is because of the fact that we

4079
02:16:26,319 --> 02:16:30,399
have this petrodollar system where we

4080
02:16:28,399 --> 02:16:32,398
are able to force

4081
02:16:30,399 --> 02:16:36,000
the saudis and other oil producing

4082
02:16:32,398 --> 02:16:38,478
nations to sell their oil in dollars

4083
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:41,280
that is really inescapable inseparable

4084
02:16:38,478 --> 02:16:43,279
from our power um and that's very rarely

4085
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:45,599
talked about and it's very important to

4086
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:46,880
understand so yeah young people could

4087
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:47,840
start thinking about that stuff it'd be

4088
02:16:46,879 --> 02:16:50,159
good

4089
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:51,840
i remember being it sounds silly to say

4090
02:16:50,159 --> 02:16:53,920
but i remember being uh really

4091
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:55,359
uncomfortable that i was dependent on my

4092
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:57,200
parents

4093
02:16:55,359 --> 02:16:59,280
at a young age

4094
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:00,960
or for like financial you need to be 18

4095
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:02,800
have a bank account or whatever right

4096
02:17:00,959 --> 02:17:04,398
one one of the people that we supported

4097
02:17:02,799 --> 02:17:05,920
at ahref through our we do software

4098
02:17:04,398 --> 02:17:08,318
development funding for people in

4099
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:09,920
bitcoin uh open source projects and he's

4100
02:17:08,318 --> 02:17:11,920
one of the guys we funded is this uh

4101
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:13,920
very young smart sort of prodigy he's

4102
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:15,519
like 17. but one of the reasons he got

4103
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:16,799
into bitcoin was because he wanted to

4104
02:17:15,519 --> 02:17:18,478
have control of his money when he was

4105
02:17:16,799 --> 02:17:20,799
like 14. yeah i mean if you think in

4106
02:17:18,478 --> 02:17:22,959
history people who invented uh

4107
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:25,199
uh all kinds of incredible contributions

4108
02:17:22,959 --> 02:17:27,438
to science or math i mean a lot of them

4109
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:29,519
did it before they were 15. yeah so

4110
02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:31,679
think about that maturity that is

4111
02:17:29,519 --> 02:17:33,920
capable and possible in many people like

4112
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:35,120
i've participated in some of the years

4113
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:37,120
ago some of the

4114
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:38,399
sort of selection processes for like the

4115
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:40,719
teal fellowship which is like really

4116
02:17:38,398 --> 02:17:42,079
amazing like these people who are 14 15

4117
02:17:40,718 --> 02:17:43,438
16 who don't need to go to college

4118
02:17:42,079 --> 02:17:44,718
they're already like so smart they can

4119
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:46,719
figure it out but they wouldn't be

4120
02:17:44,718 --> 02:17:47,598
allowed to have a bank account right so

4121
02:17:46,718 --> 02:17:49,039
hey

4122
02:17:47,599 --> 02:17:50,558
that's kind of cool like now you have a

4123
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:52,399
permissionless money you can you can

4124
02:17:50,558 --> 02:17:53,840
open up yourself without uh permission

4125
02:17:52,398 --> 02:17:56,558
from your parents that's kind of cool

4126
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:59,840
yeah that's fascinating to me i i i feel

4127
02:17:56,558 --> 02:18:01,358
like i would have loved my parents

4128
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:03,200
more

4129
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:06,079
if you had a little more separation if i

4130
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:07,519
had freedom to to fully realize myself

4131
02:18:06,079 --> 02:18:10,239
because i felt like i was a little bit

4132
02:18:07,519 --> 02:18:12,719
trapped by i don't know it's uh uh it's

4133
02:18:10,239 --> 02:18:14,638
not explicit right it's a little bit

4134
02:18:12,718 --> 02:18:17,119
it's like a subtle

4135
02:18:14,638 --> 02:18:20,159
push that you're somehow dependent on

4136
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:22,079
them i mean part of that is like

4137
02:18:20,159 --> 02:18:23,599
i think it actually very much has to do

4138
02:18:22,079 --> 02:18:25,599
not talking about money like what what

4139
02:18:23,599 --> 02:18:27,120
does it take to operate as an individual

4140
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:28,799
entity in this world like knowing that

4141
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:30,960
when you're 10 years old

4142
02:18:28,799 --> 02:18:32,879
knowing that when you're very young

4143
02:18:30,959 --> 02:18:35,919
so that you've

4144
02:18:32,879 --> 02:18:38,718
then you see the how amazing it is

4145
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:43,200
to uh have the support of your parents

4146
02:18:38,718 --> 02:18:43,199
until you're 18. like have that freedom

4147
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:49,439
have the freedom to appreciate the value

4148
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:51,519
your parents bring and at the same time

4149
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:52,559
the freedom to leave

4150
02:18:51,519 --> 02:18:54,159
in some

4151
02:18:52,558 --> 02:18:56,318
capacity

4152
02:18:54,159 --> 02:18:58,638
to uh carve your own path i mean like

4153
02:18:56,318 --> 02:19:00,718
just just all of that i think for for

4154
02:18:58,638 --> 02:19:04,318
weirdos like me especially because that

4155
02:19:00,718 --> 02:19:06,079
was a very non-traditional path that uh

4156
02:19:04,318 --> 02:19:07,199
i think it would be very empowering and

4157
02:19:06,079 --> 02:19:08,799
certainly would be empowering in the

4158
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:10,319
third world too not just weirdos like

4159
02:19:08,799 --> 02:19:11,679
you yeah i was going to mention one of

4160
02:19:10,318 --> 02:19:13,279
the people i got

4161
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:15,599
who taught me about bitcoin

4162
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:17,120
her name is roya mapub she's an afghan

4163
02:19:15,599 --> 02:19:19,840
technology ceo

4164
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:22,160
and in 2013 she started paying her

4165
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:23,599
employees in bitcoin because uh they

4166
02:19:22,159 --> 02:19:24,799
were not allowed to open bank accounts

4167
02:19:23,599 --> 02:19:27,120
the women that worked for her she

4168
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:29,119
started the country's first female like

4169
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:31,599
all-female software company

4170
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:32,960
and if they brought cash home their like

4171
02:19:31,599 --> 02:19:34,398
husbands or uncles or brothers would

4172
02:19:32,959 --> 02:19:36,718
steal it from them there's a power

4173
02:19:34,398 --> 02:19:39,199
patriarchal dominance thing going on

4174
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:41,358
but they had phones and she was able to

4175
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:43,120
pay them in bitcoin and no one knew and

4176
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:44,639
it gave them that power and that that's

4177
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:46,880
always stuck in my mind is a very

4178
02:19:44,638 --> 02:19:48,959
interesting uh effect of this kind of

4179
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:50,478
thing of permissionless money like that

4180
02:19:48,959 --> 02:19:51,919
it could be an empowerment tool so

4181
02:19:50,478 --> 02:19:53,760
absolutely

4182
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:56,318
so in your own personal life

4183
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:57,359
where did the

4184
02:19:56,318 --> 02:19:58,559
deep

4185
02:19:57,359 --> 02:20:00,559
concern

4186
02:19:58,559 --> 02:20:04,639
for the for the suffering in the world

4187
02:20:00,559 --> 02:20:06,879
come from where was that born

4188
02:20:04,639 --> 02:20:09,519
i was going to be an engineer actually

4189
02:20:06,879 --> 02:20:11,279
and then in 2003 we invaded iraq and i

4190
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:12,479
got very interested in why we did that

4191
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:15,439
as a nation

4192
02:20:12,478 --> 02:20:17,519
and i switched to my focus of study to

4193
02:20:15,439 --> 02:20:19,760
like international relations and that's

4194
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:21,920
how i kind of went down the kind of

4195
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:23,760
political science democracy rabbit hole

4196
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:25,520
and ended up getting a job at the human

4197
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:27,680
rights foundation so that that i'm a

4198
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:29,840
very much a child of like 911 and the

4199
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:32,398
iraq war those are the two really

4200
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:34,398
formative events for me personally can

4201
02:20:32,398 --> 02:20:35,199
you break that apart a little bit like

4202
02:20:34,398 --> 02:20:38,719
what

4203
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:40,720
illusion about this world was uh

4204
02:20:38,719 --> 02:20:41,599
broken apart

4205
02:20:40,719 --> 02:20:42,840
by

4206
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:45,840
the invasion of

4207
02:20:42,840 --> 02:20:48,000
iraq well i think first of all 911 just

4208
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:50,639
shifted the world dynamics completely

4209
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:53,040
from a focus on big power politics

4210
02:20:50,639 --> 02:20:56,079
between the us russia and china to this

4211
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:58,399
new threat of islamic terror

4212
02:20:56,079 --> 02:20:59,920
and a lot of it we learned later a lot

4213
02:20:58,398 --> 02:21:02,719
of the things we did were manufactured

4214
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:04,799
choreographed like there were no wmds in

4215
02:21:02,719 --> 02:21:06,000
iraq like the reason our rulers said we

4216
02:21:04,799 --> 02:21:07,519
needed to invade and destroy this

4217
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:09,920
country was a lie

4218
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:11,760
um and that that i think has really been

4219
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:13,920
forgotten like i think a lot of like the

4220
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:15,840
zoomers like today don't really know a

4221
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:18,239
lot about that time period i mean it was

4222
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:20,960
pretty crazy unanimously

4223
02:21:18,239 --> 02:21:23,119
i mean democrat republican like

4224
02:21:20,959 --> 02:21:24,799
joe biden hillary clinton like and the

4225
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:26,640
republicans everybody wanted to invade

4226
02:21:24,799 --> 02:21:28,639
this country and it was very it's very

4227
02:21:26,639 --> 02:21:30,239
um

4228
02:21:28,639 --> 02:21:32,478
it's a confusing time there's a really

4229
02:21:30,239 --> 02:21:34,639
good book by ian mcewen called saturday

4230
02:21:32,478 --> 02:21:36,959
a fiction book that takes place during i

4231
02:21:34,639 --> 02:21:38,959
think 2003 and it's one day in the life

4232
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:40,639
of the doctor in london

4233
02:21:38,959 --> 02:21:42,000
it's really good though to revisit this

4234
02:21:40,639 --> 02:21:44,239
time because

4235
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,840
he has two characters he has a character

4236
02:21:44,239 --> 02:21:47,439
in the book one of whom is very pro-war

4237
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:49,359
and one of them is very against war

4238
02:21:47,439 --> 02:21:50,880
basically he the father himself is

4239
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:52,239
pro-war and his son is against it and

4240
02:21:50,879 --> 02:21:54,000
they have all these debates and it's

4241
02:21:52,239 --> 02:21:54,719
nice to go back to revisit but that time

4242
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:57,120
was

4243
02:21:54,719 --> 02:21:58,719
it's really crazy and it really showed

4244
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:01,200
you that like the media could be

4245
02:21:58,719 --> 02:22:03,679
captured into like helping promote this

4246
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:05,600
idea of like invading another country

4247
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:07,120
so i was very curious about why we did

4248
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:08,720
it and like who who was pulling the

4249
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:10,640
strings and why what are the reasons

4250
02:22:08,719 --> 02:22:12,398
that we went and what's really

4251
02:22:10,639 --> 02:22:13,760
interesting is that like i took all

4252
02:22:12,398 --> 02:22:15,680
these courses on and interviewed all

4253
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:17,120
these decision makers

4254
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:18,639
whether they were like neocons or

4255
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:19,840
whatever different people who were

4256
02:22:18,639 --> 02:22:22,000
involved and

4257
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:23,920
the whole like dollar reserve currency

4258
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,760
thing like really never came up until

4259
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:27,920
like i i learned about it more recently

4260
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:29,600
because of bitcoin like and today when i

4261
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:31,840
look back it seems kind of obvious that

4262
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:33,760
the reason we invaded iraq was because

4263
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:34,880
saddam hussein wanted to sell oil in

4264
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:36,478
euros

4265
02:22:34,879 --> 02:22:38,719
it seems really obvious when you go back

4266
02:22:36,478 --> 02:22:40,000
and look at the chronology of it um and

4267
02:22:38,719 --> 02:22:41,840
we were like no we actually don't want

4268
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,600
you to sell dollars in euros because

4269
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:44,799
that would threaten the dollar so we're

4270
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:45,920
going to invade you and then you're not

4271
02:22:44,799 --> 02:22:48,000
going to do it and no one else is going

4272
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:50,639
to like sell dollars in europe oil and

4273
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:52,959
euros right um i guess you could say the

4274
02:22:50,639 --> 02:22:55,039
same thing about gaddafi but um

4275
02:22:52,959 --> 02:22:57,039
we we as a nation have very much

4276
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:58,479
protected our reserve currency let's put

4277
02:22:57,040 --> 02:22:59,760
it that way yeah actually one of the

4278
02:22:58,478 --> 02:23:02,318
things that bitcoin community has

4279
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:04,559
motivated me to do is to look back to

4280
02:23:02,318 --> 02:23:07,279
the histories that i have studied myself

4281
02:23:04,559 --> 02:23:09,119
from just even the two world wars

4282
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:11,600
the history of the 20th century from a

4283
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:14,399
perspective of the monetary system

4284
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:15,760
of of money and it's it's interesting

4285
02:23:14,398 --> 02:23:17,599
it's interesting to look at human

4286
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:20,318
history in the context of money can't we

4287
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:22,479
be patriotic and be pro america but like

4288
02:23:20,318 --> 02:23:24,478
not want the petro dollar like i should

4289
02:23:22,478 --> 02:23:26,719
be proud of my country why do we need to

4290
02:23:24,478 --> 02:23:28,799
be propping up the saudis why do we need

4291
02:23:26,719 --> 02:23:30,159
to be you know threatening to invade

4292
02:23:28,799 --> 02:23:32,079
other countries if they sell their oil

4293
02:23:30,159 --> 02:23:33,760
for a different currency i think we can

4294
02:23:32,079 --> 02:23:36,000
be just as powerful as we are today if

4295
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:37,359
not more powerful in a bitcoin world if

4296
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,318
you think about the infrastructure

4297
02:23:37,359 --> 02:23:39,359
americans are building all the

4298
02:23:38,318 --> 02:23:41,760
innovations we're building all the

4299
02:23:39,359 --> 02:23:43,680
wealth we have i think we'll be fine

4300
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:45,600
better than fine and we won't have these

4301
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:48,318
horrible negative externalities it's

4302
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:49,600
it's really a an optimistic vision for

4303
02:23:48,318 --> 02:23:51,760
the future

4304
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:53,359
i thought we learned the lesson of 9 11

4305
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:56,079
and uh the invasion of iraq and

4306
02:23:53,359 --> 02:23:56,079
afghanistan

4307
02:23:56,239 --> 02:23:59,520
but we're leaving and you know biden

4308
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:02,239
announced we're leaving afghanistan this

4309
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:03,760
year 20 years for what

4310
02:24:02,239 --> 02:24:05,520
taliban are going to take over again i

4311
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:08,318
mean that's like at least the good

4312
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:10,960
this the longest war right the uh the

4313
02:24:08,318 --> 02:24:13,760
forever wars i feel like the past 20

4314
02:24:10,959 --> 02:24:16,478
years or whatever it is um

4315
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:18,719
18 years 19 years

4316
02:24:16,478 --> 02:24:20,639
we've been very skeptical about invading

4317
02:24:18,719 --> 02:24:22,719
other countries

4318
02:24:20,639 --> 02:24:24,879
about

4319
02:24:22,719 --> 02:24:28,159
we've been skeptical about military

4320
02:24:24,879 --> 02:24:28,879
intervention in other nations

4321
02:24:28,159 --> 02:24:31,039
well

4322
02:24:28,879 --> 02:24:32,639
our leaders certainly haven't we're we

4323
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:34,399
have like seven active wars right now

4324
02:24:32,639 --> 02:24:36,398
and then neither the russians and the

4325
02:24:34,398 --> 02:24:37,840
chinese everybody's starting to invade

4326
02:24:36,398 --> 02:24:39,920
everybody else

4327
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:42,000
i mean so yes but i meant to a degree

4328
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:44,478
that i was worried about like conflicts

4329
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:46,318
with uh hot conflicts with iran with

4330
02:24:44,478 --> 02:24:48,478
north korea

4331
02:24:46,318 --> 02:24:50,879
those kinds of things sure that uh there

4332
02:24:48,478 --> 02:24:53,199
was not as much

4333
02:24:50,879 --> 02:24:55,199
warmongering as

4334
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:56,800
as i was afraid about but yes you're

4335
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:58,720
absolutely right we're still

4336
02:24:56,799 --> 02:25:00,719
there's a there's a big presence by the

4337
02:24:58,719 --> 02:25:02,959
united states and other nations and

4338
02:25:00,719 --> 02:25:05,119
across the world that's military this

4339
02:25:02,959 --> 02:25:06,799
the military-industrial complex

4340
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:08,399
is a thing

4341
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:11,039
that um

4342
02:25:08,398 --> 02:25:12,799
has huge detrimental ripple effects

4343
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:14,080
throughout the entirety of our

4344
02:25:12,799 --> 02:25:16,000
governments

4345
02:25:14,079 --> 02:25:17,760
yeah so the big question is how do we

4346
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,439
prevent the rise of this like

4347
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:20,239
authoritarian

4348
02:25:19,439 --> 02:25:22,079
um

4349
02:25:20,239 --> 02:25:24,639
surveillance state in china

4350
02:25:22,079 --> 02:25:26,239
while at the same time kind of diffusing

4351
02:25:24,639 --> 02:25:28,079
the military-industrial complex on our

4352
02:25:26,239 --> 02:25:29,680
side that to me is like the biggest

4353
02:25:28,079 --> 02:25:31,120
challenge of our time

4354
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:32,318
i don't have the answer but we should

4355
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:34,800
keep digging

4356
02:25:32,318 --> 02:25:36,559
yeah i i believe there's a technology

4357
02:25:34,799 --> 02:25:38,239
technological innovations

4358
02:25:36,559 --> 02:25:40,318
you're suggesting that perhaps one of

4359
02:25:38,239 --> 02:25:42,398
the technological innovations like is

4360
02:25:40,318 --> 02:25:44,478
bitcoin is a big part of it yeah on the

4361
02:25:42,398 --> 02:25:45,920
money side i think the information side

4362
02:25:44,478 --> 02:25:46,959
there's there's innovations that are

4363
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:49,120
open

4364
02:25:46,959 --> 02:25:51,358
that's possible and the political side

4365
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:53,760
i'm the most skeptical about

4366
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:56,079
i just feel like there's uh without hot

4367
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:57,280
wars that we don't seem to make any kind

4368
02:25:56,079 --> 02:25:59,680
of progress

4369
02:25:57,280 --> 02:26:01,040
bureaucracies just grow corruption and

4370
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:03,120
greed grow

4371
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:05,200
and human nature does not

4372
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:08,399
does not do well in the political

4373
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:12,079
arena so i hope technology can

4374
02:26:08,398 --> 02:26:14,639
outpace the darker sides of human nature

4375
02:26:12,079 --> 02:26:16,478
so you're busy fighting the demons

4376
02:26:14,639 --> 02:26:18,079
the darkness that's out there but

4377
02:26:16,478 --> 02:26:20,318
looking in the mirror you're finite

4378
02:26:18,079 --> 02:26:23,520
being unfortunately this ride ends for

4379
02:26:20,318 --> 02:26:25,760
you soon pretty soon

4380
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:28,319
um do you ever ask

4381
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:29,600
yourself about the meaning of it all

4382
02:26:28,318 --> 02:26:32,318
of

4383
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:34,960
why the hell us uh descendants of apes

4384
02:26:32,318 --> 02:26:38,398
are even on this thing striving so hard

4385
02:26:34,959 --> 02:26:38,398
to make a better world for ourselves

4386
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:44,479
i don't often zoom out that much i feel

4387
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:46,719
like my day job is pretty interesting it

4388
02:26:44,478 --> 02:26:48,079
keeps me very engaged

4389
02:26:46,719 --> 02:26:51,119
with all the stuff we've been talking

4390
02:26:48,079 --> 02:26:54,159
about uh as far as the

4391
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:57,040
meaning of life though

4392
02:26:54,159 --> 02:26:59,840
it seems quite clear that

4393
02:26:57,040 --> 02:27:02,720
we do have the possibility as a species

4394
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:04,799
to create um these you know beautiful

4395
02:27:02,719 --> 02:27:06,318
communities and constructs and to share

4396
02:27:04,799 --> 02:27:08,639
an exploration

4397
02:27:06,318 --> 02:27:09,760
of the world together

4398
02:27:08,639 --> 02:27:11,519
that is

4399
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:15,120
often marred by

4400
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:18,000
cold realities that we've discussed but

4401
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:21,280
i do feel like in a way um that the

4402
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:23,439
meaning of life is that that pursuit uh

4403
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:26,399
um of course biologically is you know

4404
02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:29,200
the spread our species right but also to

4405
02:27:26,398 --> 02:27:32,159
to pursue knowledge and science and

4406
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:34,159
innovation and and and freedom most

4407
02:27:32,159 --> 02:27:36,559
importantly i mean i think it freedom

4408
02:27:34,159 --> 02:27:38,478
has to guide us or else we end up

4409
02:27:36,559 --> 02:27:39,760
with prison camps if we don't let

4410
02:27:38,478 --> 02:27:41,358
freedom guide us we end up with the

4411
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:43,359
prison camps so we need to have

4412
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:45,840
scientific innovation and adventurism

4413
02:27:43,359 --> 02:27:47,359
and colonization of the stars but

4414
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:49,840
without the slavery and without the

4415
02:27:47,359 --> 02:27:51,359
prison camps i think that's so key

4416
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:53,600
there's something about the

4417
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:55,680
creation of beauty that seems

4418
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:57,520
fundamental to human nature and what

4419
02:27:55,680 --> 02:28:00,079
seems beautiful

4420
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:02,800
as these communities

4421
02:28:00,079 --> 02:28:04,318
that um

4422
02:28:02,799 --> 02:28:06,318
that don't have suffering they don't

4423
02:28:04,318 --> 02:28:07,199
have injustice and we have some kind of

4424
02:28:06,318 --> 02:28:09,439
inner

4425
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:10,720
sense of what is injustice

4426
02:28:09,439 --> 02:28:12,720
i don't know like some of the human

4427
02:28:10,719 --> 02:28:14,398
rights that you've mentioned earlier

4428
02:28:12,719 --> 02:28:16,478
they're they're they're just

4429
02:28:14,398 --> 02:28:18,398
philosophical constructs

4430
02:28:16,478 --> 02:28:19,279
but there also seem to be somehow deeply

4431
02:28:18,398 --> 02:28:20,478
in us

4432
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:22,319
too

4433
02:28:20,478 --> 02:28:24,159
it there we have a sense of what is

4434
02:28:22,318 --> 02:28:25,760
right and what is wrong

4435
02:28:24,159 --> 02:28:27,840
it's not just

4436
02:28:25,760 --> 02:28:30,318
a kind of illusion that we've all agreed

4437
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:32,159
arbitrary power torture

4438
02:28:30,318 --> 02:28:34,318
uh executions we know these things are

4439
02:28:32,159 --> 02:28:35,680
wrong i mean we know they're wrong

4440
02:28:34,318 --> 02:28:36,719
we don't have to read a book to know

4441
02:28:35,680 --> 02:28:38,000
that

4442
02:28:36,719 --> 02:28:40,398
um

4443
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:42,159
but you do you do need to

4444
02:28:40,398 --> 02:28:43,358
people can get brainwashed i mean you

4445
02:28:42,159 --> 02:28:45,039
talk to people who've grown up in north

4446
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:47,040
korea that you know they don't know any

4447
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:48,479
better like they don't know what's going

4448
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:50,240
on in the outside world

4449
02:28:48,478 --> 02:28:52,879
so they've never experienced anything

4450
02:28:50,239 --> 02:28:54,799
differently so that's why

4451
02:28:52,879 --> 02:28:56,239
look technology can play a big role here

4452
02:28:54,799 --> 02:28:58,159
in terms of like the meaning of it all

4453
02:28:56,239 --> 02:28:59,680
like it can really help emancipate

4454
02:28:58,159 --> 02:29:01,200
liberate people at least so that they

4455
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:02,960
can make their own choices

4456
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:04,960
about what to do at least so that we're

4457
02:29:02,959 --> 02:29:07,199
on a level playing field so technologies

4458
02:29:04,959 --> 02:29:10,639
like the internet and bitcoin um they

4459
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:12,399
can at least like give you the option to

4460
02:29:10,639 --> 02:29:13,358
do things your own way on your own terms

4461
02:29:12,398 --> 02:29:15,439
and then

4462
02:29:13,359 --> 02:29:17,280
and then and then from there we'll see

4463
02:29:15,439 --> 02:29:18,960
um you know i you know i think it's

4464
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:20,319
important that we have design choices

4465
02:29:18,959 --> 02:29:21,599
where we can like

4466
02:29:20,318 --> 02:29:23,760
um

4467
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:26,159
have a little more say and that not

4468
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:28,318
everything be pre-programmed for us that

4469
02:29:26,159 --> 02:29:29,680
that would be very disappointing

4470
02:29:28,318 --> 02:29:31,680
so i mean

4471
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:33,600
yeah the open web and encryption in

4472
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:36,639
bitcoin these are things that help

4473
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:38,559
uh prevent social engineering and that

4474
02:29:36,639 --> 02:29:40,159
promote more freedom and and more

4475
02:29:38,559 --> 02:29:42,318
possibilities honestly and more

4476
02:29:40,159 --> 02:29:44,318
entrepreneurship and more creativity and

4477
02:29:42,318 --> 02:29:45,680
more scientific inquiry i mean think

4478
02:29:44,318 --> 02:29:48,159
about the people who tried to shut down

4479
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:50,479
scientific inquiry 500 600 years ago or

4480
02:29:48,159 --> 02:29:51,600
whatever that we're trying to say

4481
02:29:50,478 --> 02:29:53,279
um

4482
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:55,280
you know the earth was the center of

4483
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:57,359
everything and they were wrong you know

4484
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:58,960
and then you know all these conservative

4485
02:29:57,359 --> 02:30:00,640
religious types throughout history have

4486
02:29:58,959 --> 02:30:02,799
always said that um

4487
02:30:00,639 --> 02:30:04,478
you know there's no no value in science

4488
02:30:02,799 --> 02:30:06,398
and there's no value in technology and

4489
02:30:04,478 --> 02:30:07,840
they've been wrong the whole time so

4490
02:30:06,398 --> 02:30:09,680
let's continue pushing here let's

4491
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:11,680
continue pushing

4492
02:30:09,680 --> 02:30:14,159
it's kind of scary to me sometimes

4493
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:16,239
humbling beautiful but also scary to

4494
02:30:14,159 --> 02:30:18,478
think of you mention

4495
02:30:16,239 --> 02:30:20,239
north korea people are kind of living in

4496
02:30:18,478 --> 02:30:22,239
ignorance

4497
02:30:20,239 --> 02:30:23,760
it's scary to me to think about how much

4498
02:30:22,239 --> 02:30:26,719
ignorance there is in the world today

4499
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:28,880
like how little i know personally or us

4500
02:30:26,719 --> 02:30:30,318
as a human civilization knows that has

4501
02:30:28,879 --> 02:30:32,318
yet to be discovered

4502
02:30:30,318 --> 02:30:34,879
between laziness and and ignorance right

4503
02:30:32,318 --> 02:30:35,760
like so i would be lazy if i didn't you

4504
02:30:34,879 --> 02:30:37,759
know

4505
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:39,600
take advantage of the internet right

4506
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:40,559
someone in north korea doesn't have the

4507
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:41,760
opposite they don't have the option

4508
02:30:40,559 --> 02:30:43,760
there's literally no way for them to

4509
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:45,200
access the internet so there's kind of

4510
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:47,200
like um

4511
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:48,640
social laziness

4512
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:50,640
that philosophers have warned about

4513
02:30:48,639 --> 02:30:51,519
forever that we basically become sheep

4514
02:30:50,639 --> 02:30:53,760
okay

4515
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:55,600
and then there's actual like

4516
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:57,840
brainwashing and censorship that's

4517
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:59,600
possible like by closing off your

4518
02:30:57,840 --> 02:31:00,880
population and keeping them off like the

4519
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:02,640
internet right

4520
02:31:00,879 --> 02:31:04,398
um so i think these are two very

4521
02:31:02,639 --> 02:31:06,159
different concepts absolutely but i also

4522
02:31:04,398 --> 02:31:08,159
mean just like

4523
02:31:06,159 --> 02:31:10,478
not even laziness but cognitive

4524
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:12,799
limitations and just historical

4525
02:31:10,478 --> 02:31:15,119
scientific limitations like

4526
02:31:12,799 --> 02:31:17,438
you know

4527
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:18,720
we're very young species like all of the

4528
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:20,639
exciting stuff we've been talking about

4529
02:31:18,719 --> 02:31:22,639
have happened on the scale of decades

4530
02:31:20,639 --> 02:31:24,159
maybe centuries it's very we're very

4531
02:31:22,639 --> 02:31:25,119
young and all the cool stuff we've come

4532
02:31:24,159 --> 02:31:26,879
up with

4533
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:29,680
and it's just humbling to think about

4534
02:31:26,879 --> 02:31:30,639
how little we know but you're right that

4535
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:32,720
you know

4536
02:31:30,639 --> 02:31:35,439
ultimately having the freedom to keep

4537
02:31:32,719 --> 02:31:37,760
exploring keep venturing out

4538
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:39,439
even if we later discover that a lot of

4539
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:40,840
the stuff we've been doing

4540
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:42,398
now is

4541
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:44,398
um

4542
02:31:42,398 --> 02:31:47,279
is ethically horrible if you think about

4543
02:31:44,398 --> 02:31:50,639
animals or i think about robots a lot

4544
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:52,960
the kind of things we might be doing

4545
02:31:50,639 --> 02:31:55,279
to other consciousnesses that are here

4546
02:31:52,959 --> 02:31:57,519
on earth might be we might see his

4547
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:58,880
atrocities later on but ultimately you

4548
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:00,880
have to have the freedom to explore

4549
02:31:58,879 --> 02:32:02,559
those kinds of ideas and without that

4550
02:32:00,879 --> 02:32:05,279
freedom

4551
02:32:02,559 --> 02:32:07,840
you don't even get the chance to be lazy

4552
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:09,840
yeah i mean look don't be a sheep

4553
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:11,439
okay it's easy to beat no offense to

4554
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:13,200
sheep and there's some practical things

4555
02:32:11,439 --> 02:32:14,398
man get on signals start encrypting your

4556
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:18,000
messages

4557
02:32:14,398 --> 02:32:19,519
take control over your your privacy

4558
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:22,000
the media doesn't want you to but check

4559
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:23,280
out bitcoin you can be your own bank you

4560
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:25,280
