1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
the following is a conversation between

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,720
me

3
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:10,240
and michael malus michael is an author

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:13,599
anarchist and simpleton and i'm proud

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,719
to call him my friend he makes me smile

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,320
he makes me think and he makes me wonder

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:23,439
why i sound so sleepy all the time

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,879
and now enjoy this conversation with

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,359
michael malus

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,799
in the dupagolova language that i'm

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,559
increasingly certain

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,239
i'll never quite able to get the hang of

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:39,519
hello comrade let's miss it

14
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,039
so animal farm by george orwell is

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,120
one of my favorite books it's an

16
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,200
allegory about

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,558
at least i think about the soviet union

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,000
and the russian revolution

19
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,399
of 1917 so for people who haven't read

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,439
it

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,039
it's uh animals overthrow the humans and

22
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,640
then slowly become as bad

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,520
or worse than the humans so

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,878
comrade if we lived on this farm in the

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,240
book animal farm

26
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:09,840
which animal would you most rather be

27
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:12,959
would it be the pigs the horses

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,520
the donkey benjamin the raven moses the

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,559
humans

30
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:19,599
mr mrs jones the dogs or the sheep

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,719
um i'm gonna go with the milton answer

32
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,158
which is better to rule in hell than

33
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,478
serve in heaven right

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,320
it's better to rule in health and serve

35
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:28,719
in heaven yeah so i would have to go

36
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,078
with

37
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:34,078
the pigs so i guess i'd be a cop um

38
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:36,399
at the very top so the leader the main

39
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,798
pig napoleon versus like the wallet or

40
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,280
the other

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,240
yeah i i would say it's not it's sure

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
it's an allegory of the russian

43
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,839
revolution but i think

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,240
um orwell's point was this is broader

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,719
towards most totalitarian dictatorships

46
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,478
i mean

47
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,239
it could very easily be read as an

48
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:54,078
indictment of mussolini or hitler

49
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:56,000
or many of these others uh i'm a huge um

50
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:57,839
george orwell fan one of the things that

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,359
i think people on the right

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,640
need to appreciate is the courage

53
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,718
of many of these in undisputably

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,159
left-wing voices who were the strongest

55
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,239
ones to take on

56
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,840
uh totalitarianism totalitarian

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,200
communism and the three i think off top

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
my head who are all

59
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,039
in my top ten heroes of all time are

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,920
emma goldman

61
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,439
albert camus and orwell being the third

62
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,439
you know something that uh

63
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,120
leftists like to throw in the face of

64
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,239
people on the right who constantly

65
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,920
invoke orwell

66
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,360
is that orwell said and i don't have the

67
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,318
exact quote on top of my head but some

68
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,360
of the effect of

69
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,479
every word i have written is in

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,840
should be taken as a defense of

71
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,199
democratic socialism against

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,400
totalitarianism

73
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,759
so uh people like truman you know was

74
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,879
obviously very hardcore

75
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:48,159
in many ways anti-communist we like

76
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,199
to parse things out you're going to

77
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,439
laugh

78
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,518
into binary fashions that you know left

79
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,840
good right bad or right good left bad

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,439
but historically speaking it does not

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,719
fall away into these camps

82
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:03,039
as easily as people would like and i

83
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,239
think it is important for those of us

84
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,079
it takes a lot more courage to fight

85
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,599
the right from the right or to fight the

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,159
left from the left because

87
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,439
in a sense a lot of your countrymen or

88
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,519
your fellow travelers are going to

89
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,400
regard you as a traitor to the cause

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,080
so i every chance i get i will sing the

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,560
praises of these three

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,280
figures among others who not only even

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,158
if they hadn't

94
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,239
done what they had done just lived just

95
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:32,239
amazing lives that all of us can

96
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,120
uh learn from and admire and

97
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,319
regard as somewhat a role model so what

98
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,000
was the nature of their opposition to

99
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,560
totalitarianism is that basically

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,680
freedom well the value of freedom let's

101
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,759
go to the three of them

102
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,120
so emma goldman she was an early

103
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,639
anarchist figure you know we'll talk

104
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,039
about her later i'm sure

105
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,878
she got deported from the united states

106
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,239
with her partner in crime alexander

107
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:54,959
berkman literal crime he tried to

108
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,080
assassinate

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,519
uh frick who was andrew carnegie's

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,760
main man in the pittsburgh steel mill

111
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,000
strike um she got deported

112
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,359
to the soviet union and they're like

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,719
they're like oh you want socialism

114
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
because at the time the anarchists were

115
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,400
regarded as socialist

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,239
you know go choke on it and she's there

117
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
and she was watching in great horror

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,840
uh what was going on and she actually

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
went to lenin's office and she goes this

120
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,160
isn't what we're about the revolution is

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,079
about

122
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,600
the individual and free speech and

123
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,720
everyone working together to further

124
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
society

125
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
and he told her that you know you know

126
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,079
free speech is a bourgeois contrivance

127
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,439
and regardless you can't have these

128
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,560
circumstances in the midst of a

129
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,719
revolution

130
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,560
and when she left the soviet union and

131
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,280
you know she went to britain and at the

132
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,918
time

133
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,439
before the 1917 there was a lot of

134
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,198
discussion among

135
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,560
socialist circles about what would the

136
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,160
revolution look like right

137
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,079
would there be the bakunin anarchist

138
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,759
model would there be the marxist model

139
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,359
obviously the bolsheviks ended up

140
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,879
winning but even then it wasn't obvious

141
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,919
because there was the bolsheviks and the

142
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,680
mensheviks and

143
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,959
what people you know you and i know what

144
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,720
those words mean but

145
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,799
bolsheviks were kind of funny because

146
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
boisha means bigger and manchester means

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,600
smaller

148
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,599
the mensheviks had the numbers it was

149
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,039
sarcastic that they were called

150
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,720
mensheviks and the bolsheviks were

151
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,959
called bolshah and lenin

152
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,199
you know destroyed all his foes in a

153
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,198
very merciless way obviously

154
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,560
beforehand you know there was the idea

155
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,199
like okay with all these cockamamie

156
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,280
ideas

157
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,319
we have to work together you know we

158
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,918
don't know what's going to look like for

159
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,199
the cause then as soon as he sees power

160
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,959
he's like yeah yeah we're not doing that

161
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,680
kind of pluralism anymore

162
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,599
this is going to be the right approach

163
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,879
so she left the soviet union as did

164
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,039
berkman

165
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,639
she wrote a book that they titled my

166
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,000
disillusionment with russia and i

167
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,400
remember this is one anecdote which i'm

168
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,240
going to

169
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,000
discuss in the forthcoming book where

170
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,639
she goes to britain and the british

171
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,240
were very red at the time they really uh

172
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,759
had something called the fabian society

173
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,720
which was the predecessor to the british

174
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,479
labour party

175
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,240
which were like all right we're going to

176
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:48,959
get rid of liberalism and have a

177
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,000
socialist

178
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,519
uh kind of nation and she gave talks and

179
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,160
there was this one's time where she gave

180
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,918
a talk and

181
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
she started and there was a standing

182
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,478
ovation by the time she was done you

183
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,280
could hear a pin drop

184
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,879
because she dared to look at these

185
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,879
people in the face something they'd be

186
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,159
fighting for all their lives and saying

187
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,800
you know we've been to the future and it

188
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,800
works

189
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,960
and she's like guys this is worse than

190
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,879
the czar uh you know people are under

191
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:14,399
house arrest you're not allowed to have

192
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,759
you know newspapers are being shut down

193
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,638
if they have heretical views so on and

194
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,800
so forth

195
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,038
and you know she was just even more of a

196
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,600
pariah than she had been previously so

197
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,560
she is you know deserves huge accolades

198
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,680
in that regard

199
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,918
i brought her up and we were talking

200
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,560
about with our conversation with iran

201
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,560
or well i think you don't need me to

202
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,280
explain what he has done and continues

203
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,240
to do

204
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,879
to use fiction to demonstrate uh the

205
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,400
horrors

206
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,600
of a totalitarian state and camus who

207
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,239
might be my all-time

208
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,840
you know great lighthouse so to speak in

209
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,439
terms of being a man of conscience

210
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,959
you know he joined the communist party

211
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,519
and for a lot of people in the states

212
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,879
you hear

213
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,000
oh you joined the communist party so i

214
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,120
need to hear so all you need he was a

215
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,639
communist all you need to know

216
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,160
he joined the communist party because

217
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
they were the main ones fighting the

218
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,280
fascists in france and other locations

219
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,199
and he took nazism as did many others of

220
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,799
course very very very seriously he

221
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,759
wasn't some committed communist but this

222
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,879
was just his

223
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,319
mechanism to take on uh you know be part

224
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,519
of the underground in vichy france and

225
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,039
so on and so forth

226
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,519
so he had the quote which is ascribed to

227
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:17,360
him

228
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,799
which is kind of a misquote howard zinn

229
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,879
is the one who actually said it that

230
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,800
it is a job of thinking people not to be

231
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,759
on the side of the executioners

232
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,199
and he very much felt if you read his uh

233
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,598
speech when he won the nobel prize i

234
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,079
forget

235
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,360
in the 50s where he goes it's basically

236
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,758
the job of writers

237
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,400
to keep civilization from destroying

238
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,560
himself

239
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,000
i don't think i'm ever going to be a man

240
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,959
on the level of camus and what he's

241
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,240
accomplished

242
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,638
but i think that vision of

243
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,598
it is the job of writers to be the

244
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,319
conscience

245
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,839
and to point out uh you know this is the

246
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,680
leftism at its best when

247
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,918
you're giving voice to the voiceless

248
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,079
when you have the machine of the state

249
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,079
crushing and marginalizing people and

250
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,758
they might not be educated literate or

251
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,478
have any power at all

252
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,120
some he's the guy who's like you are

253
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,000
ruining

254
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,918
humans these humans matter and i'm not

255
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,120
going to let you look the other way

256
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,120
and act like you don't know what you're

257
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,439
doing so in this time

258
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,598
whether we look at the time of fascism

259
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,719
or we look at the fictional animal farm

260
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:21,279
what's the heroic action then so uh

261
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,280
camus joined the communist party there's

262
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,478
a bunch of different heroic actions

263
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,519
some more heroic than others not just

264
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,279
for the

265
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,560
you know heroes the wrong word in terms

266
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,158
of like effectiveness

267
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,158
what's the effective action i guess is

268
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,958
what i want to ask as a writer as a

269
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,200
thinker

270
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,079
somebody with a mind what's the heroic

271
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,759
action

272
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,599
that's a tricky question because a lot

273
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,838
of times in the west heroism

274
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,519
is regardless intertwined with martyrdom

275
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,560
right so it's kind of this idea of like

276
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,320
you have to speak to

277
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,759
you know kemu always talked about just

278
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
let justice be done though the heavens

279
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,039
fall

280
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,240
this is a common um kind of motto among

281
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,439
people with conscience

282
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,200
and that you have to do the right thing

283
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
even the consequences might not be what

284
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
you like

285
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,360
and i think that is a good loose

286
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,278
definition of heroism

287
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,278
so if you me i'll give you one example

288
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,519
of heroism this was on twitter and i

289
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,120
really feel bad that i don't remember

290
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,519
the guy's name

291
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,320
uh this was the line to auschwitz i

292
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,839
believe it was

293
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,519
and you know there's the nazi guards

294
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,920
keeping everyone along

295
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,440
and uh if you were a certain i think if

296
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,879
you were under 12 they killed you or

297
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,320
some there was some age limit where

298
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,000
some kids were killed or some were not

299
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,480
there were some circumstances

300
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,159
and he asked the mom how old this kid

301
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
was and she's like he's 14 and she's

302
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,639
like no he's 12. and she's like no he's

303
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,519
nice 14 she goes

304
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,838
he's 12. and she realized what this nazi

305
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,039
was telling her even in that

306
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,360
circumstance and it ended up saving the

307
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:43,519
kids life so i think heroism

308
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,480
in this context is defiance

309
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,440
and standing true to values of

310
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,560
liberalism

311
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,760
humanism and venerating the sanctity

312
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:56,000
of human life i think that uh and

313
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,879
i think it's also important to pick your

314
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,600
battles

315
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:01,759
uh i don't think if you know he got that

316
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
nazi over there gotten a bullhorn

317
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,278
and said hey this is the rules blah blah

318
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,959
blah blah that's not going to help

319
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,958
anyone do anything so i do think

320
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,879
you know people a lot of times attack me

321
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,319
from my anarchist views it's like oh

322
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,679
you know would you call the police would

323
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,120
you use the roads would you pay your

324
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,838
income taxes

325
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,278
uh you know i i got an argument with tim

326
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,959
poole because there was that couple i

327
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:21,759
think it was at missouri or illinois

328
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,159
when they were

329
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,919
had their guns and they were being

330
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,480
arrested and they basically took a plea

331
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,479
deal

332
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,320
and he said you should have fought i go

333
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,680
it's a lot easier to say you should

334
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,120
fight but we don't know what

335
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,359
circumstance someone is under

336
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,519
and what these totalitarian regimes did

337
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,560
very very well as as you know

338
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,600
is if you were a target and they can't

339
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,919
get through to you

340
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,720
that's fine you have a family so you can

341
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,519
sit there

342
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,560
lex and gird your jaw and you can stand

343
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,000
up to all the torture

344
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:51,599
cool what are we gonna do about your

345
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,799
wife what about your mom one thing

346
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,839
stalin did

347
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,759
he made it a law that kids up to

348
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
uh 14 and up could get the death penalty

349
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,399
for certain crimes

350
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,799
so after that the rule was from the nkvd

351
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,240
if you were interrogating someone they

352
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,199
would have death warrants

353
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,360
for the kid's child on the desk visible

354
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,160
so i'm interrogating you asking you

355
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,639
to commit to i'm sorry to admit to some

356
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,240
crime

357
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,559
that you're not committed and those

358
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
piece of paper it's you know svetlana

359
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,919
she's got a death warrant you're gonna

360
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,320
admit to any crime you want

361
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,000
so this is something americans this is

362
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,839
even the case right now in north korea

363
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,120
um which i know you had yami park on

364
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,160
it's something i talk about a lot

365
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,159
let's talk about instead of the

366
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,879
hypothetical but this is happening right

367
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,719
now

368
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,120
on earth you can look at the map on

369
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,800
google uh the great leader kim il-sung

370
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,480
the founder of north korea said class

371
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,078
enemies must be exterminated three

372
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,600
generations so north

373
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,919
when people talk about individualism

374
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,680
versus collectivism uh rick santorum

375
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,759
former center says the family is the

376
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,919
basic unit of society

377
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,879
unit north korea takes that seriously

378
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,958
the family

379
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,039
is punished as a unit so if someone does

380
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,278
something wrong three generations have

381
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,519
to

382
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,399
pay the price and you often don't know

383
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,000
who it is

384
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,159
that got you all in trouble there's not

385
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,519
a trial this to western

386
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,759
minds is something almost

387
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,959
incomprehensible it's a lot easier to be

388
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,639
brave

389
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,159
when it's just your skin there's

390
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,399
something when it's when it's

391
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,838
yeah when it's your child your your

392
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,399
loved ones

393
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,240
your every man becomes a coward but also

394
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,919
what bravery is there for me to write an

395
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,600
essay for the guardian to say i don't

396
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,000
vote there's no consequences to me

397
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
there's no

398
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,879
possibility of consequences to me this

399
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,559
is the wonderful thing about living

400
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,759
excuse me in a free country

401
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,679
uh it would take a lot of courage to be

402
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,799
in the soviet union and say i'm not

403
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:37,199
going to vote

404
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,958
and what would that courage accomplish

405
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,120
very little so i think heroism in the

406
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,599
sense of kind of the suicidal stuff and

407
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,360
taking a stance with no consequences is

408
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,519
a bit overrated

409
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,120
there is some aspect like the way i

410
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,839
think about heroism

411
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,879
is something like you said about the

412
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,760
soldier

413
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,720
which is quietly privately in your own

414
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:59,519
life

415
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,040
live the virtues that you want the rest

416
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,240
of the world to live by

417
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,639
yes so like without like writing about

418
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,120
it

419
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,919
is um it's not as heroic as living it

420
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,039
quietly

421
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:13,439
i'll give you a great example of this i

422
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,278
sometimes give talks on networking and i

423
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,360
tell the kids

424
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,879
if you know someone's in town and it's

425
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
their birthday with nothing to do take

426
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,439
them out

427
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,720
and i say i do this for selfish reasons

428
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,440
and everyone laughs

429
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,000
and i go think about it this way the guy

430
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,639
who takes people out for their birthday

431
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,078
is awesome that could be you like you

432
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,759
have that capacity

433
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,958
to be that person and you're making that

434
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,159
day feel special they're going to

435
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,198
remember for a long time

436
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:42,078
what's the cost dinner 30 bucks 25 bucks

437
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,958
so they're it's it's very disturbing to

438
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:46,159
me

439
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,638
how often people have opportunities

440
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,919
to slightly move the needle and make

441
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,320
things a bit better

442
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,319
at almost no cost and they just

443
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,480
literally don't think in those terms

444
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,360
and one of the things camus talked about

445
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
you know he's

446
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,199
often described as a existentialist

447
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,959
which he did not like that term he

448
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,639
regard himself as an absurdist

449
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,039
is the idea that we're basically blank

450
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,399
canvases and this isn't something that

451
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,439
is dangerous this is enormous

452
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,839
opportunity

453
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,440
and you have the ability to become the

454
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,600
kind of man or woman

455
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,639
that you admire and want to be you don't

456
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,079
have to be you know

457
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,759
i don't know george washington or one of

458
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,958
these great heroes of all time

459
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,078
but everyone out there has the capacity

460
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,479
capacity excuse me

461
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,759
to be a hero to their kids or to be a

462
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,360
hero to maybe some

463
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,879
there's there's nursing homes and

464
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,120
there's old people who are lonely

465
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,078
i think that you take in a dog that's on

466
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,679
its last legs

467
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:39,679
uh these are little things terry shepard

468
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,000
does that a lot out of garden was a hero

469
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,799
um these are not terry sheppard on

470
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,759
blanken's name

471
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,919
these are things that people do um that

472
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,958
aren't heroic in the sense of superman

473
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,559
but that i find admirable extremely and

474
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,559
i think are very underrated because

475
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,638
these people aren't championed

476
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,719
is this some kind of weird

477
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,959
passive-aggressive and direct way

478
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,959
for you to tell me that i should take

479
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,879
you off for your birthday on monday

480
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,719
is that why you gave that whole speech

481
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,399
that's that wasn't it at all

482
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,079
that was a joke michael no it was a

483
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,399
failed joke

484
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,078
nevertheless there was no punch line

485
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,440
without failure we would not have

486
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,479
triumph

487
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,920
can we stick on the camus absurdism

488
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,240
versus existentialism

489
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:27,519
sure what do you think is the difference

490
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,560
in your ideas about uh anarchism

491
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:34,360
too it seems like those are

492
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:38,078
somehow intricately connected because uh

493
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,800
existentialism is connected to freedom

494
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:42,078
and freedom is connected to anarchism

495
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,719
sure but i mean

496
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,519
sartre was a defender of the soviet

497
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,000
union

498
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,759
uh he said explicitly about things like

499
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,278
gulags like even if it's true we

500
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,000
shouldn't talk about it

501
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:55,600
um so he it's what people don't

502
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,360
appreciate is how

503
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,120
uh human beings can have contradictory

504
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,120
ideas in their minds at the same time

505
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,120
so one would think okay someone's a

506
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,000
democrat they think abc therefore they

507
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,759
think def

508
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,519
people that have all sorts of

509
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,000
contradictions and it's not at all clear

510
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,959
and they'll

511
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,039
have a clean conscience because the

512
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,758
human mind is very sophisticated um

513
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,719
and is capable of doing this so sartre

514
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,240
you know was

515
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,839
you would think he's this radical

516
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,799
individualist you know this sense of

517
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,040
ultimate freedom

518
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,000
but he's defending the soviet union

519
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,240
camus on the other hand

520
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
would probably be was very much like a

521
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,198
social democrat

522
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,639
he didn't really talk about what

523
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,799
politics should be

524
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,320
so much as it shouldn't be his essay

525
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,240
reflections on the guillotine

526
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,959
is one of the great masterpieces of all

527
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,079
time an attack on the death penalty

528
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,479
not in terms of no one's evil or it's

529
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,799
wrong to kill murderers but in terms of

530
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
what does it do for a society if you

531
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,879
have someone who set

532
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,759
takes a person and locks them in a room

533
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,360
and says

534
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,120
you know in two years i'm going to

535
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,120
murder you and you lock them for that

536
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,560
this is not someone we regard as moral

537
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,480
regardless as someone who's

538
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,838
a complete monster but that's what the

539
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,680
state does you know

540
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,000
on with the death penalty and he

541
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,959
challenges us to think

542
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,279
is this the kind of people we want to be

543
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,679
do

544
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,359
and again he's saying i'm not saying

545
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,839
killing a murderer is wrong i'm not

546
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:16,159
saying evil is wrong his entire career

547
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,879
was dedicated to fighting the concept of

548
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,000
evil

549
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,839
but are we the kind of people who want

550
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,078
to be doing these things that in any

551
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,798
other context we regard as torture

552
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,759
or depraved so i i'm much more of a

553
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,599
camus person

554
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,440
than a star person he was probably

555
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,240
against war in that same way so i don't

556
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,720
i have to

557
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,079
uh admit i don't know much about the

558
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,600
political side of kamu

559
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,599
well i don't think his political side is

560
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,439
that interesting or relevant what i find

561
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:43,119
so interrupted what i find fascinating

562
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,480
about camus and what i think about on a

563
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,918
daily basis from him

564
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,839
is his insistence that you have to live

565
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,360
a life based on conscience

566
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,639
that you have to be accountable to

567
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,359
yourself when you put your pill your

568
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,600
head on the pill

569
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,639
at the end of the day and ask yourself

570
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,439
did i live

571
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,559
a righteous life with integrity true to

572
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,919
my values

573
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,119
did i uh not needlessly cause harm to

574
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,840
innocent people

575
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,359
um you know that kind of mindset did i

576
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,199
if someone is weak

577
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,798
am i using that as an opportunity to

578
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,440
exploit them or to harm them

579
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,960
or do i feel a bit of sympathy or

580
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,840
empathy for this person

581
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,519
because maybe they didn't have

582
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,519
circumstances that were you know as

583
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,720
beneficial as other people had well how

584
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,200
does that fit absurdism

585
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,558
where everything is absurd nothing has

586
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,160
meaning

587
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,079
uh you know it really borders on

588
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,360
nihilism so he

589
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:37,199
his he regards not his his philosophy

590
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,479
explicitly said is a response to

591
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,360
nihilism and

592
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,960
a attack on nihilism he you know he

593
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,240
regards cynicism as like

594
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,200
the worst value people can have and i

595
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,720
agree with him

596
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,640
one hundred percent a lot of times

597
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,120
people call me cynical online

598
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,320
and i push back very very hard because

599
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,678
to be a si

600
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,119
you know i had this quote and then you

601
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,000
write where i said i'd rather be naive

602
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,239
than a cynic

603
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,839
because a cynic is a hopeless man who

604
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,798
projects his hopelessness to the world

605
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,000
at large

606
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,519
uh camus this is the metaphor i use and

607
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,200
i find it very inspirational

608
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,960
i thought it was in his work but i guess

609
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,880
i thought if it described it to him

610
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,400
there's two types of people you imagine

611
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,840
you go to a mountainside

612
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,840
and you see a blank canvas

613
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:20,879
on an easel standing in front this

614
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,199
mountainside

615
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,080
one people be like why is this blank

616
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,840
canvas here

617
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,000
you know what what was this what's going

618
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,240
on here uh and just be confused

619
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,640
whereas the other type of person will be

620
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,919
like there's a blank canvas here in this

621
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,160
beautiful countryside

622
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,038
what a great opportunity i can paint

623
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,200
this river

624
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,240
i could paint that bird i could paint my

625
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,798
friends or myself

626
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,960
in the background infinite choices and

627
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,960
this is a gift that i have been given

628
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,798
and i think that also ties very heavily

629
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,160
into what i was i went to yeshiva as a

630
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,038
kid which is jewish school

631
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,558
what we were taught in incessantly uh

632
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,879
how to look at life

633
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,759
is this beautiful gift that god has

634
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,919
given you

635
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,879
and that god wants you to be happy he

636
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,759
wants you to live

637
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,320
to the fullest in a moral way i remember

638
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,839
the first time i went into a church

639
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,200
and they were asking questions about the

640
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,720
jewish concept the afterlife they

641
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,159
weren't familiar with jewish thought

642
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,440
and it took me a second because i didn't

643
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,000
really have answers and then i

644
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,000
remembered what we were taught which is

645
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,519
let's suppose you're at this banquet

646
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
with the best chef on earth

647
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,038
and the table's so heavy because you've

648
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,240
got steaks and you've got chicken and

649
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,079
you've got sushi

650
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
and the wine's flowing and you've got

651
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,558
your dr pepper and

652
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,519
mr and mr pibb and the store brand

653
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:32,879
everything you want

654
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,639
and you're looking around at this

655
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,480
amazing bounty right

656
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,240
and then you turn to this best chef on

657
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,038
earth and you're like oh so what's for

658
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,079
dessert

659
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,879
i mean the offensiveness of that is just

660
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,879
so

661
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,880
you know insane like you have this eat

662
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,480
the meal like i promise you

663
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,919
if i could deliver this meal the

664
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,400
dessert's gonna be okay

665
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,960
so this focus on the afterlife when

666
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,840
we've been given this amazing gift

667
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,440
uh you know on this earth is is a very

668
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,359
kind of different mindset from both

669
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,480
the jewish tradition as i've been taught

670
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:03,839
and the kamu mindset

671
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,240
obviously kamu is an atheist didn't

672
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,879
believe in an afterlife but this concept

673
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,558
that life

674
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:14,480
is is meaningless but that means

675
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:17,279
you have that opportunity to find value

676
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,640
to seek for truth to seek for happiness

677
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,000
and kamu has this quote

678
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,440
it's ascribed to him it's like a meme

679
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,480
i've never found the source so maybe he

680
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,558
doesn't really say it

681
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,480
but he says maybe it's not about happy

682
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,240
endings maybe it's about the journey

683
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,919
and i think when you have that mindset

684
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,798
and as you and i i think you and i both

685
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,480
found this

686
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:33,839
because neither of us when we were kids

687
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,240
thought we'd be doing this

688
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,959
right but now that we are really

689
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,279
fortunate

690
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,880
definitely this yeah and definitely that

691
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,798
yeah but now that we're fortunate enough

692
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,240
to do this and that we're blessed enough

693
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,200
that there's people who find this of

694
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,960
value and interest

695
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,960
and we could pay the rent doing this

696
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,440
there's not a day that goes by

697
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,798
where i don't think you and i or think

698
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,720
this is pretty absurd

699
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,079
yeah but it's also pretty wonderful and

700
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,279
as a consequence of us

701
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,639
thriving it also shows other people that

702
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,678
happiness is possible

703
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,880
on this earth and i think cynicism is

704
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,280
the lie

705
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,799
it's not just the worldview it's a lie

706
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,119
that happiness is not

707
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,400
possible in this earth or it's only

708
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,558
happy possible

709
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,679
if you sell your soul and you're like a

710
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,200
bad person you screw

711
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,759
other people over i reject that in every

712
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,038
aspect

713
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,798
you know as you said my birthday's

714
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,279
coming up i've been feeling

715
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:27,119
um just a lot of really great things

716
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,119
have been happening very very recently

717
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,439
so it affects me very heavily

718
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:34,479
emotionally especially when i see

719
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,880
the response it gives to uh

720
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,558
like the kids right so it's one thing to

721
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,240
say this is what i'm for

722
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,720
but when you can provide proof of

723
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,440
concept that what you've been advocating

724
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,960
does result in positive responses i got

725
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,120
a message from this kid

726
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,960
who had tried to kill himself a year ago

727
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,719
okay and then he

728
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,000
was like look i found your work i found

729
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,519
some other stuff and

730
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,519
now i realize i'm going to make

731
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,158
something of myself i was born in a meth

732
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,720
house

733
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,000
you know whatever 19 20 years old i

734
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,839
should be in the garbage

735
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,319
but i'm gonna try to be a stand-up

736
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,319
because i have opportunity on this earth

737
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,359
even if he fails as a stand-up you know

738
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,839
he's still

739
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,879
such whatever he does washing dishes

740
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,158
there's no shame in that

741
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,600
he is it so bad to have a crappy job

742
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,600
and a girlfriend who you don't really

743
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,119
like but as compared to the alternative

744
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,319
of like i'm going to kill myself this is

745
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,479
heaven

746
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,519
well i think there's beauty to be

747
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,279
discovered in

748
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,119
all of it and all of those experiences

749
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:32,158
yes so

750
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,759
but at the same time so

751
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,159
i often think about i just recently

752
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,240
reread the idiot by destiusky

753
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,520
i often feel like the idiot that's why

754
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,400
when i say i'm an idiot

755
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,158
i often think about prince mishkin that

756
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,120
kind of idiot which the world sees you

757
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,640
as naive

758
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,678
i don't think he's naive i don't think

759
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,759
i'm naive but i tend to

760
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,440
see the good in people and the good in

761
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,480
every moment

762
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,400
and the world often

763
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,000
is cynical and in fact especially in

764
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,559
what we do

765
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,359
often the intellectual is supposed to be

766
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,720
cynical

767
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:09,678
it's i this is very much an urban uh

768
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,278
elite educated mindset where if you

769
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,360
write a book about someone who's let's

770
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,679
suppose a drug addict or a prostitute

771
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,798
that has heft and that's valid but if

772
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,960
you're writing a book about

773
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,400
like a love story you know two people

774
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,120
love and it's they're in roller coasters

775
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,440
or

776
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,599
carousels that's less legitimate i hate

777
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,919
that i hate that i hate that so much

778
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,839
because the message it gives to people

779
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,640
is you have to choose between

780
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,439
thriving and happiness and silliness and

781
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,278
seriousness

782
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,640
and depravity and i'm not saying a drug

783
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:37,919
addict approaches to pray but they're

784
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,360
basically their world views if it's

785
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,600
unless it's dark and twisted

786
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,839
it doesn't really count as art and i i

787
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,839
despise that mindset that subtext

788
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,199
so the internet and people around me

789
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,319
often will call me naive

790
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,240
because i don't think the word they want

791
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,599
is innocent don't you think it's about

792
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,919
it's not that innocent

793
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,839
no but it innocent in that you you

794
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,200
genuinely in your heart i know you

795
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,240
fairly well at this point

796
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,640
believe that goodness is possible and

797
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
that

798
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,320
people can if not be good at least be

799
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,720
better than they were yesterday see

800
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,599
even the word naive or the word innocent

801
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,319
presumes that

802
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,599
there's not wisdom in that presumes that

803
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,918
somehow

804
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,879
that's uh oh isn't that beautiful to

805
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,360
live that life

806
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,200
of a child who sees the world with these

807
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,158
bright eyes and is hopeful about the

808
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,319
future

809
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,640
but just wait until they grow up and

810
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,599
realize that reality is much harsher

811
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,440
than they think

812
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:31,839
right but that child might be wiser than

813
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,840
all of the adults in the room and don't

814
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:34,399
you don't you want to be if the world is

815
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,558
like that

816
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,480
don't you want to be the guy who takes

817
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,359
it on and changes it for the better

818
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,038
right so it's like saying well you know

819
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,479
cancer is everywhere it's inevitable

820
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,960
well don't you want to be the one who

821
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,000
says not anymore i'm here and i'm going

822
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,480
to make that change

823
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,119
and i can see it being better than it is

824
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,038
now

825
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:57,599
so i i i think you and i have the same

826
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,960
analysis of your world view and i don't

827
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,359
think that there is a good

828
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,038
word for it so i guess it's this idea of

829
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,240
you know inherent benevolence might be

830
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,480
you know maybe wordy

831
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,319
but i think that's more accurate because

832
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,200
you know you and i did not have such

833
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,519
easy lives

834
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,038
growing up to put it mildly you

835
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,158
constantly talk about

836
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:17,839
um just horrific aspects of life so to

837
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,520
claim that you kind of don't know that

838
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,839
they exist or you sleep on the rug

839
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,879
is completely not accurate to your work

840
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:27,439
and your mindset

841
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,400
can we talk about world war ii in the

842
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,640
soviet union

843
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,640
sure

844
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:38,558
so on sunday june 22nd

845
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,720
1941 hitler launched

846
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:42,558
operation barbarossa which was the

847
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,798
surprise invasion of the soviet union

848
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,639
that's right if i could read to you a

849
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,278
few lyrics

850
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,600
from a song that for some reason has

851
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:55,278
stuck throughout my childhood

852
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,278
it was a famous song during that time

853
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,839
the song talks about um kiev

854
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,759
like that moment as part of that

855
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,798
operation that kiev was first bombed and

856
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,000
it was announced on

857
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,798
june 22nd the song says at exactly four

858
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,359
o'clock

859
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:31,440
that the war has begun for some reason

860
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:35,278
this song

861
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,000
haunts me because

862
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,759
the exactness of that time and this

863
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,519
realization

864
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,359
that at any moment you could have this

865
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,000
thing happen to you in your own personal

866
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:51,199
life maybe you had something like 9 11

867
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,919
happen where everything changes

868
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,880
and it's just like haunting because it

869
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,880
makes me think

870
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,600
that at any moment something like that

871
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,200
could happen that changes everything

872
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:05,359
and i just think about like normal life

873
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,840
going on in kiev at the time

874
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,558
and then all of a sudden the bombs are

875
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,759
dropping

876
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:11,918
and they announced that the war has

877
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:17,839
begun and you thought you were

878
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,840
going to stay out of the war um

879
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,320
um this is something that is very

880
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,720
intensely emotional for me

881
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,599
because you and i are both russian

882
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,798
jewish

883
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:36,558
so to know that my grandparents

884
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:36,558
and my great-grandma were told

885
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,000
that the nazis were coming and this

886
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,039
wasn't a dress rehearsal

887
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,599
and that if they get here which they do

888
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:49,119
they did lev is very western ukraine

889
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,798
that 100

890
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,319
you and all your relatives are going to

891
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:56,319
be uh murdered

892
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:58,240
yeah and uh

893
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:59,759
there's a monument now in in level where

894
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,278
i'm from about this

895
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,398
but i i don't think either of us can

896
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,599
imagine

897
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:10,959
what it's like to know

898
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,959
to think that we're about

899
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,480
you know minutes or whatever hours or

900
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,360
there's just there's just the russian

901
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,240
army

902
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,199
standing between us and everyone

903
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,359
everyone

904
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,679
we are related to are going to be

905
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:27,199
murdered for no reason

906
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,720
and um

907
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,640
you know like what's the closure here

908
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,600
right like they evacuated a lot of

909
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,000
people

910
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,879
and but they didn't evacuate enough and

911
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,919
to know

912
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,520
that there is this force

913
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,960
coming to 100 murder you this isn't some

914
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,200
kind of you know uh the tv news being

915
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,720
hyperbolic they are coming to kill you

916
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,840
and they if they get you they will kill

917
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,000
you and you have to

918
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:56,158
you know we all think about war let go

919
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
you know we hope america wins in iraq

920
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,760
right but if america got their ass

921
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,798
kicked kind of in vietnam

922
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,839
it's not really going to affect america

923
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:05,359
in the sense that you're going to have

924
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,480
the body bags and all the kids being

925
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,158
killed and that's something that's i'm

926
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,720
not sweeping on the rug but

927
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,840
no one in america thought the vietnamese

928
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,839
are going to come here and kill them

929
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:17,119
right they were secure in their person

930
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:20,480
so to have that sense of

931
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,678
we really need to win because if we

932
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,200
don't win

933
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,919
we are 100 if we they the russian army

934
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,399
doesn't win

935
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,520
we are 100 percent all going to be

936
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:31,359
slaughtered

937
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,440
and often in not just a bullet to the

938
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,398
head in sadistic ways

939
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,919
is something that um to know that people

940
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,798
who share my blood

941
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,679
uh saw and went through is very hard for

942
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:46,158
me to kind of um

943
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,360
uh wrap my head around and there's no

944
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,440
possibility

945
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,798
to delude yourself yeah yeah yeah

946
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,278
because i mean they

947
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,079
they would uh as the song also talks

948
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:56,798
about but

949
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,798
they would burn the factories so it's

950
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,839
basically saying

951
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,759
we're in the war now this is like this

952
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:04,959
is your life yeah like this is our life

953
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:07,278
you know how you yesterday you're

954
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,319
worried about like oh i misplaced my pen

955
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:12,558
where is it like it's like yeah

956
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,879
this was paradise most of us are gonna

957
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:18,000
this our life now is that most

958
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,159
of us are going to die and

959
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,519
if we want to prevent all of us from

960
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,640
dying

961
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,519
we uh we have to fight and we also can't

962
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,919
sit down

963
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,880
in some kind of weird like um desert

964
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,200
island or

965
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,399
you know plane crash situation and be

966
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,679
like let's decide

967
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,079
between us who's going to be the first

968
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,720
to die maybe the like titan the titanic

969
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,319
right

970
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,839
they sat down and they were like women

971
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:40,960
and children in the lifeboats

972
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,038
you know they had this rational

973
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,240
agreement you don't have those choices

974
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:49,519
in in a war so um

975
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,679
it's it's something that i uh uh

976
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,440
it's it's just very chilling and it's

977
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,278
something i don't really have

978
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,640
um the emotional space to understand or

979
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:00,558
grapple with

980
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,240
uh even you know obviously i've been to

981
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,240
north korea you can see it and so on and

982
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,640
so forth

983
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,640
you and i can't or anyone listening to

984
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,919
this except for maybe on me and people

985
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,919
like that

986
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,960
you can't imagine what that's like to

987
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,360
live it

988
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,000
we can't i we can't imagine what it's

989
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,678
like to live in those situations where

990
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,919
it's not like before hitler came

991
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,000
everyone's you know dancing around

992
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,360
and having a great time i mean imagine

993
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,640
how what that life is like

994
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:30,719
where your preference to hitler

995
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,679
is starving and waiting online for hours

996
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,360
for bread

997
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,480
and to have the secret police and your

998
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,678
friends are turning you in and your

999
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,399
phones are all tapped and you're a

1000
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,440
prisoner

1001
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,879
but to you this is infinitely better

1002
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,159
than the alternative like these are the

1003
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,480
choices that you know our family had to

1004
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,200
deal with it's something that no matter

1005
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,599
how much

1006
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,720
you it's like a let me put in terms

1007
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,599
people understand

1008
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,000
you know what i mean it's like your

1009
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,558
first bad breakup right like that's a

1010
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,319
much

1011
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,319
simpler thing to wrap your head around

1012
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,278
because it's like if you've never had it

1013
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:00,798
you can't really

1014
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,398
but when you feel it it's just so

1015
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:03,519
intense but you can't tell someone

1016
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,599
what's like

1017
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,120
we could sit down for days and hours and

1018
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,079
have people tell us

1019
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,839
but until it's the totality totality of

1020
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:12,960
your environment and your life and your

1021
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,000
mindset

1022
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,000
i remember my grandma

1023
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:18,879
um

1024
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:27,759
she would talk about that's like

1025
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,760
when you're when you're that hungry

1026
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,558
all you're thinking about is bread yeah

1027
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,640
because your brain won't let you know

1028
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:37,759
human beings you're revolved we have

1029
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,640
instincts whatever and

1030
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,398
the mind is telling you food food food

1031
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,759
food food food

1032
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,879
and that there's kids thinking this and

1033
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,119
that there's there they're not going to

1034
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,799
get the food yeah and

1035
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,719
imagine being a parent and you're

1036
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:55,038
watching your kids without food

1037
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,240
and knowing they're not gonna get the

1038
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:58,319
food

1039
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,079
and uh the fact that this happened in

1040
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:03,678
north korea in the 90s

1041
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:06,158
yeah i i met a refugee

1042
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,200
and uh he had to watch his dad starve to

1043
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,800
death

1044
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,800
and uh thank you um

1045
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:18,639
and we have no

1046
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,280
concept of uh

1047
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,039
what it's like i mean we kind of you

1048
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,440
know it's just like

1049
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,119
last night here in austin all the places

1050
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,240
were closed and i couldn't get my

1051
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,720
protein powder

1052
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,598
yeah and this is the extent of my

1053
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,759
suffering

1054
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,440
when it comes to food you know or if i

1055
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,960
couldn't there was a restaurant that i

1056
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,918
went to in brooklyn

1057
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,720
where for some vacation reason they

1058
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,638
weren't serving

1059
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,559
sashimi they only had sushi so i had to

1060
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,039
have the rice and the carbs

1061
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,960
to live a life where that is the extent

1062
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,679
of your food problems

1063
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,320
as opposed to the choice is either

1064
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,119
hitler

1065
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,480
killing you or being hungry 24 7. you

1066
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,240
know my grandma told this story of how

1067
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,719
they had a close call it was her and her

1068
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,838
brother and her mom my great-grandma who

1069
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,039
passed

1070
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,279
and i think there was like either

1071
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:10,480
helicopter overhead or something and my

1072
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,720
great-grandma jumped on top of my uh

1073
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,519
grandma's brother and not my grandma so

1074
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,679
she basically

1075
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,800
did a sophie's choice my grandma's name

1076
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,199
is sophia

1077
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,560
and chose the brother and this is

1078
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:22,480
something that she felt

1079
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,239
you know all her life that her mom had

1080
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,320
chosen her brother over her

1081
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,078
but these little things that happen

1082
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,000
these little kind of a

1083
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,079
decisions we have to make in war there's

1084
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,960
a book i read called uh

1085
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,800
uh five chimneys i think this woman who

1086
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,639
was an auschwitz survivor

1087
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,320
and what she talked about what people

1088
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,719
don't appreciate it's not

1089
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,079
necessarily the slaughter and the

1090
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,159
torture it's that

1091
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,760
there's no rhyme or reason to it like

1092
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,199
she talked about how they had a camp

1093
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,800
just for people from uh czechoslovakia

1094
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:54,639
and they were treated better than the

1095
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,119
jews and then one day they just killed

1096
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,039
them all

1097
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,160
right and she's like i still don't

1098
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:59,599
understand

1099
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,358
why they're giving them food and

1100
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,320
treating them well and then the next day

1101
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:03,920
they're all killed

1102
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,400
and we will never get answers you know

1103
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,440
and she's and and things like

1104
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,920
uh she talks about how they decided to

1105
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,320
kill

1106
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,838
all the kids and they didn't really

1107
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,240
either for some reason they didn't have

1108
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,400
the

1109
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,679
courage to or they wanted to be cruel so

1110
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,000
instead of shooting them they just kept

1111
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:22,719
walking in the snow until they all died

1112
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,239
so it's things like this that uh the

1113
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:26,959
fact that you and i

1114
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:27,439
dodged these bullets and that we can be

1115
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,920
here

1116
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,519
and uh be doing this and you know

1117
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,240
running our mouths for a living

1118
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,960
uh i i think about it all the time and

1119
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,959
um

1120
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:42,320
uh it's it's just very um

1121
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,838
uh disturbing to know and i know you

1122
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,720
know this as well that there's lots of

1123
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:46,559
places on earth

1124
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:48,000
where if people had a choice they would

1125
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:49,440
kill us on site and be proud of

1126
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,280
themselves for it

1127
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,559
yeah they're i don't know what to make

1128
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,519
of the contrast that you

1129
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,679
you were talking about the fact that

1130
00:36:55,519 --> 00:37:00,239
you've been truly happy the last

1131
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:03,199
few weeks and months yes there's been a

1132
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:06,319
lot of moments of happiness and joy

1133
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:09,199
and that joy is built on a history

1134
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,240
of human suffering like in your roots in

1135
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,919
your blood

1136
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:13,919
is a lot of people that were tortured

1137
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,800
that suffered so that you could have

1138
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,639
this joy

1139
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,039
you have both the you have the

1140
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,759
responsibility to truly be grateful for

1141
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,599
that joy

1142
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,880
but it also shows that there's the happy

1143
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,800
ending that it does

1144
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,200
end in a good note that it does get

1145
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,519
infinitely infinitely better

1146
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,199
um and that i think there's a i don't

1147
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,599
like you saying the word responsibility

1148
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,960
but

1149
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,280
there is um an opportunity for those of

1150
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,800
us

1151
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,359
who did dodge that bullet to uh

1152
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,200
give testimony to these people and more

1153
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,279
importantly to give testimony to the

1154
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,319
people who are going through this

1155
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,920
now so you know one of the reasons i you

1156
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,200
know talk about north korea so much why

1157
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,838
i wrote dear reader

1158
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,118
is because it's very easy and this is

1159
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,119
human nature i'm not

1160
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,400
condemning people i don't i think this

1161
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,240
is how people are wired

1162
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,760
when you see an asian country with asian

1163
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,000
people and things are

1164
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,280
you know bad over there you you know i

1165
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,639
think in the west it's like oh you know

1166
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,400
asia they're all crazy there they're

1167
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:09,519
wacky they eat you know they eat dogs or

1168
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,200
someone and so forth some weird

1169
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:12,719
stereotype and they think of them as

1170
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,039
kind of martians

1171
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:15,759
so it's important for people who aren't

1172
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,800
of that

1173
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,560
kind of ancestry to kind of speak on

1174
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,000
behalf of these people because it's very

1175
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,639
different how just people just naturally

1176
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,239
react

1177
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,239
when you have a westerner talking about

1178
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,919
this instead of becoming

1179
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,078
there you know them over there it

1180
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,800
becomes you know this could have been

1181
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,640
uh us very easily i have a friend peter

1182
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,320
they hansky great dude

1183
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,639
and i was showing him photos when i was

1184
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,480
in pyongyang and he goes this looks like

1185
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,480
a russian city with asian people it was

1186
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,159
it completely disturbed him

1187
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,760
so you know that was one of the reasons

1188
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,559
i did go to north korea because that was

1189
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,480
as close as

1190
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,838
i would get to see what your family went

1191
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
through to see what my family went

1192
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,679
through

1193
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,079
and they're still living under this uh

1194
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:57,838
a regime and one of the things i fought

1195
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,160
very hard to do with dear reader which i

1196
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,799
was successful in amazingly and

1197
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,239
it just i said like i could die now like

1198
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,000
i feel like if you make if just move the

1199
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:09,039
needle a little bit then you've kind of

1200
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,838
uh paid your due for

1201
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,000
your time here on this earth to have it

1202
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,078
change from being a laughing stock

1203
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,039
you know and i i think team america did

1204
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,200
a good job

1205
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:20,480
they made kim jong il into a clown and

1206
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,799
they made a joke of it

1207
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,480
but you're going from nothing to joke so

1208
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,839
at least now people are aware of it that

1209
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,240
it exists right

1210
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,920
and then i st and many others took it

1211
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,799
from a joke to like

1212
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,720
guys this is really really really bad

1213
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,480
and none of us can even appreciate how

1214
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:37,439
bad it is and i think now there is an

1215
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,639
understanding

1216
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,240
other than a few people who are just

1217
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,519
looking through a trump lens and wanting

1218
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,399
trump to fail because trump's an [ __ ]

1219
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:45,280
and that's fine

1220
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,880
to be like these poor people and it's

1221
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,320
really unfortunate because there's

1222
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,640
a segment of western culture who thinks

1223
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,838
that correctly often when you're

1224
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,039
complaining about

1225
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,759
uh or discussing the plight of another

1226
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,000
country

1227
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,240
that's just your preludes to war and an

1228
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,440
excuse to invade like the kurds in syria

1229
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,559
you know we're talked about if we're not

1230
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,318
in syria tomorrow it's going to be

1231
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,400
another genocide blah blah

1232
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:10,800
i'm not saying let's invade north korea

1233
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,440
or anything like that all i'm saying is

1234
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,560
you know thank god that this is in your

1235
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,240
life

1236
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:18,639
i bring this up all the time the woman

1237
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:21,439
who was my guide when i was there

1238
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:21,920
i'm aware of what she's up to now she's

1239
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,760
still

1240
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,039
she's extremely rich by north korean

1241
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,880
standards but she'll never be in a

1242
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,880
position to buy medicine she'll never be

1243
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,200
in a position to go on a vacation

1244
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,318
uh things that you and i just you know

1245
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,879
whatever she

1246
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,559
she can't go on the internet she can't

1247
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,280
get encyclopedia

1248
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,159
uh she can't better herself as a person

1249
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,680
other than

1250
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,358
through what the state allows and

1251
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,879
meaning better yourself as a person

1252
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:51,039
in service to the state so i i i mean

1253
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,800
there's it's also frustrating because

1254
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,279
there's only so much that i can do

1255
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,560
as an individual what's your takeaway

1256
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,720
about human nature

1257
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,559
from looking at north korea and looking

1258
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:01,439
at how the rest of the world is looking

1259
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,078
at north korea

1260
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,760
uh i i always this is a great question i

1261
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,000
think about it fairly often and i always

1262
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,160
say

1263
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,358
human beings are animals right when you

1264
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,000
say someone's an animal

1265
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,960
it's like a slur like he's like a beast

1266
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,679
animals are capable of enormous kindness

1267
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,800
empathy sympathy you know they look out

1268
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,559
for one another

1269
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,640
groom one another there's a thing with

1270
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,960
with apes where they groom each other

1271
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,400
for

1272
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,079
parasites and you're suppose even if

1273
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,440
there are no parasites they pretend this

1274
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,240
parasites just to have that kind of

1275
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,920
bonding

1276
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:33,679
uh you see infinite uh photos online of

1277
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,240
like cats raising puppies because the

1278
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,239
puppies

1279
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,000
mom died things like this that's part of

1280
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,959
being an animal part of being an animal

1281
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,159
is also

1282
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,000
just the most uh monstrous cruelty

1283
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:46,159
killer whales you know there's this big

1284
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,599
pc move did not call them killer whales

1285
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:51,039
and just call them orcas

1286
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,519
they will murder blue whale pups

1287
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,119
uh cavs excuse me and play with them and

1288
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,480
not even eat them so they just murder

1289
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,440
for the sake of fun

1290
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,440
so there's and cats you know kill birds

1291
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,559
all the time things like this so it runs

1292
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,679
the whole gamut

1293
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:07,279
um and i think it's i i'm you know when

1294
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,719
yaron and i were on your show i don't

1295
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,800
think lord of the flies is accurate i

1296
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,919
don't think hobbes is how reality works

1297
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,359
when you're in that kind of state um

1298
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,079
but i think uh we've seen countless

1299
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,799
examples

1300
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,599
of human beings especially when human

1301
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,800
beings have

1302
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,519
power over someone who's powerless of

1303
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,039
allowing themselves to engage in

1304
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:33,280
not just harm but cruelty

1305
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,440
and that is something as soviets you and

1306
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,839
i are very painfully aware of it

1307
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,440
it's not just about the oppression which

1308
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,000
as bad enough as it is

1309
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,599
it's that mediocre person with that

1310
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,159
little bit of power

1311
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,079
and now they're standing between you and

1312
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:51,519
your daughter having medicine

1313
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,200
and they love it to make you dance

1314
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,119
to be like oh you need me to get this

1315
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,799
medicine make you go

1316
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,160
go through hoops because now they feel

1317
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,359
like for the first time in their life

1318
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,078
they're in a position of strength and

1319
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,119
power

1320
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,119
i think that is in many ways the more

1321
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,880
common nature of evil what hannah aaron

1322
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,640
talks about the banality of evil

1323
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,079
than someone who's like an ss guard

1324
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:11,519
you're shooting someone in the head

1325
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,359
like that i think we could all wrap our

1326
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:14,559
heads around to some extent like okay

1327
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:16,719
i'm a military

1328
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,920
it's not easy i have to execute people

1329
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,199
pulling a trigger you could kind of have

1330
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,639
this mental disconnect between the

1331
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,559
finger and the victim

1332
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,920
but like that little day-to-day stuff

1333
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:25,440
like are you doing the right thing on a

1334
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,240
day-to-day basis that i think is

1335
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,000
far more common and far more disturbing

1336
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,679
aspect in certain senses of the human

1337
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,800
psyche

1338
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:36,960
yeah there's something especially

1339
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,240
disturbing about

1340
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,599
a weak man

1341
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,159
given power yeah and just abusing that

1342
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,838
power

1343
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:49,039
there's something about not just weak

1344
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:51,039
but like mediocre and everything it does

1345
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,719
or less than mediocre if you a great

1346
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,639
example of this which i'm also talking

1347
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:56,959
about the next book is ceausescu

1348
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,679
who was the dictator of romania so you

1349
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,440
know

1350
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,118
the cold war is still somewhat poorly

1351
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,039
understood in

1352
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:04,559
you know popular culture but the

1353
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:05,920
different countries in the second world

1354
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,599
the soviet bloc

1355
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,800
some are more liberal than others some

1356
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,838
were more sane than others and

1357
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,000
chauchesko

1358
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,838
at first was one of the you know more

1359
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,519
western friendly more the free ones

1360
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,440
then he met the great leader kim sung

1361
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,519
from north korea and he had the idea to

1362
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,119
impose a personality cult on

1363
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:22,639
romania and it's the kind of things like

1364
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,079
forcing people to breed because he

1365
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:25,838
wanted to make people taller

1366
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,599
he i think he made like the biggest

1367
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,358
building in all of europe the people's

1368
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,039
palace but it was just for him

1369
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,960
while there's no electricity you know

1370
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,800
elsewhere but you look at this guy

1371
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,318
you know stalin's a badass right he was

1372
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,760
a bank robber if you look at photos of

1373
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,920
him as a kid he was a hunk

1374
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,040
lennon was clearly intellectual these

1375
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,280
were not these are

1376
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:44,719
powerful trotsky these were powerful men

1377
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,400
with huge egos huge

1378
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,078
force of personality but you look at

1379
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,880
this chaucesko guy

1380
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,920
and you could like for example on my

1381
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,200
driver's license

1382
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,280
instead of my address i'm like in my

1383
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,838
real dress being like one two three four

1384
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,599
fifth avenue by mistake it says one two

1385
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:01,679
three four fifth street right

1386
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,599
so you can imagine him being in the post

1387
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:05,358
office and me giving him my id to get my

1388
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,559
package and him being baffled

1389
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:08,480
because this says street that says

1390
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,960
avenue instead of understand and this

1391
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,639
the look on his face this dullard that

1392
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,960
you can see how you know how sometimes

1393
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:16,639
i'm gonna can i curse

1394
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,519
[ __ ] yes yes so if you know like if

1395
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:19,118
you're in the airport and you see

1396
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,559
someone and you look at them an adult

1397
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,920
and you think okay this person was born

1398
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,039
[ __ ] up just like on site like

1399
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,838
something's wrong with them how are they

1400
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,318
traveling alone

1401
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:27,440
you look at chauchesku you look at him

1402
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:29,039
you're like something's not right with

1403
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,480
this guy not in the sense of like evil

1404
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:31,119
but in the sense that he's a simpleton

1405
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,559
right

1406
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,640
and now he's in charge of this whole

1407
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,400
country and everyone's taught to regard

1408
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:37,199
him as one of the great geniuses of all

1409
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,400
time

1410
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:42,559
and it's this the idea this mediocre

1411
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,160
nobody this guy would have in any other

1412
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:47,358
culture been accomplished

1413
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:49,279
nothing or or at war would have had an

1414
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:50,960
honest job where he's like okay he works

1415
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,560
at the mail mail service and he's batted

1416
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,920
it okay fine he's not hurting anyone

1417
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,679
and now as a result of this he's

1418
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,880
responsible for mass death

1419
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,318
secret police and incarceration and uh

1420
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,800
you know the one the greatest things

1421
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,000
that i've ever seen which i'm sure

1422
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,720
many people have seen as well if you go

1423
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,318
on youtube it's his speech

1424
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:09,519
and it's the first time the crowd turns

1425
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:10,318
and his head kind of like because they

1426
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:12,400
start booing him

1427
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:13,838
which was unheard of and you know he was

1428
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,599
shot with his uh um

1429
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:17,279
dog-faced wife not that long after it

1430
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,800
was just a great moment but

1431
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,280
it's things like this i agree with you

1432
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,960
that that mediocre weak person

1433
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,680
is now in a position of power over

1434
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,760
somebody else and that sense of

1435
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,279
vindictiveness like i'm going to feel

1436
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,720
strong for once in my life but it's

1437
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,640
going to be at your expense

1438
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:34,399
that i think is you know human nature

1439
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,559
it's most primal

1440
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,400
and every time i meet a person in this

1441
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,480
world you're the first person to get me

1442
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,079
to cry on a [ __ ] podcast [ __ ] the

1443
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,000
robot gets me to cry what the

1444
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,359
[ __ ] is going on every time i meet a

1445
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,559
weird person

1446
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:52,239
somebody to me heroism

1447
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:55,440
is also taking a risk to uh rebel

1448
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:58,318
against mediocrity yeah

1449
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,960
like in in the most simplest of ways

1450
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,838
like the

1451
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,440
the license address like taking a risk

1452
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:05,119
to break the little bit of rule that

1453
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,480
nobody will know about to take that

1454
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:09,680
little bit of a

1455
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,800
leap of like that little protest against

1456
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:12,559
the bureaucracy

1457
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,240
well like that nazi remedy where he just

1458
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:15,440
spoke out he's like hey lady

1459
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,199
that's a big one oh that's a

1460
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,119
restructuring i mean like literally at

1461
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,759
the line at starbucks or something like

1462
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,838
okay like even in the tiniest of ways

1463
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,680
when i see

1464
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:26,318
people just like it's almost like that

1465
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,318
little

1466
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:29,519
like glimmer in their eye a wink like

1467
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,159
we're in this together

1468
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,280
this there's there's all this conformity

1469
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:35,920
all around us

1470
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,280
that's at a different time could have

1471
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,280
been nazi germany

1472
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,319
could have been uh stalin and soviet

1473
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,000
union sure

1474
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:43,759
we're in this together we're going to

1475
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,880
rebel against that conformity

1476
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,599
by just just taking the risk that little

1477
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,160
bit of risk

1478
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,720
against mediocrity i don't know and that

1479
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,960
and then

1480
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:57,919
once again i see this in companies too

1481
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,599
when i see the mediocrity i see this you

1482
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,639
know i used to work at google i see it

1483
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,720
in google

1484
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,400
and when the companies grow that

1485
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:06,000
mediocrity is overwhelming

1486
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,240
the peter principle right the peter

1487
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,480
principle yeah yeah my hope is that all

1488
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:13,679
of us have the possibility

1489
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,240
for that glimmer that um that risk

1490
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,118
taking

1491
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:17,919
the the leap of faith or whatever the

1492
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,000
heck that is

1493
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,318
the leap out of the ordinary out of the

1494
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,119
conformity out of the mediocrity

1495
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:25,440
so this is where you and i disagree i i

1496
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,920
think

1497
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,720
most a lot of people do are not capable

1498
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,358
of that

1499
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,399
they're accustomed to it i don't know if

1500
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,400
they're not capable

1501
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,079
i i i understand your position i'm

1502
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,519
disagreeing with it i'm saying i do not

1503
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,920
think they're capable i think a lot of

1504
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,119
people

1505
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,039
effectively don't have souls they do not

1506
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,160
have a conscience in this sense where

1507
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,318
they're going to

1508
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:47,199
look at an issue bring their critical

1509
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:50,558
thinking

1510
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,358
and say all right i am going to do the

1511
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,119
right thing

1512
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:54,719
although i'm taking a risk i don't think

1513
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,920
thinking is involved or is it just

1514
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:57,838
taking that leap there

1515
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,000
there's something about that basic human

1516
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:03,119
spirit forget the thinking part

1517
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,239
it's it's just saying like i'll take

1518
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,680
that risk

1519
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:08,159
they're taking that adventure the same

1520
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:11,199
thing that got people to explore

1521
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:13,598
the seas you know that that

1522
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,480
uh throughout human civilization explore

1523
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,200
land

1524
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,159
explore the oceans like that explore

1525
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:21,759
exploration like

1526
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:23,838
we've done stuff this way all this time

1527
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,520
i'm going to take a leap and that comes

1528
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:26,960
out of nowhere seemingly but those

1529
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:30,000
people are the heroes but i don't think

1530
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,000
that's universal

1531
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,199
remember there's i'm going to use a very

1532
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,280
gauche example

1533
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,879
there was a show called scare tactics

1534
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,400
which was basically a candid camera but

1535
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,838
they would scare people like they'd have

1536
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,519
vampires whatever

1537
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:46,480
hidden camera and people's reactions and

1538
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:48,559
so a lot of but sometimes it the prank

1539
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,240
didn't work out like they expected

1540
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,519
so there was one where they were hiring

1541
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,199
some of the the people who were the

1542
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:53,920
marks you know the contestants so to

1543
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,919
speak

1544
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,838
was it was hard to be a security guard

1545
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,318
okay and you have to watch this

1546
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,239
this factory overnight and you get paid

1547
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,400
and what the setup was

1548
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,000
some people were breaking out of the

1549
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,039
factory in the middle of the night like

1550
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,159
in rags

1551
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,400
and they were saying they were keeping

1552
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,239
us prisoner here like blah blah and just

1553
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,960
watch the person reaction to this

1554
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:15,439
and there was one security guard where

1555
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,358
there

1556
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,800
he basically forced them back into the

1557
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:20,558
building and they're like

1558
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,800
they're working us 24 7 we're getting

1559
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,760
beaten he's like i'm here to do a job

1560
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,079
get back in there and you watch this and

1561
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,640
it

1562
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,920
never even enters his head to be like

1563
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:32,318
something's wrong here

1564
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,519
he was given his orders he's following

1565
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:37,358
his orders

1566
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:39,199
and to me that is not uncommon

1567
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:41,119
and that person although they look like

1568
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,799
you and i uh

1569
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,318
there's something essentially human

1570
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,280
missing with them now

1571
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:48,880
very quickly the reaction is well it's

1572
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,400
one step from there to

1573
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,519
nazism i don't think it's something that

1574
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,519
i'm not saying this person should be

1575
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:58,880
killed but i'm just saying

1576
00:50:55,519 --> 00:51:02,079
to expect that every human being

1577
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,400
has the capacity to have that defiance

1578
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,359
especially to cost their own life that i

1579
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,800
think is not

1580
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:10,239
realistic uh and i but at the same time

1581
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,519
i feel like an octopus on the eighth

1582
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:16,558
hand it is those few of us

1583
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:20,318
or if you want to include me in this who

1584
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,640
do make these tiny little protests who

1585
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:23,039
look

1586
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:24,879
the other way when someone is hungry

1587
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,199
who's stealing food from the supermarket

1588
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,960
right

1589
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,799
it's like all right like i i'm gonna

1590
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,000
pretend i didn't see anything

1591
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:36,318
that those little elements of heroism

1592
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,639
are what move humanity forward and

1593
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:39,519
demonstrate the validity of the human

1594
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:41,039
experience

1595
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:43,519
whereas everyone else is kind of like

1596
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,838
scenery i think

1597
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:46,960
almost everybody in the world can derive

1598
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:49,039
deep meaning

1599
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,318
and pleasure from having done those

1600
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,558
courageous acts

1601
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:53,599
and i also think they have the capacity

1602
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,280
to do them

1603
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,640
to discover that meaning and happiness

1604
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,359
so you're the cynic then why aren't they

1605
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:59,598
doing it

1606
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:01,440
they haven't gotten a chance to like

1607
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,480
i've never

1608
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,960
tried lsd or dmt

1609
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,240
you haven't gotten the chance to try

1610
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,679
this amazing journey

1611
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:12,159
which is taking the risk that's

1612
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:15,279
something yes because as you just said

1613
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:18,078
two minutes ago everyone has that chance

1614
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,519
every day to do the right thing and we

1615
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,559
have the chance to do a lot of things

1616
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:22,400
and we don't realize

1617
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,160
there's a lot of stuff right in front of

1618
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,680
our nose that we don't realize

1619
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:27,598
right because you have to kind of wake

1620
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:30,719
up to it and sometimes

1621
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,039
uh you need the catalyst there needs to

1622
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:33,039
be

1623
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:34,400
some kind of thing that happens that

1624
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:38,558
wakes you up

1625
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:41,440
that the fact that most people

1626
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,160
don't take the small acts of rebellion

1627
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,119
doesn't mean they

1628
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,399
don't have the capacity to both do so

1629
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,039
and to

1630
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,480
derive a lot of meaning from it then

1631
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:52,800
it's a

1632
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,960
discussion about how to create societies

1633
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,720
that get more and more people

1634
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,720
to be free actors and free thinkers

1635
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:02,318
that's that's the question and that that

1636
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,679
probably leads us into a discussion of

1637
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,239
anarchism and so on but

1638
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,279
yeah i just think we are very young as a

1639
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:09,919
species

1640
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,640
we're trying to figure out how to get

1641
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,240
ourselves

1642
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:15,118
to first be collaborative but at the

1643
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,358
same time be

1644
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:19,440
free spirits and i think both of those

1645
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:22,480
are within human nature

1646
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,119
i think another big concern is that

1647
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,199
there's enormous disincentives

1648
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,838
and this is michael malus speaking yeah

1649
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:32,879
uh for human beings to be kind

1650
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:34,318
and for tenderness and i think

1651
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,240
especially when you're young you know

1652
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:37,838
what i mean when you're immature

1653
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,318
a lot of times someone will reach out to

1654
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:42,159
you with kindness or vulnerability

1655
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:43,440
and you think it's funny to kind of dunk

1656
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:44,399
the head underwater in a pool or

1657
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,159
something like that

1658
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,800
yeah and when you get older you look

1659
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:51,039
there you know there's this one

1660
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,480
uh example of this this was a this was

1661
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,199
in the 90s

1662
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,039
and there was a woman she became a like

1663
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:58,318
uh like stripper or something like that

1664
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,558
or whatever it was but she had this

1665
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,960
amazing body she was just gorgeous

1666
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,319
and the show was she was talking about

1667
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,679
how when she was in high school she was

1668
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:07,119
bullied a lot

1669
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,358
and that there was this football player

1670
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,880
he messed with her every single day

1671
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:12,239
and like at one day she even threw

1672
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,240
pickles in her hair and her hair smelled

1673
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,399
like pickles and it was laughing at her

1674
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,479
and this really screwed her up i mean up

1675
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,838
to that show and they took her backstage

1676
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,800
and they brought out the football player

1677
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:23,358
now he's a dad

1678
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,119
and a regular dude and he's like do you

1679
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:26,639
know like do you know why you're here

1680
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,680
and he's like no and they're like oh

1681
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,639
what were you like in high schools like

1682
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:30,480
i was kind of a jock

1683
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:32,639
you know bully whatever and they brought

1684
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,119
her out and he didn't even remember her

1685
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:34,719
really

1686
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,838
and she just starts crying about the

1687
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:37,279
pickles and whatever and there's

1688
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:39,679
something that affected her for like 20

1689
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,519
years and i've never seen

1690
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:43,199
a clear example of someone who wants to

1691
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,358
kill themselves in this guy

1692
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:46,399
like the guilt on his face and he's

1693
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:48,880
looking at her

1694
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,838
and he's desperate to be like what can i

1695
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,480
do

1696
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:52,880
to take your pain away to make it better

1697
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,119
uh

1698
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,400
like i i he was just crippled by it

1699
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,880
because he knew there's nothing he could

1700
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,599
do

1701
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,760
he knew he 100 did the wrong thing he

1702
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,519
knew he did the wrong thing unthinkingly

1703
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,359
like you can imagine you know i gotta

1704
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,719
screw over this lady to feed my family

1705
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:09,199
you know that that's fine

1706
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:10,399
but for it was at the time it meant

1707
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:11,279
nothing to him so of course he didn't

1708
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,280
remember

1709
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,440
and he was just paralyzed by this sense

1710
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,920
of crippling guilt one of the reasons i

1711
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,480
always try to do the right thing isn't

1712
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,639
because

1713
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,000
i'm an inherently good person which i do

1714
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:23,039
not think i am i don't think anyone is

1715
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,920
inherently good

1716
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,119
but because i will feel guilty about it

1717
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,599
for a very very

1718
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,599
long time because if you do the wrong

1719
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,480
thing this is a very common idea

1720
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,519
if you do the wrong thing to a good

1721
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,000
person

1722
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:38,960
that's really really bad because what

1723
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,559
kind of person are you

1724
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,720
in the same way that everyone can be

1725
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,839
that guy who takes someone out for their

1726
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:46,000
birthday

1727
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:47,279
everyone has that ability for someone

1728
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
who did the wrong thing

1729
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,000
to someone who's a normal person and do

1730
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,199
you want to be that guy as well

1731
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,239
my friend uh um bitstein he's a um

1732
00:55:55,199 --> 00:56:00,798
uh big gold uh excuse me bitcoin person

1733
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:02,318
my biography ego and hubris is like 500

1734
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:03,838
now on ebay it's like hard to find came

1735
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:07,440
out in 2006

1736
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:09,199
and he had told me that you know you can

1737
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,119
get it on on torrent it's it's

1738
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,318
downloadable and i'm like oh i thought

1739
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,280
if you were my friend you know you'd

1740
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:15,759
want to buy it

1741
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,200
at the time it was not 500 i assure you

1742
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,280
and he goes i did buy it

1743
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:20,879
i'm just telling you that you could also

1744
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,400
get it for free this information that

1745
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,960
you might want to use

1746
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,000
and i felt i'm like i snapped at this

1747
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,599
kid

1748
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,519
who was doing right by me and i felt

1749
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,599
it just stuck in my head i'm like you're

1750
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:35,119
an ass yeah and then years later i

1751
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,559
apologize he didn't have no memory of

1752
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,079
this at all and i'm glad to be able to

1753
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,480
reiterate the apology again

1754
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:42,000
but you know this is you know a lot of

1755
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,599
times i'm extremely aggressive

1756
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,440
on twitter and in other venues i always

1757
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,079
try to and maybe i fail and that's

1758
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,440
my moral failing always do it as a

1759
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,599
counter-attack

1760
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,039
if you're gonna start going personal if

1761
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:57,440
you're gonna start being aggressive

1762
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,318
against an individual i'm not going to

1763
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,480
necessarily

1764
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:02,239
hold back when i reciprocate and it's

1765
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,400
something that is very common

1766
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:05,439
on social media but i don't think it is

1767
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,119
normal i

1768
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,318
just because a lot of this you're

1769
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,119
talking about the the quiet little

1770
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:11,199
rebellion

1771
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,160
just because everyone else around you

1772
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:14,000
thinks it's okay

1773
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:15,199
to just go up to people and attack them

1774
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,159
in the most personal ways

1775
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:18,558
imprompted because of their views really

1776
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:20,078
just

1777
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,079
take a step back and realize what you're

1778
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,280
engaging with now if that's the fight

1779
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,760
they want

1780
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,480
then you know my soviet cruelty can come

1781
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,319
out and that's

1782
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,039
kind of why i don't drink because i do

1783
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:33,279
enjoy it yeah but at the same time

1784
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,599
be aware of what you're doing and and

1785
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,720
and again this goes back to camus

1786
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,559
um sense that conscience really is what

1787
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:41,919
makes us human beings

1788
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,760
yeah that's the thing was saying i don't

1789
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,280
think most people think in terms of

1790
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,119
conscience they don't think it

1791
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,599
they we are taught this is that this is

1792
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,240
that that creeping cynicism

1793
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,400
that oh grow up when you're an adult you

1794
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,318
have to make sacrifices

1795
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,838
blah blah blah and even if i buy that

1796
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:59,920
for a second which i don't

1797
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,199
but if i have to make sacrifices

1798
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,639
sometimes

1799
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:05,199
that doesn't mean it's okay for me to

1800
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:07,759
make a sacrifice of my values in

1801
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:08,318
this moment if i have to maybe be at

1802
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,240
work

1803
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,079
and my boss is a jerk to me and calls me

1804
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:13,519
names i have to be humiliated but i got

1805
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,920
to put food in the plate

1806
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,358
that doesn't mean it's okay later if i'm

1807
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,880
at a party and i'm just

1808
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:21,279
you know extremely offensive to someone

1809
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,838
for no reason

1810
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,680
you know my own flavor of a little bit

1811
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:29,039
of rebellion

1812
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:29,039
sometimes i use the number two

1813
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,880
is uh you know you're very witty on

1814
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:39,920
twitter and thank you

1815
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:43,200
my and twitter

1816
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,720
likes mockery and wit

1817
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:49,358
and uh counterattack

1818
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:51,118
is uh twitter loves that somebody who's

1819
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:54,318
skilled at it

1820
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,599
my own flavor of a bit of a rebellion is

1821
00:58:54,318 --> 00:59:00,639
to say things

1822
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:00,640
very simply bordering and cliche

1823
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:07,280
with with uh with a authenticity

1824
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,240
and like genuinely meaning the words i

1825
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,599
say

1826
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:14,959
but knowing that those words would be

1827
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:17,599
are easy to attack sure and that

1828
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,480
sometimes those attacks can hurt because

1829
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,720
people would just

1830
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,159
mock me sure people don't like

1831
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:22,879
earnestness because they've been taught

1832
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:25,519
to be

1833
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,720
too cool for school yeah so there's this

1834
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,440
pressure for me to be

1835
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:31,118
sound way more sophisticated yeah use

1836
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,798
bigger words

1837
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:36,960
sometimes throw in um a criticism

1838
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,000
of institutions or something like that

1839
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,400
like uh

1840
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,559
like almost as if i have a deep wisdom

1841
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,519
about the way the world is broken

1842
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,000
but when you speak very simply about

1843
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:49,759
beautiful

1844
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,960
things in life it's very easy to sound

1845
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,880
like you don't know what the hell you're

1846
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,000
talking about sure and

1847
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,280
i kind of i stick by that

1848
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,358
i don't know where that's going to end

1849
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,000
up but it's like the idiot from this day

1850
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:03,279
it feels like that's the right uh that's

1851
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,960
the right thing

1852
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,200
even if it hurts when i'm attacked for

1853
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,039
it i i do something similar sometimes

1854
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:10,719
which is i'll have some innocuous

1855
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,719
comment about like bubble gum i mean

1856
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:15,358
just it's not even political

1857
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:17,279
and a lot of times people it's a few

1858
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:18,239
people will respond to this paragraph of

1859
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,079
just invective

1860
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,679
yeah about like blah blah and then this

1861
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,839
and you say this and you're an ass and

1862
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:26,000
just really trying to get at me

1863
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:28,078
and what i in those situations there are

1864
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,760
very specific circumstances

1865
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,318
i will respond and i mean it every

1866
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,319
single time i will say i i

1867
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:35,759
wish your parents had been kinder to you

1868
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:38,000
or your mom or your dad

1869
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,680
because if someone is some even if i'm

1870
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,119
some idiot on twitter right if we just

1871
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:42,399
talk about bubble gum and this is your

1872
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,079
res i'm not talking about politics where

1873
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,160
i can see how people get emotional coven

1874
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:50,000
my grandma died now you're talking

1875
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:52,558
and you i realize this isn't about me

1876
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,798
like i'm someone you've never met making

1877
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:56,880
some inane point about nothing

1878
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:58,159
and you're getting agitated about this

1879
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,160
it's clearly something

1880
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:02,399
else that's going on here and someone

1881
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:04,798
taught you someone had to teach you

1882
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,798
that this is how to respond in this kind

1883
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:09,039
of very kind of harsh way

1884
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:11,039
and a lot of times they'll you know they

1885
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:14,880
won't say anything or get deleted

1886
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:17,119
and i hope every single time

1887
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,240
there's no asterisk here that they take

1888
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,640
a second

1889
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,759
and they realize that the way that they

1890
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:25,039
were talked to

1891
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:27,280
growing up was not acceptable that

1892
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:28,159
they don't have to carry this forward

1893
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,680
and that

1894
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:32,159
they don't have to be kind to me i'm

1895
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:34,159
nobody of them but take a second and ask

1896
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,519
if this is the kind of mindset you want

1897
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:37,039
to be your norm

1898
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:38,239
as opposed to a weapon you pull out of

1899
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:39,279
your pocket sometimes where it's

1900
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:40,318
warranted or even when it's not

1901
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,599
warranted

1902
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,000
i think there's a lot of those people

1903
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:47,280
out there you know and we forget

1904
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,798
uh how you know how

1905
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,680
um hard it is for a lot of people to

1906
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:53,759
grow up

1907
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:55,038
how they're trained from their parents

1908
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,400
or the single parent

1909
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,079
that the only way they're gonna get

1910
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,920
attention is by acting out

1911
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,079
that when they do good things it doesn't

1912
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,000
get comment but if they do bad things

1913
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,160
they gotta smack upside their head

1914
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,039
that i think is far more common than we

1915
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:08,960
realize

1916
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,319
and that's such a it's not even it's not

1917
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,000
hitting the kid that's going to last

1918
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:12,639
it's the pain is going to give five five

1919
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,880
seconds

1920
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:16,239
but when you're training this child

1921
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,160
helpless child

1922
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:19,759
is something that's really really bad i

1923
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:20,558
don't know if it always can be mapped to

1924
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,200
that

1925
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,640
i always wonder about them like what

1926
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:26,558
their motivations are

1927
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:28,719
and i just kind of like whenever i think

1928
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,839
about them i think only positively

1929
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:33,038
and i don't even think about the

1930
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:36,880
childhood thing i think

1931
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:39,200
i don't know i i i kind of imagine that

1932
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:42,880
all of us can go through that stage

1933
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:44,960
where we enjoy the derision of others

1934
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,880
we go through stages of being i i enjoy

1935
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,240
the derision of others but it has to be

1936
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,680
you know billy i'd have that quota like

1937
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:51,358
i like it when people are mean to me i

1938
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:52,798
stopped pretending to be nice

1939
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,719
but like what's the worst thing someone

1940
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:55,920
can say about you you're not what harm

1941
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,759
are you doing

1942
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,280
uh maybe your podcast is garbage and the

1943
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,880
people are the conversations suck and

1944
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,798
the people are losing well okay

1945
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,960
no the main the main thing i would say

1946
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:05,358
is i'm way more popular than i deserve

1947
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,199
to be

1948
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:11,358
what does deserve mean the reality is

1949
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:12,960
there's people out there that just enjoy

1950
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:16,318
hating on others

1951
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:19,119
and i don't um

1952
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:20,318
i don't fault them for it like i don't

1953
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:22,480
even think of them as

1954
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:24,159
haters i think of them as just people

1955
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,480
that in this particular part of their

1956
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:28,639
life

1957
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:31,760
are enjoying this activity of uh

1958
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:34,318
of deriding others on the internet

1959
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,599
i'm i'm not sure what to do with that i

1960
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:37,119
i just don't want to

1961
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:39,440
i i don't want to allow myself to think

1962
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,880
badly of them i guess is the thing

1963
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,318
i'm the one saying don't think badly of

1964
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,838
them i'm saying that i don't think

1965
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:46,159
they're inherently bad people i think

1966
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:48,318
that their thinking is screwed and that

1967
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:49,759
i'm i'm i'm steel mining them i'm saying

1968
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:51,119
let's assume everything you're saying

1969
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,720
about lex is true

1970
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,400
this is an opportunity for you to out

1971
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:57,118
dulex like it's

1972
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,720
no but are you saying they should stop

1973
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,358
hating because i'm saying like maybe

1974
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,358
they shouldn't

1975
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:02,880
just keep i i don't believe in should

1976
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:06,719
right i'm an anarchist what i'm saying

1977
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:08,480
is like if this is your belief about lex

1978
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,000
you know what it is i made this comment

1979
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,599
in my book than you write when people

1980
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,280
make fun of andy warhol

1981
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,359
and they're like oh my god he painted a

1982
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,319
soup can and now he became a millionaire

1983
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:18,719
i could do this

1984
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:19,679
well why don't you yeah so basically if

1985
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:22,159
i go up to you

1986
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:23,919
with a check and i say i will give you a

1987
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:26,159
million dollars you could see the check

1988
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,119
you got to paint a soup can what am i

1989
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:29,279
waiting for

1990
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:31,358
so clearly there's a disconnect in their

1991
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,359
thinking between what they're perceiving

1992
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:36,078
and the reality because if it was as

1993
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:38,318
simple or as maybe not simple but as as

1994
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,400
possible for them as they perceive it to

1995
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:40,719
be why are they leaving comments instead

1996
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,119
of

1997
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:43,919
uh outdoing you how great would it be

1998
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,599
for them

1999
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,639
to have your bigger audience and drive

2000
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,000
you into the ground i don't know how

2001
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:48,400
that would work because it's not the nba

2002
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,920
but no

2003
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,838
but you want to point out you do this

2004
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:56,079
too on twitter you want to point out

2005
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:58,318
the hypocrisy

2006
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,839
the fraudulence of others right yeah

2007
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:01,119
what are you you're not claiming

2008
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:02,880
anything other than this is

2009
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,559
the following is the conversation

2010
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,480
between me and

2011
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,000
and yeah michiki whatever his name is

2012
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,119
right i got the voice down dude

2013
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,039
i got it down i've been walking around

2014
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,838
my house doing my lex impression

2015
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,319
i've been leaking motor oil everywhere

2016
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:17,199
yeah

2017
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:19,038
but yeah i don't know i i don't know i

2018
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:20,879
don't know what to make of it because uh

2019
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,720
i think there's a more general statement

2020
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,358
to be made like i see twitter this way

2021
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,639
too

2022
01:05:23,358 --> 01:05:28,558
when i read a tweet i try to

2023
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:29,759
read it with like the best possible

2024
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:32,079
interpretation

2025
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,799
meaning like what is the wisdom in this

2026
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,440
tweet

2027
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:36,318
right as opposed to what i think a large

2028
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,838
number of people

2029
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:41,920
not a large but some fraction

2030
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:43,759
try to see what is the worst possible

2031
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,159
interpretation of this tweet

2032
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,680
and they want to they they want to

2033
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:49,519
destroy you

2034
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:51,279
for that worst interpretation like they

2035
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:53,199
want to um

2036
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,798
there's people i'm already aware of this

2037
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,879
with me and certainly with a lot of

2038
01:05:54,798 --> 01:06:00,000
people they're waiting for me to fail

2039
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,358
they want me to be like this guy talks

2040
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,679
about love all the time

2041
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:04,880
you want me to be some dark like uh

2042
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:06,798
abilities

2043
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,559
pain yeah they want you to be in pain

2044
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:09,199
because they die i'll tell you exactly

2045
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,039
why

2046
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:12,719
because this is why i'm so for being

2047
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:15,119
white-pilled and being for hope

2048
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,838
because if you are black-pilled meaning

2049
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,079
if you think

2050
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:19,599
it's pointless we're all done you're

2051
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,920
just wasting your breath

2052
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:24,400
if you have any counter examples to this

2053
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,798
thesis if there's even a little bit of

2054
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,480
hope

2055
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:28,000
your entire hypothesis falls through

2056
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,599
right so if it's

2057
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,679
it's kind of how like you have all these

2058
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,599
stories of people who are like painting

2059
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:34,318
swastikas who aren't nazis but just to

2060
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,160
show that

2061
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,639
oh there's all this nazism so i'm gonna

2062
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:41,199
you know kind of force the conclusion

2063
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:41,920
so for them when they see you thriving

2064
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:44,798
you are

2065
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,639
as a mediocre person with a crappy show

2066
01:06:44,798 --> 01:06:48,318
but you're demonstrating that people can

2067
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:51,199
succeed this bothers them

2068
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:52,400
so you are anyone can succeed that

2069
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:53,838
bothers them yeah so

2070
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,838
because then why haven't they so now

2071
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:57,920
you're a counter to their world view

2072
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:58,880
and that is going to cause anxiety when

2073
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,798
you have data

2074
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,318
that contradicts other data in your in

2075
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:03,838
your world view this is the

2076
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:06,639
in your mindset this is a big issue for

2077
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:09,279
them yeah so anyone listening to this

2078
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:10,078
they're annoyed by the look of my face

2079
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,440
remember

2080
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,680
that you could probably do way better

2081
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,240
than me and you should but also what

2082
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:16,318
would you

2083
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:18,000
failing look like like let's suppose

2084
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:18,798
this podcast went from whatever views

2085
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,519
you had

2086
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:22,559
to 100 views in episode that's still

2087
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:24,559
success

2088
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:26,319
you are talking to people you like

2089
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,079
having conversations about important

2090
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:29,519
issues you're having a good time

2091
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,440
they're giving a good time how is that a

2092
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:31,920
failure if i have dinner with a friend

2093
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,720
of mine

2094
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,440
there's zero viewers and we enjoy that

2095
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:38,719
time

2096
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:41,280
that is the height of human success

2097
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:42,480
when you are sharing happiness happiness

2098
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,400
joy

2099
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,838
joy over love so what's the difference

2100
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,720
between joy and love

2101
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:49,759
michael malus uh i think joy is easier

2102
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:52,399
to attain

2103
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,119
it's more common you could share it with

2104
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,000
everyone

2105
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:58,160
give me an example of joy like what was

2106
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
the moment of joy for you recently

2107
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:01,598
i could give you a great example of joy

2108
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,559
and this is part in the absurdist

2109
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,920
mindset

2110
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:07,200
okay i love having a bad meal at a

2111
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,440
restaurant

2112
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:10,798
and i'll give you you can see why you go

2113
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,440
with your friend

2114
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:14,000
it takes you 45 minutes to get seated

2115
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,399
okay

2116
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,279
i'm starving waiters not at paying

2117
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,798
attention to you

2118
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,400
they bring your water it's got a hair in

2119
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:22,000
it they get the food wrong

2120
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,399
yeah it comes out again it's ripe but

2121
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,198
it's cold at a certain point

2122
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:28,158
you're like okay i'm hungry i'm living

2123
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:29,759
an anecdote

2124
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,439
this is something that you if you were

2125
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,119
at dinner we could talk about this for

2126
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:35,599
years because

2127
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:36,880
how great is it that the worst thing

2128
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,640
that's happening to me

2129
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,000
is i gotta wait an hour for this meal

2130
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,759
that's gonna be cooked wrong

2131
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,359
right that to me is joy is holding on

2132
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:48,479
to that idea that happiness and thriving

2133
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:50,560
are possible

2134
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:52,718
even when in the moment it's uh

2135
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,719
everything's going the wrong way

2136
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,319
doesn't every moment have the capacity

2137
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:58,480
to uh

2138
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:00,159
fill you with joy then yes so yes the

2139
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:01,759
shitty moments and the good moments

2140
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:03,759
yes but that see that's the way i

2141
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:07,039
usually talk about love is

2142
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:10,000
like i love life

2143
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:10,719
yes and in because life can generate

2144
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,880
every

2145
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:18,399
everything the pain the loss but also

2146
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:20,880
just like simple or complicated bliss

2147
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,879
all of that i just love all of that and

2148
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,838
that because it fills me with it with a

2149
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,640
kind of

2150
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:28,079
i guess joy but joy has a connotation

2151
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,079
that's supposed to be somehow positive

2152
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:32,479
like you're supposed to be smiling

2153
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:33,359
uh to me you know man search for meaning

2154
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:37,838
with victor

2155
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:39,759
frankl you know just it's you're

2156
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:41,119
you're in the holocaust you're in a

2157
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,719
concentration camp

2158
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:44,719
just having a little bit of food that

2159
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:47,759
you didn't expect you will have

2160
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:49,119
uh or even just thinking about food or

2161
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,719
what about there's a kid there you tell

2162
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:52,880
them a funny story you crack them up

2163
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,480
yeah like you take away this child's

2164
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,119
pain for like five minutes that

2165
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:58,399
is the height of joy yeah so to me like

2166
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,719
all of like life is

2167
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,759
like infinitely full of possibility for

2168
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,520
joy yes

2169
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,600
and that's what i mean by love because

2170
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,960
oftentimes like romantic love is what

2171
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,480
people

2172
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,880
think about when they think love but to

2173
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:14,158
me it's all like part of the same thing

2174
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,480
and it's almost like love romantic love

2175
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:17,519
or

2176
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:20,238
love with a friend friendship is like

2177
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,760
you both notice each other it's like

2178
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:22,959
dogs they look at each other and then

2179
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,600
they look at the thing they're

2180
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,319
interested in you both notice each other

2181
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,079
and

2182
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:29,439
that moment of joy you share that moment

2183
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:30,880
of joy together yeah like the restaurant

2184
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:34,319
yeah the restaurant

2185
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:37,359
yeah if you're both almost without

2186
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:40,639
uh conspiring notice the

2187
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:42,880
absurdity of how shitty this meal is and

2188
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,760
like that again that little glimmer of

2189
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,480
realization

2190
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,760
that's that's what makes life beautiful

2191
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:50,079
you mentioned uh

2192
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,920
your grandmother and levovov you were

2193
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:55,039
thinking of returning there

2194
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:58,000
the plans got a little bit delayed but

2195
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:59,198
what are you hoping from that trip of

2196
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,600
going back to russia

2197
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:03,599
going back to ukraine what do you

2198
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,800
hope to get out of it but what do you

2199
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:09,359
think you will feel

2200
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,159
uh a lot of things first of all i'm

2201
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:11,839

01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,319
i have them on my phone we're gonna

2258
01:12:57,359 --> 01:12:58,880
we'll have them we could we could

2259
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:01,759
shouldn't write

2260
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,039
uh you could slice it in right here so

2261
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,920
to be able to go

2262
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:07,840
with someone who is a very close i mean

2263
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,158
we meet him talk like every day right

2264
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,960
so to someone who generally cares about

2265
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:14,879
you

2266
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,719
who uh who's he's very very grounded

2267
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,000
right so like a lot of times i'll have

2268
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:19,920
like some concern

2269
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,319
and he's really good and if you listen

2270
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,840
to show at slicing through the noise and

2271
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:24,799
being like hold on a second i can't do

2272
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,960
the accent yet

2273
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,560
have you considered a b and c because

2274
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,719
you know whenever i had the situation

2275
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,560
this is what i did so he's really good

2276
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,800
with that um

2277
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,640
so to have a first of all just like two

2278
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,360
buddies on a trip is a really a lot of

2279
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,679
fun

2280
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:41,519
second of all i know that if it's gonna

2281
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:44,158
get be very intense

2282
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,440
so for you you left russia much later

2283
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:47,279
than i did how old were you 13

2284
01:13:45,439 --> 01:13:49,039
13 right so you remember it i'm sure

2285
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:50,559
very very well i left when i was one and

2286
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:53,600
a half two i don't remember at all

2287
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,039
to go to the streets

2288
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,360
where you know my family had to go

2289
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:58,719
through this stuff to see the you know

2290
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:00,479
they they came to live up they

2291
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:02,000
slaughtered all the jews i mean to have

2292
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:02,799
that little memorial there that's there

2293
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,880
now

2294
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,800
and to just look around and know

2295
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,480
yesterday best basically

2296
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,480
they came here they rounded everyone up

2297
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:12,158
and also from the other side you had the

2298
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,959
stalinists coming in and starving all

2299
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:15,359
the people

2300
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,198
it's it's just to know that so much

2301
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:18,639
horror and death there's this quote i

2302
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:20,799
saw once

2303
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,400
about a woman who went to auschwitz and

2304
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,360
she just made the comment like grass

2305
01:14:22,399 --> 01:14:25,279
grows here

2306
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:26,799
because we think you know that when it

2307
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:27,840
comes to the nature of evil that you're

2308
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,239
going to go there this is going to be

2309
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,719
this

2310
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:31,279
pits of hell or whatever there's birds

2311
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,960
you know

2312
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:34,800
there's you know robin's hopping around

2313
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,719
looking for the worms or whatever they

2314
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,560
think it's perfectly nice and you you

2315
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,920
you stand there to understand that so

2316
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,960
much suffering happened here

2317
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,800
or there is going to be very jarring

2318
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,239
i know that it's going to be an issue

2319
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,199
because i speak russian and not

2320
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:49,119
ukrainian

2321
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:50,719
and to speak russian to ukrainians is

2322
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:51,679
like a big deal so that's gonna be a

2323
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:53,198
concern

2324
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,719
i'm also worried about going to russia

2325
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:56,639
because every russian

2326
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,480
has this idea that even though they've

2327
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,840
just met you they feel it

2328
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:00,879
they feel that they're in a position to

2329
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,319
tell you what you're doing wrong with

2330
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,440
your life what you should be doing if

2331
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:04,960
they're a cab driver

2332
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:06,879
i have no tolerance for unsolicited

2333
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,319
advice on a basis at all

2334
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,520
that's gonna be horrible they're gonna

2335
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:12,238
be telling me i need to speak russian

2336
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:14,320
better because think about

2337
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:16,158
i'm not hearing it i'm not interested in

2338
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:18,639
hearing it so

2339
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:19,519
that i think and also you know given my

2340
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,199
upcoming book

2341
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,280
the white pill and covering what

2342
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:24,158
happened back in the day under stalinism

2343
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:26,960
and later

2344
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:28,319
to see this was the leblanc this was the

2345
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,760
basement where they would you know you

2346
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:31,279
know once this is something that

2347
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,760
people might not realize there's a

2348
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:35,039
superb film uh the death of stalin which

2349
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,679
is kind of that's what i do with north

2350
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,279
korea

2351
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:38,640
you know he puts a humorous spin on and

2352
01:15:37,279 --> 01:15:39,759
then when you take a step back and you

2353
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,440
realize what they're actually saying

2354
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:44,400
it's just like it's very very disturbing

2355
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,919
how when stalin was dying he had a

2356
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:48,000
stroke he's laying there in a pile of

2357
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,079
his own past he's unconscious

2358
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,600
he'd be right before he died he thought

2359
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:52,158
the doctors were all plotting against

2360
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,640
him

2361
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:56,238
so they were being tortured to confess

2362
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,000
that they were trying to murder him

2363
01:15:56,238 --> 01:15:59,359
they had to get the doctors out of the

2364
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,479
torture chambers

2365
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:04,000
to attend to him and they did it so this

2366
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:06,158
kind of thing to like

2367
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,279
go there like red square and see this is

2368
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:09,519
where it happened

2369
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:11,519
to see lennon's body like this is the

2370
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:14,560
guy who emma goldman yelled at

2371
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:17,440
it's gonna be really um because i've

2372
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,360
worked so much in this space jarring and

2373
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:20,799
intense and emotional and that's

2374
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:22,719
as intense as for me sitting here

2375
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,760
talking to you about it to see it and to

2376
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:25,520
see the faces

2377
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,880
and to see cyrillic everywhere you know

2378
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,600
other than brighton beach and brooklyn

2379
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,000
um

2380
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,760
it's gonna i'm sure it's gonna do a huge

2381
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,880
number on me because

2382
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:37,199
uh as we as western and as the tupoi

2383
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,760
mirikanets as the russians will say i am

2384
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:40,319
this is still where i came from yeah so

2385
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,239
no matter

2386
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,439
to see it face to face i don't know how

2387
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:44,079
i'm gonna react but i don't think it's

2388
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:47,439
gonna be like

2389
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:48,000
meh you've assembled uh a number of

2390
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:50,238
essays

2391
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,439
from anarchist thinkers in a new book

2392
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:55,519
called the anarchist

2393
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:57,039
handbook you mentioned emma goldman

2394
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:59,120
what interesting things do these

2395
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:00,560
thinkers agree on and what do they

2396
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:02,479
disagree on

2397
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,199
the anarchist handbook.com is the

2398
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:06,639
website it covers from the 1790s to

2399
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:08,559
i think my essay is the last one from

2400
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,400
2014 which uh

2401
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,679
a friend of mine who's uh kind of a

2402
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:13,279
mediocre scientist is going to be

2403
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:16,719
reading for the audiobook

2404
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:18,158
um also podcasts and vodka i never

2405
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:20,079
but it's not a podcast anyone would have

2406
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:20,799
heard of it's like tom wood's been even

2407
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:24,000
worse

2408
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:27,039
so what they all agreed on

2409
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:30,479
was the illegitimacy of government

2410
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:34,079
and also the malevolence of state actors

2411
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:38,079
and the consequences of governments

2412
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:39,840
so they range in terms that most people

2413
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:41,600
would easily regard as either left or

2414
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,159
right wing

2415
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,719
but it tackles the nature of government

2416
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:47,359
and

2417
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:48,480
also creates positive non-state

2418
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:50,639
alternatives

2419
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:52,718
from really many different angles the

2420
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,159
slogan i have is the black flag which is

2421
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:56,560
the traditional flag of anarchism

2422
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:58,319
the black flag comes in many colors so

2423
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,760
they were really all over the map in

2424
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:01,599
terms of what they're for

2425
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,079
but their disagreement is about the

2426
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:06,159
nature of state and the nature of power

2427
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:07,760
um and it's very edifying because this

2428
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:09,759
is an ideology that's been

2429
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:12,079
in many ways swept on the rug no one

2430
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:15,039
takes this seriously grow up

2431
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:16,559
um that i can allow people to sit down

2432
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,238
and read these essays

2433
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:19,760
and see for themselves just how

2434
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:22,158
beautiful this tapestry

2435
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,079
over the decades and centuries uh has

2436
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:24,799
been woven about people who genuinely

2437
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:27,840
believed

2438
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:30,640
in freedom as the most important

2439
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,319
and how to maximize that uh uh for

2440
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,719
society

2441
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:36,479
so maybe it's useful to talk about a few

2442
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:40,158
contrasting thinkers in there so

2443
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:44,238
one is uh leo tolstoy oh yeah

2444
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:47,759
who um i think not many people know

2445
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:50,879
is uh an anarchist yes uh a christian

2446
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,960
and a christian anarchist yeah so he

2447
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:55,920
uh came to despise government for his

2448
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,079
deceit and his violence

2449
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,679
but to him the the christian principles

2450
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:01,519
of non-violence i think

2451
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,199
are important oh yeah this kind of

2452
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,000
pacifist kind of mindset

2453
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:07,599
of uh you know it's better to someone to

2454
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,840
punch you than to punch them back

2455
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,239
so he's in that way at least i read he

2456
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:15,199
influenced mlk and gandhi

2457
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:15,839
what do you think about this flavor

2458
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:18,559
color

2459
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,159
of the anarchist flag of non-violence ah

2460
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:23,440
nonviolent opposition

2461
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:25,359
i i i will put the caveat that

2462
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:26,879
it bothers me when people bring up mlk

2463
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:28,238
because he's become so corporate

2464
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,760
yeah and everyone just brings him up

2465
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:31,359
without knowing about him one of the

2466
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:34,719
things that martin luther king

2467
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:38,238
did so very well was that he forced

2468
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:40,158
people to face the consequences of what

2469
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:41,839
they were putting forward

2470
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:43,920
you want to be racist you want to be for

2471
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,520
jim crow you wanted for segregation

2472
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:48,158
okay it's easy for you to do that from

2473
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,880
your living room now turn on your news

2474
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:52,719
and you see men and women in suits being

2475
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,880
attacked by dogs

2476
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:56,079
being attacked by fire hoses and beaten

2477
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,440
by cops

2478
01:19:56,079 --> 01:19:59,840
just so they could sit on the front of

2479
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,319
the bus and now for a lot of people

2480
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,000
who were still racist who were still had

2481
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:07,439
animus toward black people are watching

2482
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:10,158
this and it's gonna be a lot harder

2483
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:12,319
to be like i'm okay with this i'm okay

2484
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:13,839
with human beings even ones i regard as

2485
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:17,039
somehow bad or inferior

2486
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,960
to be beaten and attacked by

2487
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:20,158
trained dogs and they're not doing

2488
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,639
anything in response

2489
01:20:20,158 --> 01:20:24,879
that strikes to i think a very basic

2490
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:27,359
nature of especially american like

2491
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:29,440
okay whatever you're for i'm not for

2492
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:31,359
people getting beaten and attacked

2493
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:32,638
when they're not really doing anything

2494
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:34,319
so i think

2495
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:35,679
pacifism is something that's very easy

2496
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:38,799
to make fun of

2497
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:41,840
but people don't underestimate how

2498
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:44,159
powerful it is for someone to say

2499
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,360
you can do what you want to me i'm not

2500
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:47,439
going to fight you back

2501
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,039
i just want to live peacefully and have

2502
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:51,039
the same rights as you

2503
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:52,319
and to say screw you you should get

2504
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:54,079
beaten

2505
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:56,238
that's a hard pill for a lot of people

2506
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:58,880
to swallow so i think he was

2507
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:00,319
really and gandhi of course as well were

2508
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,920
excellent in that regard there's a

2509
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:03,198
little bit of machiavellianism to it you

2510
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,480
know they've both been beatified

2511
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:08,158
regardless saints

2512
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:11,519
but their strategy worked very very well

2513
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:13,920
for their purposes so i think uh

2514
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,360
just all of us when you see someone you

2515
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,800
know in this kind of christian

2516
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:18,960
i know iran obviously it's nothing very

2517
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,159
highly christianity but if he's someone

2518
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:23,279
who's willing

2519
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:25,198
to you know take a punch and just say

2520
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:27,920
you could do whatever you want to me

2521
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:29,678
i'm not going to hurt somebody else

2522
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,158
instinctively

2523
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:34,079
that maybe this is kind of a hack most

2524
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:35,679
people want to side with that guy

2525
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:37,760
step in between and be like oh okay

2526
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:39,840
let's take a step back because whatever

2527
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,039
led to this is not tenable we need to go

2528
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,000
back to the drawing board if the

2529
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:44,079
consequence

2530
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,479
is people are having these as a result

2531
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:49,600
of my decisions and actions so

2532
01:21:46,479 --> 01:21:53,359
i think that aspect of anarchism uh

2533
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:56,079
is very very in certain context healthy

2534
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:57,839
and much smarter and more sophisticated

2535
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:59,119
than people give it credit for and let's

2536
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,920
also point out

2537
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:03,198
that tolstoy wrote warned peace and he

2538
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,600
wrote anna karenina

2539
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:07,039
so this was not some naive or innocent

2540
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,600
whatever word you want to use

2541
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:10,639
he knew the nature of evil he knew how

2542
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,120
bad things get

2543
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:15,039
so he wasn't saying at all that human

2544
01:22:13,119 --> 01:22:17,359
beings are inherently nice and kind

2545
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:18,719
he was saying it's much more effective

2546
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:21,519
to not fight back

2547
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:22,480
and to force them to face that i i i'll

2548
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,000
give you another example

2549
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:25,839
i was talking to i was on the show of

2550
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,760
trigonometry

2551
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,279
and i was talking to the hosts and one

2552
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,560
of them talked about how

2553
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:32,880
someone he knew had been uh in the gulag

2554
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,280
or

2555
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:37,520
his mom was born the gulag grandma and

2556
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:38,079
after stalin died and the soviet union

2557
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,280
liberalized

2558
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:41,039
and lots of the people in the gulags

2559
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:42,000
were freed by khrushchev and and so on

2560
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:44,719
and so forth

2561
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
he i didn't know this many of the or

2562
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:47,679
some let's say some

2563
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,158
of the guards of the gulags killed

2564
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,279
themselves because they had genuinely

2565
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:53,279
believed

2566
01:22:51,279 --> 01:22:55,920
that everyone in these camps was there

2567
01:22:53,279 --> 01:22:57,679
for a reason and when they found out

2568
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,520
that these people were completely

2569
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:01,039
innocent didn't even have trials

2570
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,880
and that they were the ones forced them

2571
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:05,279
to work themselves death and starve

2572
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,239
they couldn't deal with that guilt so

2573
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:10,238
when you are

2574
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:12,079
a pacifist or non uh a non-retaliatory

2575
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:14,079
and you're forcing someone who's using

2576
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:16,719
force like look what you're doing

2577
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:17,840
look what you've become for some people

2578
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:19,279
some people don't care

2579
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,039
you know like the guy in scare tactics

2580
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:21,679
like i mentioned earlier where for a lot

2581
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:23,920
of others

2582
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:25,199
they're gonna be like okay is this who i

2583
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,560
wanted to grow up to be they will have

2584
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:27,678
that little flame of conscience that you

2585
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,840
and i talked about earlier

2586
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:32,079
there will be like how did i get to the

2587
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:34,239
point where there's this lady

2588
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:35,760
who wants to ride the bus and she's you

2589
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:38,479
know lovely dressed

2590
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,039
put together and i have a sending a dog

2591
01:23:38,479 --> 01:23:40,959
on her

2592
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:42,079
what kind of person am i for some of

2593
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,319
those people

2594
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:46,000
they're gonna be like okay i can't be a

2595
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:46,719
part of this i don't even understand the

2596
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,600
politics

2597
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:50,399
i still am racist but i'm not going to

2598
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,039
take part

2599
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:53,839
in this atrocity well that was uh for

2600
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:56,479
him

2601
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,880
from the individual perspective perhaps

2602
01:23:56,479 --> 01:23:59,039
he

2603
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,039
he calls that christian but listening to

2604
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:04,319
that voice of conscience

2605
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:08,079
like whatever that is in you

2606
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:10,960
so for tolstoy it seems like

2607
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:12,319
anarchism from the individual

2608
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,560
perspective

2609
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:16,399
is uh silencing the rest of the world

2610
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,880
and listening to the

2611
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:20,000
the for him probably god-given voice of

2612
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,440
conscience yes

2613
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:25,760
and so that that's what it means to live

2614
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:27,279
embody anarchism and to embody

2615
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,440
christianity i would think he would say

2616
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:30,399
but he would see those as basically yes

2617
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:33,839
correct uh

2618
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:36,479
yeah so in terms of forms of government

2619
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:37,279
the christian government is one that's

2620
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:40,319
no government

2621
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:40,319
yeah correct uh

2622
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:46,480
what do you think about that as a device

2623
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:47,279
for an individual turn the other cheek

2624
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:48,638
do you think uh

2625
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:50,319
i tend to believe that that's a really

2626
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:52,560
good way to live

2627
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:53,759
i think it's very underrated and this is

2628
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,400
me talking

2629
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:58,400
i think a lot of times when someone

2630
01:24:56,399 --> 01:25:00,238
let's suppose you're having an argument

2631
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:01,439
and but you have to you have to pick

2632
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:02,718
your battles right let's suppose you're

2633
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:04,319
having a heat argument if someone says

2634
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,480
something very cruel to you

2635
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:07,599
we have attempted to double down and hit

2636
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:09,119
back twice as hard

2637
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,079
but if it's someone who at all cares

2638
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:12,399
about you when they're just in the

2639
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:12,719
moment and you just stop and you just

2640
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:14,719
say

2641
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,920
did you hear what you just said to me

2642
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,840
for some cases

2643
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,279
that person will take a step back and be

2644
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,920
like just like me when i snapped at

2645
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:22,960
michael

2646
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:25,279
uh at bitstein years ago i'd be like wow

2647
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,158
okay this is bad this is bad i'm sorry

2648
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:28,079
and they kind of

2649
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:29,920
you know it's kind of like they have to

2650
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:32,158
get to 10 before they re

2651
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,600
control or delete to use your language

2652
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:36,158
thank you yeah

2653
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,440
but for overflow i appreciate that but

2654
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:39,279
and for some they're gonna

2655
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:41,119
they're gonna just twist the knife but i

2656
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:43,920
think this is a very useful

2657
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:44,880
technique and also you can also sleep

2658
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,719
well at night

2659
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,800
because you could be like as much as

2660
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:51,760
this person tried to hurt me

2661
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,760
i still didn't reciprocate and yeah i

2662
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,400
took that punch and it sucks

2663
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:58,639
but at least i never said anything that

2664
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:01,039
i could feel guilty about

2665
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:02,560
exactly do you think that's ultimately a

2666
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:06,158
good way to implement

2667
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:07,840
anarchy in your personal life anarchy

2668
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:09,599
implementing anarchy in your personal

2669
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,560
life just means

2670
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,120
uh respecting people's boundaries it

2671
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,800
means

2672
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:18,399
uh um uh not forcing people to do things

2673
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:22,079
they otherwise wouldn't want to do

2674
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:24,399
i think you then have to take uh

2675
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:27,439
case by case like there's so many human

2676
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:29,119
interactions that are required for life

2677
01:26:27,439 --> 01:26:32,158
and there's tension and all those kinds

2678
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:32,158
of things it's not always

2679
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:36,959
being so naive no should i put the hat

2680
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,639
on

2681
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,079
the hat's on the other head now well i

2682
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,600
had to take off the hat cause it's like

2683
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:42,000
photo with the ring i was starting to

2684
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,480
feel

2685
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,920
like powerful i wanted to give you

2686
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:49,519
orders and i want

2687
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,039
no i i just i think there's uh ways of

2688
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,679
dealing with the tensions that are

2689
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:57,519
natural to human interactions

2690
01:26:53,679 --> 01:27:00,319
that can't be simply um

2691
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,840
you know it's not as simple as saying

2692
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:04,880
you want to respect

2693
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,239
the freedom of others and uh the

2694
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:09,039
boundaries of others

2695
01:27:06,238 --> 01:27:10,638
it's like you both have to agree on

2696
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:12,639
stuff and work something out

2697
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,400
and the mechanisms of that agreement the

2698
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:16,560
game theory of that agreement

2699
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:18,079
requires different hacks and strategies

2700
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,280
and the the

2701
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:22,479
the question is for an anarchist

2702
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:25,519
collective

2703
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:26,479
that's well functioning what kind of

2704
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,679
hacks

2705
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:32,799
uh what kind of ways of behavior

2706
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:34,560
are more likely to be productive and not

2707
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,079
you know that that's almost like the

2708
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,440
question do you want to turn the other

2709
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:38,880
cheek or do you want to stand your

2710
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:40,799
ground really firmly

2711
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,480
when somebody is an [ __ ] to you you

2712
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,239
walk away

2713
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:46,158
or when somebody is an [ __ ] to you

2714
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:48,000
you turn the other cheek and give them a

2715
01:27:46,158 --> 01:27:48,799
chance to rise to the best version of

2716
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,039
themselves

2717
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:51,840
and then find a common ground kind of

2718
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:53,439
thing it's

2719
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,840
it's an open question of how to form

2720
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:58,879
those collectives when there's people

2721
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:00,639
with with difficult childhoods and

2722
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,920
all that kind of stuff but it also comes

2723
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,880
down to what is your relationship with

2724
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,319
this person

2725
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,239
right is this out of character if you

2726
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:07,840
and i got into a disagreement all of a

2727
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:09,039
sudden you started getting very personal

2728
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,239
first i'd be very hurt

2729
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:11,760
yeah but then i'd be like this is out of

2730
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:12,319
character for lex i'm sure i could be

2731
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,760
like

2732
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:15,679
let's take a pause here like you're

2733
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,159
getting heated i'm trying to work this

2734
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:17,679
out

2735
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:19,599
what's going on here and you get a kind

2736
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:21,199
of a meta conversation but again you and

2737
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,239
i have a relationship with mutual

2738
01:28:21,198 --> 01:28:24,238
respect so

2739
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:25,759
as opposed to if it was a stranger you

2740
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:27,519
know who's

2741
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,679
just wants a piece of you it's just like

2742
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,760
i don't you are coming at me not correct

2743
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:32,960
i don't have to reciprocate in kind i'm

2744
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,880
not going to shoot you

2745
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,639
but i'm not going to pretend that you

2746
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:38,319
deserve respect when you're treating me

2747
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:41,920
with such contempt

2748
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:42,319
i i do defer especially with people i

2749
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:43,520
know

2750
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:44,960
because it's just this is smart

2751
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,080
long-term game theory as well as the

2752
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,439
right thing to do

2753
01:28:46,079 --> 01:28:49,039
i do try to give them the benefit of the

2754
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:50,879
data first right yeah because if you're

2755
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:52,639
gonna go aggro you can't go back

2756
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,400
but you could always go from like let me

2757
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:56,000
hear them out and then then i could go

2758
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:58,960
aggro so there's a big asymmetry

2759
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,840
there yeah and that's i mean i don't

2760
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,000
think anyone

2761
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,279
has the answer to this question is is

2762
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,039
that the right strategy

2763
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:07,359
to me game theoretically it seems the

2764
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:08,960
right strategy is to uh with reciprocity

2765
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:10,639
is what game theory says is the right

2766
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,079
strategy they did the prisoner's dilemma

2767
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:13,520
and they found tit for tat is the one

2768
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:14,960
that's the most advantageous

2769
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,880
so that's for when it's perfectly

2770
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:20,000
rational actors but when you have

2771
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:23,279
i mean there's noise the the

2772
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,600
there's uh i think benefit to just

2773
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:26,559
even if they keep being shitty to you

2774
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,320
still

2775
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,840
being nice to them well then there's the

2776
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:31,279
universe where girls are turned off

2777
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,199
some people are like if you're in a

2778
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:33,599
relationship and not just girls but girl

2779
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:35,119
like

2780
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,639
some people when you're kind to them

2781
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:39,679
they find you less attractive

2782
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:41,440
right that is kind of this weird what am

2783
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,000
i supposed to do like you're only into

2784
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:44,079
me

2785
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,760
if i'm mean to you i don't want to be

2786
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:47,119
mean but then i'm getting punished for

2787
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,079
doing the right thing that's another

2788
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:49,519
tricky one

2789
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:51,439
and i mean this is nothing that

2790
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:52,880
necessarily do with anarchism so much as

2791
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:54,079
like you know human beings are

2792
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,760
infinitely complex

2793
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:57,439
we don't often know the back story like

2794
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:00,239
for example just yesterday jay

2795
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:00,879
who's here is one of my closest friends

2796
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:02,319
i had

2797
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,000
a dinner with a bunch of people i

2798
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:06,479
couldn't bring a plus four

2799
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
so i didn't he wasn't invited he didn't

2800
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:09,439
know the circumstances he just thought

2801
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
we were having dinner without him he was

2802
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:11,759
hurt

2803
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,600
once i spelled it out he completely

2804
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,239
understood it i felt horrible because

2805
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,320
for me

2806
01:30:14,238 --> 01:30:18,638
to have any of my friends feel left out

2807
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,719
is just a very very cruel thing

2808
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:22,400
um and i was i felt bad and i'm glad to

2809
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,158
apologize again publicly that that's end

2810
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:24,479
up being the circumstances but yeah it's

2811
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:26,079
it's

2812
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:27,919
it's a lot of times we're also in

2813
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:30,000
plato's cave when you're dealing with

2814
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,359
somebody else you have very very limited

2815
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,399
information about their background and

2816
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:34,079
circumstances

2817
01:30:32,399 --> 01:30:36,158
and that's why i will always if it's

2818
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:38,639
someone i even have a little bit

2819
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:39,839
of a relationship with try to give them

2820
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,920
benefit of doubt because

2821
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:43,199
i've found especially this comes from

2822
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,399
being a co-author when you co-author

2823
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:45,119
books and you're walking other people's

2824
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:46,719
shoes

2825
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:48,479
you don't know what's a lot of the

2826
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:49,840
information so if

2827
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:51,519
it's a lot of times it's just a

2828
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:53,199
misunderstanding but isn't that a

2829
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:56,480
fundamentally anarchist question

2830
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:58,479
of uh how we figure out this puzzle of

2831
01:30:56,479 --> 01:31:00,079
human complexities in order to form

2832
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:01,599
voluntary collectives like we have to

2833
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:04,238
figure that out how to make

2834
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,440
people feel good how to make people i

2835
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:07,519
agree that's fair

2836
01:31:05,439 --> 01:31:08,719
and that i think i think not only

2837
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,760
anarchists have to think about this as

2838
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:12,158
my point

2839
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,840
of course well but we have to think

2840
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:16,399
about it more than others do

2841
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,679
right i feel like i should try to argue

2842
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:20,479
against anarchism

2843
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:20,800
at some point out of love out of love

2844
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:23,198
and

2845
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,480
so because people out of joy do people

2846
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:27,279
enjoy

2847
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,158
seeing me um what is it when like ben

2848
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:29,519
shapiro

2849
01:31:28,158 --> 01:31:31,679
argues against like a 20 year old

2850
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:33,840
feminist destroys high school students

2851
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:35,760
so this is this is this video of uh

2852
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:39,279
michael males destroys uh

2853
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:42,400
a a marxist russian communist

2854
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:43,359
pig so anarchism as opposed to

2855
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:44,719
hierarchies

2856
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:46,639
well that's left anarchism yeah

2857
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:47,920
anarcho-communism yeah the state but

2858
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:49,440
there are many hierarchies that are not

2859
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,039
the state you we have a hierarchy here

2860
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:53,119
this is your show on differential to you

2861
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:55,198
right but they're okay rigid hierarchies

2862
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:56,479
forced hierarchies is the first time yes

2863
01:31:55,198 --> 01:31:59,519
forced hierarchies okay

2864
01:31:56,479 --> 01:32:02,638
so do you think it's possible that

2865
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:04,239
humans when left on their own

2866
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:06,079
chord they they form hierarchies

2867
01:32:04,238 --> 01:32:07,678
naturally yes inevitably it might be

2868
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:08,719
inevitably which is why i disagree with

2869
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:10,800
the left anarchist

2870
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:12,239
i think it's not a coherent thing to

2871
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,400
argue for uh

2872
01:32:12,238 --> 01:32:16,000
non-hierarchical relationships even in

2873
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:18,719
theory it doesn't make sense to me

2874
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,399
and i i know the the the old school

2875
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,359
anarchist will call me stupid or

2876
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:23,039
uninformed but i

2877
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:24,719
i've never been able to even wrap my

2878
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:26,639
head around this claim that you could

2879
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:28,800
have relationships with that hierarchy

2880
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:29,920
right so i guess there's a certain sense

2881
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,000
in which we're living in

2882
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,520
anarchism now and i don't mean just like

2883
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,800
because the the nations as

2884
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:37,760
you've said are uh in anarchism relative

2885
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,760
to each other

2886
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,360
but isn't the united states just a

2887
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:43,360
collective that was formed

2888
01:32:41,359 --> 01:32:44,559
in anarchy and this is just the

2889
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:46,399
collective that we're

2890
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:48,320
operating under this hierarchy that was

2891
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:49,519
naturally formed it wasn't well the

2892
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:51,599
united states was not naturally formed

2893
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:55,040
it was formed by force and and by fiat

2894
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:56,159
but to your point um i i stress this

2895
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:58,399
throughout the book

2896
01:32:56,158 --> 01:33:00,319
uh i always say this anarchism is not a

2897
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:02,238
location it's a relationship

2898
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:03,359
so yeah you and i do have a hierarchy in

2899
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:05,439
that this is your show

2900
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:07,119
but not but neither of us really has an

2901
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:08,960
authority over the other like i'm here

2902
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:09,359
voluntarily you can kick me out if you

2903
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,119
want

2904
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:12,479
i can leave it anyone neither of us has

2905
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:13,840
the power to force the other to be in

2906
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:16,799
this relationship we've chosen

2907
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:18,560
my lawyer uh you know i defer to his

2908
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,159
judgment he's not forcing me to do it he

2909
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,719
gives me his advice and i can take it or

2910
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:22,399
leave it

2911
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:23,920
same with the doctor so there is a

2912
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:24,719
clearly like who's in charge and who's

2913
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,158
not in charge

2914
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:27,679
but they're not in a position to impose

2915
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:29,279
their will and everybody else and you

2916
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:32,000
could very easily see

2917
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:33,759
uh john is stephanie's lawyer and

2918
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,920
stephanie is john's doctor

2919
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,679
and in each of those contexts one has

2920
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,880
this position of ostensible authority

2921
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:41,279
over the other so

2922
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,319
anarchism is in fact not some utopian

2923
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:45,119
crazy thing

2924
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:46,479
it is the norm of human relationships

2925
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:48,158
where you meet people

2926
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:49,279
you're not necessarily equal someone's

2927
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:51,039
gonna be taller someone's gonna be

2928
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:51,679
stronger someone start smarter wealthier

2929
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:55,039
with others

2930
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:57,199
but you're not at all thinking i am here

2931
01:33:55,039 --> 01:33:59,760
and i could tell you what to do and you

2932
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:01,919
are legally or morally obligated

2933
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,119
to follow my wishes that that is the

2934
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,520
basis of anarchism

2935
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:06,479
so in what way is the united states

2936
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,719
imposing

2937
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:10,799
by force something on you do you think

2938
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:11,920
uh if you leave your house you will go

2939
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,079
to jail

2940
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:15,199
uh 40 of my money being taken from you

2941
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:17,600
by taxation

2942
01:34:15,198 --> 01:34:19,279
right but don't you have the freedom to

2943
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,960
not operate under that

2944
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:22,319
no but that's like yeah like technically

2945
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,679
if someone comes up to you and

2946
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:25,920
mugs you and says your money or your

2947
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:27,600
life you are making a choice

2948
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:29,760
but what the anarchist argument is

2949
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,239
they're not a position to force you

2950
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,520
to make that choice that is not morally

2951
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:35,039
binding even though they have

2952
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,440
practically the power

2953
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:39,119
to force you into that dilemma but you

2954
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:43,279
have the freedom to live

2955
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:45,118
on the united states or not so so even

2956
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:46,479
i see yeah the argument is if you don't

2957
01:34:45,118 --> 01:34:47,839
like it leave right

2958
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:49,599
not necessarily leave like

2959
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:53,440
geographically but there's

2960
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:55,280
there's ways to live outside

2961
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:56,799
the force of the united states there's

2962
01:34:55,279 --> 01:34:58,079
ways it's just very difficult to operate

2963
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,079
that way but that's like saying you

2964
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:02,800
could outrun the mugger which is true

2965
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:03,920
but the issue is does that mugger have

2966
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:07,119
the right

2967
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:08,880
to tell you at gunpoint you're either

2968
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:09,759
giving me your money or i'm gonna shoot

2969
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,480
you or

2970
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:14,639
secret plan c you get to run away is

2971
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:16,319
that person a moral actor and the

2972
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:18,480
anarchist answer is never

2973
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:20,000
and the difference one more thing the

2974
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:21,039
anarchist view is the difference between

2975
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,079
that mugger

2976
01:35:21,039 --> 01:35:25,920
and the government is only an

2977
01:35:24,079 --> 01:35:28,079
air of legitimacy literally they're

2978
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:31,039
morally identical so is it possible

2979
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:32,000
that every hierarchy that gets big

2980
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:33,840
enough

2981
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,279
and successful enough such that it can

2982
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:38,079
monopolize

2983
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:39,439
a bunch of services it provides isn't it

2984
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:42,960
always going to be

2985
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:44,799
a moral in your sense the way the united

2986
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,158
states government is immoral well i

2987
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,199
i don't want to say just like the united

2988
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:48,399
states government is immoral because

2989
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:49,919
that implies the united states

2990
01:35:48,399 --> 01:35:51,279
government is uniquely or especially

2991
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,480
immoral very governmental

2992
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:53,599
i just want to clarify that because i

2993
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:55,039
know you didn't mean that i don't want

2994
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,719
that to be an implication

2995
01:35:55,039 --> 01:36:01,359
um can you repeat the question so like

2996
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:03,279
won't every okay so that's right this is

2997
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:04,079
so that's progressive economics yeah so

2998
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:06,079
the argument is

2999
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:07,519
in any market at a certain point things

3000
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:10,158
tend to centralize

3001
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,840
and then that organization de facto can

3002
01:36:10,158 --> 01:36:12,319
dictate price can dictate so on and so

3003
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,880
forth

3004
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:17,118
that is completely historical if you

3005
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,880
look at any market the trend is always

3006
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:19,920
towards

3007
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:21,359
decentralization the music industry

3008
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,279
right when we were kids

3009
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:24,479
there were four or five record labels

3010
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:25,359
they were the ones who made all the

3011
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:27,439
songs that you're going to see in the

3012
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:30,000
billboard top 100 with a few exceptions

3013
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:31,678
now anyone can go to direct to market if

3014
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,479
you look at tv stations right it went

3015
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:35,279
from cbs

3016
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:36,479
nbc abc then you got fox then you had

3017
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:38,079
cable which is 100.

3018
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:39,198
now you have satellite which have sounds

3019
01:36:38,079 --> 01:36:40,559
around the world and you have youtube

3020
01:36:39,198 --> 01:36:43,198
which is literally infinite

3021
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,719
so as technology improves and as wealth

3022
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:45,599
increases which is a function of free

3023
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:47,600
enterprise

3024
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,639
you are going to always have more and

3025
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,600
more choice

3026
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:52,319
even within a monopoly coca-cola right

3027
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,239
uh

3028
01:36:52,319 --> 01:36:55,920
uh this is an example i used i think and

3029
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:58,399
then you write when we were kids

3030
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:59,118
every terrible comedian would be like oh

3031
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:01,920
now that i've got

3032
01:36:59,118 --> 01:37:02,719
diet uh caffeine-free coke what's next

3033
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,880
and it's like

3034
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:06,880
yeah that's good you want to have uh

3035
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:08,800
what was his name uh

3036
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:11,199
caiman the guy who invented the segway

3037
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:14,480
if you go it dean came in if you go into

3038
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:16,559
some restaurants right now you will have

3039
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:17,759
those machines where you have like 80

3040
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:19,119
kinds of cokes

3041
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:21,119
and then you could have whatever flavor

3042
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:21,439
you want to add to it grape cherry lemon

3043
01:37:21,118 --> 01:37:24,639
lime

3044
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:25,919
so on and so forth so in any field

3045
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:27,840
you're going to have more and more

3046
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:30,399
competition you're going to have

3047
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:32,079
less competition and less choices when

3048
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:33,439
the state gets involved because the

3049
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:35,840
state wants control

3050
01:37:33,439 --> 01:37:36,879
the state wants one big neck with one

3051
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,400
leash around it

3052
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,319
and that way it could just pull that dog

3053
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:41,439
in one direction another and you saw

3054
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:43,599
this last year

3055
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:45,039
with the lockdowns carol roth wrote this

3056
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,760
amazing book called the war in small

3057
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:47,840
business

3058
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,600
and she talked about we have seen for

3059
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:52,960
the first time in history

3060
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:53,840
a massive wealth transfer from small and

3061
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,520
medium business

3062
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,119
towards organizations like target and

3063
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:59,280
amazon who made

3064
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:01,439
trillions of dollars last year whereas

3065
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:02,399
mom and pop which to me at least is like

3066
01:38:01,439 --> 01:38:03,839
the acme

3067
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:05,679
of american achievement you come to

3068
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,560
america you have a fruit stand a

3069
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:09,039
laundromat

3070
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,639
uh you make you socks whatever it is

3071
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:11,600
you're that unique artisan creating

3072
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:13,440
something special

3073
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:15,360
they're the ones who didn't last whereas

3074
01:38:13,439 --> 01:38:15,678
target amazon did so when you have the

3075
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:17,519
state

3076
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:19,199
involvement it will always be in favor

3077
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,840
of jeff bezos and for the simple reason

3078
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:21,118
that

3079
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,360
it's going to be a lot easier for jeff

3080
01:38:21,118 --> 01:38:24,639
bezos to get nancy pelosi and mitch

3081
01:38:23,359 --> 01:38:27,519
mcconnell on the phone

3082
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,639
than it is for me making socks on etsy

3083
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:31,199
but your sense

3084
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:33,279
is that there'll be less and less over

3085
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:35,519
time jeff bezos says

3086
01:38:33,279 --> 01:38:36,559
like whatever the industry will look at

3087
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:39,520
there's be less

3088
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,159
there's a trend towards decentralization

3089
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,719
across

3090
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:44,960
all industries and when i say

3091
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:47,679
decentralization i just mean choice

3092
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,560
right so if you look at again networks

3093
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:50,158
you're gonna

3094
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,880
if you were in the 80s and you had a

3095
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:54,479
network just for uh lgbt issues

3096
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,239
first of all it's going to be completely

3097
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:57,279
heretical that's not going to happen

3098
01:38:56,238 --> 01:38:58,718
and there's not going to be enough

3099
01:38:57,279 --> 01:38:59,519
necessarily people identify as that to

3100
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:00,880
have an audience

3101
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,239
then there was something called logo

3102
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,520
they have that there's lots of other

3103
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:06,559
shows like that in this the way

3104
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:09,119
so more specific look at websites yeah

3105
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,840
i'm positive that you and i if we wanted

3106
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:12,960
to look up

3107
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,719
uh breeding guinea pigs would find

3108
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,480
thousands of websites about different

3109
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:18,480
breeds and all this other stuff

3110
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:19,839
20 years ago 30 years ago like you're

3111
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:21,519
gonna have two books

3112
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,880
yeah and they're not gonna be dynamic as

3113
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:25,360
these new uh um

3114
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:27,199
uh breeds are developed so at the same

3115
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:30,000
time it does

3116
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:31,759
following on your argument it does seem

3117
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
easier to move

3118
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:35,360
and immigrate from from state to state

3119
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,359
within the united states

3120
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:39,679
and to other countries do you think

3121
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:42,559
that's a form of freedom

3122
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,600
that embodies anarchism where you can

3123
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,719
resist

3124
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:47,440
the uh the force of state by choosing

3125
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:50,319
where you live

3126
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:51,759
to some extent but the line people some

3127
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:52,880
of these boomers will got me on twitter

3128
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,079
if i'm going after the police or

3129
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,880
something and be like if you don't like

3130
01:39:54,079 --> 01:39:56,880
america

3131
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:59,520
get out of here and i tell them freedom

3132
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:01,600
means i do what i want not what you want

3133
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:02,639
freedom means i don't have to move you

3134
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,239
don't have to move

3135
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:05,600
free speech is a good example it doesn't

3136
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:06,879
mean i have to be on twitter right

3137
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:08,239
twitter has the right to ban me

3138
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,319
but what i'm saying is i'm saying

3139
01:40:08,238 --> 01:40:12,319
something and you don't like it

3140
01:40:10,319 --> 01:40:13,359
too bad you're the one who has to

3141
01:40:12,319 --> 01:40:15,118
accommodate me

3142
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:16,880
because i have a right to do what i want

3143
01:40:15,118 --> 01:40:17,920
with my person as long as i'm being

3144
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,920
peaceful

3145
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:23,279
so i guess i'm trying to get to the

3146
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:25,840
difference between the state

3147
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:26,719
and what you would naturally want in

3148
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:29,520
anarchy

3149
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:31,198
which is like a security company sure

3150
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,239
all those things

3151
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:35,599
they will as they become successful

3152
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:37,359
start looking more and more like the

3153
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:40,800
state because you get to

3154
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:42,000
elect you give them money they uh i got

3155
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,560
you they have leaders

3156
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,520
what's the difference between a

3157
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:49,280
government

3158
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:51,280
and a very successful service provider

3159
01:40:49,279 --> 01:40:53,439
in in anarchism this gets a little

3160
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:55,759
confused in america's big companies

3161
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:57,439
necessarily are in hand in hand with the

3162
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,119
government ended up in bed with them

3163
01:40:57,439 --> 01:41:00,879
the answer to this question is a long

3164
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:02,158
complicated one and thankfully it's all

3165
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,760
in the anarchist handbook

3166
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:05,679
there was an essay by murray rothbard

3167
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,800
who dave smith is this is the essay that

3168
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:08,399
converted dave smith

3169
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,000
so maybe it's not as good as it could

3170
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:10,879
have been otherwise called anatomy of

3171
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,880
the state

3172
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:14,000
and mary rothbard points out that state

3173
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:17,279
is the only

3174
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:19,840
agency in a country which gets its goods

3175
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:22,000
through force the state is the only

3176
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:24,079
agency that is not a producer

3177
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,158
but inherently a parasite because it

3178
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:28,319
does not get its money voluntarily

3179
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:29,839
but through taxation and by imposing its

3180
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:31,759
values on a country

3181
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:34,319
that is what makes a state uniquely

3182
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:37,920
different from let's suppose an amazon

3183
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:40,319
or a barnes noble or a target jeff bezos

3184
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:41,440
does not have the authority or the moral

3185
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:43,679
legitimacy

3186
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:44,799
to get an army and go into somebody's

3187
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:47,920
house whereas

3188
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:49,920
andrew cuomo or ron desantis donald

3189
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:53,199
trump and barack obama certainly do

3190
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:56,639
but is it possible that

3191
01:41:53,198 --> 01:42:01,039
to refrain so jeff pesos does if he

3192
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:03,359
if he hires a security force right also

3193
01:42:01,039 --> 01:42:05,198
is it possible to reframe taxation as a

3194
01:42:03,359 --> 01:42:07,759
form of payment like it

3195
01:42:05,198 --> 01:42:08,638
uh if it was done much better if you

3196
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:11,520
could pay

3197
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:13,440
this collective that we call government

3198
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:14,080
in ways where you could pay for things

3199
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:17,678
that you care

3200
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:19,519
for so much your money would be

3201
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:21,039
much more directly contributing to the

3202
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:22,320
things you care for whether

3203
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:24,399
if you care for a service like

3204
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:26,000
healthcare you'll be able to

3205
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:28,000
buy essentially insurance from the

3206
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,960
government uh why am i buying insurance

3207
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,479
from the government as opposed to

3208
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,679
insurance from insurance company

3209
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:33,439
what do you perceive as a difference

3210
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,719
between a tax and a price do you see the

3211
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:36,559
difference

3212
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:38,960
yes i know on the surface level i'm

3213
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:41,440
trying to get deeply to say

3214
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,880
there's a lot of similarities but what

3215
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:45,118
i'm saying is there's one

3216
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,480
essential difference which is taxes are

3217
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:49,039
imposed on you

3218
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:50,799
and you have no choice as here's an

3219
01:42:49,039 --> 01:42:51,679
example my my book ego and hubris my

3220
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,920
biography

3221
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:55,520
uh it goes for 500 on ebay someone paid

3222
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:56,800
for it some crazy person

3223
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:58,639
people are showing me that it's on

3224
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,679
amazon for three thousand dollars

3225
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:01,359
something like that

3226
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:03,118
you could put a million for it it's you

3227
01:43:01,359 --> 01:43:04,719
could charge whatever price you want the

3228
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:06,000
question is is someone paying that three

3229
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:06,880
thousand ford is someone paying that

3230
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,039
million for it

3231
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:11,039
and if it's actually the buyer who

3232
01:43:09,039 --> 01:43:12,719
establishes the price because the seller

3233
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:14,880
can put any price tag he wants

3234
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:16,079
80 trillion dollars but unless someone's

3235
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,719
paying that amount and clearing the

3236
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:18,800
market

3237
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:20,239
uh that price has literally no real

3238
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:22,000
meaning right it's not an indicator of

3239
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:25,198
value or worth or market price

3240
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:27,920
taxation on the other hand is by fiat

3241
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:29,359
i can decide it's fair that you lex have

3242
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:32,960
to pay 40

3243
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:34,799
and joe has to pay 45 joe and lex are in

3244
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,520
no position to be like this price is too

3245
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,480
high

3246
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:40,320
that not only is that money uh set just

3247
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:43,118
completely out of their hands

3248
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:44,799
it's taki for people who are employees

3249
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:45,839
it's taken out of their paychecks before

3250
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,279
they even see it

3251
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,800
so they don't have the choice to be like

3252
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:50,639
you know what i agree that the

3253
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,320
government has the right to pay taxation

3254
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:54,159
here's my check for forty percent it's

3255
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:55,840
going on it's completely different

3256
01:43:54,158 --> 01:43:57,679
uh paradigm than you are when you're

3257
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:58,639
playing the government provides a lot of

3258
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:00,560
services

3259
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:02,319
in the current system right but there's

3260
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,960
no service the government provides that

3261
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:04,479
cannot be

3262
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:06,000
that would not be provided better more

3263
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:06,479
efficiently and with more choices in a

3264
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,560
market

3265
01:44:06,479 --> 01:44:09,759
well that's a hypothesis no that's very

3266
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:11,119
likely no well that's not

3267
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:13,360
this i can demonstrate this to you very

3268
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:13,359
easily

3269
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:17,760
i love it when you get flustered this is

3270
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:21,199
this is what this is what people like

3271
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,920
it's so cute the robot don't make me put

3272
01:44:21,198 --> 01:44:24,879
on the head

3273
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:26,079
uh robot has the fire the smoke coming

3274
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:28,960
out of his ears

3275
01:44:26,079 --> 01:44:28,960
what is price

3276
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:33,599
there okay so it will tax love you know

3277
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:35,440
like you know people like

3278
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,880
i i think of the government as a kind of

3279
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:38,719
subscription service

3280
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,239
no no that's the anarchist view the

3281
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:41,600
anarchist view of gov of

3282
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:43,599
a private security would be a

3283
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:45,520
subscription service so that's exactly

3284
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:48,239
correct but everyone hates

3285
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:49,920
when uh you sign up to a gym and then

3286
01:44:48,238 --> 01:44:52,000
you realize in the contract

3287
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:54,079
it's very difficult to cancel that uh

3288
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,279
membership and then they up the price

3289
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:57,840
i mean that's there's a lot of

3290
01:44:55,279 --> 01:44:59,118
unpleasant things with with uh with a

3291
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,279
subscription service

3292
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:02,479
that then you can elect to go to another

3293
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:04,800
subscription service

3294
01:45:02,479 --> 01:45:06,479
sure you're or you could go and yelp and

3295
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,920
complain and if there's enough people do

3296
01:45:06,479 --> 01:45:09,439
that the gym will be receptive

3297
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,840
look at the power of yelp versus the

3298
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:14,000
power of the vote well this

3299
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:16,400
we could talk about that too so you're

3300
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:20,800
saying yelp is more effective

3301
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:23,920
than voting yes the thing is

3302
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:27,039
i agree with you but you go

3303
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:28,079
take a further step you say that yelp is

3304
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:31,359
ethical

3305
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:32,719
and moral and voting is amoral or like

3306
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:35,118
not voting but

3307
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:36,639
government is immoral so like it's not

3308
01:45:35,118 --> 01:45:37,359
only is one more efficient than the

3309
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:39,440
other

3310
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:40,960
you're saying like because i would say

3311
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:42,960
government sucks

3312
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:44,239
at doing what it does and it's gotten a

3313
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,719
lot better at it

3314
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:47,439
and i believe it can get keep getting

3315
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:50,480
better

3316
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:51,919
uh as it gets smaller and leverages

3317
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:55,359
companies more and more

3318
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:59,600
but you're saying no no government is

3319
01:45:55,359 --> 01:46:01,359
fundamentally as an idea gets in the way

3320
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,039
of companies that should be doing those

3321
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:04,960
things anyway right

3322
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:06,479
i i just think that companies when you

3323
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,079
take away government will start looking

3324
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:09,279
like government

3325
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:11,359
they just because something looks like

3326
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:12,960
something does not mean it's the same

3327
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:15,039
if someone puts out a yamaka into

3328
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,719
fill-in and they go to shul they're not

3329
01:46:15,039 --> 01:46:19,279
jewish

3330
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:20,158
right the the basic objection you have

3331
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:22,639
with government

3332
01:46:20,158 --> 01:46:23,759
because you can leave like i i i

3333
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:25,760
apologize that

3334
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:28,400
this is that stupid twitter cliche

3335
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:30,639
statement but

3336
01:46:28,399 --> 01:46:32,879
your opposition to the this idea of

3337
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:35,520
leaving the united states

3338
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,000
is that it's just it's a lot of effort

3339
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:37,600
it's

3340
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,000
it's it's too much friction not the

3341
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:42,159
opposite the option the opposition is

3342
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,158
i in the introduction to the book yeah i

3343
01:46:42,158 --> 01:46:44,638
say anarchism can be summed up in one

3344
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:46,638
sentence

3345
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:47,760
you do not speak for me everything else

3346
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:50,159
is application

3347
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:52,000
so the claim that somebody i've never

3348
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:54,559
met or who i voted against

3349
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,039
let's say i hate donald trump i despise

3350
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,400
him

3351
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:58,560
you know i want hillary clinton to be

3352
01:46:56,399 --> 01:47:00,319
president too bad trump's your president

3353
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:02,480
that's not what i want yeah the idea

3354
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:05,039
that this person can come on me and make

3355
01:47:02,479 --> 01:47:07,279
any claims onto one second of my time

3356
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:08,479
as opposed to trying to persuade me that

3357
01:47:07,279 --> 01:47:11,439
is something that i

3358
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:13,519
at anarchists regard as inherently uh

3359
01:47:11,439 --> 01:47:14,000
evil and nonsensical but to operate

3360
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:16,239
large

3361
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,000
organizations like you you see this with

3362
01:47:16,238 --> 01:47:19,839
cryptocurrency there's governance

3363
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
you have to make difficult decisions

3364
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:24,159
there's a block size wars for bitcoin

3365
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,920
sure so you will there is a voting

3366
01:47:24,158 --> 01:47:27,679
mechanism often with membership when

3367
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,440
your subscription service but

3368
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:31,359
see the thing is you're using these

3369
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:32,238
words and you're switching definitions

3370
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:34,319
because like

3371
01:47:32,238 --> 01:47:36,079
if i go to a store i can technically say

3372
01:47:34,319 --> 01:47:38,319
i'm voting for tropicana orange juice

3373
01:47:36,079 --> 01:47:39,118
as opposed to another one but to kind of

3374
01:47:38,319 --> 01:47:40,639
say oh

3375
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:42,559
well you're making a choice therefore

3376
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:43,679
every choice is a vote i i don't i think

3377
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,360
that that's something that

3378
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:46,960
the venn diagram is not no i literally

3379
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:49,920
mean vote in this case not money

3380
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,639
okay there's some decisions like should

3381
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:53,039
bitcoin

3382
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:54,319
have increases block size okay there's a

3383
01:47:53,039 --> 01:47:56,079
bunch of different

3384
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:58,000
uh they're called soft forks they're

3385
01:47:56,079 --> 01:47:58,479
hard forks oh i'm not saying you should

3386
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,560
never

3387
01:47:58,479 --> 01:48:02,079
vote like stockholders have to vote

3388
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:04,400
right exactly but there's no

3389
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:05,600
pretense here's let's look at this if

3390
01:48:04,399 --> 01:48:06,960
you want to build robots

3391
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:08,560
right you would sit down with the

3392
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,520
company you would you guys would be like

3393
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,639
we should do this kind of rubble i

3394
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,320
should do this kind of robot

3395
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:14,239
the stockholders would have a vote or

3396
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:15,759
the board in proportion to their

3397
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:18,718
investment in the firm

3398
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:19,199
me who knows nothing about robots uh i

3399
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:21,198
am

3400
01:48:19,198 --> 01:48:23,118
the idea that i'm in a position to walk

3401
01:48:21,198 --> 01:48:23,759
in and be like this is what you should

3402
01:48:23,118 --> 01:48:26,238
do

3403
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:27,840
is crazy and bizarre and wrong because

3404
01:48:26,238 --> 01:48:30,319
i'm not in an informed position

3405
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:30,960
so what democracy does is it forces

3406
01:48:30,319 --> 01:48:33,599
people who

3407
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,319
run businesses well to run businesses

3408
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,760
poorly

3409
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:37,359
by people who don't know how to run

3410
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,520
businesses at all that's the

3411
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:40,880
that's one of the many concerns but

3412
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:43,199
you're saying that's the fundamental

3413
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:44,560
property of the state

3414
01:48:43,198 --> 01:48:47,118
i have a sense that the state could

3415
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:48,560
become as effective as what we think of

3416
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:50,559
as companies i mean

3417
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:52,400
as this is why they can't because the

3418
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:55,280
state does not have access to

3419
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:57,279
data the way that firms do and this is

3420
01:48:55,279 --> 01:48:59,439
one of ludwig von mises great points

3421
01:48:57,279 --> 01:49:01,920
what he called the calculation problem

3422
01:48:59,439 --> 01:49:03,678
if i'm looking at comic books right and

3423
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:06,639
i have detective comics

3424
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:08,960
if detective comics 26 is a thousand and

3425
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:12,239
detective comics 28 is a thousand

3426
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:14,319
and detective comics 27 is 50 000

3427
01:49:12,238 --> 01:49:15,678
that is telling me that even if i don't

3428
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:18,479
know anything about comics

3429
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:20,000
that detective comics 27 is either very

3430
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:21,919
very scarce for some reason

3431
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,520
or very very desirable it's the first

3432
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,880
appearance of batman whatever but

3433
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,719
you don't need to know that to just look

3434
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:28,400
at this data and be like okay this is

3435
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:30,399
the market tell me something

3436
01:49:28,399 --> 01:49:32,238
if prices are set by the government

3437
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:34,158
which the government is a monopoly

3438
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:36,319
i have no way of picking those winners

3439
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:37,519
or losers i don't have that data of

3440
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:40,238
supply and demand

3441
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:42,000
of an entire nation or a world of people

3442
01:49:40,238 --> 01:49:44,238
making individual decisions

3443
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,198
and having price be dynamic and

3444
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:47,678
informing me

3445
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:49,198
as the the organization where i should

3446
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:52,399
allocate my resources

3447
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:55,519
so the price is a really strong signal

3448
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:58,238
yes that allows you to uh

3449
01:49:55,520 --> 01:50:00,560
to operate a voluntary collective where

3450
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:01,839
people get what they want

3451
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,840
and don't get what they don't want and

3452
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:04,319
it tells me what to produce what not to

3453
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:06,880
produce

3454
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:08,399
and it also is great because if i see

3455
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,599
this podcasting industry which didn't

3456
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:11,279
exist five years ago

3457
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:12,880
and now these people are making bank

3458
01:50:11,279 --> 01:50:15,359
that tells me as

3459
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:16,560
someone who is an investor okay they're

3460
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:19,039
making 50

3461
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:20,239
pro whatever 10 profit on their capital

3462
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:23,439
in in the

3463
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:25,519
plant industry it's 2 if i i'm going to

3464
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:26,960
further my capital into this 10 percent

3465
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:28,080
and that's going to lower the profit

3466
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,639
rate as that

3467
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:31,359
builds up and that is how uh markets are

3468
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:34,159
regulated

3469
01:50:31,359 --> 01:50:34,719
voluntarily but the word government i

3470
01:50:34,158 --> 01:50:37,439
just think

3471
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:38,158
it's possible to have collectives that

3472
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:40,799
of

3473
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:43,039
human beings that represent others based

3474
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,560
on their voluntary

3475
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:46,399
they yes of course you have private

3476
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:48,400
governance absolutely private governance

3477
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:50,000
any company you can have a ceo you're

3478
01:50:48,399 --> 01:50:50,559
gonna have a board directors yeah but

3479
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
then you

3480
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:57,440
i just it starts to look

3481
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,760
very similar to me a successful private

3482
01:50:57,439 --> 01:51:00,799
governance mechanism at a scale of the

3483
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:03,920
united states

3484
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:05,520
starts looking a whole lot like the

3485
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:08,639
current government of the united states

3486
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:10,000
what's what's how even amazon i don't

3487
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:12,480
think is anything close

3488
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,359
to the center size-wise or budget-wise

3489
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:16,399
or power-wise

3490
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:18,319
no so you're saying you just

3491
01:51:16,399 --> 01:51:20,158
it's not even state it's almost like

3492
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:21,359
anything at that size you want to keep

3493
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:24,000
things smaller

3494
01:51:21,359 --> 01:51:25,359
and i don't i their markets are not

3495
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,760
going to

3496
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:28,479
combine to that level of the state

3497
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:31,039
because no

3498
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:32,479
jeff bezos will never even position to

3499
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:34,399
tell everyone in america

3500
01:51:32,479 --> 01:51:36,158
i'm going to take 40 of your money

3501
01:51:34,399 --> 01:51:37,198
before you even see it that to me is

3502
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:39,118
actually unclear

3503
01:51:37,198 --> 01:51:40,479
we don't know that to be true or that

3504
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:42,319
google or amazon

3505
01:51:40,479 --> 01:51:44,879
can't grow to the size if you take away

3506
01:51:42,319 --> 01:51:46,880
the us government i'm not sure that

3507
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:48,000
amazon can't grow to the size okay so

3508
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:52,400
worst case scenario

3509
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:55,439
is we're back where we started right uh

3510
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:56,399
that's not worst case scenario but the

3511
01:51:55,439 --> 01:51:57,598
concern is that

3512
01:51:56,399 --> 01:51:59,359
google is going to be the federal

3513
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:01,119
government that's not the concern i'm

3514
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:02,479
saying like this is what it looks like

3515
01:52:01,118 --> 01:52:03,118
when google is the federal government

3516
01:52:02,479 --> 01:52:06,559
it's not a

3517
01:52:03,118 --> 01:52:08,880
it's like to me the

3518
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:10,880
the us government is our best attempt so

3519
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:12,239
far to have large-scale representation

3520
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:14,639
of people's interests

3521
01:52:12,238 --> 01:52:16,158
it really sucks but it's our best

3522
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:17,199
attempt so far and the question is how

3523
01:52:16,158 --> 01:52:19,439
to improve it

3524
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:20,799
like if you take away all the if you

3525
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:23,678
take away the us government

3526
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:24,239
i'm trying to see how do we improve on

3527
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:27,118
that

3528
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:27,678
level that scale of representation of

3529
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:29,279
people's

3530
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:30,480
let me give you one example that's that

3531
01:52:29,279 --> 01:52:31,679
people could wrap their heads up very

3532
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:32,399
easily i'm against government police

3533
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:34,880
monopoly

3534
01:52:32,399 --> 01:52:36,158
i'm for private security right you don't

3535
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,960
have to be an anarchist to understand

3536
01:52:36,158 --> 01:52:39,439
this

3537
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:40,399
can everyone agree or at least as a

3538
01:52:39,439 --> 01:52:42,479
hypothesis

3539
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:44,399
everyone can wrap the heads around and

3540
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:46,238
here's a big concern 9-1-1

3541
01:52:44,399 --> 01:52:47,759
right there i've heard this 9-1-1 call

3542
01:52:46,238 --> 01:52:49,279
it's very chilling there's a kid in a

3543
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,039
closet his family's being murdered

3544
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:53,679
outside right he has to call 9-1-1 he's

3545
01:52:51,039 --> 01:52:56,880
whispering it's it's horrifying to hear

3546
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:59,118
there's no reason why the number i call

3547
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:00,319
for my families being murdered is the

3548
01:52:59,118 --> 01:53:01,679
same number i call for the fire

3549
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:02,399
department is the same number i call for

3550
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:04,399
an ambulance

3551
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:05,839
what if instead it operated like uber

3552
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:07,920
you had buttons on your phone

3553
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:09,679
if there's a real emergency like

3554
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,960
someone's gun flyers someone's being

3555
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:13,760
killed you press this

3556
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,399
and it sends instead of the one police

3557
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:16,400
district

3558
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:18,079
whatever company is nearby you have a

3559
01:53:16,399 --> 01:53:19,279
bunch of them and they're the ones who

3560
01:53:18,079 --> 01:53:19,920
are going to come to your house to save

3561
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:21,198
you

3562
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:23,118
people can wrap their heads around that

3563
01:53:21,198 --> 01:53:25,039
very easily that is one

3564
01:53:23,118 --> 01:53:26,880
very clear way to go from having a

3565
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:28,719
government security monopoly

3566
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:31,039
towards having a more free enterprise

3567
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:32,719
system so when you apply that to pretty

3568
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:34,238
much anything it doesn't become that

3569
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:38,800
complicated of alternative

3570
01:53:34,238 --> 01:53:42,158
so what i would criticize this

3571
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:43,279
but i believe the government it's like

3572
01:53:42,158 --> 01:53:44,079
the parenting thing we've talked about

3573
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:48,479
earlier

3574
01:53:44,079 --> 01:53:51,198
i think it creates a safe space

3575
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:52,799
for govern for uh i'm for safe spaces so

3576
01:53:51,198 --> 01:53:55,198
i'm not going to laugh you about that no

3577
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:57,199
i want people to be safe but for uh a

3578
01:53:55,198 --> 01:54:00,719
safe space for entrepreneurship

3579
01:53:57,198 --> 01:54:00,960
so i believe that good government hold

3580
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:02,239
on

3581
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,279
give me a second give me a second sure

3582
01:54:02,238 --> 01:54:04,158
i'm sorry i'm sorry you're right you're

3583
01:54:03,279 --> 01:54:07,679
right i'm sorry

3584
01:54:04,158 --> 01:54:10,638
uh i think government gives

3585
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:12,239
opportunity for companies to out-compete

3586
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:15,279
it

3587
01:54:12,238 --> 01:54:17,759
yes so yes fedex 100

3588
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:18,719
not a question so i believe you need to

3589
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:22,480
have private school

3590
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:25,439
government to give a chance for

3591
01:54:22,479 --> 01:54:26,158
ups fedex for spacex always an x in

3592
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:29,118
there

3593
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:31,118
uh to uh to to pop up and then

3594
01:54:29,118 --> 01:54:32,079
government will naturally back off from

3595
01:54:31,118 --> 01:54:34,479
that place

3596
01:54:32,079 --> 01:54:36,079
so like you but you need the innovator

3597
01:54:34,479 --> 01:54:38,158
to step in and build the thing

3598
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:39,599
okay like you can't just when has

3599
01:54:38,158 --> 01:54:42,879
government ever backed off though

3600
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:46,079
that never happens back well from from

3601
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:47,679
from what from fedex and ups from uh

3602
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:50,479
spacex from

3603
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:52,560
amazon hold on the u.s postal service

3604
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:55,039
still competes with fedex and ups

3605
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:56,159
so here's the other thing not nearly not

3606
01:54:55,039 --> 01:54:58,800
well but they still exist

3607
01:54:56,158 --> 01:54:59,839
and the point is they're dying but ups

3608
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,920
and fedex are

3609
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:02,880
taxed so not only are they paying for

3610
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,319
their own company

3611
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,319
they're paying for this competitor this

3612
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:06,639
is the essential difference imagine if

3613
01:55:06,319 --> 01:55:08,639
you

3614
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:10,159
didn't have ups excuse me the federal

3615
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:12,000
government no post office

3616
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:13,759
so you had fedex you have dhl you have

3617
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,800
u.s post service and many others

3618
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:20,400
how about in this scenario ups

3619
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:21,360
has the capacity to take 20 of fedex's

3620
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:23,198
dhl

3621
01:55:21,359 --> 01:55:24,158
and couriers money and put in their own

3622
01:55:23,198 --> 01:55:25,039
pocket and they never have to do

3623
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:26,399
anything in return

3624
01:55:25,039 --> 01:55:28,880
this is going to be an enormous

3625
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:30,399
advantage of ups and then when you add

3626
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:31,760
the addition that ups

3627
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:33,039
is not necessarily going to be more

3628
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:35,039
efficient the others this is going to be

3629
01:55:33,039 --> 01:55:36,880
a huge distortion in the market

3630
01:55:35,039 --> 01:55:38,079
can you imagine if your podcast you just

3631
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:40,560
automatically got 20

3632
01:55:38,079 --> 01:55:42,079
of the views of everybody else i mean

3633
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:43,199
would there be any incentive for you to

3634
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:44,479
be great or you could just sit in your

3635
01:55:43,198 --> 01:55:46,879
laurels and do whatever you want even

3636
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:48,638
more than now

3637
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:49,840
it's hard to imagine more than now i

3638
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:50,719
didn't say your robot and lack

3639
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:53,760
imagination

3640
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:55,359
i i think there just has to be uh

3641
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,719
it's of course you can do it completely

3642
01:55:55,359 --> 01:55:58,158
without government but government's all

3643
01:55:56,719 --> 01:56:00,960
i need to hear okay that's all i need to

3644
01:55:58,158 --> 01:56:00,960
hear show's over

3645
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:08,639
is uh like that safety net that's needed

3646
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,679
for entrepreneurship that's needed for

3647
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:13,279
uh i'm sorry to say but i have a sense

3648
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:14,399
that there needs to be a bit of a safety

3649
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:16,880
net for freedom

3650
01:56:14,399 --> 01:56:18,399
i i'm much more comfortable with saying

3651
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:20,079
you need a safety net for freedom then

3652
01:56:18,399 --> 01:56:21,920
you need one for entrepreneurs

3653
01:56:20,079 --> 01:56:24,079
the beauty of markets is with your

3654
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:26,239
startup if you have a startup

3655
01:56:24,079 --> 01:56:28,319
and it completely fails the only person

3656
01:56:26,238 --> 01:56:30,319
who's screwed is you and your investors

3657
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:32,000
if i'm a government and i make a startup

3658
01:56:30,319 --> 01:56:32,319
the entire society fails like the iraq

3659
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,880
war

3660
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:36,000
right if i have this cockamamie plan i

3661
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:37,599
don't everyone else doesn't have a

3662
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,439
choice they are both funding it and

3663
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:40,239
sometimes even drafted or forced into it

3664
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:42,638
right

3665
01:56:40,238 --> 01:56:44,000
the safety net the antlers getting back

3666
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:44,800
to the early anarchists one of the

3667
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,479
things that i

3668
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,760
admire about them the inaugural

3669
01:56:46,479 --> 01:56:48,718
communists the old school left

3670
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,800
anarchists

3671
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:52,239
is people don't remember what context

3672
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,520
they were in they were in context

3673
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:55,279
without a welfare state

3674
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:56,960
they're immigrating in huge numbers from

3675
01:56:55,279 --> 01:56:58,319
eastern europe people are you go to the

3676
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,480
tenement museum in new york

3677
01:56:58,319 --> 01:57:01,359
people like 12 to room kids are working

3678
01:57:00,479 --> 01:57:02,718
factories or

3679
01:57:01,359 --> 01:57:04,079
they either work in factories or they

3680
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:04,800
have to starve it's not their parents

3681
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:06,079
didn't love them

3682
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:08,239
is that the parents didn't have birth

3683
01:57:06,079 --> 01:57:09,439
control which was a felony and they also

3684
01:57:08,238 --> 01:57:10,638
were in a position to put food in the

3685
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:11,519
table for their kids because they're

3686
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:13,199
uneducated

3687
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:14,719
and the jobs are paying nothing so you

3688
01:57:13,198 --> 01:57:16,319
could understand why emma goldman

3689
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:18,158
alexander berkman prudone

3690
01:57:16,319 --> 01:57:19,599
uh and and all these other figures were

3691
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:22,638
like this is untenable

3692
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:25,520
we see carnegie with 80 000 mansions

3693
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:26,400
whereas this lady whose husband died at

3694
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:28,400
age 30

3695
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:29,598
who's never been to uh high school or

3696
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:31,759
even junior high school

3697
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:33,199
has 10 kids how is she going to put food

3698
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:34,639
in the table it's not going to happen

3699
01:57:33,198 --> 01:57:36,079
you could understand why they would be

3700
01:57:34,639 --> 01:57:36,560
like all right we need to seize this

3701
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:37,840
money

3702
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:39,920
and distribute around the people that

3703
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:40,960
makes a lot of sense in a contemporary

3704
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:43,199
context

3705
01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:45,679
where food is much cheaper where shelter

3706
01:57:43,198 --> 01:57:50,319
to some extent is uh more available

3707
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:50,319
when medical care people we're so

3708
01:57:50,479 --> 01:57:54,399
oblivious to how bad things were that we

3709
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:56,000
see things are bad now so we assume that

3710
01:57:54,399 --> 01:57:58,000
they were better than in some context

3711
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,039
they were much much worse there in many

3712
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,560
contexts so

3713
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:02,158
if you're going to make an argument for

3714
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:03,760
government for me

3715
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:05,598
the strongest argument is like food

3716
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:07,679
stamps or like uh

3717
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:08,639
free lunches for children because i

3718
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:10,960
agree that would be

3719
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:12,560
very inefficient and it's gonna probably

3720
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:13,039
make them obese because you're gonna

3721
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:15,280
have

3722
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:16,479
uh nabisco lobbying to make sure that if

3723
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:18,399
you're gonna have this uh

3724
01:58:16,479 --> 01:58:20,158
protein you wanna you're not gonna give

3725
01:58:18,399 --> 01:58:20,799
the kids an oreo aren't you these kids

3726
01:58:20,158 --> 01:58:22,719
are

3727
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,159
poor you want them to have some pleasure

3728
01:58:22,719 --> 01:58:25,679
and that's gonna have deleterious

3729
01:58:24,158 --> 01:58:27,279
effects but if the choice is an

3730
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:29,920
inefficient government program

3731
01:58:27,279 --> 01:58:31,039
and mass starvation that is one where as

3732
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:32,960
an anarchist i

3733
01:58:31,039 --> 01:58:35,840
i could easily see making the argument

3734
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:35,840
for that one

3735
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:38,960
even though i think very clearly private

3736
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:40,560
charity would be more efficient and

3737
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:41,679
distributed more effectively but i

3738
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:44,000
at that point i don't really care about

3739
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:45,760
efficiency i if you're throwing out food

3740
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,520
to make sure these kids get fed i don't

3741
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:50,239
care so would the

3742
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:52,080
engagement in military conflict be one

3743
01:58:50,238 --> 01:58:55,198
of the biggest

3744
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:58,000
negative things about the state

3745
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:59,678
to you yeah of course war is wars war is

3746
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,880
the state at its worst

3747
01:58:59,679 --> 01:59:02,880
so if we take away

3748
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:08,639
yeah i mean wouldn't that be a huge step

3749
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:10,159
forward yeah instead of regarded

3750
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:12,800
we're always this is what drives me

3751
01:59:10,158 --> 01:59:15,519
crazy we're taught as kids in school

3752
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:16,320
that war is a last resort and i agree

3753
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:18,239
with that

3754
01:59:16,319 --> 01:59:20,238
and yet when you look at the corporate

3755
01:59:18,238 --> 01:59:23,759
press war is always the first

3756
01:59:20,238 --> 01:59:27,359
response and these people do not

3757
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:29,199
talk about what war means they'll show

3758
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:30,479
examples during the bush years of

3759
01:59:29,198 --> 01:59:32,319
soldiers coming home

3760
01:59:30,479 --> 01:59:34,399
in caskets which already is an

3761
01:59:32,319 --> 01:59:36,880
unacceptable price in many cases for me

3762
01:59:34,399 --> 01:59:38,399
but they don't even pretend to care

3763
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:39,920
about the people overseas whose

3764
01:59:38,399 --> 01:59:41,839
countries we've ransacked

3765
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:42,960
and uh lives we've ruined and it's just

3766
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:44,480
like well what are you gonna do not

3767
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:48,158
ransack those countries

3768
01:59:44,479 --> 01:59:49,118
so that war is it to me is the state at

3769
01:59:48,158 --> 01:59:52,238
its worst

3770
01:59:49,118 --> 01:59:54,399
see i think that there is value from

3771
01:59:52,238 --> 01:59:57,198
small government that doesn't engage in

3772
01:59:54,399 --> 01:59:59,118
wars i do think that

3773
01:59:57,198 --> 02:00:00,638
the kind of collectives that you imagine

3774
01:59:59,118 --> 02:00:03,198
functioning well would look

3775
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:04,079
like the best version of government that

3776
02:00:03,198 --> 02:00:06,799
i imagine

3777
02:00:04,079 --> 02:00:08,639
so okay what a great endorsement why i

3778
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:09,840
see them as the same

3779
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:12,000
i think a lot of this is just

3780
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:14,000
terminology i have no problem

3781
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,118
saying that i'm using the word anarchism

3782
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,639
incorrectly and

3783
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:19,279
to go for what you want i have no

3784
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:21,118
problem with that or anything really

3785
02:00:19,279 --> 02:00:23,679
because like i said life is beautiful

3786
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:27,198
but nevertheless

3787
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:29,520
you wrote the essay why i'm not

3788
02:00:27,198 --> 02:00:31,198
not going to vote this time or ever yeah

3789
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:34,080
i think i won't vote this year or

3790
02:00:31,198 --> 02:00:35,839
any other year or any year uh and the

3791
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:37,439
basic i hope you do a better job reading

3792
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:38,840
it than you just read that title

3793
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:39,849
i guess you'll take as many takes as

3794
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:42,159
necessary

3795
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:43,679
[Laughter]

3796
02:00:42,158 --> 02:00:46,158
i'll read it in russian and then pay

3797
02:00:43,679 --> 02:00:47,520
somebody to just translate it

3798
02:00:46,158 --> 02:00:49,759
this isn't even russian at all you just

3799
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:54,080
make up words

3800
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:55,360
where'd you find this guy um you get

3801
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:59,920
what you pay for

3802
02:00:55,359 --> 02:01:03,118
exactly uh this is anarchy

3803
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:04,560
this is what you wanted uh like your

3804
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:08,079
basic summary is

3805
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:10,080
uh let me see if pressed the simplest

3806
02:01:08,079 --> 02:01:10,960
explanation i have for refusing to vote

3807
02:01:10,079 --> 02:01:13,920
is this

3808
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:15,039
i don't vote for the same exact reasons

3809
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:18,560
that i don't take

3810
02:01:15,039 --> 02:01:20,639
communion no matter how admirable he is

3811
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:22,000
or how much i agree with him the pope

3812
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:24,880
isn't the steward

3813
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:27,599
over my soul nor is any president the

3814
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:30,079
leader of my life

3815
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:31,599
this does not make me ignorant or evil

3816
02:01:30,079 --> 02:01:33,439
any more than not being a christian

3817
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:35,679
makes me ignorant to evil

3818
02:01:33,439 --> 02:01:37,598
if i need representation i will hire the

3819
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:41,279
most qualified person to do so

3820
02:01:37,599 --> 02:01:42,880
yeah isn't voting our current best

3821
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:44,639
developed way of hiring the most

3822
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:45,599
qualified person to represent you on

3823
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:48,560
some things

3824
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:50,719
no because because if i have a lawyer

3825
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:52,639
and the lawyer screws up i can fire him

3826
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:54,000
if i vote for someone i don't get who i

3827
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:56,079
want i get for

3828
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,479
who my neighbors want so what that makes

3829
02:01:56,079 --> 02:02:00,880
no sense but representation means

3830
02:01:58,479 --> 02:02:02,000
i want you to speak for me whereas

3831
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:03,679
voting is like

3832
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,118
i kind of want you but i'll take what i

3833
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:07,279
can get and i'm going to take what i

3834
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:09,679
could get regardless of what's the point

3835
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:10,960
what in governance again that's what

3836
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:12,960
with bitcoin

3837
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:14,158
is you want to be represented in

3838
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:16,399
deciding

3839
02:02:14,158 --> 02:02:17,519
what to do but once wait bitcoin isn't

3840
02:02:16,399 --> 02:02:19,039
picking a person

3841
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:20,880
they're not picking a president of

3842
02:02:19,039 --> 02:02:22,319
bitcoin they're picking an idea yeah

3843
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:24,400
it's more like a referendum

3844
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:26,799
right and to me a referendum is much

3845
02:02:24,399 --> 02:02:29,118
more represent is much more coherent

3846
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:30,400
and defensible than it is voting for

3847
02:02:29,118 --> 02:02:32,880
representative because

3848
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:35,198
if i'm voting for joe biden i'm saying

3849
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:36,719
this person speaks for me for abortion

3850
02:02:35,198 --> 02:02:38,319
taxation environmental policy

3851
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:39,840
immigration war right

3852
02:02:38,319 --> 02:02:41,759
the odds that unless you're a complete

3853
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:43,520
npc that this one person

3854
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:45,440
will speak for you for everything and

3855
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:46,960
will and will deliver what he promised

3856
02:02:45,439 --> 02:02:48,960
as and has the power to deliver what he

3857
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:52,560
promised is not true whereas if i have

3858
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:54,239
brexit if i say i want britain to be

3859
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:55,599
remain part of the european union to say

3860
02:02:54,238 --> 02:02:57,919
yes or no question

3861
02:02:55,599 --> 02:03:00,560
that makes a lot more sense to me but

3862
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,599
even that is not pure democracy because

3863
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:03,520
going back to the idea of the

3864
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:05,199
circulation of the elites which james

3865
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:06,239
burnham talked about pareto and moscow

3866
02:03:05,198 --> 02:03:07,919
and all them

3867
02:03:06,238 --> 02:03:10,238
you're still going to have someone

3868
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:12,158
telling you what you can and can't vote

3869
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:14,559
for and how these questions are framed

3870
02:03:12,158 --> 02:03:15,759
so the contradiction to what the left

3871
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,920
anarchist said

3872
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:21,119
some element of hierarchy is always

3873
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:21,118
going to be inevitable

3874
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:26,639
so listen i agree with this aspect

3875
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:28,000
very much so that we should be voting

3876
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:30,960
for ideas and

3877
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,639
issues not voting for leaders for for

3878
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:34,719
leaders to represent us across

3879
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:36,400
the full spectrum of issues right it

3880
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:38,560
seems to make no sense

3881
02:03:36,399 --> 02:03:40,879
okay good man this is great but i do

3882
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:43,520
think there should be

3883
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:45,520
a leader i i do believe in voting for

3884
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:48,000
representatives to

3885
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:48,960
debate to be communicators of ideas to

3886
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,719
us but that you

3887
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:52,239
here's here let me interrupt you but you

3888
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:53,840
can you could you could have those two

3889
02:03:52,238 --> 02:03:54,959
things for example wouldn't this be an

3890
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:56,639
improvement if

3891
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:58,399
they have that now you have a referendum

3892
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:59,359
do you want tax rates to be 30 or 40

3893
02:03:58,399 --> 02:04:01,039
whatever percent yeah

3894
02:03:59,359 --> 02:04:02,719
you have the guy leading the campaign

3895
02:04:01,039 --> 02:04:03,920
for 50. fight for 50.

3896
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:05,760
then you have the lady leading the

3897
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:07,199
campaign for 45 for 40.

3898
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:09,039
they'll go out there they can have

3899
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:10,399
debates they can talk about the issue

3900
02:04:09,039 --> 02:04:12,319
but you're still not voting for one of

3901
02:04:10,399 --> 02:04:14,000
them you're voting for the issue that

3902
02:04:12,319 --> 02:04:15,679
makes much more sense to me

3903
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,359
then i'm going to vote for him and hope

3904
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:18,639
that he puts forward 50 and that depends

3905
02:04:17,359 --> 02:04:20,799
on 99 other senators

3906
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:22,159
exactly and but but also i mean i do

3907
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:24,079
like the idea of voting for certain

3908
02:04:22,158 --> 02:04:25,598
people to debate certain ideas yes

3909
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:27,439
i think that's a major improvement but

3910
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:28,159
the final vote should be based on the

3911
02:04:27,439 --> 02:04:29,919
idea so

3912
02:04:28,158 --> 02:04:31,359
okay so we agree that would be nice to

3913
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:34,239
have plus no wars

3914
02:04:31,359 --> 02:04:34,559
and then then uh you'll stop tweeting so

3915
02:04:34,238 --> 02:04:37,678
uh

3916
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:38,000
aggressively and to decriminalize things

3917
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:40,639
that

3918
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:42,078
don't hurt people drugs crimes drugs

3919
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:44,319
especially prostitution

3920
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:45,118
is a big one if there's and this is me

3921
02:04:44,319 --> 02:04:47,599
talking mr

3922
02:04:45,118 --> 02:04:49,519
mr all cops are criminals there is no

3923
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:50,078
one or or maybe other than like abused

3924
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:52,639
children

3925
02:04:50,078 --> 02:04:54,078
who needs access to the police other

3926
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:56,078
than sex workers

3927
02:04:54,078 --> 02:04:57,599
they're the ones who are the most likely

3928
02:04:56,078 --> 02:04:58,399
to really put themselves in dangerous

3929
02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:00,639
situation

3930
02:04:58,399 --> 02:05:02,078
so they need to be able to call security

3931
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:03,920
because that's why they have pimps

3932
02:05:02,078 --> 02:05:06,000
because you're a woman dealing with some

3933
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:08,000
strange dudes who are

3934
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,760
a lot of the time gonna have weird kinks

3935
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,880
you wanna be able to be sure

3936
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,719
even if you don't approve of

3937
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:14,239
prostitution think it's horrible that

3938
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:15,599
she's not gonna be raped and murdered

3939
02:05:14,238 --> 02:05:17,039
and have no consequences

3940
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:18,639
and if you're gonna say oh well she's a

3941
02:05:17,039 --> 02:05:20,639
prostitute she can't be raped

3942
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:22,480
i uh just think for a second if you're

3943
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:23,599
agreeing to sleep with somebody

3944
02:05:22,479 --> 02:05:24,718
and then he starts choking you and

3945
02:05:23,599 --> 02:05:26,159
beating the crap out of you and saying

3946
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:28,158
it's now it's a dumb situation

3947
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:30,238
that is clearly a beyond the pale

3948
02:05:28,158 --> 02:05:33,439
assault and the same thing with drugs

3949
02:05:30,238 --> 02:05:37,039
uh heroin cocaine do you crack do

3950
02:05:33,439 --> 02:05:38,879
you um the people that need

3951
02:05:37,039 --> 02:05:40,479
help the most are the ones who are

3952
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:41,920
addicted to those drugs even the ones

3953
02:05:40,479 --> 02:05:43,279
who need punishment let's suppose you

3954
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:46,480
think drug dealers should be

3955
02:05:43,279 --> 02:05:47,198
in jail right it is very hard for me to

3956
02:05:46,479 --> 02:05:50,559
say that

3957
02:05:47,198 --> 02:05:52,399
someone who sells uh cocaine should be

3958
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:54,560
treated or in the same building

3959
02:05:52,399 --> 02:05:55,839
as someone who rapes children or is a

3960
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:57,520
murderer these are not

3961
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:59,039
similar types of evil even if you

3962
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:00,159
believe that that drug dealer is an evil

3963
02:05:59,039 --> 02:06:03,439
person

3964
02:06:00,158 --> 02:06:04,960
yeah i have um i mean there's an essay

3965
02:06:03,439 --> 02:06:05,519
in there called by alexander burkman who

3966
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:07,679
is

3967
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:08,800
emma goldman's partner crime on crime on

3968
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:11,039
prisons and crime

3969
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:12,960
and this is leftism at its best for

3970
02:06:11,039 --> 02:06:14,319
getting the person who's forgotten

3971
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:16,000
and the fact that we have the world's

3972
02:06:14,319 --> 02:06:17,439
largest prison population

3973
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,800
the fact that so many people are just

3974
02:06:17,439 --> 02:06:20,479
like oh you commit a crime just put them

3975
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:21,920
in jail throw away the key

3976
02:06:20,479 --> 02:06:24,000
at the very least if you want to be

3977
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:26,158
totally immoral about it's expensive

3978
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,679
and second of all the the concept that

3979
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:28,879
all criminals should be locked in a room

3980
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:30,639
together in these kind of

3981
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:32,400
largely inhuman conditions and that's

3982
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:33,520
going to help people i don't think that

3983
02:06:32,399 --> 02:06:36,319
that's the ideal

3984
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:37,360
mechanism yeah i tend to believe i

3985
02:06:36,319 --> 02:06:39,359
usually don't

3986
02:06:37,359 --> 02:06:40,799
speak so negatively about politicians

3987
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:44,319
but i do think that

3988
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:46,320
politicians have done more evil

3989
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:48,319
in the war on drugs than did the people

3990
02:06:46,319 --> 02:06:49,599
that are supposed to be the criminals

3991
02:06:48,319 --> 02:06:51,198
in this picture and i'll give you one

3992
02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:52,719
another example of how this is the

3993
02:06:51,198 --> 02:06:54,559
anarchist critique of power

3994
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:55,840
hunter biden and i'm not gonna i'm not

3995
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:56,239
making fun of him not taking shots at

3996
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:58,880
him

3997
02:06:56,238 --> 02:07:00,718
he had an article in uh the new yorker

3998
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:02,078
where he talks about when he was in la

3999
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:03,679
he was buying crack

4000
02:07:02,078 --> 02:07:05,759
and there was a misunderstanding or like

4001
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:07,520
he left the crack pipe in the hertz car

4002
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:10,159
and then blah blah there's an issue

4003
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:12,079
he's admitting to a felony in writing to

4004
02:07:10,158 --> 02:07:13,759
a reporter and i'm sure this was within

4005
02:07:12,078 --> 02:07:16,158
the statute of limitations

4006
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:18,159
there was no possibility he was going to

4007
02:07:16,158 --> 02:07:19,039
have consequences kamala harris who was

4008
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:20,559
a cop

4009
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:22,158
talked about when she was in college

4010
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:24,480
through smoking weed

4011
02:07:22,158 --> 02:07:26,559
and it's like i don't begrudge you guys

4012
02:07:24,479 --> 02:07:27,198
smoking your crack or smoking your weed

4013
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:29,679
but

4014
02:07:27,198 --> 02:07:30,479
for other people who are poor or maybe

4015
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:32,639
just had the

4016
02:07:30,479 --> 02:07:34,078
short end the stick this is years of

4017
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:36,078
their life being

4018
02:07:34,078 --> 02:07:37,599
uh destroyed at the very least even a

4019
02:07:36,078 --> 02:07:39,920
rest is a traumatic situation

4020
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:41,440
yeah if you have a weed or cocaine or

4021
02:07:39,920 --> 02:07:42,399
crack you're arrested that's really

4022
02:07:41,439 --> 02:07:43,839
going to screw up

4023
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:45,759
it's going to do a number on you being

4024
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:47,440
locked up so to have that double

4025
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:48,560
standard to me is completely

4026
02:07:47,439 --> 02:07:50,000
unacceptable

4027
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:52,079
and that has nothing to do with

4028
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,279
republican or democrat that george w

4029
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:55,519
bush was

4030
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:57,198
i i coke head back in the day he talks

4031
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:59,280
about overcoming his addiction and i'm

4032
02:07:57,198 --> 02:08:01,519
glad that he did more power to him

4033
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:03,599
but just to have this kind of you know

4034
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:05,599
it's just really kind of um disturbing

4035
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:07,199
to me and this is my anarchist brain

4036
02:08:05,599 --> 02:08:08,480
like how prevalent drug use is in

4037
02:08:07,198 --> 02:08:10,000
college there's that i think this joke

4038
02:08:08,479 --> 02:08:11,279
on south park like there's a time and a

4039
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,800
place to try drugs and that's called

4040
02:08:11,279 --> 02:08:14,639
college where people experiment

4041
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:16,719
but all those college kids which are

4042
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:18,960
going to become next generations elite

4043
02:08:16,719 --> 02:08:20,480
don't really have that worry that if

4044
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:21,359
they get caught then anything's going to

4045
02:08:20,479 --> 02:08:23,598
happen to them

4046
02:08:21,359 --> 02:08:24,880
but that kid in the street uh who did

4047
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:27,360
not have that good upbringing

4048
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:28,800
even if he's a piece of crap like he's

4049
02:08:27,359 --> 02:08:30,639
not gonna have a different punishment i

4050
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:34,000
i think that's just really

4051
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:35,520
that is based on american so in contrast

4052
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,198
to tolstoy

4053
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:38,960
let me ask you about emma goldman you

4054
02:08:37,198 --> 02:08:42,000
wrote that uh

4055
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:44,319
if anarchism believed in rulers then

4056
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,319
emma goldman would be the undisputed

4057
02:08:44,319 --> 02:08:49,840
queen yes

4058
02:08:46,319 --> 02:08:50,719
what uh ideas define her flavor of

4059
02:08:49,840 --> 02:08:53,920
anarchism

4060
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:57,118
would you say emma was really

4061
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:58,719
an old-school radical she was a radical

4062
02:08:57,118 --> 02:09:00,319
among radicals

4063
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:02,480
i don't know what ideas i mean what

4064
02:09:00,319 --> 02:09:05,039
would diabetes find her was anarchism

4065
02:09:02,479 --> 02:09:06,078
obviously there's the violence i mean

4066
02:09:05,039 --> 02:09:09,279
she was more

4067
02:09:06,078 --> 02:09:12,158
open to the idea of violent opposition

4068
02:09:09,279 --> 02:09:14,479
versus somebody like tolstoy oh sure for

4069
02:09:12,158 --> 02:09:16,000
sure so basically emma and alexander

4070
02:09:14,479 --> 02:09:17,039
berkman their mentor was someone named

4071
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,158
johan most

4072
02:09:17,039 --> 02:09:21,760
and johan most was a very early free

4073
02:09:20,158 --> 02:09:23,279
speech not very early but he was a free

4074
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:24,560
speech concern because he published a

4075
02:09:23,279 --> 02:09:26,719
pamphlet in europe

4076
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:28,159
that was translated in the states about

4077
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:30,319
how to build dynamite

4078
02:09:28,158 --> 02:09:31,679
because his idea was all right you have

4079
02:09:30,319 --> 02:09:33,198
this oppressive government this

4080
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:36,319
oppressive police force

4081
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:38,399
that use batons and bolts against us the

4082
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:39,759
only way for us as the working class to

4083
02:09:38,399 --> 02:09:41,519
level the playing field

4084
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:43,760
is through dynamite and here's how you

4085
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:45,040
build it so the question is all right is

4086
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:46,079
this something that could be allowed to

4087
02:09:45,039 --> 02:09:47,920
be legal

4088
02:09:46,078 --> 02:09:50,158
now that you're allowing the layman to

4089
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:53,520
in his own house build bombs

4090
02:09:50,158 --> 02:09:55,039
so uh johann most turn basically they

4091
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:57,040
had a big parting of ways

4092
02:09:55,039 --> 02:09:58,158
because when alexander berkman tried to

4093
02:09:57,039 --> 02:10:01,439
assassinate uh

4094
02:09:58,158 --> 02:10:03,598
frick johann said no no this is not uh

4095
02:10:01,439 --> 02:10:05,678
something i'm for and in fact they

4096
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:07,440
thought uh with this assassination this

4097
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:09,279
failed assassination this would be the

4098
02:10:07,439 --> 02:10:10,319
thing that's fired off the revolution

4099
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:12,000
because you have this strike the

4100
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:12,479
pinkerton's interval pinker's getting

4101
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,238
killed

4102
02:10:12,479 --> 02:10:15,519
strikers are getting killed you know

4103
02:10:14,238 --> 02:10:17,198
this is what marx predicted

4104
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:18,719
you know they're gonna light the spark

4105
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:20,319
and everything's come falling down

4106
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:22,158
he ends up going to jail for 13 years

4107
02:10:20,319 --> 02:10:25,359
instead alexander berkman does

4108
02:10:22,158 --> 02:10:25,759
uh and then goldman and berkman had a

4109
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:28,319
big

4110
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:30,159
issue because when leon salgaz killed

4111
02:10:28,319 --> 02:10:32,000
mckinley in 1901

4112
02:10:30,158 --> 02:10:33,519
it was really it's kind of humorous in

4113
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,800
retrospect he gets arrested and they're

4114
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:35,199
like why'd you kill the president he

4115
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:36,960
goes

4116
02:10:35,198 --> 02:10:38,319
i was radicalized by emma goldman and

4117
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:40,319
she's like god damn it

4118
02:10:38,319 --> 02:10:42,158
so she's on the run she's like i don't

4119
02:10:40,319 --> 02:10:45,198
even know this guy

4120
02:10:42,158 --> 02:10:46,719
and she made the point about like

4121
02:10:45,198 --> 02:10:48,960
why is it worse than the president being

4122
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:50,719
killed and somebody else we're all equal

4123
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:52,639
and you would think if you're against

4124
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:53,920
capitalism against the ruling class this

4125
02:10:52,639 --> 02:10:56,719
would be your first target

4126
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:57,599
but berkman who went to jail who was

4127
02:10:56,719 --> 02:11:00,399
tried

4128
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:02,480
to assassinate someone he had said

4129
02:11:00,399 --> 02:11:04,238
mckinley this is your villain he's just

4130
02:11:02,479 --> 02:11:04,959
a party hack he's like a symptom of the

4131
02:11:04,238 --> 02:11:07,198
times he's

4132
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:09,279
this is this is foolish and goldman

4133
02:11:07,198 --> 02:11:12,319
disagreed with him she thought it wasn't

4134
02:11:09,279 --> 02:11:13,039
necessarily um justified but it may have

4135
02:11:12,319 --> 02:11:15,118
done

4136
02:11:13,039 --> 02:11:16,399
something that was defensible so the

4137
02:11:15,118 --> 02:11:18,000
three of them uh

4138
02:11:16,399 --> 02:11:20,078
you know had their differences on the

4139
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,520
use of violence and in fact when she

4140
02:11:20,078 --> 02:11:23,198
came back from russia

4141
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:24,560
and was denouncing it in her book my

4142
02:11:23,198 --> 02:11:25,519
disillusionment russia and my further

4143
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:28,000
solution rostra

4144
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:29,679
the last chapter she goes look i'm not

4145
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,118
saying i'm against violence

4146
02:11:29,679 --> 02:11:32,719
when there's the revolution comes we're

4147
02:11:31,118 --> 02:11:35,039
gonna have to use force she goes

4148
02:11:32,719 --> 02:11:36,560
but it's not the force of the state

4149
02:11:35,039 --> 02:11:37,920
against the working class against the

4150
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:39,520
masses this is exactly what we're

4151
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:42,880
opposed to this is a complete

4152
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:44,800
obscenity to our principle so that was

4153
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:47,440
interesting the fact that she was a uh

4154
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:49,360
her periodical mother earth was a

4155
02:11:47,439 --> 02:11:51,118
clearing house for many prominent

4156
02:11:49,359 --> 02:11:52,319
uh you know ideas of the day that

4157
02:11:51,118 --> 02:11:54,000
weren't anarchists but were certainly

4158
02:11:52,319 --> 02:11:55,679
radical so she was a bit and also she

4159
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,920
was like tiny she was like 5-1

4160
02:11:55,679 --> 02:11:58,800
so to have this little woman who was so

4161
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:01,359
feisty

4162
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:02,079
um and talk back to lennon talk back to

4163
02:12:01,359 --> 02:12:04,000
lennon

4164
02:12:02,078 --> 02:12:05,519
uh would she took on lennon woodrow

4165
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
wilson jander hoover was the one who

4166
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,119
deported

4167
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,399
her uh someone who just and the thing is

4168
02:12:09,118 --> 02:12:13,198
you have to be careful

4169
02:12:10,399 --> 02:12:14,799
because i think just like war it's very

4170
02:12:13,198 --> 02:12:17,519
easy to glamorize

4171
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:19,360
violence and to regard it as something

4172
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:20,320
admirable or heroic like you're fighting

4173
02:12:19,359 --> 02:12:21,279
for the cause

4174
02:12:20,319 --> 02:12:23,599
but if you take it out of the

4175
02:12:21,279 --> 02:12:25,599
romanticism you're like you're killing

4176
02:12:23,599 --> 02:12:27,039
someone who had kids you are you know

4177
02:12:25,599 --> 02:12:29,119
killing someone with the family

4178
02:12:27,039 --> 02:12:30,800
you're making your if you're gonna shoot

4179
02:12:29,118 --> 02:12:31,920
someone they're probably gonna retaliate

4180
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:33,760
twice as hard

4181
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:35,520
violence sings its own song and this is

4182
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:36,000
a very dangerous word you're going down

4183
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:38,719
so

4184
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:40,000
you you really need to be uh careful

4185
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:40,560
about what you're what you're preaching

4186
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,880
here

4187
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:44,320
um and you know she kind of had this

4188
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:46,480
mixed feelings about it but

4189
02:12:44,319 --> 02:12:47,359
that is certainly not uh emma goldman

4190
02:12:46,479 --> 02:12:50,399
her best

4191
02:12:47,359 --> 02:12:53,359
emma goldman her best was about the

4192
02:12:50,399 --> 02:12:55,279
ultimate freedom of the individual of

4193
02:12:53,359 --> 02:12:56,000
caring about people who were desperately

4194
02:12:55,279 --> 02:12:58,399
poor

4195
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:00,719
who despised the corporate idea that we

4196
02:12:58,399 --> 02:13:02,479
all had to be made into cookie cutters

4197
02:13:00,719 --> 02:13:03,840
and be interchangeable and all have to

4198
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:06,000
start work at the same time

4199
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:07,520
and basically our entire lives slave for

4200
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,920
corporation that have nothing to show

4201
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:09,520
for it

4202
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:11,760
while they get wealthy and you you have

4203
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:14,239
no opportunity for either uh

4204
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:16,000
productive work or creative work so uh

4205
02:13:14,238 --> 02:13:18,559
that i think the valorization

4206
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:20,319
of kind of the lowest of the low is

4207
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:22,079
something i find very admirable there's

4208
02:13:20,319 --> 02:13:23,920
a quote of hers which i think

4209
02:13:22,078 --> 02:13:25,679
even for those of us who are you know

4210
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:27,599
for property rights

4211
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:28,719
is anarchy left anarchism at its best

4212
02:13:27,599 --> 02:13:31,360
but she goes

4213
02:13:28,719 --> 02:13:32,000
go and ask for work if they don't give

4214
02:13:31,359 --> 02:13:33,920
you work

4215
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,039
ask for bread if they don't give you

4216
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:36,560
bread take bread

4217
02:13:35,039 --> 02:13:38,319
so the idea that like if you're that

4218
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:39,760
poor and you're honestly trying to work

4219
02:13:38,319 --> 02:13:42,319
and work isn't available

4220
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:44,000
and you steal food to keep alive that

4221
02:13:42,319 --> 02:13:45,759
you shouldn't feel guilt about it

4222
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,599
i don't know that i would disagree with

4223
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:49,440
that i i think that there's something to

4224
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:50,078
be said at that point where it's just

4225
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:51,678
like

4226
02:13:50,078 --> 02:13:53,279
you know if property rights come between

4227
02:13:51,679 --> 02:13:54,960
that and mass starvation

4228
02:13:53,279 --> 02:13:56,559
it's gonna be very hard for anyone to

4229
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:57,359
make the case for property rights now my

4230
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:59,039
argument is

4231
02:13:57,359 --> 02:14:00,960
when you have free enterprise food

4232
02:13:59,039 --> 02:14:01,679
becomes so plentiful that now obesity is

4233
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:03,439
an issue

4234
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:04,880
but at the time she did not of course

4235
02:14:03,439 --> 02:14:07,678
have that data to

4236
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:08,400
you know access is there somebody you

4237
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:10,239
left out

4238
02:14:08,399 --> 02:14:11,519
from the book that you thought about

4239
02:14:10,238 --> 02:14:14,559
leaving in

4240
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:17,360
like uh some interesting figures

4241
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:18,800
yeah there there's a couple so um

4242
02:14:17,359 --> 02:14:20,238
chomsky would have been one

4243
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:21,679
of course because he's a you know one

4244
02:14:20,238 --> 02:14:22,718
he's probably the biggest standard

4245
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:24,840
because one of the biggest anarchist

4246
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:27,840
thinkers in contemporary times

4247
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:29,840
um i was on the fence about herbert

4248
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:31,199
spencer because he's not an anarchist

4249
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:33,039
chris williamson is reading the chapter

4250
02:14:31,198 --> 02:14:34,078
for the book he coined the term survival

4251
02:14:33,039 --> 02:14:35,519
of the fittest and the

4252
02:14:34,078 --> 02:14:37,599
chapters called the right to ignore the

4253
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:39,199
state from his book social statics it

4254
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:40,719
was deleted from later editions people

4255
02:14:39,198 --> 02:14:44,319
found it and reprinted it

4256
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:46,319
um and uh

4257
02:14:44,319 --> 02:14:48,479
randolph-born he was an early

4258
02:14:46,319 --> 02:14:50,479
progressive he was the only one or one

4259
02:14:48,479 --> 02:14:51,519
the very few fighting against entering

4260
02:14:50,479 --> 02:14:53,198
the great war

4261
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:55,199
and he had an essay called war is the

4262
02:14:53,198 --> 02:14:55,919
health of the state which is basically

4263
02:14:55,198 --> 02:14:57,759
about how

4264
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:59,359
states love war because it gives them an

4265
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:01,119
excuse to increase their power

4266
02:14:59,359 --> 02:15:03,039
and it's very hard to argue against

4267
02:15:01,118 --> 02:15:04,479
increasing state power in a time of war

4268
02:15:03,039 --> 02:15:06,479
but since he was not himself an

4269
02:15:04,479 --> 02:15:07,279
anarchist and there was plenty anti-war

4270
02:15:06,479 --> 02:15:08,638
in there already

4271
02:15:07,279 --> 02:15:10,880
i didn't include him but those would be

4272
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:14,159
the ones is there some people that

4273
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:15,039
you think uh the public would be

4274
02:15:14,158 --> 02:15:17,118
surprised

4275
02:15:15,039 --> 02:15:19,439
to learn that they are at least in part

4276
02:15:17,118 --> 02:15:21,279
anarchists like i saw that howard zinn

4277
02:15:19,439 --> 02:15:23,678
is supposed to be an anarchist

4278
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:24,800
i mean is there um like just like

4279
02:15:23,679 --> 02:15:26,399
tolstoy isn't it

4280
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:28,560
anarchist is there some people like that

4281
02:15:26,399 --> 02:15:30,238
that you think in our modern life

4282
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:32,400
that would be surprised to learn their

4283
02:15:30,238 --> 02:15:33,359
anarchists i can't think of any off the

4284
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:35,920
top of my

4285
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:37,598
head i mean you could say carl hess who

4286
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:39,359
was like barry goldwater speechwriter

4287
02:15:37,599 --> 02:15:40,159
from the 964 campaign but he's hardly a

4288
02:15:39,359 --> 02:15:44,319
household name

4289
02:15:40,158 --> 02:15:46,960
yeah um i mean i think a lot of people

4290
02:15:44,319 --> 02:15:48,158
would not ascribe to that term but are

4291
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:50,639
certainly informed

4292
02:15:48,158 --> 02:15:51,279
with this complete distrust of all

4293
02:15:50,639 --> 02:15:53,199
authority

4294
02:15:51,279 --> 02:15:54,719
murray rothbard had an essay if i didn't

4295
02:15:53,198 --> 02:15:56,000
include anatomy of the state i was going

4296
02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:56,960
to include this one it's much much

4297
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:59,198
shorter

4298
02:15:56,960 --> 02:16:00,480
and his question was who are our allies

4299
02:15:59,198 --> 02:16:02,719
and who are enemies

4300
02:16:00,479 --> 02:16:04,000
and the point he makes is there's lots

4301
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:06,560
of people who would call themselves

4302
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:07,359
anarchists who are of little use whereas

4303
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:08,880
someone who

4304
02:16:07,359 --> 02:16:10,719
is still like a minor kisser for

4305
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:11,279
government but genuinely hates the

4306
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:13,840
question

4307
02:16:11,279 --> 02:16:15,198
rothbard had is if there's a button and

4308
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:16,719
you could press that you would end the

4309
02:16:15,198 --> 02:16:18,078
state would you press it so fast your

4310
02:16:16,719 --> 02:16:20,319
finger would get a blister

4311
02:16:18,078 --> 02:16:22,000
those are allies even if they're uh you

4312
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:24,719
know somewhat of a minericus

4313
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:25,920
so i think that is a kind of a better

4314
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:27,840
lens of looking at it

4315
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:30,960
and i don't think anyone needs to really

4316
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:33,200
ascribe to anarchism as a whole ideology

4317
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:35,599
insofar as you're seeing right now many

4318
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:38,079
people in certain fringe elements

4319
02:16:35,599 --> 02:16:39,439
are just essentially or are decreasingly

4320
02:16:38,079 --> 02:16:40,239
fringe and increasing mainstream

4321
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:43,439
elements

4322
02:16:40,239 --> 02:16:45,199
are realizing that this idea that

4323
02:16:43,439 --> 02:16:46,880
whatever the state does is somehow

4324
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:48,800
morally binding or legitimate

4325
02:16:46,879 --> 02:16:50,959
is something that a b at least bears

4326
02:16:48,799 --> 02:16:53,599
strong questioning

4327
02:16:50,959 --> 02:16:54,079
sure and i mean i i guess there's a lot

4328
02:16:53,599 --> 02:16:56,719
of

4329
02:16:54,079 --> 02:16:57,280
groups like the libertarians for example

4330
02:16:56,718 --> 02:16:59,839
sure have

4331
02:16:57,280 --> 02:17:01,519
some element of that oh sure for sure of

4332
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:03,760
harsh questioning of the ways

4333
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:05,040
of government and also i think what's

4334
02:17:03,760 --> 02:17:07,120
what i love

4335
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:08,639
i mean if there's one issue where i

4336
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:10,399
would want people to have this kind of

4337
02:17:08,638 --> 02:17:13,279
analysis it is war

4338
02:17:10,398 --> 02:17:13,599
and it is like okay are you really sure

4339
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:15,359
uh

4340
02:17:13,599 --> 02:17:17,599
because this is a hundred percent gonna

4341
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:19,840
result in a lot of people being killed

4342
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:22,159
a lot of people being traumatized a lot

4343
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:24,478
of people who are never gonna recover

4344
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:26,558
children innocent people are you really

4345
02:17:24,478 --> 02:17:28,558
sure this is the right thing to do

4346
02:17:26,558 --> 02:17:30,638
and i think a lot of times if the answer

4347
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:33,279
is well it's the profitable thing to do

4348
02:17:30,638 --> 02:17:34,159
and that is i think again government at

4349
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:37,200
its absolute

4350
02:17:34,159 --> 02:17:40,318
most venal and worst

4351
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:41,120
you michael mouse in many ways are a new

4352
02:17:40,318 --> 02:17:43,599
yorker

4353
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:45,040
oh yes i'll give you one example i don't

4354
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:46,880
know where austin is on the map

4355
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:49,840
no idea not even kidding but does it

4356
02:17:46,879 --> 02:17:52,159
even matter it doesn't matter

4357
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:54,318
but nevertheless you've decided to move

4358
02:17:52,159 --> 02:17:56,159
to austin yes

4359
02:17:54,318 --> 02:17:57,359
why do you think you're moving to austin

4360
02:17:56,159 --> 02:18:00,558
or why do you moving

4361
02:17:57,359 --> 02:18:03,599
both to austin and away from new york

4362
02:18:00,558 --> 02:18:04,638
this was one of the both i hate it when

4363
02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:05,359
people talk like this but i'm gonna do

4364
02:18:04,638 --> 02:18:07,119
it anyway

4365
02:18:05,359 --> 02:18:08,719
this was one of the hardest and easiest

4366
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:10,479
decisions of my life

4367
02:18:08,718 --> 02:18:12,318
it was hard because i've lived in new

4368
02:18:10,478 --> 02:18:14,000
york since i was two

4369
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:16,000
other than college it's the only home

4370
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:18,239
i've known i know it intimately

4371
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,638
i know all the cool spots i love it with

4372
02:18:18,239 --> 02:18:22,799
every fiber of my being or i did

4373
02:18:20,638 --> 02:18:24,638
it was very much you know ingrained in

4374
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:26,398
my personality my outlook

4375
02:18:24,638 --> 02:18:28,159
about what cities can be and can't be

4376
02:18:26,398 --> 02:18:31,358
and should be and shouldn't be

4377
02:18:28,159 --> 02:18:34,239
um deciding to move was not done

4378
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:36,000
but when you see your crew your your you

4379
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:39,119
know chosen family one

4380
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,159
by one whittling away it's not easy um

4381
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:41,840
they all left

4382
02:18:40,159 --> 02:18:44,318
uh there's just a couple of us left in

4383
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:46,079
new york and

4384
02:18:44,318 --> 02:18:47,439
i don't see any mechanism by which new

4385
02:18:46,079 --> 02:18:48,638
york is going to improve things are

4386
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:50,239
getting much worse

4387
02:18:48,638 --> 02:18:52,879
all the time it's just completely

4388
02:18:50,239 --> 02:18:55,199
outrageous here i would have a

4389
02:18:52,879 --> 02:18:56,638
i have a huge crew i didn't realize how

4390
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:58,000
much cheaper real estate is

4391
02:18:56,638 --> 02:18:59,438
than in new york this is another way

4392
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,558
many so new yorkers are the most

4393
02:18:59,439 --> 02:19:01,840
provincial people on earth who are

4394
02:19:00,558 --> 02:19:02,478
completely oblivious to the rest of the

4395
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:03,920
country

4396
02:19:02,478 --> 02:19:05,679
so for a long time the argument was new

4397
02:19:03,920 --> 02:19:06,478
york versus l.a right for certain types

4398
02:19:05,679 --> 02:19:08,398
of people

4399
02:19:06,478 --> 02:19:10,000
and they would say la's cheaper in terms

4400
02:19:08,398 --> 02:19:12,000
of rent so new york let's suppose the

4401
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:13,359
rent is a thousand la was 700 but you'd

4402
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,318
have to get a car i'm like this is kind

4403
02:19:13,359 --> 02:19:17,040
of a wash

4404
02:19:14,318 --> 02:19:18,239
so i assumed austin would be like 80 of

4405
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:19,840
new york prices

4406
02:19:18,239 --> 02:19:21,439
and i'm looking at these houses and for

4407
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:23,359
like 700 000

4408
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:25,359
you could get a house here that would

4409
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:27,200
cost like 3.5 million in new york

4410
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:28,800
yeah so and you could have a gun and

4411
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:30,639
it's just like i could have a yard

4412
02:19:28,799 --> 02:19:32,718
and i could have a dog and i have a

4413
02:19:30,638 --> 02:19:34,239
three bedroom and i could have you know

4414
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:37,678
aquariums and my

4415
02:19:34,239 --> 02:19:41,519
weird plants so to have all that and

4416
02:19:37,679 --> 02:19:44,558
it's just to have i am very very

4417
02:19:41,519 --> 02:19:46,719
lucky that i have such a supportive crew

4418
02:19:44,558 --> 02:19:48,318
and they're also very smart because they

4419
02:19:46,718 --> 02:19:50,799
sat me down and they said

4420
02:19:48,318 --> 02:19:51,439
whatever excuse you have not to move

4421
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:53,199
here

4422
02:19:51,439 --> 02:19:54,720
we are going to make sure that doesn't

4423
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:57,040
count so my buddy matt

4424
02:19:54,719 --> 02:19:59,199
said because i have a huge library he

4425
02:19:57,040 --> 02:20:01,200
goes i will go to your house

4426
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:02,640
and i will pack every single book you

4427
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:04,240
own myself

4428
02:20:02,639 --> 02:20:05,920
so you can get that as an excuse out of

4429
02:20:04,239 --> 02:20:06,879
the way i don't know how to drive near

4430
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:08,879
this uku

4431
02:20:06,879 --> 02:20:10,000
um she's like we're gonna take driving

4432
02:20:08,879 --> 02:20:12,959
lessons together

4433
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:14,478
there goes that excuse uh how do i find

4434
02:20:12,959 --> 02:20:16,639
an apartment they're like

4435
02:20:14,478 --> 02:20:18,159
we'll go to with the realtor we'll take

4436
02:20:16,639 --> 02:20:19,358
pictures for you we'll report back you

4437
02:20:18,159 --> 02:20:20,799
could trust our judgment

4438
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:22,318
and i'm like that's very i would do that

4439
02:20:20,799 --> 02:20:23,119
that sounds like fun shopping for house

4440
02:20:22,318 --> 02:20:25,359
i'd have to buy them

4441
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:26,240
yeah then matt just yesterday had the

4442
02:20:25,359 --> 02:20:29,439
idea goes

4443
02:20:26,239 --> 02:20:30,879
come here rent a furnished apartment

4444
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:33,040
for a few months you don't have the

4445
02:20:30,879 --> 02:20:34,398
pressure of buying and it's just

4446
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:36,080
it's going to be an easy transition the

4447
02:20:34,398 --> 02:20:38,159
rent's not going to be anything compared

4448
02:20:36,079 --> 02:20:40,879
to new york i'm like these are all

4449
02:20:38,159 --> 02:20:42,559
very valid things you're here lots of

4450
02:20:40,879 --> 02:20:45,679
other people by the way that's what this

4451
02:20:42,559 --> 02:20:48,000
is is uh i made sure that's

4452
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:49,200
renting month to month oh this is rental

4453
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,478
this is rental

4454
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:52,479
well you didn't realize this i thought

4455
02:20:50,478 --> 02:20:53,199
you bought this no no no it was a rent

4456
02:20:52,478 --> 02:20:55,199
to hawk

4457
02:20:53,200 --> 02:20:56,960
why i thought you bought it no it's

4458
02:20:55,200 --> 02:21:01,280
rental well i really value

4459
02:20:56,959 --> 02:21:02,639
freedom so who are you talking to

4460
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:03,290
i've heard this thing freedom it's

4461
02:21:02,639 --> 02:21:05,199
really great

4462
02:21:03,290 --> 02:21:07,600
[Laughter]

4463
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:08,880
but not everybody the implementation of

4464
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:12,239
freedom is different for everybody

4465
02:21:08,879 --> 02:21:14,318
of course for me i i don't want to

4466
02:21:12,239 --> 02:21:15,600
uh make a statement about others i'll

4467
02:21:14,318 --> 02:21:18,719
just speak for myself

4468
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:21,760
i think when you buy a house that is not

4469
02:21:18,719 --> 02:21:23,599
just a wise financial decision

4470
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:25,359
or all those kinds of reasons that

4471
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:26,239
people have investment all those kinds

4472
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:29,439
of things

4473
02:21:26,239 --> 02:21:31,600
i think it's also a hit on your freedom

4474
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:32,880
because the positive way to frame that

4475
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:35,439
is you make it a home

4476
02:21:32,879 --> 02:21:37,438
you have a deep connection to it but the

4477
02:21:35,439 --> 02:21:39,600
negative way to frame it is

4478
02:21:37,439 --> 02:21:40,960
you're now a little bit stuck there yeah

4479
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:44,000
and you may stay there way

4480
02:21:40,959 --> 02:21:45,679
longer than you should when much better

4481
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,000
opportunities for life

4482
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:49,439
come up there are stages in life when

4483
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,959
you're not sure exactly what the future

4484
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:52,479
will hold i would argue that's very

4485
02:21:50,959 --> 02:21:54,959
often the case

4486
02:21:52,478 --> 02:21:56,478
uh basically at every stage in life and

4487
02:21:54,959 --> 02:21:58,000
i just want to make sure i maximize the

4488
02:21:56,478 --> 02:22:01,760
freedom

4489
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:04,000
to uh to embrace the most ambitious

4490
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:04,960
the uh the craziest the wildest the most

4491
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:07,359
beautiful

4492
02:22:04,959 --> 02:22:08,000
opportunities that come by you've

4493
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:09,680
actually brought this

4494
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,280
up to because i i said i really enjoyed

4495
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:14,479
the conversation with you and

4496
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:17,600
euron yeah like you

4497
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:18,719
talking to you and somebody else

4498
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:20,800
yeah i think you make a really

4499
02:22:18,719 --> 02:22:21,599
significant effort you've said this

4500
02:22:20,799 --> 02:22:23,679
before but

4501
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:25,439
it really is true and it stands in

4502
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:26,639
contrast to

4503
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:29,040
other folks who are also good

4504
02:22:26,639 --> 02:22:31,039
conversation you really make an effort

4505
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:33,120
for that person like to unders like to

4506
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:35,280
meet the person oh for sure

4507
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:37,280
and that's uh you made me you made me

4508
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:40,399
realize it's kind of a

4509
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:44,079
uh it's an art form uh

4510
02:22:40,398 --> 02:22:45,199
but it's also just it's a thing worth

4511
02:22:44,079 --> 02:22:48,239
doing

4512
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:50,560
of putting in that effort and that leap

4513
02:22:48,239 --> 02:22:52,398
of humanity to like reach the whether

4514
02:22:50,559 --> 02:22:56,159
you're talking to dave rubin

4515
02:22:52,398 --> 02:22:58,079
or alex jones or joe or me

4516
02:22:56,159 --> 02:23:00,000
just yeah those are different human

4517
02:22:58,079 --> 02:23:01,039
beings and they're taking that leap it's

4518
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:03,200
it's fascinating i mean

4519
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:04,080
do you have um how do you think about

4520
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:06,560
that

4521
02:23:04,079 --> 02:23:07,439
i i'm a huge introvert as as you are i

4522
02:23:06,559 --> 02:23:12,478
think

4523
02:23:07,439 --> 02:23:15,600
um i i feel very very very lucky

4524
02:23:12,478 --> 02:23:18,478
that i get to get on a mic

4525
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:19,920
and run my mouth and for some people

4526
02:23:18,478 --> 02:23:23,039
some reason people like this

4527
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:25,760
so i know

4528
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:26,960
what it's like to have a good convo and

4529
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:27,840
i know what it's like to have a bad

4530
02:23:26,959 --> 02:23:30,559
convo

4531
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:32,239
so before i'll do a show i will have

4532
02:23:30,559 --> 02:23:33,680
like some

4533
02:23:32,239 --> 02:23:34,959
things i would want to talk about and

4534
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:36,239
then i'll think about how to say them in

4535
02:23:34,959 --> 02:23:38,478
an engaging way

4536
02:23:36,239 --> 02:23:39,680
so i do my homework in that regard i'm

4537
02:23:38,478 --> 02:23:42,478
also very

4538
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:45,040
good at or i pride myself at taking

4539
02:23:42,478 --> 02:23:47,358
people who are cerebral or intellectual

4540
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:49,520
and making them a little bit silly but

4541
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:51,359
also making them feel safe to be silly

4542
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:52,960
because i'm not going to be making a

4543
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:55,200
buffoon of them that we're having

4544
02:23:52,959 --> 02:23:56,879
fun as opposed to disrespecting the

4545
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:57,520
person i think we all saw that with

4546
02:23:56,879 --> 02:23:59,839
yaran

4547
02:23:57,520 --> 02:24:01,280
who's very cerebral very serious but we

4548
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:03,920
were all cracking jokes

4549
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:05,600
um and he was having a good time and he

4550
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:06,559
knew even if i'm making fun of him to

4551
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:08,399
his face

4552
02:24:06,559 --> 02:24:09,920
it is coming from a place of kindness

4553
02:24:08,398 --> 02:24:10,959
and he's in on the joke and we're all

4554
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:14,318
having fun

4555
02:24:10,959 --> 02:24:16,799
that is something i try to do as

4556
02:24:14,318 --> 02:24:18,159
uh much as possible i had an episode of

4557
02:24:16,799 --> 02:24:20,000
my show

4558
02:24:18,159 --> 02:24:21,359
a couple of weeks ago and someone who's

4559
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,959
been a friend of mine for a long time

4560
02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:23,840
and someone i admire a lot elizabeth

4561
02:24:22,959 --> 02:24:26,318
spyers

4562
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:27,680
she was the founding member of um gog

4563
02:24:26,318 --> 02:24:29,039
founding editor of gawker

4564
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:30,960
you know she's she's worked for the

4565
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:32,960
observer for jared kushner she's her

4566
02:24:30,959 --> 02:24:34,318
resume's second to none and she was on

4567
02:24:32,959 --> 02:24:36,639
my show and she was talking

4568
02:24:34,318 --> 02:24:37,760
you know her politics are pretty

4569
02:24:36,639 --> 02:24:38,799
straightforward like corporate

4570
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:41,280
journalist blue pill

4571
02:24:38,799 --> 02:24:42,959
politics and my audience was very upset

4572
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:44,159
that i wasn't pushing back or like

4573
02:24:42,959 --> 02:24:47,119
whatever i'm like

4574
02:24:44,159 --> 02:24:48,398
my job if someone is coming to a place

4575
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:49,840
where like the audience is at least

4576
02:24:48,398 --> 02:24:52,079
going to be somewhat hostile

4577
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:53,520
is not to make her have negative

4578
02:24:52,079 --> 02:24:55,359
consequences

4579
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:58,000
for doing something that she didn't need

4580
02:24:55,359 --> 02:24:58,800
to do my job is to make sure that the

4581
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,079
experience

4582
02:24:58,799 --> 02:25:03,358
is a positive one for her as the host so

4583
02:25:02,079 --> 02:25:06,079
when i'm the guest

4584
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:07,200
i always feel that my job is to make the

4585
02:25:06,079 --> 02:25:08,719
host look good

4586
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:10,640
and make the host not feel like it's

4587
02:25:08,719 --> 02:25:12,159
work and the audience really likes that

4588
02:25:10,639 --> 02:25:14,559
because instead of it being an interview

4589
02:25:12,159 --> 02:25:14,959
or intense it is a conversation nine of

4590
02:25:14,559 --> 02:25:17,039
us know

4591
02:25:14,959 --> 02:25:18,879
what's going to happen and so this is

4592
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:21,600
something i think about a fair amount

4593
02:25:18,879 --> 02:25:22,639
and i try to apply and insofar as it

4594
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:24,880
successfully

4595
02:25:22,639 --> 02:25:26,239
i'm delighted and there's times when

4596
02:25:24,879 --> 02:25:26,719
it's not successful and that's a shame

4597
02:25:26,239 --> 02:25:29,199
but

4598
02:25:26,719 --> 02:25:30,398
all we could do is uh do our best yeah i

4599
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:31,439
really enjoyed that conversation with

4600
02:25:30,398 --> 02:25:33,840
her i was surprised

4601
02:25:31,439 --> 02:25:35,359
by uh the dislikes and all that kind of

4602
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:36,000
stuff well one of the things i always

4603
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:38,079
talk about

4604
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:40,079
is i don't i don't care what my friends

4605
02:25:38,079 --> 02:25:41,840
politics are i care about if someone's

4606
02:25:40,079 --> 02:25:43,359
if i'm having a bad day can i call them

4607
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:45,040
up and ask for advice and elizabeth has

4608
02:25:43,359 --> 02:25:46,880
been there for me in the past

4609
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:48,319
and then when i do it on a camera in

4610
02:25:46,879 --> 02:25:48,799
front of mike's people freaking out i'm

4611
02:25:48,318 --> 02:25:52,000
like

4612
02:25:48,799 --> 02:25:53,438
i'm practicing what i preach uh my

4613
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,439
the relationships are more important

4614
02:25:53,439 --> 02:25:58,479
than someone's political views

4615
02:25:55,439 --> 02:26:00,800
and it's not hypocrisy at all to

4616
02:25:58,478 --> 02:26:02,478
demonstrate that and not not to push

4617
02:26:00,799 --> 02:26:04,559
back and there was great humor there

4618
02:26:02,478 --> 02:26:06,079
you're both a bit of trolls and yeah in

4619
02:26:04,559 --> 02:26:07,920
very different ways but

4620
02:26:06,079 --> 02:26:10,478
nevertheless that connection the humor

4621
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:12,239
and the mutual respect and love

4622
02:26:10,478 --> 02:26:14,159
that was all there yeah yeah it's just

4623
02:26:12,239 --> 02:26:15,920
fascinating um

4624
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:17,359
you've talked to alex jones a couple

4625
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:19,040
days ago sure yeah you've talked to him

4626
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:20,720
many times before but you've had him on

4627
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:23,600
your podcast

4628
02:26:20,719 --> 02:26:26,000
um this week yeah this week i was kind

4629
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:29,600
of surprised that um

4630
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:30,559
he mentioned that human animal hybrids

4631
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:33,280
was like

4632
02:26:30,559 --> 02:26:34,478
the number the main conspiracy that

4633
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:38,159
people should

4634
02:26:34,478 --> 02:26:41,119
look into to open their eyes to the

4635
02:26:38,159 --> 02:26:42,318
you know to the globalists all the

4636
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:45,359
conspiracies that are out there

4637
02:26:42,318 --> 02:26:48,879
was that surprising to you um no

4638
02:26:45,359 --> 02:26:51,120
because i came in there with questions

4639
02:26:48,879 --> 02:26:52,000
and i was very focused on corralling him

4640
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:53,680
and having it be

4641
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,200
like a kind of a coherent intellectual

4642
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:57,040
conversation that was a really really

4643
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:59,760
good it was only an hour but it was a

4644
02:26:57,040 --> 02:27:01,840
very good conversation yeah thank you

4645
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:03,040
the response was overwhelmingly positive

4646
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:05,359
and i'm like all right

4647
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:07,040
i'm in a unique position because alex i

4648
02:27:05,359 --> 02:27:07,920
i met alex well that's not true but i

4649
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:10,160
was on alex

4650
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:11,280
with alex on tim pool a couple of times

4651
02:27:10,159 --> 02:27:13,359
it was mayhem

4652
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:14,880
it was anarchy and i'm like all right

4653
02:27:13,359 --> 02:27:16,318
let me get but the thing is what people

4654
02:27:14,879 --> 02:27:16,959
enjoyed is i was the one who was

4655
02:27:16,318 --> 02:27:19,199
basically

4656
02:27:16,959 --> 02:27:20,879
able to translate alex ease he's

4657
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:22,720
obviously very performative

4658
02:27:20,879 --> 02:27:24,398
and a lot of times alex will say things

4659
02:27:22,719 --> 02:27:26,719
that are not really

4660
02:27:24,398 --> 02:27:28,079
uh particularly controversial but he'll

4661
02:27:26,719 --> 02:27:29,840
say them in such a way

4662
02:27:28,079 --> 02:27:31,520
that it sounds crazier than it is you

4663
02:27:29,840 --> 02:27:32,239
know i think joe's made this observation

4664
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:34,479
as well

4665
02:27:32,239 --> 02:27:35,439
so what i wanted to have him on when on

4666
02:27:34,478 --> 02:27:37,679
my show

4667
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:40,000
is all right let's go through all these

4668
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:40,559
conspiracies which have validity which

4669
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,159
don't

4670
02:27:40,559 --> 02:27:43,600
and i knew if i asked because he's got a

4671
02:27:42,159 --> 02:27:44,559
lot of historical knowledge even if you

4672
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:45,840
want to think of a lot of it's

4673
02:27:44,559 --> 02:27:48,159
nonsensical

4674
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:50,000
let's sort out the wheat from the chaff

4675
02:27:48,159 --> 02:27:52,000
you know because everyone has someone

4676
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,600
crazy in them i have this expression

4677
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:55,200
you take one red pill not the whole

4678
02:27:53,600 --> 02:27:56,559
bottle you take the whole bottle of red

4679
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:57,600
pills you assume literally everything in

4680
02:27:56,559 --> 02:27:59,439
the media is a lie

4681
02:27:57,600 --> 02:28:00,800
that that's just not a coherent position

4682
02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:01,439
to have is the weather alive when they

4683
02:28:00,799 --> 02:28:03,119
tell you the

4684
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:04,720
temperature's gonna be wrong tomorrow so

4685
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:05,200
that was fun to watch him go through

4686
02:28:04,719 --> 02:28:07,679
that

4687
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:09,120
and he felt bad because he felt

4688
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:10,880
incorrectly in my opinion

4689
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:12,479
that he was needlessly aggressive and

4690
02:28:10,879 --> 02:28:14,318
disrespectful toward me on tim i didn't

4691
02:28:12,478 --> 02:28:15,679
feel disrespected at all it got heated

4692
02:28:14,318 --> 02:28:17,119
but i didn't take it personally people

4693
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:18,960
have heated debates all the time

4694
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:20,640
so i think he he promised me he wouldn't

4695
02:28:18,959 --> 02:28:22,719
interrupt and would be deferential

4696
02:28:20,639 --> 02:28:23,840
but that because he promised to be on

4697
02:28:22,719 --> 02:28:26,000
his best behavior

4698
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:27,280
that gave me an opportunity to address

4699
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:29,760
him seriously

4700
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:32,000
and not to bring the clown aspect out of

4701
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:34,079
him which is easy to caricature him

4702
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,359
my friend ethan supply who i'm sure

4703
02:28:34,079 --> 02:28:36,719
people know played a basic

4704
02:28:35,359 --> 02:28:38,640
character based on him in the hunt

4705
02:28:36,719 --> 02:28:39,519
because eric alex is kind of this

4706
02:28:38,639 --> 02:28:42,000
cartoon

4707
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:43,439
archetype so it was really fun to get

4708
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:46,478
another side of him

4709
02:28:43,439 --> 02:28:47,680
um and and also it's just fun

4710
02:28:46,478 --> 02:28:49,760
being on his show just him being

4711
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:50,720
bombastic and just trying to be the calm

4712
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:53,200
voice of reason

4713
02:28:50,719 --> 02:28:54,478
and for once the trickster was apollo

4714
02:28:53,200 --> 02:28:57,200
well i like this

4715
02:28:54,478 --> 02:28:57,679
this thing he said before and that's

4716
02:28:57,200 --> 02:29:00,000
what

4717
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:02,398
makes me the most interested in alex is

4718
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:05,120
the uh the nietzsche quote about the uh

4719
02:29:02,398 --> 02:29:06,799
you know gazing into the abyss i think

4720
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:08,880
he said on your show that he has become

4721
02:29:06,799 --> 02:29:11,599
the abyss or something like that

4722
02:29:08,879 --> 02:29:13,358
i think that makes him fascinating that

4723
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:14,720
when you really take conspiracy theory

4724
02:29:13,359 --> 02:29:17,520
seriously

4725
02:29:14,719 --> 02:29:19,358
the kind of effect it has on your mind

4726
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:20,159
that to me is fascinating well can i say

4727
02:29:19,359 --> 02:29:22,800
one thing

4728
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:23,760
the term conspiracy theory if you ask

4729
02:29:22,799 --> 02:29:26,000
any layman

4730
02:29:23,760 --> 02:29:27,840
like it's like this you say do you like

4731
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:29,520
puppies i hate them do you like baby

4732
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:31,280
dogs oh they're the best right people

4733
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:33,280
the human mind is capable of doing this

4734
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:36,560
yes so if you ask people

4735
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:39,120
do you think extremely powerful people

4736
02:29:36,559 --> 02:29:40,079
often get together and manipulate data

4737
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:41,600
or rules

4738
02:29:40,079 --> 02:29:44,079
in order to further their power and

4739
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:45,200
control and maintain it i think 90 plus

4740
02:29:44,079 --> 02:29:47,359
percent of people be like

4741
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:48,640
of course then you say oh so you believe

4742
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:49,520
in conspiracy theories oh no that's for

4743
02:29:48,639 --> 02:29:51,840
crazy people

4744
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:52,640
those concepts are identical now that

4745
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:55,040
term

4746
02:29:52,639 --> 02:29:56,079
is used for people who are like all

4747
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:57,680
right uh

4748
02:29:56,079 --> 02:29:59,280
um you know there's conspiracies in

4749
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:01,760
government to experiment on people like

4750
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:03,600
tuskegee this is not in dispute the cia

4751
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:05,280
has you know unsealed things operation

4752
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:06,880
mockingbird so on and so forth

4753
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:08,319
and at the same time conspiracy theory

4754
02:30:06,879 --> 02:30:09,920
applies to people who say

4755
02:30:08,318 --> 02:30:12,239
9 11 never happened and those are

4756
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:13,040
holograms now it's the same word for

4757
02:30:12,239 --> 02:30:15,600
both

4758
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:17,280
but these are not at all equal truth

4759
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:18,159
claims and they do not at all have equal

4760
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:20,399
evidence to them

4761
02:30:18,159 --> 02:30:22,398
but it's very useful for powerful people

4762
02:30:20,398 --> 02:30:23,840
to have that term in the zeitgeist

4763
02:30:22,398 --> 02:30:26,159
because then i don't have to explain or

4764
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:27,439
defend it's like only lunatics are going

4765
02:30:26,159 --> 02:30:29,119
to look further on this

4766
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:30,639
do you really want to be a lunatic kid

4767
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:32,960
and that takes care of the issue

4768
02:30:30,639 --> 02:30:34,799
i i unfortunately the same problem

4769
02:30:32,959 --> 02:30:35,438
applies with language applies to a lot

4770
02:30:34,799 --> 02:30:37,599
of other

4771
02:30:35,439 --> 02:30:39,200
100 that's the nature of language yeah

4772
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:39,840
it's used not just to communicate but to

4773
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:42,000
obfuscate

4774
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:44,000
obviously that could be fixed by coming

4775
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:46,559
up with different words

4776
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,439
to uh to label conspiracy theories that

4777
02:30:46,559 --> 02:30:50,318
are much more

4778
02:30:47,439 --> 02:30:50,960
likely to be true yeah power elite

4779
02:30:50,318 --> 02:30:52,478
analysis

4780
02:30:50,959 --> 02:30:54,639
is another it's basically conspiracy

4781
02:30:52,478 --> 02:30:56,719
theory this is the black pill

4782
02:30:54,639 --> 02:30:59,039
versus white pill question sure with the

4783
02:30:56,719 --> 02:31:01,199
abyss

4784
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:04,080
do you think thinking about these things

4785
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:07,120
can can destroy the mind

4786
02:31:04,079 --> 02:31:08,719
can uh make you deeply cynical about the

4787
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:11,439
world

4788
02:31:08,719 --> 02:31:13,438
yeah because if you are thinking that

4789
02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:16,000
you are not aware of or

4790
02:31:13,439 --> 02:31:17,280
no one is aware of who's controlling

4791
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,359
things and that

4792
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:20,640
the level of their control it gives you

4793
02:31:19,359 --> 02:31:21,680
the sense of powerlessness and

4794
02:31:20,639 --> 02:31:24,719
hopelessness

4795
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:26,079
yeah and my counter is the people in

4796
02:31:24,719 --> 02:31:26,879
charge one of the reasons i'm an

4797
02:31:26,079 --> 02:31:29,039
anarchist

4798
02:31:26,879 --> 02:31:30,159
are nowhere near as smart and crafty as

4799
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:32,160
you think they are

4800
02:31:30,159 --> 02:31:33,600
and certainly maybe the the ones

4801
02:31:32,159 --> 02:31:35,200
completing the shadow maybe are but the

4802
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:36,239
ones who are in the public face most

4803
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:38,000
certainly are not

4804
02:31:36,239 --> 02:31:40,239
as social media has demonstrated when

4805
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,318
you look at how senators and harvard

4806
02:31:40,239 --> 02:31:45,039
professors tweet

4807
02:31:42,318 --> 02:31:47,199
these are not you know intellects that

4808
02:31:45,040 --> 02:31:49,359
you're in awe of to put it mildly

4809
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:52,479
so i think that kind of takes the bloom

4810
02:31:49,359 --> 02:31:53,760
off the rose to a great extent

4811
02:31:52,478 --> 02:31:56,079
you mentioned that you've been doing a

4812
02:31:53,760 --> 02:32:00,000
lot of amazing things been truly joyful

4813
02:31:56,079 --> 02:32:00,000
recently yeah what uh

4814
02:32:00,079 --> 02:32:03,680
i don't know if you have a bucket list

4815
02:32:02,239 --> 02:32:05,359
is there items on the bucket list you

4816
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:07,600
haven't done yet

4817
02:32:05,359 --> 02:32:08,559
are you are you pretty much satisfied

4818
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:11,200
and happy

4819
02:32:08,559 --> 02:32:12,159
and if you die today i if i murder you

4820
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:14,079
you'll be happy

4821
02:32:12,159 --> 02:32:16,799
i could die today is there an item on

4822
02:32:14,079 --> 02:32:20,478
the buccal list you want to get done

4823
02:32:16,799 --> 02:32:23,358
um i don't yeah uh deep sea

4824
02:32:20,478 --> 02:32:24,719
submersible that would be number one in

4825
02:32:23,359 --> 02:32:26,880
a bucket list

4826
02:32:24,719 --> 02:32:28,398
why because that's where all the most

4827
02:32:26,879 --> 02:32:32,239
interesting zoology is

4828
02:32:28,398 --> 02:32:34,478
and to be um in a place where

4829
02:32:32,239 --> 02:32:35,760
like virtually no human being has been

4830
02:32:34,478 --> 02:32:37,119
and to see these

4831
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:39,760
god's mistakes in their natural

4832
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:41,280
environment my friend coined that term

4833
02:32:39,760 --> 02:32:43,120
god's mistakes if you look at deep sea

4834
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:44,640
creatures you can imagine god

4835
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:46,000
making some animal being like oh god

4836
02:32:44,639 --> 02:32:47,519
this is hideous i'll just throw the bomb

4837
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:49,920
the ocean no one's gonna see this

4838
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:50,960
um so that would be my number one bucket

4839
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:53,359
list thing

4840
02:32:50,959 --> 02:32:55,438
i would say go to the white house as a

4841
02:32:53,359 --> 02:32:57,359
guest would be a bucket list thing

4842
02:32:55,439 --> 02:32:58,559
russia go to russia would be a bucket

4843
02:32:57,359 --> 02:33:01,439
list thing

4844
02:32:58,559 --> 02:33:02,879
um i want to go these are secondary like

4845
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:04,318
go to eritrea

4846
02:33:02,879 --> 02:33:06,318
it would be a buckless thing i've got a

4847
02:33:04,318 --> 02:33:07,760
long list of books i need to write

4848
02:33:06,318 --> 02:33:09,519
that's that's i don't know that's really

4849
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:14,318
a bucket list per se

4850
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:16,159
um uh there's not that much what i'm at

4851
02:33:14,318 --> 02:33:18,559
a point in my life

4852
02:33:16,159 --> 02:33:20,318
is once you cross off certain things you

4853
02:33:18,559 --> 02:33:21,600
basically instead of driving the car

4854
02:33:20,318 --> 02:33:23,439
start surfing

4855
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:24,960
and just amazing i talked to you about

4856
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:25,760
this medical thing you know before we

4857
02:33:24,959 --> 02:33:27,279
started yeah

4858
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:28,719
at a certain point and i'm sure this

4859
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:30,239
happens to you because your platform's a

4860
02:33:28,719 --> 02:33:31,679
lot bigger than mine

4861
02:33:30,239 --> 02:33:33,039
all sorts of things start coming your

4862
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:35,280
way that you never would have thought of

4863
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:37,600
and you're like this is pretty darn cool

4864
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:40,000
so to be and that's happening at an

4865
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:42,318
escalating rate like i'm at a point now

4866
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:44,398
where i get stopped every day um by

4867
02:33:42,318 --> 02:33:45,119
people so that's going to be a weird

4868
02:33:44,398 --> 02:33:48,799
thing for me

4869
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:51,120
to get adjusted to i ever like

4870
02:33:48,799 --> 02:33:52,959
without exception everyone who has ever

4871
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:54,640
stopped me on the street has been cool

4872
02:33:52,959 --> 02:33:56,159
and it's been a pleasant experience

4873
02:33:54,639 --> 02:33:56,959
there was one exception in an event

4874
02:33:56,159 --> 02:33:58,879
where someone

4875
02:33:56,959 --> 02:34:00,159
was genuinely on the spectrum and they

4876
02:33:58,879 --> 02:34:01,839
didn't understand like

4877
02:34:00,159 --> 02:34:04,079
distance and you don't touch people and

4878
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:06,239
that but that's as bad as it got

4879
02:34:04,079 --> 02:34:08,079
so that is something that's going to be

4880
02:34:06,239 --> 02:34:10,559
weird for me to have to deal with

4881
02:34:08,079 --> 02:34:11,920
um over the next couple of years but you

4882
02:34:10,559 --> 02:34:13,760
know it's the price you pay and

4883
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:15,280
it's it's hardly a small price when

4884
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:16,800
people come up to you and say you've

4885
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:18,720
made my life better but it's just weird

4886
02:34:16,799 --> 02:34:19,358
when you go and like like i was at the

4887
02:34:18,719 --> 02:34:20,959
gym

4888
02:34:19,359 --> 02:34:22,399
and then someone tweets like did i see

4889
02:34:20,959 --> 02:34:24,559
you at the gym just now

4890
02:34:22,398 --> 02:34:26,639
it's kind of weird and i'm sure it's the

4891
02:34:24,559 --> 02:34:28,239
same for you when you're walking around

4892
02:34:26,639 --> 02:34:29,358
and you don't think about it but people

4893
02:34:28,239 --> 02:34:30,799
know who you are and you don't know who

4894
02:34:29,359 --> 02:34:32,079
they are that you're being watched even

4895
02:34:30,799 --> 02:34:32,879
though it's not malevolent it's still

4896
02:34:32,079 --> 02:34:35,680
just

4897
02:34:32,879 --> 02:34:36,879
you don't get prepared for that michael

4898
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:40,239
there were

4899
02:34:36,879 --> 02:34:42,398
there will be two really big names that

4900
02:34:40,239 --> 02:34:44,318
uh wanted to do this podcast we'll do

4901
02:34:42,398 --> 02:34:45,920
this podcast that i considered to do

4902
02:34:44,318 --> 02:34:48,719
episode 200 with

4903
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:49,439
but then i realized why the hell talked

4904
02:34:48,719 --> 02:34:52,639
to somebody

4905
02:34:49,439 --> 02:34:54,639
um famous when i could talk to somebody

4906
02:34:52,639 --> 02:34:57,680
i love

4907
02:34:54,639 --> 02:35:00,959
that nobody knows or cares

4908
02:34:57,680 --> 02:35:01,280
you just hit a random number generator

4909
02:35:00,959 --> 02:35:03,199
yeah

4910
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:05,120
just i listed all the russians i know

4911
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:08,399
and who's the easiest to get

4912
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:10,240
you're the yeah who's the most desperate

4913
02:35:08,398 --> 02:35:12,398
he's got a shitty book out we could talk

4914
02:35:10,239 --> 02:35:14,478
about that for five minutes

4915
02:35:12,398 --> 02:35:15,760
this garbage cut and pace that he did

4916
02:35:14,478 --> 02:35:19,119
yeah

4917
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:22,079
uh it turned out okay i think

4918
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:23,760
slightly above average michael i i love

4919
02:35:22,079 --> 02:35:24,318
you you're an incredible human being

4920
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:25,680
it's an

4921
02:35:24,318 --> 02:35:27,119
honor that you would talk to me and

4922
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:27,600
you'll be my friend thanks so much for

4923
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:31,520
doing this

4924
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:33,280
uh the respect that i got uh when you

4925
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:35,439
asked me to be the guest for the

4926
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:37,600
anniversary episode was similar to the

4927
02:35:35,439 --> 02:35:38,639
respect when my two friends josh and zoe

4928
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:39,840
they were going to get married

4929
02:35:38,639 --> 02:35:41,680
at city hall and they said we want

4930
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:44,318
someone to witness it they ask you

4931
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:46,000
so it's one thing when people tell you

4932
02:35:44,318 --> 02:35:47,680
they like you and respect you which

4933
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:49,600
i had growing up it's nothing when they

4934
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:51,520
show it and this is something that i do

4935
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:53,040
not take lightly and i hope no one takes

and now let me leave you with some words

4958
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:37,280
from jack kerouac

4959
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:38,000
that perhaps begins to explain the

4960
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:39,920
nature of

4961
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:42,239
and the reasons for my friendship with

4962
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:44,799
mr michael malus

4963
02:36:42,239 --> 02:36:46,478
the only people for me are the mad ones

4964
02:36:44,799 --> 02:36:49,840
the ones who are mad to live

4965
02:36:46,478 --> 02:36:51,519
not to talk matt to be saved desirous of

4966
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:53,280
everything at the same time

4967
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:54,560
the ones who never yawn or say

4968
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:58,319
commonplace thing

4969
02:36:54,559 --> 02:36:59,119
but burn burn like fabulous yellow roman

4970
02:36:58,318 --> 02:37:01,840
candles

4971
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:02,880
exploding like spiders across the stars

4972
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:05,200
and in the middle

4973
02:37:02,879 --> 02:37:07,920
you see the blue center light pop and

4974
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:07,920
everybody goes

4975
02:37:08,879 --> 02:37:19,839
