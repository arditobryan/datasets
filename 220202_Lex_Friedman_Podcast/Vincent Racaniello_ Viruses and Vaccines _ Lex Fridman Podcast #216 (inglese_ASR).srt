1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,200
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:08,160
vincent raqueniello professor of

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,160
microbiology and immunology at columbia

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,320
vincent is one of the best educators in

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,320
biology and in general that i've ever

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,640
had the pleasure of speaking with

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,920
i highly recommend you check out his

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,560
this week in virology podcast and watch

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,039
his introductory lectures on youtube in

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,559
particular the playlist i recommend is

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,640
called virology lectures 2021

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,439
to support this podcast please check out

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,759
the sponsors in the description

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,238
as a side note please allow me to say a

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,558
few words about the coveted vaccines

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:43,199
some people are scared of a virus

17
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:45,280
hurting or killing somebody they love

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,640
some are scared of their government

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,160
betraying them

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,079
their leaders blinded by power and greed

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,759
i have both of these fears

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,198
and two i'm afraid as fdr said a fear

23
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,238
itself

24
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:02,479
fear manifests as anger and anger leads

25
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:05,920
to division in the hands of charismatic

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:08,640
leaders who then manufacture truth in

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,040
quotes that maximize controversy and a

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,280
sense of imminent crisis that only they

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,000
can save us from

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,759
and though i'm sometimes mocked for this

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,640
i still believe that love compassion

32
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,359
empathy is the way out from this vicious

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,680
downward spiral of division

34
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,759
i personally took the vaccine based on

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,759
my understanding of the data deciding

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,959
that for me the risk of negative effects

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,599
from covid

38
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,319
short-term and long-term are far worse

39
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,599
than the negative effects from the mrna

40
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,719
vaccine

41
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,118
i read

42
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,319
i thought i decided

43
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,840
for me

44
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,319
but i never have

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,000
and never will talk down to people who

46
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,078
don't take the vaccine

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,438
i'm humble enough to know just how

48
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,199
little i know

49
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,519
how wrong i have been

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,880
and will be on many of my beliefs and

51
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,840
ideas

52
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,679
i think dogmatic certainty and division

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,439
is more destructive in the long term

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,680
than any virus

55
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:10,399
the solution for me personally like i

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,200
said is to choose empathy and compassion

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,439
towards all fellow human beings no

58
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,199
matter who they voted for

59
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,239
i hope you do the same

60
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,039
read

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,560
think

62
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,159
and try to imagine

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,719
that what you currently think is the

64
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,878
truth may be totally wrong

65
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,318
this mindset is one that opens you to

66
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,000
discovery innovation and wisdom

67
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,238
i hope my conversation with vincent

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,479
raqueniello is a useful resource for

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,640
just this kind of exploration he doesn't

70
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,959
talk down to people and he's the most

71
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,159
knowledgeable virologist i've ever

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,239
spoken to he has no political agenda no

73
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,120
desire to mock those who disagree with

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,680
him

75
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,159
he just loves biology and explaining the

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,000
fundamental mechanisms of how biological

77
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,840
systems work

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,919
that's a great person to listen to and

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,080
learn from with an open mind

80
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,799
i hope you join me in doing so and no

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,640
matter what try to put more love out

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,640
there in the world

83
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,119
this is the lex friedman podcast and

84
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,279
here is my conversation with vincent

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,280
raqueniello

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,158
you mentioned in one of your lectures on

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,719
virology that there are more viruses in

88
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,560
a liter of coastal seawater than people

89
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,000
on earth

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,640
in the

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
nature article titled microbiology by

92
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,598
numbers it says there are 10 to the 31

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,479
viruses on earth

94
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:35,518
also it says that the rate of viral

95
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:39,119
infection in the ocean stands at

96
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,439
10 to the 23 infections per second

97
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,400
and these infections remove 20 to 40

98
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,359
percent

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,200
of all bacterial cells each day there's

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,640
a war going on

101
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,318
do you uh what do you make of these

102
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,359
numbers

103
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,199
why are there so many viruses so the

104
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,239
the numbers you're quoting they're in my

105
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,438
first

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,878
virology lecture right because

107
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:02,959
people don't know these numbers and they

108
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,158
get wow they get wowed by them so i love

109
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,158
to give them

110
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,120
so the way sorry to interrupt

111
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:10,959
as i was saying offline you have one of

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,319
the best introductory lectures on

113
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
virology

114
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,759
that i've ever seen introductory

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,720
lectures period so i highly recommend

116
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,560
people

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,479
find you on youtube and watch it if

118
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,000
you're curious at all about viruses it

119
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,758
it um

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,879
yeah there's a lot of times throughout

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,400
watching it

122
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,560
i felt like whoa

123
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,319
yeah that's my goal is to and that's

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,879
what my students tell me one student

125
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,639
once said i every day after every

126
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,120
lecture i could go home and tell my

127
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,840
roommate something she didn't know

128
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,079
yeah and and blew her away so the number

129
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:45,279
of viruses is really an amazing number

130
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:48,800
so that number 10 to the 31 is actually

131
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,478
just the bacterial viruses in the ocean

132
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,759
so there are viruses that infect

133
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,000
everything on the planet including

134
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,800
bacteria there's a lot of bacteria in

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,040
the ocean and so 10 to the 31 is from

136
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,879
basically particle counts of seawater

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,039
all over the world so they're more

138
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,159
viruses than 10 to the 31 but just in

139
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,959
the ocean

140
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,360
and that number is so big

141
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,038
first of all the mass exceeds

142
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,800
that of elephants on the planet by a

143
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,519
thousand fold

144
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,120
and if you lined up those viruses end to

145
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,120
end they would go

146
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,079
200 million light years

147
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,120
into space it's so big a number

148
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,000
it's amazing and then yes 10 to the 20

149
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,879
some

150
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,439
infections per second of these viruses

151
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:34,478
killing bacteria and releasing all this

152
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:37,360
organic matter and that's part of this

153
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,680
what we call the biogeochemical pump

154
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,759
cycling of material in the ocean

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,759
the bacteria die

156
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,360
they start to sink and then they get

157
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,800
metabolized and converted to compounds

158
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,879
that that are needed a lot of it gets

159
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,319
released as carbon dioxide and so forth

160
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,560
so these are actually really important

161
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,399
cycles that are catalyzed by the virus

162
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
it's so wild that nature has developed a

163
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,719
mechanism for mass murder

164
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,800
about bacteria that's one way to look at

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,280
it but it's just what happened right

166
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,439
it's interesting i mean um i wonder what

167
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,918
the evolutionary advantage of like such

168
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,800
fast cycling of life

169
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,599
is

170
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,160
is it just an accident of evolution that

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,240
viruses are so numerous

172
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,800
or is it um

173
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,680
is it is it a feature not a bug

174
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,600
so the the fast is

175
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,319
it rain it does not all fast not all

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,160
viruses are fast some are 20 minutes per

177
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,240
cycle some take

178
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,199
weeks per cycle

179
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,960
um

180
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,879
but that's just per second there's so

181
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,719
many viruses in the ocean that that's

182
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,279
what you get per second no matter how

183
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,680
fast the cycle is but

184
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,839
i look at it this way viruses were

185
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,199
probably the first

186
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,758
organic entities to evolve on the planet

187
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,759
long ago billions billion years ago

188
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,319
just as the earth cooled and organic

189
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,720
molecules began to form

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,280
i think these self

191
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,599
we call them self replicators

192
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,318
they're just short things that today

193
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,199
would look like rna which is the basis

194
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
of

195
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,199
many viruses right they evolved and they

196
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,639
were able to replicate of course they

197
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,720
were just naked

198
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,038
molecules they had no protection and it

199
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,960
was just rna-based

200
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:21,680
and that that's tough because rna is

201
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,478
pretty fragile in the in the world and

202
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,000
um

203
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,439
it probably didn't get very big as a

204
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,120
consequence

205
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,120
but then

206
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,639
proteins evolved and i'm skipping like

207
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,280
hundreds of millions of years of

208
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,240
evolution proteins evolved maybe without

209
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,918
a cell

210
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,360
maybe with a cell

211
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,758
but then

212
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,680
to make a cell there probably were some

213
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,919
rna-based cells early on but they were

214
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,959
pretty simple but the cells that we know

215
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,878
of today even bacteria and single celled

216
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,680
eukaryotes

217
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,160
they have very long dna genomes and you

218
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,959
need a lot of dna to make a complicated

219
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,919
cell and so we think at some point

220
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:02,478
the rna became dna

221
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,079
and probably one of the earliest enzymes

222
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,918
that arose

223
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,680
is the enzyme that could copy that rna

224
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,318
into dna which we now know today as

225
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,478
reverse transcriptase which my former

226
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,160
boss david baltimore and howard tement

227
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:14,959
co-discovered

228
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,560
and

229
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:21,598
that that enzyme arose and copied rna to

230
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,439
dna and then you could build big cells

231
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,079
with because dna can be millions and

232
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,719
millions of bases in length and rna the

233
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,598
the longest rna we know of is

234
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,918
40 000 bases not much bigger than the

235
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,639
sarsko v2 what would you say is the

236
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:38,319
magic moment along that line i saw it

237
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,799
was uh

238
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,000
one or two billion billion maybe three

239
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,759
billion

240
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,480
years it took

241
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,879
to go from bacteria to

242
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,600
to like complex organism

243
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,559
like it seems like earth had a very long

244
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,000
time

245
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,679
like not a very long time without life

246
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,519
and in a very long time with very

247
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,599
primitive life

248
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,200
um maybe i'm discriminating calling

249
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
bacteria affirmative life yeah but

250
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,360
people would object to you yeah doing

251
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,759
that for sure but it seems like complex

252
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,959
organ when you start becoming something

253
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,958
like um

254
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,079
i don't know what's a good uh not animal

255
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,319
like but

256
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,360
more complexity than just like a single

257
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,600
cell

258
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,278
um what what do you think is the magic

259
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
there what's the hardest thing if you're

260
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,519
trying to engineer earth and build a

261
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,600
life

262
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,200
and build the simulations obviously

263
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,800
we're living in a video game what this

264
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,959
is so if you're trying to build this

265
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:34,159
vehicle what's the hardest part about

266
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:36,958
long-term evolution so bacteria

267
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,039
are mostly single cells they do make

268
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,119
colonies they get together in biofilms

269
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,919
which are really important

270
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,000
but

271
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,278
they're all single bacteria in that and

272
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,519
the key is

273
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:49,439
making an organism where

274
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,200
cells do different things you know we

275
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,600
have skin cells and eye cells and brain

276
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,519
cells and bacteria never do that and the

277
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,440
reason is probably energy

278
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,879
bacteria don't can't make enough energy

279
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,080
to do that

280
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,559
and so

281
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,839
there was another cell

282
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,838
existing at the time the archaea

283
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,519
and the idea is that a bacteria went

284
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,759
into

285
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,120
an archaea and became the modern day

286
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,439
mitochondria

287
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,440
the energy factory of the cell and that

288
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,200
now let that cell

289
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,040
develop into more and more complicated

290
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
organisms like we have today it was all

291
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,759
about energy so the mitochondria the

292
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,399
energy uh the mitochondria is the magic

293
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,000
thing i think so it's actually not my

294
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,519
idea it's nick jones have you heard of

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
nick jones he's an evolutionary

296
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,078
biologist in the uk

297
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,040
and he's he's done experimental work on

298
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,239
this and it's his idea that the defining

299
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,759
point was

300
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,200
the ability to make a lot of energy

301
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,600
which a mitochondria can do it's

302
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,278
basically a whole bacteria inside of a

303
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,839
bigger cell and that becomes what we now

304
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,039
call eukaryotes and uh

305
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,640
that they can get more and more

306
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,240
complicated so let me bring you back to

307
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,159
the viruses i want to finish that story

308
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,720
yeah which points the viruses come along

309
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,639
so remember we have these pre-cellular

310
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,519
they're called pre-cellular replicons

311
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,879
right

312
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,519
and

313
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,559
so we have a pre-cellular stage where we

314
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,200
have these

315
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,799
self-replicating molecules and cells

316
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,480
arise

317
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,479
and then

318
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,759
the self-replicating molecules invade

319
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,360
the cells

320
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,879
why because it's a hospitable

321
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,480
environment and i mean they didn't know

322
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,519
that they just went in and it turned out

323
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,519
it was beneficial for them so it stuck

324
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,120
and they replicate inside the cell now

325
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,200
where they have pools of everything they

326
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,720
need they get more and more complicated

327
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,399
and then they steal

328
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,160
proteins from the cell to build a

329
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,399
protective shell

330
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,078
and then they can be released as virus

331
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,919
particles they're now protected they can

332
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:40,879
move from host to host

333
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,519
and

334
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,439
because they're at the earliest stages

335
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,519
of cellular evolution

336
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,720
they can diversify to infect anything

337
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,039
that arises and that is why i think

338
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,879
there's so many of them and everything

339
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,958
on the planet is infected because the

340
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,439
ancestor of everything was infected many

341
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,599
years ago so it's easier to steal than

342
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
to build from scratch

343
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,600
so like it's easier to sort of break

344
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,519
into somebody else's thing and steal

345
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,278
their proteins yes

346
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,039
my colleague dixon de pombiere calls

347
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,000
viruses safe crackers safe crackers so

348
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,360
it's just

349
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,278
uh from an evolutionary perspective it's

350
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,278
yeah it's it's easier to steal because

351
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,439
you can select but then you have to

352
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,519
figure out mechanisms for stealing for

353
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,959
breaking into from crack in the states

354
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,560
well you don't have to figure out it

355
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,518
just happens right

356
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,239
because molecules are so diverse that a

357
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,000
molecule gets into a cell and if there's

358
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,200
a protein that sticks to it it's going

359
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,278
to stick

360
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,040
and that gives an advantage

361
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:43,200
there's no you know there's no planning

362
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,879
there's no thinking about it right it

363
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,079
just happens

364
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,078
oh we'll return to that

365
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,320
what uh but these numbers are crazy so

366
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:55,759
what as these more complex organisms

367
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,639
evolved

368
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,639
let's take us humans as an example

369
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,320
uh should we be afraid of these high

370
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,039
numbers should we be worried that

371
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,360
there's so many viruses in the world

372
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,199
but to a certain extent i mean they have

373
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,278
it's twofold they're good and bad right

374
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,360
viruses are no there's no question they

375
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,039
can be bad we know that because they've

376
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,879
infected and caused disease throughout

377
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,958
history but we're also you and i are

378
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,480
full of viruses that don't hurt us at

379
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,958
all and probably help us and every

380
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,720
organism is the same so they are

381
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:28,159
clearly beneficial as a consequence so i

382
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,360
think

383
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:34,000
so every living thing on the planet has

384
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,680
multiple viruses infecting everything

385
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,039
you can see

386
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,479
and

387
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,439
most of them i think we don't worry

388
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,440
about

389
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,600
because they can't infect us they're

390
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,120
unable in fact

391
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,560
now you could actually you can actually

392
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,919
take your feces and send them to a

393
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,479
company and they will sequence your

394
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,159
viruses in your feces for you your fecal

395
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,159
firearm right

396
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,360
and the most

397
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,559
common

398
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,320
virus in human feces is a plant virus

399
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,958
that infects peppers

400
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,160
it's called pepper model mosaic virus

401
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,399
and that's because people eat a lot of

402
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,639
peppers and it just passes right through

403
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,320
you cabbage is full of viruses from the

404
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,919
insects that walk on the cabbage in the

405
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,000
fields we eat them

406
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,319
they just pass us so i think most of the

407
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,360
viruses we don't need to worry about

408
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,760
except when we're talking about species

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,039
that are closest to us mammals

410
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,360
of course

411
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,519
i and i think the most numerous ones are

412
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,120
the most concerning they're viruses like

413
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,320
bats bats are 20 of mammals and rodents

414
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,120
are 40

415
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,839
of mammals and we humans

416
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,360
live nearby right yeah and we know

417
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,959
throughout history many viruses have

418
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,480
come from bats and from rodents to

419
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,078
people no question about it there's a

420
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,159
proximity in terms of just living

421
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,719
together in a proximity genetically to

422
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,799
so it's more likely a virus will jump

423
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,040
from a bat in the road and birds too

424
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,519
birds can give us their viruses that's

425
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,919
happened you know influenza viruses come

426
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,120
from birds mainly so i think those are

427
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,559
the three

428
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,240
species

429
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,518
not species it's higher than species

430
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,039
obviously but those are the three i

431
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,399
would worry about in terms of getting

432
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:10,399
their viruses and we don't really know

433
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,278
what's out there right we have very

434
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,480
little clue about what viruses and i've

435
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,240
for years wanted to capture wild mice in

436
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,079
my backyard and see what viruses they

437
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,320
have because no one knows

438
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,638
wait and it's you can't ask them so you

439
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,079
mean map uh like is there a way to ask

440
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,240
them yeah no i have to would have to

441
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,519
sacrifice them and take tissue and then

442
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,120
bring it in the lab and do genome

443
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,879
sequences so you can do a

444
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,600
thorough sequencing to determine which

445
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:38,159
viruses is there a sufficiently good

446
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,720
categorization of viruses where you'd be

447
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,958
that's a very good question so whenever

448
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,120
you do sequence right you get some

449
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,198
environmental sample and you extract

450
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,519
nucleic acid and you sequence it what

451
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,439
you do is you run it past the database

452
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,278
with the gold standard is the genbank

453
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,560
database which is maintained here in the

454
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:59,278
u.s and you see if you get any hits

455
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,119
and then you can say ah look this this

456
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,439
sequence is similar to this virus and

457
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,360
you can classify all the viruses you see

458
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,720
the problem is

459
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,278
90

460
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,839
of your sequence is dark matter it

461
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,399
doesn't hit with anything it's

462
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,920
probably a lot of it is unknown viruses

463
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,039
and it's going to be hard to figure out

464
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,759
because someone's going to have to go

465
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,679
after it and sort it through so yes you

466
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,199
can find a lot of viruses and the

467
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,599
numbers you get are astounding you can

468
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,639
find thousands of new viruses just by

469
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,879
looking in

470
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,159
various life forms but

471
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,039
there are many more that we don't pick

472
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:35,120
up because they're not in the database

473
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,799
maybe this is a good time to take a

474
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,399
quick tangent what do you think about

475
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,159
alpha fold too i don't know if you've

476
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,240
been paying attention to that

477
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,159
well the them uh deep mind solving the

478
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,560
protein folding problem

479
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,759
and then also releasing

480
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,838
first of all

481
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,240
open sourcing the code which is for me

482
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,959
as a software person that i love and

483
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,278
then second of all also making

484
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,958
like 300 000 predictions or something

485
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,679
like that for different protein

486
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,119
structures and releasing that data

487
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:04,959
yeah

488
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,599
so on the side of because you make

489
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,839
you're saying there's dark matter right

490
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,399
is there something

491
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,720
um what first what are your general

492
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,519
thoughts level of excitement about their

493
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,720
uh their work and second how can that be

494
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,318
applied to

495
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,558
viruses do you think we'll be able to

496
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,399
explore the dark matter of

497
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,160
virology using machine learning

498
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,839
absolutely because in all this dark

499
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,160
sequence you can

500
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,599
translate it and make a protein you can

501
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,840
see what a protein looks like it has

502
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,079
what we call an open reading frame right

503
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,918
a start and a stop and right now it's

504
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:38,960
just a bunch of amino acids but if we

505
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,679
could

506
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,360
fold it maybe the fold would recognize

507
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,200
like something we already know some

508
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,719
protein fold which gives you

509
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,600
a lot of clues right because there are

510
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,919
only so many protein folds in biology

511
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,558
and that dark matter is probably one of

512
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,400
them

513
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,519
so i think that's very exciting because

514
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,960
for years i've followed structural

515
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,558
biologists

516
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,360
for years and

517
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:02,798
you know

518
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,558
in the beginning we couldn't even solve

519
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,558
structures of viruses they're too big we

520
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,000
could do small molecules like myoglobin

521
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,558
and that was the first one done took

522
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,038
years to do that and then

523
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,960
as computational power increased then

524
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,640
they could start to do viruses but it

525
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,400
took a long time

526
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,080
x-ray crystallography

527
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,759
it depended on getting crystals of the

528
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,879
virus right and now we can do

529
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:26,319
cryo-electron microscopy which is much

530
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,559
faster

531
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,480
you could solve the spike of sars cov2

532
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,558
was solved in two months by by jason

533
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,798
mcclelland here in austin actually at

534
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:37,359
the beginning of the pandemic

535
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:40,240
but you're limited you can't do

536
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:44,079
huge proteins you can only do moderately

537
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,240
sized ones so or i should actually you

538
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,079
can do viruses but you can't do small

539
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,038
proteins so that's speeded it up but

540
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,319
it's still too fast to solve you get a

541
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,919
new protein you want to solve its

542
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,279
structure so if we could predict it and

543
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,960
i know from talking to structural

544
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,960
biologists this has been their holy

545
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,120
grail from day one they want to be able

546
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,120
to take a sequence of a protein put it

547
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,399
in a computer and have the structure put

548
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,319
out without having to do all the

549
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,640
experiment so that's why this is very

550
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,759
exciting that yeah you can predict it i

551
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,280
mean it's not

552
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,960
finished obviously and there's more to

553
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,440
do but i think it will be a day where

554
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,279
you could take any amino acid sequence

555
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,960
and predict what it's going to look like

556
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,720
see but yeah like aren't structural

557
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,558
biology is going to get greedy so once

558
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,279
you have that don't you want to go more

559
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,558
complicated then don't you want to go

560
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,558
because that's that's just the first

561
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,480
step right to go from you know acid to

562
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,079
the structure then there's like multiple

563
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,319
protein interactions

564
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:37,038
like how do you get to the virus

565
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,798
well so that's what the ultimate goal of

566
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,879
getting a structure is that then you can

567
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,918
do experiments and figure out what the

568
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,799
structure means right so many

569
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,038
in the old days structural biology was a

570
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,960
career in itself you worked with people

571
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,000
who had a system and you solved proteins

572
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,279
for them and then you moved on to

573
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,119
another one you didn't really do any

574
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,960
experiments the other people got to do

575
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,558
all the interesting experiments right

576
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,038
now

577
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:03,519
young structural biologists are

578
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,960
multifaceted they solve the structure

579
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,519
and then they say what happens if we

580
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,279
change this amino acid oh look it it

581
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,279
blocks binding to the receptor this must

582
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,519
be the receptor binding interface so

583
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,119
that's the exciting stuff absolutely is

584
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,359
doing the experiment i wonder if you can

585
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,798
do some kinds of like

586
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:22,959
simulations of like

587
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,200
you know different proteins or

588
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,519
multi-protein systems going to war

589
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,679
against each other

590
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,279
like to try to figure out

591
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,159
you know

592
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:37,038
reinforcement learning is used in alpha

593
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,120
zero for example to learn chess and go

594
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,879
and that's using the self-play mechanism

595
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,639
where the thing plays against itself

596
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,480
sure and learns better and better yeah

597
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,640
whether you can i wonder if you can

598
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,519
simulate almost evolution in that way

599
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,440
for us for primitive biological systems

600
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,359
have them in stimulation

601
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,120
fight each other and then see what comes

602
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,719
out like a super dangerous virus comes

603
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,479
out or super

604
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,000
like chuck norris type of thing that

605
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,079
defends against the super dangerous

606
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,919
virus and it's all in simulation so an

607
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,158
example would be

608
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,759
we have all these variants of sars cov2

609
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,200
arising right

610
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,119
which which

611
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,960
look to be selected by

612
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,439
immune responses

613
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,200
but we now we know what amino acids are

614
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,120
changing in the spike

615
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,480
and how they block antibody bonding you

616
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,319
could simulate that you could say

617
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,000
what what is the antibody looking at you

618
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,000
these are where antibodies bind on

619
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,679
proteins are called epitopes right you

620
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,679
could map them all and change them in a

621
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,360
simulation one by one and and go back

622
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,519
and forth between the antibody and the

623
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,359
virus so all these

624
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,000
evolution is is what we call an arms

625
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,839
race right the virus changes

626
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,079
and then it evades the host and then the

627
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,439
host can change the host takes longer to

628
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,240
change though unfortunately it takes

629
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,240
geological time but it can and then the

630
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,720
virus can change and it can go back and

631
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,120
forth and we can see evidence of this

632
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,159
in genome sequences of both viruses and

633
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,038
their hosts

634
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,280
and so

635
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,200
you can take a protein

636
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,519
in a host that is a receptor for

637
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,840
multiple viruses and you can see all the

638
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,440
impacts of virus pressure on it and you

639
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,959
could simulate that for sure and that's

640
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,038
just one thing that you could do you

641
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,079
could simulate

642
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,839
changes in say a an enzyme that makes it

643
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,158
resistant to a drug and predict all the

644
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,480
drug resistance

645
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,000
but but the problem is

646
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,679
people like me the experimental

647
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,640
virologist don't know how to do any of

648
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,600
that so we need to collaborate with

649
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,559
people i guess oh with other humans

650
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,959
we do that we do that okay but with

651
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:37,599
people from a field that we're not used

652
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,440
to like i suppose people who

653
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,199
would it be ai i suppose yeah machine

654
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,798
learning people machine learning people

655
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,480
and you would say look

656
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,798
this is the biological problem is there

657
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,720
a way we can use your tools to attack it

658
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,679
the problem is those people

659
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,600
are

660
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,960
anti-social introverts

661
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,759
that

662
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,759
that

663
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,279
have a place like this and try to hide

664
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,519
from other people in the world very

665
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:00,798
difficult to find in the wild

666
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,279
um okay

667
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,879
so outside of doing amazing brilliant

668
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,839
lectures online

669
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
you

670
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,639
host

671
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,880
and produce

672
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,080
five i would say related podcasts

673
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,799
including

674
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:17,599
my favorite this week in virology also

675
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:20,400
this weekend parasitism this week in

676
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,759
microbiology and so on so you're a good

677
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,640
person to ask

678
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,640
what are the categories of small things

679
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,000
small biological things in this world

680
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,799
that can kill you

681
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,640
kill us humans

682
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,200
let's let's look you said like most

683
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,080
viruses are friendly or at least not

684
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,880
unfriendly right but let's look at the

685
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,558
unfriendly ones and viruses and bacteria

686
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,240
and those kinds of things when you look

687
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,119
at the full spectrum of things that can

688
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,200
kill you

689
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,158
can you kind of paint a brief picture

690
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,640
yeah i think

691
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,720
the the big picture is that

692
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,559
the things that can kill your minority

693
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,319
of everything that's out there and we're

694
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,960
talking about

695
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:02,240
molecules so we have in us

696
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,440
proteins that can kill us yeah prions

697
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,599
that are just

698
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,759
it's a protein in us and if it misfolds

699
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,839
it makes all of its other

700
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,158
copies misfold and then you you die of a

701
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,199
neurological disease yeah that's pretty

702
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,799
rare

703
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,319
um so there are proteins there are

704
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,720
viruses

705
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,240
and as i said only certain ones

706
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,480
can kill us

707
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,640
but even though if we get those from

708
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,440
animals it's not straightforward if you

709
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,000
look at sarsko v2 right this is probably

710
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,038
a once in a hundred year pandemic i

711
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,519
would say

712
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,359
equivalent to 1918

713
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,960
in its devastation and in between there

714
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,038
have been smaller pandemics of other

715
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,558
other viruses but it doesn't happen all

716
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,400
that often so we have a lot of viruses

717
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,319
we have a lot of bacteria

718
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,600
of various sorts that can cause

719
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:50,399
infections in us and there's this it's a

720
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,798
limited number right your streptococci

721
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,880
and staphylococci and clostridium we

722
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,720
could go on and on but

723
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,799
we know how to handle those as long as

724
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,880
we have antimicrobials it's just that we

725
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:04,000
abuse them and we get resistance so that

726
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,320
can be a problem then we have fungi

727
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,278
not mushrooms but much smaller fungi

728
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,319
that

729
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:12,319
multiply submicroscopic or just at the

730
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,918
microscopic level they can

731
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,439
you know in dry climates of the u.s you

732
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,480
can inhale their spores and they can

733
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,200
grow in your lung if you're

734
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,240
immunosuppressed and so forth so those

735
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,240
are

736
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,960
the tiny guys and then we have parasites

737
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,919
which we we do this week in parasitism

738
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,079
where

739
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,640
single cells even worms of various sorts

740
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,678
can invade you and cause all sorts of

741
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
problems

742
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,400
how um i was like kind of terrified to

743
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,319
listen to that podcast what uh what's it

744
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,400
like

745
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:46,480
i mean what you learn is that

746
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,640
you can you travel somewhere and you can

747
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,960
get infected and bring it back home yes

748
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,520
here in the us we do have

749
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,840
certain kinds of parasites but

750
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,839
because of our lifestyle we more or less

751
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,480
have avoided them for example there is a

752
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,278
parasite called toxoplasma

753
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,038
which

754
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,038
has is infected most of the world

755
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,519
actually because a lot of people like to

756
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,200
eat raw meat and you would get it from

757
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,879
from raw meat and

758
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,159
we're not as fond of that here in the

759
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,679
u.s

760
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,440
we like to cook our meat but that could

761
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,360
be a consequence of

762
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,759
eating raw meat is that what leads to

763
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:23,158
what is it called taxoplasmosis

764
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,158
yeah so toxoplasmosis

765
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,360
it's mainly

766
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,759
a big issue is if you're pregnant and

767
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,879
you get toxo then your fetus is going to

768
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,119
be

769
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,240
very badly malformed it's going to have

770
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,038
brain defects and so forth

771
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,359
and

772
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,879
animals can get it as well

773
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,199
so there are a lot of parasites of that

774
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,278
nature which you often acquire by food

775
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,600
eating food of different sorts and it

776
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,919
usually happens elsewhere we just on

777
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,678
this week in parasitism we do

778
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,759
a case so daniel griffin is a resident

779
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,000
physician he's a doctor a real doctor

780
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,798
right and he every month he comes up

781
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,200
with a case okay this is a person i saw

782
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,960
and last month this young lady had

783
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,640
traveled somewhere

784
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,159
and

785
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,440
she ate

786
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,120
raw fish

787
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,840
she was just somewhere southeast asia or

788
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:15,918
something and she ended up with uh with

789
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:17,678
with red bumps all over her skin it

790
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,159
turned out was a parasite from the fish

791
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,679
that moved around in her and and they're

792
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,039
very easy to cure

793
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,559
we have you have to write doctors and

794
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,119
the right drugs you can cure all these

795
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,639
what about diagnose like connect the red

796
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,479
spots to the fact that it's a parasite

797
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,320
it's very easy to if you have the right

798
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,599
diagnostics now daniel often goes to

799
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,839
parts of the world where they don't have

800
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,839
diagnostics and he has to

801
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,240
use other mechanisms he may have to take

802
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:41,599
a bit and look at it under a microscope

803
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,679
and then he may not be able to get the

804
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:45,678
drug depending on where he is

805
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,440
but if these but often he sees patients

806
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,759
who come back to the us and they get

807
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,200
diarrhea or they have a fever and he

808
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,879
said where have you been and he can put

809
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,640
two and two together and so we let our

810
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,200
listeners do that and they all send in

811
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,320
guesses and it's wonderful to hear them

812
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,240
go through this so there are a lot of

813
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,839
parasites puzzle and solvent that can

814
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,000
get you you have to be careful about

815
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,798
eating when you go overseas and water

816
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,720
too water as well and you know in parts

817
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:11,119
of africa there are parasites in the

818
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,960
lakes that if you go swimming they can

819
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,798
invade you and in fact it can go into

820
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,079
your hair follicles and burrow in and

821
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,119
get into your bloodstream that's

822
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,720
exciting so um daniel is interesting

823
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,719
because he's very adventurous he doesn't

824
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,720
he's not afraid of any of this

825
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,079
so there's a famous lake in africa lake

826
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,759
malawi

827
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,599
where which harbors a lot of these

828
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,359
parasites and he said oh yeah yeah i

829
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,038
just make sure i towel off vigorously

830
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,038
when i get out

831
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,359
and get yours get rid of them and that

832
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,158
was the name of an an episode but you

833
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:40,798
know food

834
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:44,399
vigorously you know sushi you can uh you

835
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:46,720
can get worms from sushi yeah and the

836
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,719
solution is to freeze it

837
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,880
and many sushi restaurants now have

838
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,960
liquid nitrogen they snap freeze their

839
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,278
sushi and that kills all the parasites

840
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,759
and a study was actually done

841
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,919
in japan showing that freezing does not

842
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,599
alter the taste of sushi because oh wow

843
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,120
except you see a big industry yeah

844
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,398
that's brilliant

845
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,278
that's brilliant

846
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:10,479
yeah um i i was thinking about

847
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:12,398
you know i'm so boring and bland

848
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,599
that especially when i am now in texas

849
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:15,839
here and i've been eating quite a bit of

850
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,199
barbecue i realized i really haven't

851
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,879
explored

852
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,798
the culinary world

853
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,039
and i've been curious to travel and

854
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,839
taste different foods is there something

855
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,919
you can say by way of

856
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:30,959
advice uh you know channeling daniel i

857
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:33,120
guess if you were to travel in the world

858
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,480
if eating is the thing that gets you the

859
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,038
parasites

860
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,038
what's good advice for eating

861
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,679
in uh strange parts of the world

862
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,119
mongolia india china

863
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,360
is there something you could say by way

864
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,119
of advice i think daniel would say make

865
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:49,678
sure your food is cooked

866
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,158
right but that's so boring yeah it's

867
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,880
unfortunate and he would agree with you

868
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,520
because you know many vegetables are

869
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,960
delicious salads even are delicious not

870
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:02,879
cooked but they can have parasites in

871
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,159
them meats fish people like to have

872
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,520
uncooked fish

873
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,039
so if you want to be really safe and

874
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,759
boring just make sure everything is

875
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,879
cooked now we have a case this week on

876
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,038
twip

877
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,960
of a young man who went

878
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:18,000
i forgot where he went but he stayed in

879
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,319
a hotel i think he oh oaxaca mexico

880
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,919
stayed in a hotel

881
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,599
and he said to dan he came back with

882
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,840
diarrhea and fever

883
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,158
and he said i don't know where i stayed

884
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,720
in the hotel i just ate hotel food lots

885
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,240
of vegetables and fruits and

886
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,759
probably they weren't washed with clean

887
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,798
water you know he got something from

888
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,679
that

889
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,200
the bottom line is most of these

890
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,120
infections with parasites can be

891
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,720
diagnosed and you can be treated and

892
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,918
you'll be fine

893
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,000
so if you really want to

894
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,759
experience the cuisine i don't think you

895
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,759
should worry about it that's what daniel

896
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:53,200
would say let's return to the basics

897
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:54,879
we're gonna jump around all over the

898
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,440
place

899
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,039
what are the basic principles of

900
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:04,000
virology maybe a good place to start is

901
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,759
what is a virus that's great i mean i

902
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,440
talk in my first lecture for 20 minutes

903
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,759
before i get to that

904
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,360
but and i wonder if i should put it up

905
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,599
front but it's kind of a boring

906
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,678
definition so if you do that first

907
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,519
people will turn off so first you tell

908
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,559
them about all the millions and billions

909
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,558
of viruses around so a virus we have a

910
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,000
very specific definition

911
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,759
because it's different from everything

912
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,880
else on the planet

913
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,720
um because first of all it's a parasite

914
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,000
it takes a parasite means you take

915
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,919
something from someone else you know we

916
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,960
have human parasites who take money from

917
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,840
others right but in biological terms

918
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,159
a parasite takes something from the host

919
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,158
that the host would otherwise use energy

920
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,760
or some building block or something

921
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,320
there's never really a symbiotic

922
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,480
relationship between a virus and a host

923
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,558
well there can be so that's the

924
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,079
dichotomy i think is that we define them

925
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:59,759
as parasites yet i just told you 20

926
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,439
minutes ago that many viruses are

927
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,879
probably beneficial

928
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,480
so i think

929
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,399
what it means is we at some point we're

930
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,480
going to have to change our definition

931
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:11,119
right because

932
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,759
after all definitions we make are just

933
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:15,759
constructs that make it easier for us to

934
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,240
study that not necessarily represent

935
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,720
what's right yeah right like uh like

936
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,319
pluto was a planet at first and now it's

937
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,240
not a planet anymore and a lot of people

938
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,319
are very upset but it's only according

939
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,079
to us there may be another race living

940
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,839
somewhere else who thinks it's a planet

941
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,599
right well maybe that's why viruses are

942
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:35,278
attacking humans they're very angry they

943
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:36,639
weren't uh calling them parasites so

944
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:37,919
right now our definition includes

945
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,000
parasite

946
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,278
because a virus cannot do anything

947
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,079
without a cell

948
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:45,599
if i if this mug were full of viruses it

949
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,519
would not do anything

950
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,519
for years it would eventually probably

951
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,919
lose its infectivity but it's not going

952
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,278
to reproduce here it needs cells

953
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,038
and you know to the first people who

954
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:57,759
discovered viruses that was astounding

955
00:32:55,038 --> 00:33:00,640
that they didn't just reproduce divide

956
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:02,640
on their own like bacteria so a virus

957
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,480
needs to get inside of a cell

958
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,200
inside the cell it can't just hang

959
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,440
around on the surface it needs to get in

960
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,000
in order to make more of itself and so

961
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,399
we call it an obligate intracellular

962
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,640
parasite because it needs to get in a

963
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,319
cell and then it takes things

964
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,720
from the cell in the form of all kinds

965
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:23,519
of molecules and processes and energy

966
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,440
and so forth to make new viruses

967
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,079
obligate means it's obligated to be

968
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,798
inside the cell absolutely it will not

969
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:35,439
reproduce outside of the cell so this

970
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:37,759
mug of viruses is can in no way be

971
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,080
living in my opinion however once it

972
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,798
gets inside of a cell now the cell is a

973
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,278
virus infected cell it's alive so a

974
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:48,079
virus in my view has two phases right

975
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:50,000
it's this non-living particulate phase

976
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,000
that everyone is used to

977
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,558
yeah i'll send you you need a virus for

978
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,079
your table i'll send you a nice model i

979
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:57,678
think it would look good here yes you

980
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:59,439
have to go with all this other stuff

981
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,600
yeah well these are all mechanical

982
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,440
there's no biology here so you wouldn't

983
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:05,359
want a virus here no i'd wanna buy of

984
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,278
course i'll send you one and look at

985
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,918
that you can look at it because now that

986
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:12,800
we have the three-dimensional structures

987
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,319
solved by structural biologists we take

988
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,320
the coordinates so we put it in a 3d

989
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,919
printer and you can make amazing models

990
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,760
right

991
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,799
of any virus and so there's a huge

992
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,399
variety of viruses huge that we know of

993
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,839
yeah which is only a fraction of what's

994
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,000
out there what's the categories so

995
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:30,878
there's rna there's dna viruses what

996
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,480
what are those what's dna and rna two

997
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:35,598
two

998
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,838
broad categorizations rna and these are

999
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,119
genetic material it can be two different

1000
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:40,639
chemicals

1001
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,480
so rna

1002
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,559
everything else on the planet besides

1003
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,559
viruses is all dna based you and i are

1004
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:49,358
dna based everything on the planet today

1005
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,519
is dna based except some viruses are rna

1006
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:54,480
based and that's because

1007
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:56,239
as i mentioned earlier the first

1008
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,920
life that arose on the planet was

1009
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,078
rna-based yeah so these are like

1010
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,559
old-school viruses they're old-school

1011
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,640
these are we call relics yeah they're

1012
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,239
relics and this has got a name it's

1013
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:08,400
called the rna world which i think is

1014
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,799
great is it big still or they are the

1015
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,599
relics dying out oh no the relics in my

1016
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,920
opinion are the most successful viruses

1017
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,519
the rna viruses and the source cov2 is

1018
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,920
an rna virus we can talk about why

1019
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:22,639
they're so successful but you have

1020
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,880
broadly speaking viruses with rna

1021
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,639
genetic information which are relics

1022
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,800
of course they're contemporary they have

1023
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,039
adapted to the modern world

1024
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,280
and the modern organisms living in it

1025
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,440
and then we have dna based viruses which

1026
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,519
are extremely conservative

1027
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,119
and slow they're very successful you

1028
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,719
know everyone has a herpes virus

1029
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,519
infection but

1030
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:43,279
they

1031
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,079
they don't get the news like the rna

1032
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,960
viruses do the hivs and the influenza

1033
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,000
viruses and the um sars coronaviruses

1034
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,800
they get all the press and they're

1035
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,599
rna-based because rna lets you change

1036
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,480
more so than dna so they they've evolved

1037
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,280
much faster rna viruses much faster and

1038
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,480
in fact when i i have an electron

1039
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,400
evolution i don't know if you've

1040
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,679
listened to that one you should it's

1041
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,079
really i think it's really interesting

1042
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:11,199
rna viruses exist

1043
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,680
at

1044
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,919
their error threshold

1045
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,239
which means they can't make any more

1046
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,440
mutations when they reproduce otherwise

1047
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,838
they're dead

1048
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,519
they don't extinct they're evolving at

1049
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:26,159
their error threshold

1050
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,239
dna viruses are hundreds of times lower

1051
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,920
than their error thresholds

1052
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,078
and we know this we can do an experiment

1053
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,519
to find that out now why that is is a

1054
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,359
good question

1055
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:38,159
but uh

1056
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:40,480
that's that's the reason why rna viruses

1057
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:43,440
are far more successful they infect many

1058
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,000
more hosts and they're very i would say

1059
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,400
slippery they can change hosts really

1060
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,320
quickly because in any animal harboring

1061
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,160
an rna virus

1062
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,119
like let's say a bat in some cave

1063
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,199
somewhere it's not just one genome it's

1064
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,000
it's millions of different genomes of

1065
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:59,919
all

1066
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,760
kinds with all within the framework of

1067
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,079
say coronavirus but they're all

1068
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,480
different and one genome in there might

1069
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,320
just be right for infecting a person if

1070
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,838
it ever encountered that person i mean

1071
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,838
that's the thing that well there could

1072
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,239
be a large number this is a tiny

1073
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:16,320
fraction but a large number of uh of

1074
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,519
them and they're all operating at the

1075
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,880
threshold of

1076
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,719
error that's right that's fascinating

1077
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,200
it's like little like uh it's like

1078
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,039
startups little entrepreneurs like a

1079
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,480
startup world yes and many of them fail

1080
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,079
yeah many of the changes and then

1081
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,800
there's the dna of ours that are like

1082
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,119
the ibm and exactly exactly big

1083
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,560
corporations it's very good conservative

1084
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,240
with the bureaucracies and all that kind

1085
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,078
of stuff so there's a lot of baggage

1086
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,000
yeah yeah it's expensive for them to

1087
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,839
reproduce yeah and they don't move

1088
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,280
quickly yes the rna viruses are the

1089
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:45,519
fast-moving

1090
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,800
members so that's what a virus is we

1091
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:48,960
call them

1092
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,880
obligated intracellular parasites and

1093
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,800
then i told you there's dna in rna but

1094
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,079
then let's go further

1095
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,200
the the nucleic acid is not naked

1096
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,079
because naked nucleic acid in the world

1097
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:04,078
isn't good i mean it it existed in the

1098
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,079
in the pre-cellular world but there

1099
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,039
probably weren't a lot of threats to it

1100
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,039
then

1101
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,320
naked nucleic acid doesn't last long in

1102
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,159
the environment so they're they're

1103
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,000
covered the nucleic acid is covered it

1104
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,759
can be covered with a protein shell a

1105
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,199
pure protein shell

1106
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,440
or it can have a membrane around it

1107
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,319
which would be uh lipids from the host

1108
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,358
cell

1109
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,400
so

1110
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:28,719
lipids so it's a fatty membrane fatty

1111
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,480
membrane yeah so our cells are

1112
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:32,319
coated with fatty membranes right our

1113
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,320
cells the outer plasma membrane right

1114
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,160
that's the same viruses can be too so

1115
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,240
they're kind of like cells but without

1116
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,319
the ability to do the mitochondria stuff

1117
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,639
some some are some they don't have

1118
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,720
nuclei they don't have mitochondria yeah

1119
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:46,639
but they do have a nucleic acid they

1120
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,639
have a membrane and then of course there

1121
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:51,118
are spikes in the membrane

1122
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,960
that allow them to attach to cells

1123
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,480
and so that completes our two different

1124
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,199
kinds so they have they all have like

1125
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,280
attachment mechanisms like ways to

1126
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:02,639
like keys into the into the city they

1127
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,880
all have to get into cells there are

1128
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:08,319
there are a couple of exceptions though

1129
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,480
uh there are viruses of fungi

1130
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,559
uh and uh plants

1131
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,480
so let's do the fungi fungi would be

1132
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,920
like yeast

1133
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:20,559
the virus yeast cell wall is pretty hard

1134
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,639
to get through so viruses typically

1135
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,320
don't attach to a yeast and get inside

1136
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,440
rather they just live in the yeast

1137
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,599
forever yeah and they multiply as mostly

1138
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,280
nucleic acids and as the yeast divide

1139
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,000
they go into the daughter cells and

1140
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,599
that's how they exist plant viruses also

1141
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,480
the plant cell wall

1142
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,400
would be very hard to get across with a

1143
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,119
by binding a protein

1144
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,559
so plant viruses get into plants either

1145
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,200
by

1146
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:48,880
pests that inject them in

1147
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,039
they're sucking sap out and they inject

1148
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,559
virus at the same time or farmers they

1149
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,960
have contaminated farm equipment and

1150
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:57,599
they roll over the plants and introduces

1151
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,079
viruses so those fungi and plant viruses

1152
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,599
they don't have this specific receptor

1153
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,680
binding to get them into the cell but

1154
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,280
everything else yeah the virus binds to

1155
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,279
something on the surface very specific

1156
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,880
it's taken into the cell because that's

1157
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,359
what cells do

1158
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,599
when things bind their exterior

1159
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:15,679
they take it in because in most cases

1160
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,680
it's good it's something they need

1161
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,440
and so the virus slips in i guess you'd

1162
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:21,399
call that a trojan horse right frozen

1163
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,519
horse it's so hard to not

1164
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,920
anthropomorphize this whole thing it is

1165
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:26,800
hard so obviously they don't know any of

1166
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,358
this

1167
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,119
it's not an actual trojan horse

1168
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:32,719
so that they

1169
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,559
they're not getting actually tricked in

1170
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,318
the way humans trick each other

1171
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,480
no it's all passive and it's just

1172
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:40,800
through so many years of evolution it's

1173
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,000
you select something that works

1174
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,640
and

1175
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
it continues and what survives then goes

1176
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,159
on with the

1177
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,159
uh perhaps a slightly different approach

1178
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:52,719
i love this idea of past of course

1179
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,078
according to sam harris uh so from a

1180
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,078
sufficiently intelligent alien

1181
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,160
civilization observing humans our

1182
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,160
behavior might seem passive too because

1183
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,159
they understand fully exactly what we're

1184
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,920
doing and then there's no free will and

1185
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,838
we're all just operating in the same way

1186
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,680
it could be a cell does which is a much

1187
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:10,318
higher level of complexity

1188
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:13,118
yeah so i love the distinction between

1189
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,119
active and passive i mean the point is i

1190
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,640
think anthropomorphizing to a certain

1191
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,680
extent is fine because it helps people

1192
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,000
understand

1193
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:22,000
but when you start to say i think the

1194
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,838
virus is doing that because then you're

1195
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,159
putting a human

1196
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,679
lens on it and you may be wrong

1197
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:28,719
yeah because you don't know why things

1198
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:30,879
happen

1199
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,279
for a virus

1200
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,960
so right now we have variants emerging

1201
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,960
and people say well i think it's because

1202
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,000
the antibodies are selecting for

1203
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,000
variants

1204
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,760
that's a good idea but it may not be the

1205
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,679
only thing that's going on you start

1206
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,839
imagining them coming to the table

1207
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:46,639
negotiating

1208
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,000
yeah

1209
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,440
you get into trouble with that that's

1210
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,760
right that's why i tell my students be

1211
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,960
careful about the anthropomorphizing

1212
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,359
because

1213
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,960
you're going to apply your values to a

1214
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,039
virus and you have different value

1215
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,800
you're human and you have

1216
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,400
what you think is the reason for this

1217
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,480
outcome may not be right that's all just

1218
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,480
be open-minded yeah about it in both

1219
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,760
directions i actually one of the things

1220
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,119
that push back

1221
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,200
on is in in the space of robotics people

1222
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,280
most people in robotics try to not

1223
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:17,598
anthropomorphize for example they don't

1224
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,319
give a gender or a name to robots they

1225
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,680
really try to see it as a machine and to

1226
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:25,039
me that makes sense in one in one way

1227
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,598
but it totally doesn't make sense in

1228
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,440
another if that robot is to interact

1229
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,720
operate in the human world and interact

1230
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,119
with humans

1231
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,838
we have to we have to anthropomorphize

1232
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,920
it

1233
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,960
in order to understand

1234
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,079
as an engineering problem

1235
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,159
how should it operate in a human world

1236
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,000
now the difference with viruses the

1237
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,159
scale of operation

1238
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
it doesn't make sense to treat them as

1239
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:51,838
human-like because the scale of

1240
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,838
operations is much smaller but with

1241
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:55,599
robots you're on the same sure time

1242
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:57,039
scale the same spatial scale of course

1243
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,760
in the movies they always give them

1244
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:01,599
names and personalities yeah well yeah

1245
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,280
that's the move but that's my argument

1246
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,119
is we should do the same when you're

1247
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,880
trying to solve the engineering problem

1248
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,119
of robotics too it's not just for the

1249
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,480
movies well let me ask you this because

1250
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,039
you've said

1251
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,119
controversially not really that uh

1252
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:17,119
viruses are not living

1253
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,039
um

1254
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,119
defend yourself

1255
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:23,838
so are viruses alive or not so i've seen

1256
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,680
many people say oh they have to be they

1257
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,119
they have nucleic acids they evolve they

1258
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:29,118
mutate

1259
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,880
that's all true but they don't do it on

1260
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,480
their own the particles in my mug are

1261
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,838
just not doing any of that unless they

1262
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,400
get into a cell

1263
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,799
so a virus infected cell is alive i

1264
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,519
totally agree with that because in fact

1265
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,440
when a virus gets in a cell it converts

1266
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,079
it into a virus making

1267
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,480
factory if you will it's no longer a

1268
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,240
cell it's a some people call it a viral

1269
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,119
cell i don't really like that but it's

1270
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:53,039
fine

1271
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,440
so that's what i'm talking about the

1272
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,920
particle is not alive you can have your

1273
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,200
virus infected cell as as alive but the

1274
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,680
particle it just would not do anything

1275
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:05,279
forever without getting inside of a cell

1276
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:07,358
well once it's in the cells

1277
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,440
it it it is alive then but it's no

1278
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,199
longer a particle it's taken apart and

1279
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,440
nucleic acid is moving around the cell

1280
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,199
it's making proteins eventually it makes

1281
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,720
new particles and then those particles

1282
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:18,719
released from the cell they're not

1283
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:20,399
living anymore so

1284
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,598
it's kind of i think it's kind of like a

1285
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,039
spore a spore of a

1286
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,720
or a seed

1287
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,039
although the seed just doesn't work

1288
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,399
because the seeds the cells in the seed

1289
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:31,920
have the ability to make their own

1290
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,079
energy and so forth

1291
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,599
but a bacterial spore and it's the same

1292
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,039
thing doesn't do anything unless you add

1293
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,318
water and nutrients and then it starts

1294
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:39,838
to divide but it doesn't need to get

1295
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,318
into a cell it's very different from a

1296
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:45,199
virus so that's why the particle

1297
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:47,279
and when people think of virus

1298
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,199
they're always thinking of the particle

1299
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,640
and that's why i say it can't be alive

1300
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,480
because the particle can't do anything

1301
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,400
on its own but if you think of a virus

1302
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,800
as an organism with a particle phase and

1303
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,240
a part in a cell then it makes sense to

1304
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,760
be alive

1305
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,199
and by the way when you say particle

1306
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,960
you're referring to that structure that

1307
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,118
you've been mentioning so right membrane

1308
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,280
and not that that's that's been called

1309
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,440
what is a viron particle or something

1310
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,000
so what you should have here i'll send

1311
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,800
you one and then you can refer to what's

1312
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,838
the sexiest one to have like what what

1313
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,599
in terms of particles to have on the

1314
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:21,358
table well unfortunately the ones that

1315
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,960
you can 3d print

1316
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:24,400
oh they're not going to be so they're

1317
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,280
they're only they're the ones that we

1318
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,480
know the structures of right so someone

1319
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,359
sent me

1320
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,880
last year a 3d model of source cov2 and

1321
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:34,960
it's beautiful it's actually cracked

1322
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,358
open so you can see the rna and the

1323
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,280
spikes are sticking out and they even

1324
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,759
put some antibodies sticking onto the

1325
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,359
spikes and that's i mean when i show

1326
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,440
this on a live stream people love this

1327
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,119
thing oh my god that's beautiful it is

1328
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,760
it's absolutely gorgeous i have that i

1329
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,240
have my virus that i worked on most of

1330
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,160
my career polio virus i have a 3d model

1331
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:55,919
of that which i actually just had made

1332
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:57,838
it's gorgeous and you can have it made

1333
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,960
in any color you want right what would

1334
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,519
you say

1335
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,480
is the most fascinating

1336
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,838
terrifying surprising beautiful virus to

1337
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,480
you so

1338
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:10,400
of all the viruses you looked at

1339
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,800
sometimes when you just sit late at

1340
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,800
night with a glass of wine looking over

1341
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,240
the sunset which virus do you think

1342
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,280
about

1343
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:19,519
so

1344
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,720
fulfilling all of those adjectives is

1345
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:22,960
hard

1346
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,598
right fascinating

1347
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,400
exciting terrifying well the terrifying

1348
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,318
is an optional one i think because

1349
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,599
maybe that puts a lot of pressure i see

1350
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:33,279
terrifying

1351
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,039
to me

1352
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,240
i'm not terrified because i think we can

1353
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,400
handle

1354
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:40,239
as most viruses as you see with this

1355
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,400
brand new one that emerged a year ago

1356
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:44,318
where we can handle it

1357
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,079
from a virology perspective yeah i mean

1358
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:48,559
the human perspective is a different

1359
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,760
story right that's always an issue but

1360
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,000
um

1361
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,319
so i i think

1362
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,400
there are a couple of different

1363
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,880
categories of virus so we could do the

1364
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,960
the terrifying and i think rabies is a

1365
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,240
terrifying virus because unless you're

1366
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,358
vaccinated

1367
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,838
100

1368
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,559
certainty you're going to die

1369
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:10,880
so you get bitten by a rabid raccoon or

1370
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:14,159
bat or dog whatever

1371
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,920
and you know and there's still 70 000

1372
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,118
deaths a year of rabies throughout the

1373
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,960
world because there are a lot of feral

1374
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,960
dogs running around that are infected

1375
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,599
unless you're vaccinated you're going to

1376
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,358
die there's nothing we can do but we do

1377
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,400
have a vaccine which we can actually

1378
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:28,078
give you

1379
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,200
even after you've been bitten which is

1380
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,039
the only

1381
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,519
vaccine that works that way

1382
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:36,000
it's a therapeutic right it will treat

1383
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:38,318
your illness because the disease takes

1384
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,920
so long to develop

1385
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:41,838
you know eventually you get all kinds of

1386
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,720
neurological issues and

1387
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,078
paralysis and so forth but it takes time

1388
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,078
and you can be vaccinated it will

1389
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,160
prevent that in the meanwhile so people

1390
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,400
always say what's the most lethal virus

1391
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,799
is it ebola i said no it's actually

1392
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,920
rabies unless you're vaccinated it will

1393
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,079
kill you

1394
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,119
maybe it's good to linger because we'll

1395
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,280
talk about vaccines a few times today

1396
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:08,079
it's good to linger

1397
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,079
on cases where vaccines have clearly

1398
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:13,679
undoubtedly helped human civilization

1399
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,000
and it seems like

1400
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,358
rabies is a good example oh rapist is

1401
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,119
great because

1402
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:21,279
everyone knows what happens when

1403
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,200
somebody gets rabies right

1404
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,079
you have fear of water

1405
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:30,318
hydrophobia

1406
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:32,000
your body becomes and stiff and

1407
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:34,558
jerks around and

1408
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,639
you lose consciousness you can't

1409
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,200
no no more not a fun ride to death it's

1410
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:40,960
horrible it's a horrible way to die

1411
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,759
so i think most people know that it's

1412
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,519
been popularized enough in in media

1413
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,119
right so that nobody would probably

1414
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,440
object to getting

1415
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,039
oh i was just bit by this raccoon and it

1416
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,039
ran off

1417
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,800
okay well we should assume it's rabid we

1418
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:56,639
should immunize you and most people are

1419
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,240
okay with that yeah because they know

1420
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:59,118
the consequences and it's also pretty

1421
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:01,199
rare

1422
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,680
right it's not like something that

1423
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,558
you're trying to get into the arms of

1424
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:07,039
you know

1425
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,680
three 250 300 million americans that's

1426
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,920
hard but yeah the the the the few

1427
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,838
thousand every year is easy so the

1428
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,119
transmissibility is difficult right it

1429
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:16,960
has to

1430
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,800
oh it's not it's not airborne so now

1431
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,280
you're bored it just has to be you have

1432
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,800
to be bitten although some some people

1433
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,640
claim you could

1434
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,640
walk into a cave

1435
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,639
and the bats you know breathing out

1436
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,879
rabies virus could infect you but i

1437
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:33,039
don't really think that's well that's

1438
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,800
well substantiated yeah i think it's a

1439
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:36,800
bike how would you do a study on that

1440
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,640
yeah it's very hard to do you'd have to

1441
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,640
collect the vapors in the cave and show

1442
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,799
that they're infectious which

1443
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:44,639
and by the way someone emailed me the

1444
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,318
other day you'll like this they say why

1445
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:48,000
can't we just immunize all the bats in

1446
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:49,599
the world

1447
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,199
against these viruses and i said well

1448
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,119
how would you do that there's caves

1449
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:54,960
everywhere right yeah

1450
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,559
he said well maybe you could just go and

1451
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,800
aerosolize that

1452
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,720
yeah it's pretty dangerous and then and

1453
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,559
then all the bats should have vaccine

1454
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,078
passports to make sure that they're yeah

1455
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,280
so you have to get their consent before

1456
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,079
you do it

1457
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,720
but

1458
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:12,000
you we do

1459
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:14,959
immunize wildlife against rabies

1460
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
we have rabies vaccines for wild animals

1461
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,358
there are a whole bunch of them that get

1462
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,159
rabies

1463
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:21,679
and we put it we put it in bait and drop

1464
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,000
it from helicopters in the woods and it

1465
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:26,159
drops down the incidence of rabies and

1466
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,519
people wow you know people hiking get

1467
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:29,440
bitten and so forth it drops the

1468
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:31,838
incident so we can do that i didn't know

1469
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,599
that i always wondered how much medical

1470
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:35,199
care are we doing for animals in the

1471
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,440
wild because

1472
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:40,078
i've recently become more and more aware

1473
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,519
that animals are living in extreme

1474
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,280
poverty

1475
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,679
right like you don't know you think like

1476
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:49,200
natural it's great

1477
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:51,838
um you know like uh like when animals

1478
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,598
are living on a farm it's terrible but

1479
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,159
then you also have to compare to like

1480
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,838
what life is like and or like the zoo

1481
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,199
you have to compare what life is like in

1482
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,279
in the wild

1483
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:02,799
life in the wild is very tough i think i

1484
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,240
mean most animals have to well the

1485
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,318
carnivores anyway they have to catch

1486
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,959
their food every day yeah right and then

1487
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:11,838
there's the viruses there and viruses as

1488
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,760
well so the rabies immunization is the

1489
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:17,440
only

1490
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:20,000
one i'm aware of for wild animals um

1491
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,480
we do immunize lots of other

1492
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,960
animals so we immunize

1493
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,519
chickens and pigs and cows

1494
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,440
even fish farmed fish we

1495
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:31,039
pick each fish up and give it an

1496
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,400
injection you know when it's a small

1497
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:34,239
fish

1498
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,240
but that's mostly

1499
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:38,078
so that the farmers get a good yield we

1500
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:40,159
don't really care about the animals

1501
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,318
right we want a good yield for

1502
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:44,558
market and then there's some examples

1503
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:47,279
where we

1504
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,839
immunize animals to prevent

1505
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,960
spillovers into

1506
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:53,358
people so there's a disease called

1507
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,280
hendra in australia

1508
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:56,239
which

1509
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,400
was

1510
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:00,318
discovered in the 90s it turns out that

1511
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,318
there are bats fruit bats that have this

1512
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:04,000
virus and the bats are fine

1513
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:05,039
but sometimes they flying into horse

1514
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,880
stalls

1515
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,880
and the horses get infected these are in

1516
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,039
australia it was initially race horses

1517
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,800
which are very expensive right

1518
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:14,159
the horses got infected and they died

1519
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,318
and the humans who would take care of

1520
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:18,078
them would die also so now they immunize

1521
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,318
the horses

1522
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,599
to prevent the well to save the horses

1523
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:23,199
probably that's the motivation because

1524
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,039
these horses are hundreds of thousands

1525
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:26,960
of dollars right and then the people

1526
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:28,719
don't get sick because the horses don't

1527
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,199
get sick you don't want to immunize all

1528
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:33,358
the people because it's too rare but

1529
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:35,199
that approach is called one world health

1530
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:37,039
approach which means everything's

1531
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,318
connected on the planet

1532
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:40,880
and we have to think of everything in

1533
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:42,800
the grander scheme not just us

1534
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,559
yeah so you can immunize some things

1535
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,960
along the trajectory that a virus would

1536
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,160
take exactly so something some living

1537
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,240
beings

1538
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,558
in the arabian peninsula they have a

1539
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:55,679
mers coronavirus issue every month there

1540
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,519
are a couple of cases where a camel

1541
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,960
will infect the human and the human can

1542
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:01,358
get very sick

1543
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,119
it's respiratory disease very very much

1544
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:04,400
like covid

1545
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,079
and so

1546
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,639
camels are very common there they're

1547
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:10,480
used they're raced they're used as pets

1548
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:12,400
they're eaten

1549
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,639
so there's a lot of human camel contact

1550
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,920
but the number of cases are rare two to

1551
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,679
a month so you don't want to immunize

1552
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,240
all the humans so the idea would be to

1553
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:23,598
immunize the camels

1554
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:25,679
so i like it so okay so you put rabies

1555
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:30,000
but ebola

1556
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:32,078
uh also is a famously deadly one right

1557
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,679
what is it it kills like i don't know 50

1558
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:38,079
60 percent of it could be 50 to 90 but

1559
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:40,318
that's in africa where the health care

1560
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,400
isn't great what you saw when they when

1561
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:44,000
cases of ebola came to the u.s

1562
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,680
we were we could take care of it we knew

1563
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,358
how to take care of we had fancy

1564
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:48,960
hospitals and so forth and now we have a

1565
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:52,159
vaccine so

1566
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,559
we can and the vaccine is really good

1567
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:56,879
but there are many governments in africa

1568
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,640
who that are suspicious of of us and

1569
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,559
they don't want to use our vaccines so

1570
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:02,639
they so there's a vaccine for ebola

1571
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,200
there is yeah and uh

1572
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:07,440
the effectiveness and safety of it to

1573
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,759
how much is understood so

1574
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,838
this is difficult because there's not a

1575
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,000
lot of ebola right

1576
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:15,838
it's not a continuous ongoing thing

1577
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,318
there are sporadic outbreaks here and

1578
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,799
there of a few thousand people at most

1579
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:22,639
at most usually a few hundred and

1580
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,240
the biggest ever

1581
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:26,879
in fact this is why we didn't for years

1582
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:28,879
have an ebola vaccine the us military

1583
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,559
together with canada developed an ebola

1584
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,079
vaccine for service people right they

1585
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,079
wanted to say well we're sending people

1586
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,839
into these ebola areas we want a vaccine

1587
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,960
for them so they had developed it

1588
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:38,960
through

1589
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,960
all the pre-clinical which means before

1590
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,798
it goes into people

1591
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,039
and that stopped because there was no

1592
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:47,440
money to do a phase one and a phase two

1593
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:48,960
and a phase three in fact for phase two

1594
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,480
and three you need to have infections

1595
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,318
going on because you're looking at how

1596
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,798
well the vaccine prevents infections

1597
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:56,960
right so then there was a west african

1598
00:54:54,798 --> 00:55:00,798
outbreak in 2015

1599
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,679
2013 2015. the most cases ever 25 000 so

1600
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,039
they got to test the vaccine

1601
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:07,039
but

1602
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:09,119
they only put it in a few thousand

1603
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,719
people it's not like it's been in

1604
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,798
hundreds of thousands of people like the

1605
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,798
covid vaccines has been so

1606
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:16,239
it's it looks like it's it has high

1607
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,559
efficacy

1608
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:21,358
um but we'd like to have more data

1609
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,400
side effects may be are not so great

1610
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:24,400
there are a couple of different

1611
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,000
available vaccines some have been tested

1612
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,280
more than others

1613
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,199
i would say

1614
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,440
this would probably not be widely

1615
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:32,960
accepted in the u.s

1616
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,480
but then

1617
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,480
neither would be

1618
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,199
something over 50

1619
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:42,000
uh deadliness of a virus no i think if

1620
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:43,598
you are in fact many physicians work in

1621
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,280
countries that have ebola so they get

1622
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,200
vaccinated because they understand the

1623
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,359
choice yeah right it's always about the

1624
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:52,159
choice um so

1625
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:53,358
so then one more thing to answer the

1626
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,358
interesting

1627
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:56,960
what are some of the viruses you really

1628
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:57,838
are fascinated by

1629
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,079
there are

1630
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:02,000
a number of viruses that

1631
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:04,559
have clearly been shown to alter host

1632
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
behavior and that's how they spread

1633
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,839
i think those are fascinating for

1634
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,119
example

1635
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:14,798
there are some viruses of plants

1636
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:17,760
that are spread by aphids

1637
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:20,400
and the aphid bites the plant the virus

1638
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,280
reproduces in the plant and it somehow

1639
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,559
engineers the plant to give off volatile

1640
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,119
organics

1641
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:30,079
to attract more aphids which will spread

1642
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,519
the virus

1643
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,960
isn't that amazing

1644
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:37,119
yeah so that's altering the behavior

1645
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,039
altering because somehow the virus

1646
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,720
infecting the plant cells gives off

1647
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:42,719
these organics and it contracts aphids

1648
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,879
and furthermore

1649
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:47,118
somehow the when the aphid bites it

1650
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,960
tastes horrible so they immediately

1651
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:51,119
leave with the virus they've just picked

1652
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,880
up and go to another plant to spread it

1653
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,400
so they're attracted and then repulsed

1654
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,160
at the same time and obviously you don't

1655
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,079
want to anthropomorphize this like a

1656
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:59,920
strategy they're taking on somehow this

1657
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,519
worked out it worked out this way it

1658
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,240
just evolved and you know evolution is

1659
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:05,119
sometimes hard to trace right

1660
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:06,798
like

1661
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,480
darwin famously said he could never

1662
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,079
figure out how an eye evolved from a

1663
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,039
single cell right but

1664
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,640
it did

1665
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:16,798
the more complicated complex the the

1666
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,078
holistic organism is that the virus

1667
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:20,318
invades

1668
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,079
the less able it is to control that

1669
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:26,000
organism right so i wonder if there's

1670
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:26,880
viruses that can control human behavior

1671
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,639
um

1672
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,920
you know to

1673
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,798
induce

1674
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,559
more spread of the virus

1675
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:36,639
well i don't see why not there's not

1676
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,480
enough humans i supposed to like evolve

1677
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:40,078
through well we can't do the experiment

1678
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,679
to test it right we have to observe and

1679
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,599
that's always hard when you're observing

1680
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:44,960
because there's so many things that can

1681
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,400
confound

1682
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,240
what you're looking at change human

1683
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,760
behavior yeah i mean there's so many

1684
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:54,959
things that impinge on our behavior but

1685
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,119
um yeah it's i think it's possible um i

1686
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,599
think it's highly possible if it does it

1687
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:01,280
in a plant why not change some other

1688
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,720
organisms behavior i think it's fine

1689
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,400
anyway those fascinate me there are lots

1690
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:07,118
of examples of those

1691
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,880
that are fascinating and how they work

1692
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,240
people are trying to figure out but

1693
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,160
there's not a lot of money to work on

1694
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:14,239
you know insect and plant viruses unless

1695
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:15,440
you're going to the usda so they don't

1696
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:18,000
get a lot of

1697
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:19,920
uh work moving forward well is there if

1698
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,639
you understand some of those viruses is

1699
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,039
that transferable to human viruses that

1700
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:27,519
understanding i think some of it could

1701
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:29,119
be sure i think the general principles

1702
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:31,280
for example how the

1703
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,519
how does the virus cause volatile

1704
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,960
organics to be made it must be turning

1705
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:37,280
on some genes

1706
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,280
and you could learn principles from that

1707
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,599
how the virus might do that sure i think

1708
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,720
everything is broadly applicable so to

1709
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,960
say

1710
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:47,279
it's not useful to study

1711
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,679
viruses of insects and plants is just

1712
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,599
wrong because in science you probably

1713
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:52,879
know this maybe in your field it's the

1714
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,240
same

1715
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,240
if you're curious you're going to run

1716
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,239
into interesting things that you never

1717
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:00,399
planned on right that's why people like

1718
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:03,519
you can criticize uh why do we want to

1719
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,280
go on mars why do we colonize mars

1720
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:06,639
well it's like why do you want to go to

1721
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,720
the moon

1722
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:10,078
the the reality is when you do really

1723
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:12,480
difficult things

1724
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,240
yeah engineering things like all these

1725
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,559
inventions along the way are created

1726
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:17,358
it's kind of fascinating how basically

1727
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,798
just

1728
00:59:17,358 --> 00:59:21,119
pick a

1729
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:23,519
pick a thing that everyone can agree

1730
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:25,680
it's kind of cool and it's really hard

1731
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,039
and do that and then you'll have like

1732
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:28,318
thousands of inventions that have

1733
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,558
nothing to do with the thing that's

1734
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:33,358
right i think you should let

1735
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,880
curious scientists just follow what

1736
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:36,239
they're interested in to a certain

1737
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,760
extent you can't

1738
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,519
you know in science we say we have

1739
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,359
translational research where we say okay

1740
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:43,519
here's some money go cure cancer or

1741
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:45,279
diabetes or heart disease whatever right

1742
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,519
and that's fine but that often doesn't

1743
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,760
work out very well what works better is

1744
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:51,039
to say here you're you have a good lab

1745
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,160
you have a good track record here's some

1746
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:54,798
money

1747
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:57,920
or something and that's where pcr

1748
00:59:54,798 --> 01:00:00,000
crisper recombinant dna all that stuff

1749
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,000
which has made the field explode that's

1750
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,639
all it came from not from people saying

1751
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,798
i want to cure genetic diseases by gene

1752
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:09,920
editing but by saying what are these

1753
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,960
repeated things in this bacterium doing

1754
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,639
yep

1755
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:17,440
can ask you a big philosophical question

1756
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:20,000
so there's these deadly viruses they're

1757
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:23,039
not very transmissible

1758
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,159
ebola rabies and then there's these less

1759
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:25,599
deadly viruses that are very

1760
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:26,719
transmissible

1761
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,760
um

1762
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:31,039
like uh like covid is i guess kind of

1763
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,839
borderline

1764
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:34,079
but

1765
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:38,239
uh why isn't there

1766
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:40,318
super transmissible super deadly viruses

1767
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:41,279
i think if you compare stars one and two

1768
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:44,000
you get

1769
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,519
somewhat of an answer right sars one was

1770
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,039
more deadly

1771
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:48,639
in fact

1772
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:50,318
over half of the time

1773
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:51,920
when people were infected

1774
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:53,440
they ended up in the hospital because

1775
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,519
they were that sick

1776
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,358
and then

1777
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:59,280
the peak of virus shedding from them

1778
01:00:57,358 --> 01:01:01,598
happened long after they went in the

1779
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,200
hospital so it's easy to contain

1780
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,559
uh the infection when you're in a

1781
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,399
hospital right

1782
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,599
there was not much

1783
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:12,160
pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic

1784
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,318
shedding with sars1 and shedding means

1785
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:16,480
you you're in you become infectious so

1786
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:18,719
in a respiratory virus you're you inhale

1787
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,480
the droplets with virus and they they

1788
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,798
reproduce in your upper respiratory

1789
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,400
tract what we call the nasopharynx right

1790
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:26,880
the nose and going back to that little

1791
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,480
cavity just above your mouth

1792
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,079
so the virus reproduces really well and

1793
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,159
then as you talk and sneeze and cough

1794
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,079
you expel droplets and then those are

1795
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,838
inhaled by other people and then they

1796
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:38,960
reproduce and

1797
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:40,558
for sars 2 we now know there's a lot of

1798
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:44,079
reproduction just before you feel

1799
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:46,960
anything if at all so there's a lot of

1800
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,798
shedding and transmission before you get

1801
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,880
symptomatic and many people don't ever

1802
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:52,798
get symptomatic right so they spread

1803
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,440
really easily

1804
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:57,599
so that explains why some viruses can

1805
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,000
transmit a lot better than others and if

1806
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,280
one happens to knock you out

1807
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,559
then you're never going to transmit

1808
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,000
because you're in the hospital like sar

1809
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:08,000
as one but why can't you have both why

1810
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,358
can't you just wait a while before he

1811
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,599
knocks you out but when it knocks you

1812
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:14,078
out it really kills you that's that is a

1813
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,000
philosophical question right because

1814
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:18,960
we could talk about why we haven't

1815
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,599
observed it i mean one one issue is that

1816
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,000
if you uh

1817
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,680
if you're killed too quickly by a highly

1818
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,119
lethal virus

1819
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:29,440
you're not going to transmit it very

1820
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,960
well right so ebola can kill you quite

1821
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,880
rapidly

1822
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:37,119
and most of the transmission occurs

1823
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,599
when people are being cared for at home

1824
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,920
or in hospitals the doctors and nurses

1825
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,200
get virus but people walking around

1826
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,039
you're not walking around when you have

1827
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:47,279
ebola you're too sick

1828
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,119
you know you have black bloody diarrhea

1829
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,839
you're vomiting you're

1830
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,680
you're bleeding from your skin and

1831
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:56,239
mucous membranes you're not walking

1832
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:59,118
around not going to parties so

1833
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:00,879
i think that's part of it that if if the

1834
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:03,599
infection is too lethal you're simply

1835
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:06,400
not a good transmitter and i think

1836
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:08,160
transmission is probably one of the most

1837
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,318
powerful selection

1838
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:12,960
forces for viruses because of ours

1839
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:14,000
always has to have find a new host if it

1840
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,559
doesn't

1841
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,960
it's a startup that fails right if it

1842
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:21,280
doesn't find a new host it's gone and so

1843
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,480
anything that makes the virus transmit

1844
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,519
better

1845
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,599
is going to help it and if killing you

1846
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:30,239
being less lethal is part of that that

1847
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,640
works too so there's a strong selection

1848
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,479
pressure against being lethal i think

1849
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:36,639
there's a strong selection of

1850
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,719
pressure against being lethal and

1851
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:40,078
being more transmissible

1852
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:41,919
those two

1853
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,280
seem to work in opposite ways and now we

1854
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,960
don't have a lot of data to support this

1855
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,920
this is kind of a

1856
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,000
thought

1857
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,480
experiment but there is one

1858
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,318
experiment done in australia

1859
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,280
many years ago i don't know if you know

1860
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:55,759
this but

1861
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,599
in the 1800s the hunters in australia

1862
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,359
imported a rabbit from europe so they

1863
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,960
could hunt it

1864
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:02,400
because the native rabbit in australia

1865
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,159
was too fast for them they couldn't

1866
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,519
shoot them so they brought in this

1867
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:07,679
european rabbit

1868
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:09,280
and they they reproduced out of control

1869
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,358
within a couple of years they were

1870
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,359
everywhere millions of rabbits and all

1871
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:15,199
the watering holes

1872
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:16,880
and now they had a problem so they

1873
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:18,960
decided to use a virus to get rid of

1874
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,838
these excess rabbits

1875
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,159
and they used a virus a pox virus called

1876
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:26,719
mixoma virus which is a natural virus of

1877
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,719
a different kind of rabbit but for these

1878
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:30,480
european rabbits it was quite lethal and

1879
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:33,679
it's spread by mosquitoes so they said

1880
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:36,440
okay let's let's uh release this virus

1881
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:40,239
and the first year

1882
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:42,079
99.2 of the rabbits were killed

1883
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:43,439
but that point eight percent that were

1884
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,599
left

1885
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,358
had some form of resistance they were

1886
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:49,440
variants you know every organism not

1887
01:04:47,358 --> 01:04:51,038
just viruses makes mutants and there

1888
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,519
were some variants of the rabbits that

1889
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,760
could survive infection and then in

1890
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:57,519
subsequent years the virus became less

1891
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,200
lethal and then

1892
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:00,639
the mosquitoes had a better shot of

1893
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:02,239
transmitting it from one rabbit to

1894
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:04,480
another if the rabbit lived longer

1895
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:06,959
that's the selection probably and so in

1896
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,480
the end the rabbits lived on the virus

1897
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,159
was there it evolved to be more

1898
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,960
transmissible and less

1899
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:13,358
uh

1900
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:16,000
lethal so that is amazing that's the

1901
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:17,920
only data that's amazing it is it is if

1902
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,079
you take the time to

1903
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,000
look at it and see what's happened it is

1904
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,519
amazing it's also humbling that it just

1905
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,318
makes you realize humans are just a

1906
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:28,318
small part of the picture of course

1907
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:30,798
and we're wrecking it aren't we

1908
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:32,318
well i mean that's that

1909
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:34,559
we're not really

1910
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:35,838
i mean viruses are wrecking it some way

1911
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,079
it's part of this we're not really

1912
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:40,239
wrecking anything it's all part of it

1913
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,318
but you know when

1914
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:44,399
the ways that human exists encourages

1915
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:47,838
viruses to infect us right when we were

1916
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:50,400
hunter-gatherers living in bands of 100

1917
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:52,639
people very few viruses because it was

1918
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,039
hard for the virus to go from one band

1919
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,480
to another and perhaps a hunter would

1920
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,799
one of these humans would get an animal

1921
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,079
and bring a virus at the camp and some

1922
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:01,519
people would die but it would never

1923
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,280
spread

1924
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:05,038
to another and then when we started to

1925
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,798
congregate in cities we figured out

1926
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,400
agriculture and so forth and how to

1927
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:10,159
harvest animals then we could get bigger

1928
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,318
and bigger populations and the viruses

1929
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:14,960
went crazy and they went from animals to

1930
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:17,440
us so measles went from cows to humans

1931
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:20,559
when humans learned to domesticate cows

1932
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,599
and and started gathering in big cities

1933
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:26,960
yeah but now that humans are able to

1934
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,640
communicate and travel globally

1935
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,679
the viruses become more and more

1936
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:33,358
dangerous transmissible

1937
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:35,279
thereby if you look at earth as an

1938
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:36,719
organism thereby pushing humans to be

1939
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,640
more innovative

1940
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:40,639
create alpha fold two and three and four

1941
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,798
and five create better systems and

1942
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:45,118
eventually there's rockets that keep

1943
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:47,358
flying from earth and eventually

1944
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:48,480
uh the virus is becoming super dangerous

1945
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:50,798
and threatening all of human

1946
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,719
civilization will force it to become a

1947
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,719
multi-planetary species and this

1948
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:57,038
organism starts expanding so i think

1949
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:59,598
it's a feature not a bug i don't know

1950
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:03,039
um well i think that we have

1951
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:06,079
our early probably the most of the when

1952
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:08,079
we're studying viruses since 1900 right

1953
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:10,960
most of that time was because of

1954
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,960
diseases they caused the first viruses

1955
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,280
discovered yellow fever

1956
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,798
virus smallpox

1957
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,640
poliovirus

1958
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:21,038
influenza virus

1959
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,719
those were all because people got sick

1960
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:26,079
and they said oh look this is a virus

1961
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:28,798
that's associated with it and so we got

1962
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,640
good at learning how to take care of

1963
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:32,159
these infections making vaccines and so

1964
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,798
forth over the years and it's only in

1965
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:36,159
the last 20 years that we recognize that

1966
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:38,239
there are more viruses out there that

1967
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:39,920
are far more interesting perhaps but

1968
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:42,239
we've learned how to deal with the bad

1969
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,358
ones for sure so we talked about what is

1970
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:44,879
a virus

1971
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:47,759
we talked about some of the most

1972
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,519
dangerous and deadly viruses can we zoom

1973
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:52,079
in and talk about

1974
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:54,318
covin-19 virus sure i don't know what

1975
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:57,039
your preferred name is but well

1976
01:07:54,318 --> 01:07:59,759
right the virus is cov2 which is hard

1977
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,760
it's long right and then covet 19 is the

1978
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,760
disease so you could say the virus of

1979
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,520
covet 19 that's fine it's a virus of

1980
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,039
cova-19 but for the purpose of this

1981
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:10,079
conversation we'll every once in a while

1982
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:14,160
i'll just say kovid it's fine no problem

1983
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:16,079
wha what is this virus from uh

1984
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:19,599
i don't know how many ways we can talk

1985
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:21,679
about it i think from a basic structural

1986
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,960
like the the varian

1987
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:25,359
structure

1988
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:28,000
biological structure perspective what is

1989
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:30,159
it what are its variants

1990
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
can you describe the basics the

1991
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:35,119
important characteristics of the virus

1992
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,198
so viruses are classified by humans just

1993
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:40,880
to make it easier to keep track of them

1994
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:42,238
right so this is a corona virus which is

1995
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,679
because

1996
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:45,039
when they were first

1997
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,719
discovered

1998
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:48,399
i think the first ones were animal

1999
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,759
coronaviruses

2000
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:51,278
they looked at them in the electron

2001
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,520
microscope and it looked like the solar

2002
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:54,880
corona and that's all there is to it and

2003
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,199
i have to say that

2004
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,199
early in the outbreak the the

2005
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,479
place with the highest cereal positivity

2006
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:04,079
in the u.s for a while 68 percent was a

2007
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:06,399
working-class neighborhood in new york

2008
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:08,318
city called corona

2009
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:11,198
can you can you beat that right that's

2010
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:12,719
crazy yeah so coronaviruses they have

2011
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:14,399
membranes right we talked about

2012
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:16,239
membranes they have spiked proteins in

2013
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:18,960
the membrane so they can attach to cells

2014
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:21,039
and inside they have rna

2015
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,520
and they are the viruses with the

2016
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:25,039
longest rna that we know of no none

2017
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,880
other comes close

2018
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:29,519
for some reason

2019
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:32,798
they're able to maintain thirty thousand

2020
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:35,279
so sars cov2 rnas thirty thousand bases

2021
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:38,238
of rna and some of the other coronas are

2022
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:41,040
even longer 40 000. this is a

2023
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:42,318
coronas our family of viruses that

2024
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:43,119
included

2025
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,120
the

2026
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:48,079
what the the one you mentioned before

2027
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:50,318
version one cesares kovi one yeah kobe

2028
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,479
one and i guess other ones so the first

2029
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,880
we first learned of them in animals a

2030
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:55,839
lot of animals pigs and

2031
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,400
uh

2032
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,199
cows and horses have coronaviruses and

2033
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,920
then

2034
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:04,719
uh in their 60s we discovered a couple

2035
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,560
of human coronaviruses that just caused

2036
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:08,800
colds very mild colds that you wouldn't

2037
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,159
even think twice about right

2038
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,679
and then suddenly

2039
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:14,879
in 20

2040
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:18,560
2003 there's this outbreak of

2041
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:21,440
severe respiratory disease in in china

2042
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,719
and you know they it started in november

2043
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,919
and they didn't tell the world until

2044
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,719
february

2045
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,399
and

2046
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:28,480
that was really bad because it was

2047
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:31,119
already spreading by the time they

2048
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,479
told people about it but

2049
01:10:31,119 --> 01:10:34,800
this

2050
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:36,799
went to many 29 different countries only

2051
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,400
8 000 people were infected and then it

2052
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,199
stopped

2053
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:44,319
and that was the first time we saw

2054
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:46,639
an epidemic coronavirus and it what they

2055
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:47,920
did afterwards is they said okay

2056
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,600
it looks like it came from the meat

2057
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,560
markets they have live meat markets in

2058
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,320
guangzhou in the south of china

2059
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,520
where you can go and pick out an animal

2060
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:57,039
and the guy will

2061
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,159
slaughter it for you and give it to you

2062
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:00,079
and then of course there's blood

2063
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:01,920
everywhere and that's how they got

2064
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:04,559
infected and they figured out that

2065
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,000
there's this animal called a palm civet

2066
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,120
that was the source of virus the palm

2067
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,520
civets are shipped in from the

2068
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:11,039
countryside and they the palm civ

2069
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,199
somehow in the countryside got it from a

2070
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:15,760
bat so they went looking in caves in the

2071
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:17,439
countryside and they found in one cave

2072
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,039
all the viruses that could make up

2073
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:22,000
saurus one

2074
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:24,399
and that was 2012 i would say took about

2075
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,679
five eight years after that outbreak so

2076
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:26,479
that was the

2077
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:30,000
first

2078
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:31,839
hint that bats have coronaviruses that

2079
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,800
can infect people and cause problems

2080
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,520
right

2081
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:37,520
and after that we should have been ready

2082
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,000
so didn't they already start developing

2083
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:42,719
vaccines yes so some people started

2084
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,238
making vaccines they tested them in in

2085
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,880
mice

2086
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:48,879
but they never got into people

2087
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,800
and some people started working on

2088
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,840
anti-viral drugs

2089
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:56,480
nothing ever came of them

2090
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,159
you know industry there's no there's no

2091
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:01,519
disease it's gone why should we make

2092
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:03,519
vaccines and drugs and nih in the u.s

2093
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,120
you submit a grant and they say it's too

2094
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,239
risky there's no none of this virus

2095
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,238
around so people were really

2096
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,439
short-sighted because i always say we

2097
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:12,639
could have had

2098
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:15,439
antivirals for this absolutely yeah for

2099
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,199
sure no question in fact one the one

2100
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:18,079
antiviral that's in phase three it's

2101
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:20,079
called

2102
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:21,760
molnu pyravir

2103
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:24,079
it's the only one that you can take

2104
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:26,400
orally it's a pill it looks really good

2105
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:28,158
that was developed five years ago but

2106
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:29,198
never taken into humans it could have

2107
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:31,279
been ready

2108
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:34,839
so we dropped the ball

2109
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:37,359
and then the next decade 2012 mers

2110
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:39,039
coronavirus comes

2111
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:40,158
comes up in the arabian peninsula this

2112
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:41,920
comes from

2113
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:44,719
camels and infects people but probably

2114
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:46,158
the camels got it from bats originally

2115
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,239
some time ago

2116
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:50,559
but that never transmits

2117
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:53,198
from person to person very rarely

2118
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,360
every new little outbreak is a new

2119
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:58,399
infection from a camel

2120
01:12:55,359 --> 01:13:00,880
so that was 2012 and now here we are

2121
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:02,719
2019 a new outbreak of respiratory

2122
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,880
disease in china

2123
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,560
and this one really

2124
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,000
goes all over the world

2125
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,760
where sars one could not it's a

2126
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
coronavirus you know it's different

2127
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,920
enough from sars one that it has very

2128
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,399
different properties but it still has a

2129
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,640
membrane still has a very long

2130
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:20,719
rna in the middle and then it still has

2131
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:23,199
the spike proteins that's right what are

2132
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,640
the things that are what are the little

2133
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,919
unique things

2134
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,760
that make it

2135
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,560
that much more effective

2136
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,480
to make it cause a pandemic of millions

2137
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:34,239
of people as opposed to sars one yeah

2138
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:35,439
well the genome

2139
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:38,718
is

2140
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:40,479
20 different from source one say and in

2141
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:42,319
those bases there's some there are

2142
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:44,079
things that uh make it different from

2143
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:46,319
soros one it binds the same receptor

2144
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:47,840
ace2 on the cell surface so that's

2145
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:50,000
remarkable

2146
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,520
it has a lot of the same proteins

2147
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,079
they look similar like if you look at

2148
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,239
the structure of the spikes they look

2149
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:58,559
similar but there's enough amino acid

2150
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:02,000
differences to to make the biology and

2151
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,679
what it is we don't know because

2152
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,760
how do you figure that out you need to

2153
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:08,399
study animals because you can't infect

2154
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,800
people and the the animal models aren't

2155
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:12,799
great you know for for so the way you

2156
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,039
figure that out is you figure out how

2157
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,600
those differences

2158
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:19,519
what functional like how the difference

2159
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,520
in the amino acids lead to functional

2160
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,120
difference of the virus like how it

2161
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,120
attaches how it breaks the cell wall

2162
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:28,960
exactly and how the hell do you figure

2163
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:31,039
that out like i guess there's models

2164
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,880
of interaction you need uh first you

2165
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:35,760
need an animal of some kind to infect

2166
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,960
right you can use mice people have used

2167
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,560
ferrets

2168
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,719
guinea pigs

2169
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,400
non-human primates

2170
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:44,079
all of the above and non-human primes

2171
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:44,960
are very expensive so not many people do

2172
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,519
that

2173
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,600
um and then you can put the virus in the

2174
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,760
respiratory tract but in fact

2175
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,640
none of them get sick like people do you

2176
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,039
know

2177
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:58,079
many people with with kovid get a mild

2178
01:14:55,039 --> 01:15:00,079
disease but 20 percent get a very severe

2179
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:03,119
longer-lasting disease and they can die

2180
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:04,719
from it right no animal does that yet so

2181
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:06,079
we have no insight into what's

2182
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:08,719
controlling that but if you just want to

2183
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:10,800
look at the very first part of infection

2184
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:13,760
and the shedding and the transmission

2185
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,600
you can do it in any one of several

2186
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,760
animal models ferrets are really good

2187
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,480
for transmission they tend they have

2188
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,480
nasal structures like humans and they

2189
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:23,919
you can put them in cages next to each

2190
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:26,479
other and they'll transmit the virus

2191
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,840
really nicely so you can study that

2192
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:29,678
but the other thing that's important

2193
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:33,840
that we should mention

2194
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,840
is how do you manipulate these viruses

2195
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:39,119
so these are rna viruses

2196
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,640
you can't manipulate rna we don't know

2197
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:42,559
how to do it

2198
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,880
but we dna

2199
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,480
because of the recombinant dna

2200
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:49,440
revolution that

2201
01:15:46,479 --> 01:15:51,919
occurred in the 70s we can change

2202
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:53,919
dna any way we want we could change a

2203
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,880
single base we can cut out bases we can

2204
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,239
put other things in really easily

2205
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,079
and

2206
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:02,238
if i may

2207
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:05,679
give it a personal aspect when i went to

2208
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:07,439
mit as a postdoc in 1979

2209
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,880
david baltimore said here's what i want

2210
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:11,839
you to do

2211
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,920
the the moratorium on recombinant dna

2212
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,640
experiments on viruses has just been

2213
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,079
lifted i want you to make a dna copy of

2214
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,679
polio

2215
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:23,279
and see if you put that in a cell

2216
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:24,399
whether it will start an infection

2217
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,198
it's okay

2218
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:27,359
so

2219
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:30,479
i made a dna copy of poliovirus it's

2220
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:31,679
only 7500 bases it's much smaller than

2221
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:34,639
corona

2222
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,640
and i took that dna and i put it in a

2223
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,920
piece of dna from a bacteria called a

2224
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,880
plasmid

2225
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,719
and you can grow plasmids and many many

2226
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:45,039
bacteria make lots of them and purify

2227
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,880
the dna really easily and i took that

2228
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:49,279
dna

2229
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,880
and i i sequenced it because we wanted

2230
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,559
we didn't know the genome sequence of

2231
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,560
polio at the time

2232
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,320
and that took me a year by the way

2233
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,239
because the techniques we had were

2234
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:01,359
really archaic and nowadays you could do

2235
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:03,519
it in 15 minutes right it's amazing

2236
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:06,719
and i took the dna i put it into cells

2237
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:08,880
and out came polio

2238
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,719
so that's the start now since then

2239
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:12,159
everybody has taken that technique and

2240
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,158
used it for their virus you can now do

2241
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:17,439
it with source cov2 you make a dna copy

2242
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:19,039
of any rna virus you can modify it

2243
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:21,519
and you put it back into cells and

2244
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:22,640
you'll get your modified virus out so

2245
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,719
that's an important part of

2246
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,119
understanding the properties of the

2247
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,800
virus as say in an animal by changing

2248
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:31,119
the virus you're changing a dna copy

2249
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,400
you're making the virus then and putting

2250
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:35,279
it into the end

2251
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:37,279
can you clarify so even in the rna virus

2252
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:40,079
you can take and turn it into

2253
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:41,840
dna yes and then that allows you to

2254
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:44,559
modify it yes

2255
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,560
what's that what's that uh mapping well

2256
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,239
no no what's the process of going from

2257
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,080
rna to dna

2258
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:51,839
reverse transcription that's reverse

2259
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:53,439
transcription right oh so you actually

2260
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,520
going through the the process of reverse

2261
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:57,839
transcription to do this yes remember

2262
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,080
david baltimore and howard yes had

2263
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,079
discovered this enzyme in the 70s they

2264
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:04,479
got the nobel prize for that and when i

2265
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:06,640
went to david's lab at mit

2266
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:08,479
he had the enzyme in the freezer he said

2267
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,079
here take this and make a dna copy of

2268
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:12,238
paul yeah i didn't make the connection

2269
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:13,920
that you can use that kind of thing for

2270
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:16,319
an rna virus

2271
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,319
and so that's and then modify it see any

2272
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,759
dna virus already exists as dna so you

2273
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:22,719
can modify it

2274
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:25,600
but for rna viruses it was difficult and

2275
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:28,000
so then from that point on for influenza

2276
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:30,239
every other rna virus and coronaviruses

2277
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,880
people made dna copies and that's what

2278
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:34,718
they use to modify and and ask questions

2279
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,319
about what things are doing right what's

2280
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:37,760
this gene doing what if we take it out

2281
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:40,799
what happened can you do the same thing

2282
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:43,000
with uh kovid uh is takes the rna and

2283
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,760
then of course and in fact in january

2284
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,800
2020 as soon as the genome sequence was

2285
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,239
released

2286
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,880
from china the

2287
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:52,718
labs all over we're synthesizing this 30

2288
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,520
000 base dna

2289
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:56,158
and

2290
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:58,960
getting what can you figure out

2291
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:00,399
without infecting anything just uh

2292
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,840
turning into

2293
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:04,319
with the reverse transcription turning

2294
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,840
into dna modifying stuff and then

2295
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:07,599
putting it into a cell what can you

2296
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,319
figure out

2297
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,079
from that oh well you could let's say

2298
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:13,599
you can cut out a gene you see some

2299
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:15,920
genes in the sequence i don't know what

2300
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,840
these genes do let's cut them out

2301
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,520
and then you could

2302
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,279
cut them out of the dna you put the dna

2303
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,280
in cells and maybe you get

2304
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:25,279
virus out and you go oh

2305
01:19:23,279 --> 01:19:26,800
clearly that gene's not needed

2306
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:29,119
for the virus to reproduce at least in

2307
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,119
cells right or maybe you take the g now

2308
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:32,800
and you never get any virus so it's

2309
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:34,640
lethal is there a nice systematic ways

2310
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,360
of doing this do people kind of automate

2311
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:37,280
it

2312
01:19:35,359 --> 01:19:39,920
absolutely and we

2313
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:41,920
i mean the problem with sars

2314
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:45,199
the covid virus is it's thirty thousand

2315
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:47,520
basis a lot of stuff there yeah and

2316
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:50,238
what makes it more difficult is that

2317
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,760
you have to it's been classified as a

2318
01:19:50,238 --> 01:19:52,718
bsl3

2319
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,440
agent

2320
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:57,439
biosafety level three

2321
01:19:55,439 --> 01:20:00,079
and so not everyone has a lab that's

2322
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,479
capable of doing that so it limits the

2323
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:04,640
number of people who can do experiments

2324
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:07,119
you know some we were lucky to have a

2325
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:09,679
few in new york city but not every place

2326
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:11,359
has them so you cannot work

2327
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:13,039
with the virus just out on the bench

2328
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,719
like we do with many other viruses you

2329
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:16,319
have to wear a suit and you have to have

2330
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,079
special procedures and containment and

2331
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:20,719
so forth so it makes it difficult to do

2332
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:22,639
basic experiments on the virus but well

2333
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:24,560
it's a pandemic there's a lot of money

2334
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:26,639
there's a lot of incentive to work on it

2335
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,560
harder and also you don't need to work

2336
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:30,800
on the virus you can take bits of it and

2337
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,800
work you could take say just the spike

2338
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,320
right and say can we make a vaccine with

2339
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,679
just the spike because that doesn't

2340
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:39,519
require bsl3 so yes so if uh like

2341
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:42,719
building a vaccine requires you to

2342
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,800
figure out how or antiviral drugs

2343
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,239
how to attack various structural parts

2344
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,960
of the virus and the functional parts of

2345
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:50,000
the virus right you have to decide on a

2346
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,480
target

2347
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,439
yeah like i'm going to make an antiviral

2348
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:56,879
what am i going to target in the virus

2349
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:58,879
and

2350
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,400
there are a few things that make more

2351
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,199
sense than others

2352
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:04,638
usually we like to target enzymes

2353
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:07,198
i don't know if you remember any your

2354
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,719
biochemistry but you know enzymes are

2355
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:11,119
catalytic you don't need a lot of them

2356
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:13,279
to do a lot of things so they're

2357
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:15,279
typically in low concentrations in in a

2358
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:18,158
virus-infected cell so it's easier to

2359
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:19,759
inhibit them with a drug and the coronas

2360
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:20,879
have couple of enzymes that we can

2361
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,960
target

2362
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,639
so it's you have to figure that out

2363
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,399
ahead of time and decide what to go

2364
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:28,079
after and then you can look for drugs

2365
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:31,198
that inhibit what what you're interested

2366
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:32,639
in it's not that hard to do

2367
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:34,000
there's just something beautiful about

2368
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:36,239
biology

2369
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,039
about the mechanisms of biology and i

2370
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:39,039
kind of regret

2371
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:42,960
falling in love with computer science so

2372
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,760
much that i

2373
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,158
um

2374
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:48,480
left that biology textbook on the show

2375
01:21:46,158 --> 01:21:50,399
and left it behind but hopefully we'll

2376
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:52,079
return to it now because

2377
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:54,839
i think one of the things you learn even

2378
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:59,439
in computer science that studying

2379
01:21:54,840 --> 01:22:02,719
biology and certainly neurobiology

2380
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:04,479
uh you you get inspired

2381
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:06,560
here's a mechanism of incredible

2382
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:08,399
complexity that works really well is

2383
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,440
very robust it's very effective

2384
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:11,198
efficient

2385
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:12,799
it inspires you to come up with

2386
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:14,879
techniques that you can engineer in the

2387
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:17,199
machine so that's that's the what drives

2388
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,480
a field forward when people

2389
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:21,359
improvise

2390
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:23,279
and come up with new technologies that

2391
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:25,198
really make a difference we have we have

2392
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:26,960
a bunch of those now

2393
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:29,519
what's the difference between the

2394
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:32,158
coronavirus family and the

2395
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,440
uh the other popular family influenza

2396
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:34,879
virus family

2397
01:22:33,439 --> 01:22:37,198
is um

2398
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,719
i mean if i were because you mentioned

2399
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:40,238
we should have done a lot more in terms

2400
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:43,679
of vaccine development that kind of

2401
01:22:40,238 --> 01:22:45,359
thing for coronaviruses but if i were

2402
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:47,039
back then

2403
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:49,759
from my understanding the thing we

2404
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:50,880
should all be afraid of is influenza

2405
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,960
like some

2406
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:55,199
strong variants coming out from that

2407
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,800
family that seems like the one that will

2408
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:59,519
destroy human

2409
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,760
civilization or uh or hurt us really

2410
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:04,800
badly i don't know if you agree with

2411
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,800
this sense but maybe

2412
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:08,719
maybe you can also just clarify what to

2413
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,480
use the is the difference between the

2414
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,840
families so it's an interesting

2415
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:14,399
difference they both

2416
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:17,039
they both have membranes right

2417
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,879
so then they have spike proteins

2418
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:20,639
embedded in them for

2419
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,679
and they're different spikes

2420
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:24,079
in fact

2421
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:27,119
for influenza there are two main ones

2422
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:30,079
they're called the h a and the n a

2423
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:33,439
but what's inside

2424
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:36,960
is rna but it's very different rna

2425
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:38,960
and here we have to explain that so

2426
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:42,000
viruses with rna can have three

2427
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:45,359
different kinds of rna

2428
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,119
they can have what we call plus rna

2429
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,839
they can have minus

2430
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:52,399
rna or they could have plus minus

2431
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,480
actually two strands

2432
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:57,599
hybridized together

2433
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:58,479
the plus rna simply means

2434
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,920
that

2435
01:23:58,479 --> 01:24:03,759
if you put that plus rna in a cell you

2436
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,760
know your cell has ribosomes in it that

2437
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,600
make the proteins that you need the

2438
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,199
ribosomes will immediately latch on to

2439
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:13,760
the plus rna and begin to make proteins

2440
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:15,198
a minus rna is not the right strand to

2441
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,360
make proteins

2442
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:20,158
so it has to be copied first and then

2443
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:21,279
the plus minus is both together so the

2444
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:23,759
sars

2445
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:25,119
coronaviruses all the coronaviruses have

2446
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,719
plus rna

2447
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:28,559
so as soon as that rna gets in the cell

2448
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:30,319
boom it starts an infectious cycle same

2449
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:33,520
thing with poliovirus by the way which i

2450
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:34,960
worked on influenza viruses are negative

2451
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,880
stranded

2452
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,279
so they cannot be translated when they

2453
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,960
get in the cell so that that's tough for

2454
01:24:39,279 --> 01:24:43,039
the virus because

2455
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,399
the cell actually cannot

2456
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:45,760
make plus

2457
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:47,679
rna

2458
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,000
from minus rna it doesn't have the

2459
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:51,600
enzyme to do it so the virus has to

2460
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,920
carry it in

2461
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,920
inside the virus particle and then when

2462
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,760
the minus rna is in the cell the virus

2463
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,199
enzyme makes plus rnas and those get

2464
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,920
translated

2465
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:04,000
it's a big difference and then

2466
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:07,359
in the influenza viruses not only is it

2467
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,359
minus rna but it's in pieces it's in

2468
01:25:07,359 --> 01:25:11,359
eight pieces

2469
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:14,799
we call that segmented whereas the

2470
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:16,319
corona is in one long piece of rna

2471
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,560
so what is it is that they're like

2472
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:19,920
floating separately yeah so the genes

2473
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,920
are on separate pieces they're all

2474
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,679
packaged inside that virus particle of

2475
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,359
influenza virus but they're in pieces

2476
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:27,920
and why that's important

2477
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:29,279
is because if two different influenza

2478
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,359
viruses

2479
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:33,920
infect the same cell

2480
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:35,519
the pieces as they reproduce can mix and

2481
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,079
out can come

2482
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,560
a virus with a new assortment of pieces

2483
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:41,920
and that allows influenza virus to

2484
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,679
undergo

2485
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,920
extremely high frequency evolution

2486
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:48,239
that's why we get pandemics when we have

2487
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:49,920
a new flu pandemics is because somewhere

2488
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:52,399
in some animal

2489
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:55,279
two viruses have reassorted and made a

2490
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:57,759
new virus that we hadn't seen before

2491
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:59,039
so so you're you're you're talking about

2492
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,920
kind of

2493
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:04,560
biological characteristics but what am i

2494
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,920
incorrect in my intuition that

2495
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:08,400
or from the things i've heard that the

2496
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,760
influence of family viruses is more

2497
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:11,679
dangerous

2498
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,159
like what what makes it more dangerous

2499
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:14,158
to humans

2500
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:19,279
well it depends on the there are many

2501
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,800
flavors or vintages of influenza virus

2502
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:23,198
some are dangerous and some are not

2503
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:26,320
right it depends on which one some like

2504
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:28,158
that 1918 apparently was was very lethal

2505
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:31,439
killed a lot of people

2506
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:34,000
but more contemporary viruses we had a

2507
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:36,879
pandemic in 2009

2508
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,920
of influenza and that wasn't such a

2509
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,199
lethal

2510
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,279
virus

2511
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:43,198
we don't know exactly why but it didn't

2512
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:45,119
kill that many people it transmitted

2513
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:47,678
pretty well is that the bird flu one

2514
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:50,158
they're all they're all deriving that

2515
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:51,199
one was called swine influenza swine it

2516
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:54,319
seemed to it

2517
01:26:51,198 --> 01:26:57,198
started in a pig but it had bird it had

2518
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:59,679
rnas from bird influenza viruses these

2519
01:26:57,198 --> 01:27:01,759
viruses are all reassortance of

2520
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,520
different viruses from pigs and birds

2521
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,800
and humans

2522
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:07,280
um

2523
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:09,119
but influenza can cause pneumonia and

2524
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:11,119
can kill you as does

2525
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:13,279
sorrows kobe 2. so it depends on the the

2526
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:15,039
virus so there is another influenza

2527
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:16,639
virus that's currently circulating so

2528
01:27:15,039 --> 01:27:19,039
right now we have

2529
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:22,400
the 2009 pandemic virus that's still

2530
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:24,960
around and then the 1968

2531
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:27,439
pandemic virus which was the one before

2532
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,960
2009 that one is still around too and

2533
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:31,279
that's more lethal

2534
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:34,719
and depending on the season some seasons

2535
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:37,519
the 2009 virus predominates some seasons

2536
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:40,000
the 1968 and when the 68 is around you

2537
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:42,000
get more lethality so we're living with

2538
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,840
the influenza family we haven't

2539
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
exterminated them

2540
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:48,639
right we never will never exterminate

2541
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,800
them why well because every shore bird

2542
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:53,440
in the world is infected with them you

2543
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,719
know gulls and turns and ducks and all

2544
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:56,960
sorts of things

2545
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:59,600
why can't we develop

2546
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:01,760
strong vaccines that defend against oh

2547
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:04,079
we could do that sure

2548
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:05,520
um but that would not eliminate them

2549
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:08,158
right from humans even if you had the

2550
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:10,320
best vaccine you would never get rid of

2551
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:12,399
it in people because there would always

2552
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:14,000
be someone who's not vaccinated or in

2553
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:16,158
which the vaccine didn't work you know

2554
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,319
no but no vaccine is a hundred percent

2555
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:20,158
right so well you just contradict

2556
01:28:18,319 --> 01:28:22,479
yourself you had the he said the perfect

2557
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:24,638
vaccine so

2558
01:28:22,479 --> 01:28:27,279
imperfect but you then you said

2559
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:29,359
like even if you had the professor yeah

2560
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:30,800
some people wouldn't get vaccinated but

2561
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:32,639
i understand what you mean so but i

2562
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,119
actually was asking how difficult is it

2563
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,639
to make vaccines like that for

2564
01:28:35,119 --> 01:28:38,800
it seems like it's very difficult to do

2565
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:41,520
that for the influenza virus

2566
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:43,840
so it's really easy to make an

2567
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,440
old-school vaccine

2568
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:47,440
so the the way

2569
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:49,759
the first influenza vaccines were made

2570
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:53,198
was actually jonas salk worked on them

2571
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,719
in the 40s you just grow lots of virus

2572
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:56,960
and you grow it in eggs by the way

2573
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:59,039
chicken eggs nice

2574
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:00,880
literally wait wait yeah chicken

2575
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:03,119
embryonated so they get fertilized and

2576
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:05,039
there's a 10 or 12 day embryo in it and

2577
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:07,439
you put virus in it it grows up and then

2578
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:08,399
you harvest it you get about 10 ml of

2579
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:10,638
fluid

2580
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:12,638
and then you take that you treat it with

2581
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:14,960
formaldehyde or formalin and it

2582
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:16,480
inactivates the virus so it's no longer

2583
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,480
infectious

2584
01:29:16,479 --> 01:29:19,919
and you just inject that into people and

2585
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,158
that was the first flu vaccine it was

2586
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,399
made for the the us army actually and

2587
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:27,279
then it got moved over to people we

2588
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:29,519
still use that old school tech today

2589
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,679
so you're you're taking

2590
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:34,400
can you help me out here okay so this is

2591
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:36,960
a good time to talk about vaccines

2592
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:39,198
okay so you're talking about

2593
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:42,480
you're taking the actual virus right you

2594
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:44,000
put it in an egg you let it grow up

2595
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:47,039
it's very funny that you put in an egg

2596
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,238
it's very um it's very poetic

2597
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:51,359
and then uh how do you make it not

2598
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:53,839
um

2599
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:55,679
infection uh not effective or whatever

2600
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:57,679
not infectious not infectious is that

2601
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:59,840
the right term here yeah so how do you

2602
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:01,920
make it not infectious you can

2603
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,800
treat it with any number of chemicals

2604
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,359
that'll

2605
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:07,760
disrupt the particle so it no longer

2606
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:08,960
so that that step of disrupting the

2607
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,960
particle

2608
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:13,679
is that very specific to any a

2609
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:15,439
particular variant particle no the same

2610
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:17,039
collection of chemicals you can use for

2611
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:19,759
all kinds of action and which have been

2612
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:22,158
used for sars cov2 vaccines also same

2613
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:23,760
technology okay so what are

2614
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:26,479
there's several things to ask so you

2615
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:28,239
called it old school in a way that's uh

2616
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:31,759
slightly dismissive like people talk

2617
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:32,638
about windows 98 or something uh

2618
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,960
so there

2619
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,800
so is there risks involved with it or is

2620
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,119
it just difficult to produce large

2621
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:41,199
amounts no it's a lot of eggs it's very

2622
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:43,599
easy i mean you could do it in cells and

2623
01:30:41,198 --> 01:30:45,519
culture but eggs were convenient and

2624
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:47,280
in the 1940s we didn't have cells in

2625
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,840
culture we didn't know how to do that so

2626
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:52,158
we had to use something else

2627
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:55,039
it's easy to do

2628
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:56,879
but the process of inactivating

2629
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:59,439
the virus with a chemical

2630
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:02,000
makes it not not the best vaccine you

2631
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:04,559
can make the flu vaccines that we have

2632
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,279
today which are mostly based on this

2633
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:11,920
inactivation this is called inactivated

2634
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:13,679
virus vaccines oh so like the kind of uh

2635
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,119
thing it presents to the immune system

2636
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:17,440
to train on

2637
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:19,679
not right it's not it's not

2638
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:21,119
it's not close to the actual virus yes

2639
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:23,279
that's what we think so that's why

2640
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:25,039
probably the flu vaccines are just not

2641
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:26,960
very good you know

2642
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:29,279
60

2643
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:31,359
efficiency at the best right which is

2644
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:32,960
not really good what does it mean what

2645
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:34,960
is the measure of efficiency for a

2646
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,560
vaccine well

2647
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:38,960
it's how it does in the general

2648
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:40,639
population at preventing influenza at

2649
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,480
preventing

2650
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:43,440
illness not infection we usually don't

2651
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:44,638
measure

2652
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:46,238
infection

2653
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:48,560
when we're testing a vaccine we just

2654
01:31:46,238 --> 01:31:50,079
measure sickness that's really easy to

2655
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:52,400
score right

2656
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:55,198
you do a trial and you say if you feel

2657
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:58,079
sick give us a call we'll tell you

2658
01:31:55,198 --> 01:32:01,519
so yeah i mean what's what's sickness

2659
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:03,679
sickness is the presence of symptoms

2660
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:06,880
so this is good time to say what a

2661
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:08,880
symptom is okay a symptom is what you

2662
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:11,920
only can feel

2663
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:13,920
only you can feel an upset stomach or a

2664
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:17,039
sore throat or that sort of the lived

2665
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:19,679
experience okay so the sign is something

2666
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:21,439
that someone could measure and tell that

2667
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:24,480
you're infected like

2668
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:27,039
virus in your nasopharynx or

2669
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:30,079
something else right signs and symptoms

2670
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:31,840
and so in a vaccine trial they tell you

2671
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:34,079
if you have any of these symptoms they

2672
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,319
give you a paper with the exact symptoms

2673
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:38,880
listed to make sure you're picking them

2674
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:41,359
up right so for flu it'd probably be

2675
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:43,520
fever sore throat cough

2676
01:32:41,359 --> 01:32:45,679
you call them and then they will do a

2677
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:47,360
pcr make sure you you've got flu and not

2678
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,880
some other virus that makes similar

2679
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:50,000
symptoms

2680
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,639
and then

2681
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,039
they would say are you a vaccine or

2682
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:57,039
non-vaccine arm and count up all the

2683
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:59,198
infections and see how the vaccine did

2684
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:00,800
basically that's so fascinating because

2685
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:03,198
um

2686
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:07,119
the reporting so symptom is what you

2687
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:10,319
feel yes and certainly the mind

2688
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:14,559
has a ability to conjure up feelings oh

2689
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:16,319
yes absolutely and so like culturally

2690
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,920
you know maybe there was a time in our

2691
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:21,279
culture where

2692
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:23,600
it was uh looked down upon to

2693
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:25,840
to feel sick or something like that like

2694
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,199
toughen up kind of thing yes and so then

2695
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:29,440
you probably have

2696
01:33:27,198 --> 01:33:31,359
very few symptoms being reported

2697
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:33,279
absolutely and then absolutely and now

2698
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:34,839
is like much more

2699
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:37,119
um i don't

2700
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,800
know perhaps you're much more likely to

2701
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:41,119
report symptoms now it's fascinating

2702
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:43,039
because then it changes oh it is

2703
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:44,960
definitely a perception because for you

2704
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:47,119
know your symptom may be nothing to me

2705
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,198
or vice versa right so when you're doing

2706
01:33:47,119 --> 01:33:50,479
this it's a little bit of a

2707
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:53,359
imprecise

2708
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:56,158
science because in in and even it's a

2709
01:33:53,359 --> 01:33:57,359
cultural thing in some countries

2710
01:33:56,158 --> 01:33:58,799
something that would make us feel

2711
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:00,399
horrible they wouldn't even bother

2712
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,159
reporting no i didn't have any symptoms

2713
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:04,399
so it's a little bit imprecise and it

2714
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:06,238
clouds the results so if you can measure

2715
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:07,679
things it's always better but you start

2716
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:10,399
out with a symptom

2717
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:13,199
and if you say if someone tells you this

2718
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:14,238
virus 20 of the people

2719
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:19,359
are

2720
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:21,439
asymptomatic they don't report symptoms

2721
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:23,039
that number is probably not as a

2722
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:24,158
constant it depends where you did the

2723
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:25,920
study

2724
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:28,399
it could be different in china versus

2725
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,239
south america europe et cetera yeah i

2726
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:33,920
mean i was trying to figure so i took

2727
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:35,359
two shots of the fisa vaccine i had zero

2728
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:37,359
symptoms wow

2729
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:39,679
so and i was wondering well see but

2730
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:42,079
that's my feelings right this is not

2731
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:45,359
because i i felt fine i was waiting did

2732
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:48,399
you have pain at the injection site

2733
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:50,238
uh no it was kind of pleasant

2734
01:34:48,399 --> 01:34:52,000
yeah you felt nothing the next day no

2735
01:34:50,238 --> 01:34:53,919
nothing okay no no no tightness no

2736
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,760
exhaustion no

2737
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,760
um but see like i have an insane

2738
01:34:55,760 --> 01:35:00,880
sleeping schedule i already put myself

2739
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:02,639
through crazy stuff that said

2740
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:04,719
maybe i was expecting something really

2741
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:06,960
bad like i was way

2742
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:08,960
and therefore didn't feel it then but i

2743
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:11,118
also got um

2744
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,920
allergy shots

2745
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:14,799
and

2746
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:16,960
those i was out all next day like

2747
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:18,480
exhausted for some reason so that that

2748
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,480
gave me like

2749
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:22,559
a sense like okay

2750
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:24,399
at least sometimes i can feel shitty

2751
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,920
that's good to know

2752
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:28,238
sure and then then

2753
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:30,560
with the vaccine it didn't but the the

2754
01:35:28,238 --> 01:35:32,079
question is like how much does my mind

2755
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:35,840
come into play there

2756
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:37,840
are the expectations of symptoms uh

2757
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,000
the expectations of

2758
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,360
not feeling well how does that affect

2759
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,439
the sort of the self-reporting the

2760
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:45,519
symptoms i think it's definitely

2761
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:47,039
a variable there but um there's

2762
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:48,639
certainly many people that don't feel

2763
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:51,600
anything after the vaccines and there's

2764
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:54,880
some that have a whole range of

2765
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:56,079
things like soreness and fever etc yeah

2766
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,480
so okay you were talking about the

2767
01:35:56,079 --> 01:35:59,439
old-school development inside the egg

2768
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:01,839
right

2769
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:03,678
what's uh what's what's better than that

2770
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:06,560
what's what so then the next generation

2771
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:07,760
of vaccines which arose in the 50s were

2772
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:10,880
what we call

2773
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:12,719
replication competent where the virus

2774
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,840
you're taking it's actually reproducing

2775
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:16,000
in you

2776
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,719
yeah that sounds safe

2777
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,118
and

2778
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:20,719
it can be somewhat problematic yes as

2779
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:22,559
you might imagine because you know once

2780
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:24,480
you put that virus in you you have no

2781
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:26,960
more control right it's not like you

2782
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:29,118
have a kill switch in it which actually

2783
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,920
would be a great idea to put in

2784
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:32,238
like

2785
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:34,239
like nano nano bots what composition no

2786
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:36,319
you could just put something in there if

2787
01:36:34,238 --> 01:36:39,039
you added a drug you would do it shut it

2788
01:36:36,319 --> 01:36:41,039
off right and people are thinking about

2789
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:42,719
that because now we're engineering

2790
01:36:41,039 --> 01:36:45,439
viruses to treat

2791
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:47,039
cancers and other diseases and we may

2792
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:48,638
want to put kill switches in them just

2793
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:50,000
to make sure they don't run away oh

2794
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:51,760
interesting so you can like deploy a

2795
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,880
drug that binds to the

2796
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:56,400
this this virus that would shut it off

2797
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,760
in the body something like that

2798
01:36:56,399 --> 01:36:59,759
something like that yeah that would be

2799
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,760
the idea you'd have to engineer it in

2800
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:04,560
anyway these were the first one was

2801
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:07,039
yellow fever vaccine that was made

2802
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:09,760
because that was a big problem and this

2803
01:37:07,039 --> 01:37:12,639
virus and the way you do this

2804
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:14,800
back in the old day was empirical

2805
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:16,400
so max tyler who did the yellow fever

2806
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,440
vaccine he took the virus which is a

2807
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:19,519
human

2808
01:37:17,439 --> 01:37:21,519
virus right

2809
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:24,800
and he infected

2810
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:26,400
i think he used chick embryos

2811
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,679
and he went from one embryo to another

2812
01:37:26,399 --> 01:37:29,198
and just kept passing it did that

2813
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:32,239
hundreds of times

2814
01:37:29,198 --> 01:37:34,719
and every 10 passages he would take the

2815
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:36,879
virus and put it in a a mouse or a

2816
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,239
monkey whatever his model was and then

2817
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,880
eventually he got a virus that didn't

2818
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:42,799
cause any disease after 200 and some

2819
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,679
passages and then that was tested in

2820
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,440
people

2821
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:46,719
and it became the yellow fever vaccine

2822
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:49,519
that we use today

2823
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:52,239
he selected for mutations that

2824
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,360
made the virus not cause disease but

2825
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:55,759
still

2826
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:58,079
make an immune response wow so those are

2827
01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:00,560
called replication competent we now have

2828
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:03,359
the polio vaccine which was developed in

2829
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:06,560
the 50s after the yellow fever then we

2830
01:38:03,359 --> 01:38:09,039
had measles mumps rubella those are all

2831
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:11,119
replication competent vaccines

2832
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:12,399
and you mentioned is that's that's a

2833
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:13,920
good idea

2834
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:16,960
they are all

2835
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:19,679
safe vaccines the only one

2836
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:21,439
that has had an issue is the polio

2837
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:23,600
replication competent vaccine it was

2838
01:38:21,439 --> 01:38:25,919
called sabin vaccine or

2839
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:27,360
oral polio virus vaccine

2840
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,679
because

2841
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:31,519
you take it orally it's a wonderful

2842
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:33,920
because you don't have to inject it this

2843
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,760
is the perfect delivery

2844
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,920
you know either intranasal for a

2845
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:40,719
respiratory virus or orally for polio

2846
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:42,800
goes into your intestines it reproduces

2847
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:45,198
and it gives you wonderful protection

2848
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:46,560
against polio

2849
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:48,960
however you do

2850
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,480
shed virus out

2851
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,880
and

2852
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:55,519
that virus is no longer a vaccine it's

2853
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:57,679
reverted genetically in your intestine

2854
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:59,760
so you can infect others with poor take

2855
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:01,920
that virus and put it into an animal and

2856
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,239
give it polio and in fact

2857
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:06,319
the parents of some kids

2858
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:08,559
in the 60s and 70s who were immunized

2859
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:12,319
got got polio from the vaccine the rate

2860
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:14,000
was about one and one and a half million

2861
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:15,679
cases of polio so it's called

2862
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
vaccine-associated polio and i always

2863
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:21,039
argue that

2864
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,639
we may not have picked the right vaccine

2865
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:24,079
there was a big

2866
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:26,319
fight in the

2867
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:28,079
u.s and other countries between the

2868
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:30,399
inactivated polio and the and the

2869
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:32,639
infectious polio vaccines which ones we

2870
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:34,158
should be using because we found out

2871
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:36,880
that the infectious vaccine actually

2872
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:39,679
caused polio and 8 to 10 kids a year in

2873
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:42,079
the u.s alone got polio from the vaccine

2874
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:44,000
which looking back is really

2875
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:46,079
not acceptable in my view although the

2876
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,800
public health community said it was to

2877
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:50,639
get rid of polio so now we are

2878
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,960
we're close to eradicating polio

2879
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:55,600
globally

2880
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:58,000
but this vaccine derived polio is a

2881
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,679
problem so now we have to go back to the

2882
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,279
an activated vaccine which is tough

2883
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:04,560
because it's injected

2884
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:07,118
so okay so the the basic high level

2885
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:09,280
you know how vaccines work

2886
01:40:07,118 --> 01:40:11,118
principle is uh

2887
01:40:09,279 --> 01:40:13,279
you want to deploy something in the body

2888
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:15,118
that's as close to the actual virus as

2889
01:40:13,279 --> 01:40:16,319
possible but doesn't do nearly as much

2890
01:40:15,118 --> 01:40:17,839
harm that's right and there's like a

2891
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:18,880
million that's right not a million but

2892
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,560
there's a bunch of ways you could

2893
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,239
possibly do so those are two ways and

2894
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,360
now of course we have modern ways we can

2895
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:26,000
make

2896
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:28,000
mrna vaccines right what's what are the

2897
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,158
modern ways i did you want to look uh

2898
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,679
mrna vaccine that's so that's one of the

2899
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:34,079
that's the most modern but even before

2900
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:34,840
mrna vaccines we learned that we could

2901
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:37,840
use

2902
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:40,079
viruses to deliver

2903
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:41,520
proteins from a virus that you want to

2904
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:43,920
prevent

2905
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:46,480
and so the ebola vaccine

2906
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:48,239
we took the spike gene of ebola virus

2907
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:50,158
and put it in a different virus and we

2908
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:53,198
deliver that to people and that's called

2909
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:55,279
a vectored vaccine and some of the covid

2910
01:40:53,198 --> 01:40:57,678
vaccines are vectors of different kinds

2911
01:40:55,279 --> 01:40:59,679
of most famous or adenovirus vectors

2912
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:01,600
carrying the spike gene

2913
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:04,239
into the cell can you explain how the

2914
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,840
vector vaccine works again so we have we

2915
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:09,039
take a

2916
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:11,360
a virus that will infect humans

2917
01:41:09,039 --> 01:41:14,079
but will not make you sick

2918
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:16,479
in the case of adenovirus the years and

2919
01:41:14,079 --> 01:41:18,639
years of people studying it has told us

2920
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:20,879
what genes you could cut out

2921
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:22,560
and allow the virus to infect the cell

2922
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,480
but not cause any disease so instead of

2923
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,800
doing selection on it

2924
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:29,039
you uh you you actually genetically

2925
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:30,800
modify it yes you modify the vector yeah

2926
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:32,800
so you'll be much more precise about it

2927
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:34,719
very precise and then you splice in the

2928
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:37,199
gene for the spike

2929
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:39,520
and then you use that to deliver the

2930
01:41:37,198 --> 01:41:40,960
gene and it becomes produced as protein

2931
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:43,119
then you make an immune response and

2932
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:44,000
vector is the term for this modifying

2933
01:41:43,118 --> 01:41:46,399
right

2934
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,359
so we're now using viruses

2935
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:49,279
at our

2936
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:51,759
bidding we're using them as vectors not

2937
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:53,599
just for vaccines we can cure monogenic

2938
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,000
diseases that is if you have if you're

2939
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:57,760
born with a genetic disease you have a

2940
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,279
deletion or a mutation in a gene a

2941
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,800
single gene

2942
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:02,639
we can give you the

2943
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,679
the regular gene back using a virus

2944
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,840
vector

2945
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:07,440
so but cancers too we can cure cancers

2946
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,639
with vectors

2947
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:09,839
wow

2948
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:12,239
really

2949
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:13,840
interesting yeah i think in 10 to 15

2950
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:16,000
years most cancers will be treatable

2951
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:18,560
with viruses yeah

2952
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:21,039
wow and not only can we put

2953
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:22,080
things in the vector to kill the tumor

2954
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:23,279
we can

2955
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:25,600
target

2956
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:27,519
the vector to the tumor specifically in

2957
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:29,039
a number of ways and that makes it less

2958
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:31,040
toxic right it doesn't affect all your

2959
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:33,600
other cells

2960
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:35,198
but it takes time to develop a vector

2961
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:37,520
for a particular thing because it

2962
01:42:35,198 --> 01:42:39,759
requires a deep understanding

2963
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,119
yeah in fact we have about a dozen

2964
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:42,800
different virus vectors that have been

2965
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:45,519
studied for 20 years

2966
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,800
and those are the set of vaccine vectors

2967
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:48,800
that we're using so it includes

2968
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,039
adenovirus

2969
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,679
vesicular stomatitis virus which is a

2970
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:55,359
cousin of rabies but doesn't make people

2971
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:58,480
sick

2972
01:42:55,359 --> 01:43:00,880
influenza viruses being used as a vector

2973
01:42:58,479 --> 01:43:03,118
and many even measles virus so

2974
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:05,359
we're familiar with how to modify those

2975
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:07,759
to be vectors and those are being used

2976
01:43:05,359 --> 01:43:09,359
for for covid vaccines and then of

2977
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:11,679
course we have the the

2978
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:13,519
new the new is just the nucleic acid

2979
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:14,639
vaccines so

2980
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,880
years ago

2981
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:18,960
people said why can't we just inject dna

2982
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,800
into people

2983
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,239
take the spike and put it in a dna and

2984
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,719
inject it

2985
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:26,479
so people tried many many different

2986
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,960
vaccines and in fact there's there are

2987
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:30,879
no human licensed vaccines that are dna

2988
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:32,960
vaccines although there is a

2989
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:34,639
there is a west nile vaccine for horses

2990
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,760
that's a dna-based

2991
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:37,520
vaccine

2992
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,960
so if you have a horse you can give it

2993
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:40,159
this vaccine but no human can you

2994
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:43,920
clarify

2995
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:46,719
uh does a dna vaccine only work for dna

2996
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:48,560
viruses no it can work for dna or rna

2997
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:51,039
because remember for an rna virus we can

2998
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:53,679
make a dna copy of it right and it will

2999
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:56,639
still when you put that dna in a cell

3000
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:58,480
it goes into the nucleus okay right

3001
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,679
so it's you just especially you get you

3002
01:43:58,479 --> 01:44:01,759
get proteins

3003
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:03,679
vaccines yeah you're giving okay i got

3004
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:06,320
it so those didn't work for human

3005
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:09,440
vaccines and there were many hiv aids

3006
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:10,719
vaccine trials that used dna vaccines

3007
01:44:09,439 --> 01:44:11,839
didn't work

3008
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:14,239
and then

3009
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:16,400
a number of years ago people started

3010
01:44:14,238 --> 01:44:19,198
thinking how about rna

3011
01:44:16,399 --> 01:44:21,439
rna vaccines and i first heard this i

3012
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:24,238
thought what i've worked with rna my

3013
01:44:21,439 --> 01:44:25,919
whole career it's so fragile

3014
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:27,519
if you look at it the wrong way it

3015
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,520
breaks

3016
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:30,480
i mean that's that's being facetious

3017
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,480
right but

3018
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:34,718
you have to be very careful because

3019
01:44:32,479 --> 01:44:37,198
your hands are full of enzymes that will

3020
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:38,560
degrade rna

3021
01:44:37,198 --> 01:44:40,399
so i thought how could this possibly

3022
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,560
work injecting it into someone's it's an

3023
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:43,920
example of i was skeptical and i was

3024
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,560
wrong

3025
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:48,880
it turns out that if you modify the rna

3026
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:50,960
properly and protect it in a lipid

3027
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:53,199
capsule

3028
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:56,158
it actually works as a vaccine and

3029
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:57,599
people were working on this years before

3030
01:44:56,158 --> 01:45:00,479
covid came around they're doing

3031
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:02,079
experimental mrna vaccines and there are

3032
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:03,439
a couple of companies that were working

3033
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:05,279
on it and

3034
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:08,238
so at the beginning of

3035
01:45:05,279 --> 01:45:10,319
2020 they said let's try it and

3036
01:45:08,238 --> 01:45:12,399
i was skeptical frankly because i just

3037
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:13,519
thought rna would be too labile but i

3038
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:16,158
was wrong

3039
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:18,239
so this is uh as we're saying offline

3040
01:45:16,158 --> 01:45:20,158
one of the great things about you is

3041
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:21,919
you're able to say when you're

3042
01:45:20,158 --> 01:45:23,439
wrong about intuitions you've had in the

3043
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,800
past which is a beautiful thing for

3044
01:45:23,439 --> 01:45:27,118
scientists

3045
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:29,039
uh but you know i still think it's very

3046
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:31,439
surprising that something like that

3047
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:33,198
works right yeah i am surprised so

3048
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:34,559
you're just

3049
01:45:33,198 --> 01:45:37,439
you're just launching rna in a

3050
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:38,800
protective membrane yeah and then

3051
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:40,479
now

3052
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:43,440
one thing is surprising that the rna

3053
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:45,759
sort of lasts long enough

3054
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:46,638
right for the uh in its structure but

3055
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,880
then

3056
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:51,279
um the the other

3057
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:54,719
thing is why does it work that that

3058
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:56,960
that's a good training ground for um

3059
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:58,800
for the immune system

3060
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,480
is that is that obvious

3061
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,880
i don't think i don't think it's obvious

3062
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:04,718
to most people and it's worth going into

3063
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,920
because it's really interesting i mean

3064
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:08,239
first of all they

3065
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:11,199
they wrap the rna in

3066
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:13,759
in fats in lipid membranes right and the

3067
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:15,839
particular formulation they test for

3068
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:17,840
years to make sure it's stable you know

3069
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,079
it lasts a long time after it's injected

3070
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:22,239
and the two companies that

3071
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:24,158
make the current coveted vaccines right

3072
01:46:22,238 --> 01:46:26,718
moderna and physio they have different

3073
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:29,759
lipid formulations to get to the same so

3074
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:31,359
that's a real part of it and it's not

3075
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,000
simple there are quite a few different

3076
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:35,839
lipids that they put into this coding

3077
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,840
and they test to see how long

3078
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:40,480
they protect the rna after it's injected

3079
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:42,800
say into a mouse how long does it last

3080
01:46:40,479 --> 01:46:44,479
and the way it works is

3081
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,400
these apparently

3082
01:46:44,479 --> 01:46:49,678
these lipid nanoparticles they get

3083
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:53,599
injected into your muscle they bump into

3084
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:56,880
cells and they get taken up so lipid

3085
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:58,480
fat is sticky

3086
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,840
it's greasy

3087
01:46:58,479 --> 01:47:02,000
we like to say

3088
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,920
and so your mem your cells are covered

3089
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,719
with the greasy membrane also so when

3090
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,639
these

3091
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:08,319
lipid nanoparticles bump into them they

3092
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:09,199
stick and they eventually get taken up

3093
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:10,799
and they

3094
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:12,719
they figured this out right at the

3095
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:14,880
beginning if we put rna in a lipid

3096
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:17,039
nanoparticle will it get taken up into a

3097
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:19,600
cell and the answer was yes it was just

3098
01:47:17,039 --> 01:47:21,439
let's try it and it worked so basically

3099
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,719
experiment it's not like some deep

3100
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:24,960
understanding of biology it's

3101
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:26,880
experimentally speaking it just seems to

3102
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:29,118
work yeah well they had some idea that

3103
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:30,239
lipids would target this to a cell

3104
01:47:29,118 --> 01:47:32,158
membrane

3105
01:47:30,238 --> 01:47:34,238
and remember there's no

3106
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:36,960
there's no receptor involved like the

3107
01:47:34,238 --> 01:47:39,118
virus has a specific protein that

3108
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:41,118
attaches to a receptor right

3109
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:43,198
it's not efficient enough to just bump

3110
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:44,960
around and get into a cell

3111
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:47,759
that's what these things are doing and

3112
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:49,679
they probably optimize the lipids to to

3113
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:51,520
get more efficient uptake

3114
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:53,840
but it's not as efficient as a virus

3115
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:56,719
would be to get into a cell you have no

3116
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:59,119
specific i mean which is why

3117
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:01,198
it's surprising that uh you can crack

3118
01:47:59,118 --> 01:48:02,839
into the safe

3119
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:05,198
with with a

3120
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:07,760
hammer or

3121
01:48:05,198 --> 01:48:09,198
with some fat i mean that's a

3122
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,320
that's kind of surprising it's kind of

3123
01:48:09,198 --> 01:48:13,519
amazing

3124
01:48:10,319 --> 01:48:16,639
um that that it works but so

3125
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:18,719
maybe let's try to um

3126
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:22,480
talk about this so one of the

3127
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:24,639
hesitancies around vaccines

3128
01:48:22,479 --> 01:48:28,559
or basically around any new technology

3129
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:30,480
is the fact that mrna is a new idea

3130
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:33,039
and it's an idea that was

3131
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:35,118
shrouded in some skepticism as you said

3132
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:37,840
but it's the scientific community

3133
01:48:35,118 --> 01:48:40,158
because it's like it's a it's a

3134
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:42,480
cool new technology

3135
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:44,319
surprising that it works

3136
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:46,559
what's your intuition

3137
01:48:44,319 --> 01:48:48,079
i think one nice way to approach this is

3138
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:52,000
um

3139
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:54,960
try to play devil's advocate and say

3140
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:59,039
both sides one side is why your

3141
01:48:54,960 --> 01:49:02,319
intuition says that it's safe for humans

3142
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:04,319
and what arguments can you see

3143
01:49:02,319 --> 01:49:06,639
if you could steal man and argument why

3144
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:08,000
it's unsafe for humans

3145
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:10,319
or

3146
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:13,840
not unsafe for humans but

3147
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:15,039
the hesitancy to take an mrna vaccine is

3148
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:16,560
justified

3149
01:49:15,039 --> 01:49:19,439
so many people

3150
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,960
are afraid because it's new technology

3151
01:49:19,439 --> 01:49:22,079
and they feel it hasn't been

3152
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:25,039
tested

3153
01:49:22,079 --> 01:49:27,279
i mean in theory what could go wrong

3154
01:49:25,039 --> 01:49:28,960
this is the nice thing about

3155
01:49:27,279 --> 01:49:32,238
mrna

3156
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:34,560
is that it doesn't last forever

3157
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:38,079
as opposed to dna which doesn't last

3158
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:41,520
forever but it can last a lot longer

3159
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:43,118
and it could even go into your dna right

3160
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:46,159
so mrna has a

3161
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:48,639
shorter lifetime maybe days after it's

3162
01:49:46,158 --> 01:49:50,319
injected into your arm then it's gone

3163
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:52,880
so that's a good thing because it's not

3164
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:55,519
going to be around forever

3165
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:57,279
so that would say okay so

3166
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:59,119
it's sticking around for your lifetime

3167
01:49:57,279 --> 01:50:00,000
is not happening but what else could

3168
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:00,960
happen

3169
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,039
well

3170
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:05,118
the let's see the protein that's made

3171
01:50:03,039 --> 01:50:07,439
could that be an issue

3172
01:50:05,118 --> 01:50:10,479
and again proteins

3173
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:12,479
don't last forever they have a finite

3174
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:14,559
longevity in the body

3175
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:17,359
and this one also

3176
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:19,280
lasts perhaps at the best a few weeks

3177
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:20,399
now this is a protein that's made after

3178
01:50:19,279 --> 01:50:22,719
the

3179
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:24,960
the rna gets into the cell yeah so the

3180
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:26,960
lipid nanoparticles taken up into a cell

3181
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,880
and the mrna is translated and you get

3182
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:31,198
protein made and there's also a question

3183
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:33,118
i'm sorry to interrupt where

3184
01:50:31,198 --> 01:50:35,039
where in the body so because it's not

3185
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:36,158
well targeted

3186
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:37,599
or

3187
01:50:36,158 --> 01:50:39,359
i don't i don't know if it's supposed to

3188
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:41,440
be targeted but it can go throughout the

3189
01:50:39,359 --> 01:50:44,399
body that's one right so it's injected

3190
01:50:41,439 --> 01:50:46,079
deep into your deltoid muscle right your

3191
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:47,679
shoulder

3192
01:50:46,079 --> 01:50:49,279
and

3193
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:51,279
the idea is not to put it in a blood

3194
01:50:49,279 --> 01:50:53,198
vessel otherwise it would then for sure

3195
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:55,840
circulate everywhere so

3196
01:50:53,198 --> 01:50:58,799
they go deep in a blood vessel and it's

3197
01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:00,400
it's locally injected and they did

3198
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:02,159
before this even went into people they

3199
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:02,879
did experiments in mice where they gave

3200
01:51:02,158 --> 01:51:04,879
them

3201
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,880
a thousand times higher concentrations

3202
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,239
than they would ever give to people and

3203
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:10,079
then when you do that it can go

3204
01:51:08,238 --> 01:51:12,479
everywhere basically you can find this

3205
01:51:10,079 --> 01:51:13,920
these nanoparticles in every tissue of

3206
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:16,000
the mouse

3207
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:18,079
but that's at a thousand-fold higher

3208
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,279
concentration right so

3209
01:51:18,079 --> 01:51:21,118
i think

3210
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:22,719
at the levels that we're using in people

3211
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:26,479
most of it's staying in the muscle but

3212
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:28,480
sure small small amounts go elsewhere

3213
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:31,039
could there be a lot of harm caused if

3214
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:33,678
it goes elsewhere in like let's say

3215
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:35,519
ridiculously high quantities i'm trying

3216
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:36,719
to understand what is the damage that

3217
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:39,280
could be done

3218
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:40,960
from an rna just floating about

3219
01:51:39,279 --> 01:51:42,479
so the rna itself is not going to be a

3220
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:44,639
problem it's the protein that is a

3221
01:51:42,479 --> 01:51:46,399
protein encoded in it right this is a

3222
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:49,440
viral rna which

3223
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:51,598
has no sequence in us so there's nothing

3224
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:52,960
that it could do it's the protein that i

3225
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:54,800
would say

3226
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:56,079
you you could ask what is that going to

3227
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,119
do

3228
01:51:56,079 --> 01:51:59,679
and

3229
01:51:57,118 --> 01:52:01,679
the one property we know about

3230
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:04,960
the spike

3231
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:06,399
is that it can cause fusion

3232
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:08,079
of cells

3233
01:52:06,399 --> 01:52:11,679
right that's how the virus gets in in

3234
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:15,599
the beginning the spike attaches to the

3235
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:17,199
cell by this h2 receptor and it

3236
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:19,039
causes the virus

3237
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:20,479
and the cell to fuse

3238
01:52:19,039 --> 01:52:23,599
and that's how the rna gets out of the

3239
01:52:20,479 --> 01:52:26,879
particle but so wait uh i'm a bit

3240
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:29,440
confused so with this mrna vaccine with

3241
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:30,560
the lipids and the rna there's no spike

3242
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:33,359
right

3243
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:35,840
the the mrna codes for the spike oh the

3244
01:52:33,359 --> 01:52:37,598
mrna codes so it creates the spike it

3245
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:40,800
creates a spike so that spike could

3246
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:44,159
cause fusion of cells yes except

3247
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:45,840
they modified the spike so it wouldn't

3248
01:52:44,158 --> 01:52:47,279
got it they made two amino acid changes

3249
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:49,440
in the spike so it would not fuse so

3250
01:52:47,279 --> 01:52:51,198
they understand enough which amino acids

3251
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:53,519
are responsible for the fusion that's

3252
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:55,118
right interesting this is so they could

3253
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,199
modify it so now it's not going to cause

3254
01:52:55,118 --> 01:53:00,000
fusion so that's not an issue it's

3255
01:52:57,198 --> 01:53:01,279
called the pre-fusion stabilized spike

3256
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,079
um

3257
01:53:01,279 --> 01:53:06,719
the spike when it binds ace2

3258
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:08,238
that that top falls off and the spike

3259
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:09,679
and the part of the spike that causes

3260
01:53:08,238 --> 01:53:10,959
fusion is now exposed and that doesn't

3261
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:13,359
happen in this

3262
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,480
mrna vaccine so

3263
01:53:13,359 --> 01:53:16,158
those are the things that could have

3264
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:18,399
happened but i think they're

3265
01:53:16,158 --> 01:53:20,479
ruled out by what we've just said but

3266
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:23,519
there's no better test than putting it

3267
01:53:20,479 --> 01:53:25,439
into people right right and doing phase

3268
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:27,520
one phase two and phase three in

3269
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:29,759
increasing numbers of people and asking

3270
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:33,199
what do we see do we do we have any

3271
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:35,280
concerns and so now it's been in

3272
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:36,879
many millions of people

3273
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:40,800
and we don't see

3274
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:43,199
most of the effects you see in a vaccine

3275
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:45,440
you see in the first couple of months

3276
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:47,118
things like the myocarditis with some of

3277
01:53:45,439 --> 01:53:50,719
the vaccines the clotting issues with

3278
01:53:47,118 --> 01:53:52,079
the astrazeneca vaccine guillain-barre

3279
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:54,880
you see those

3280
01:53:52,079 --> 01:53:57,279
relatively quickly um

3281
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:58,239
and we've seen small numbers of those

3282
01:53:57,279 --> 01:53:59,519
occur

3283
01:53:58,238 --> 01:54:02,638
but um

3284
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:04,800
other things we haven't seen and

3285
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:06,719
you know you you never say never right

3286
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,679
right so i mean this is fascinating

3287
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:09,198
right

3288
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:10,960
it's like uh

3289
01:54:09,198 --> 01:54:14,719
i i drink

3290
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:16,719
uh i put splenda in my coffee

3291
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:20,319
and has

3292
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:23,439
supposedly uh no calories

3293
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:25,679
but it tastes really good and i this

3294
01:54:23,439 --> 01:54:27,519
despite what like rumors and blogs and

3295
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:29,039
so on i have not seen good medical

3296
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:31,360
evidence

3297
01:54:29,039 --> 01:54:34,319
that is harmful to you

3298
01:54:31,359 --> 01:54:36,158
but it's like it tastes too good

3299
01:54:34,319 --> 01:54:38,479
so i'm thinking like there's got to be

3300
01:54:36,158 --> 01:54:40,319
long-term consequences but it's very

3301
01:54:38,479 --> 01:54:42,559
difficult to understand what the

3302
01:54:40,319 --> 01:54:44,559
long-term consequences are

3303
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:46,159
uh like that

3304
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:49,360
and there's this kind of

3305
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:51,279
like distant fear or anxiety about it

3306
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:52,880
like this thing tastes too good it's too

3307
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:54,479
good to be true

3308
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:55,760
there's got to be there's no free launch

3309
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:57,359
in this world

3310
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:59,360
this is the kind of feeling that people

3311
01:54:57,359 --> 01:55:01,598
have about the long-term effects of a

3312
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:02,479
vaccine

3313
01:55:01,599 --> 01:55:03,760
that

3314
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:05,759
you mentioned that there's some

3315
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:07,679
intuition about near-term effects that

3316
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:10,320
you want to uh

3317
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:11,840
uh remove like the diffusion of cells

3318
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:14,158
and all those kinds of things but they

3319
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:16,079
think okay this travels to other cells

3320
01:55:14,158 --> 01:55:18,719
in the body it travels to

3321
01:55:16,079 --> 01:55:20,158
uh neurons or that kind of stuff and

3322
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,800
then what kind of effect does that have

3323
01:55:20,158 --> 01:55:25,039
long term that's yet to be discovered

3324
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:27,279
what do you make i mean for this vaccine

3325
01:55:25,039 --> 01:55:29,920
but in general in science about

3326
01:55:27,279 --> 01:55:32,800
making statements about long-term

3327
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:34,719
uh negative effects is that something

3328
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:36,560
that weighs heavy on you is that

3329
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:38,960
something we can kind of escape through

3330
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:41,520
just large-scale experimentation

3331
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:42,800
with human with animals and humans well

3332
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:44,239
if you're really

3333
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:45,920
if you're concerned about long-term then

3334
01:55:44,238 --> 01:55:46,638
you have to do a long-term experiment

3335
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:47,920
right

3336
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:49,840
and

3337
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:51,920
maybe you don't see something for 50 60

3338
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:53,440
years so

3339
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:56,639
if someone says to you there are no

3340
01:55:53,439 --> 01:55:57,759
long-term effects of the covid vaccines

3341
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:00,480
they can't say that because they haven't

3342
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:02,400
done the long experiment right right is

3343
01:56:00,479 --> 01:56:03,919
always the possibility but you have to

3344
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:05,920
weigh it it's always

3345
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:08,639
there's no free lunch right

3346
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:10,560
there's always a risk benefit

3347
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:12,400
calculation you have to make you can

3348
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:14,800
have the study that goes for 50 years

3349
01:56:12,399 --> 01:56:16,719
and and then decide but i guess what

3350
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:18,880
you're doing is you

3351
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:20,880
just like we said um

3352
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:23,920
i forget with which one with polio with

3353
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:26,400
rabies i forget but you're weighing

3354
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:28,480
the side effects yeah

3355
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:31,039
the vaccine versus

3356
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:33,279
the effects of the virus

3357
01:56:31,039 --> 01:56:35,519
and like both of them you don't know

3358
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:38,079
long-term effects

3359
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:40,320
but you're building up intuition as you

3360
01:56:38,079 --> 01:56:44,719
study which what are the long-term

3361
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:46,079
effects like there is a huge number of

3362
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:46,960
people

3363
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:48,960
like

3364
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:50,960
um

3365
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:52,319
that have like i don't want to say

3366
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:54,319
experts because i don't like the word

3367
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:56,319
but people have studied it long enough

3368
01:56:54,319 --> 01:56:58,238
to where they build up intuition they

3369
01:56:56,319 --> 01:57:00,399
don't know for sure there's basic

3370
01:56:58,238 --> 01:57:03,039
science being done in this basic studies

3371
01:57:00,399 --> 01:57:04,000
we start to build up an intuition

3372
01:57:03,039 --> 01:57:05,359
of

3373
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,439
what

3374
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:10,399
might be a problem down the line and

3375
01:57:07,439 --> 01:57:13,118
what is not biologically speaking and so

3376
01:57:10,399 --> 01:57:14,158
given that map you then considering the

3377
01:57:13,118 --> 01:57:16,158
virus

3378
01:57:14,158 --> 01:57:17,839
there seems to be a lot of evidence for

3379
01:57:16,158 --> 01:57:19,839
covid having

3380
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:20,560
negative effects

3381
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:22,319
on

3382
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:24,560
all aspects of the body not just even

3383
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:26,399
respiratory which is kind of interesting

3384
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:27,920
right so the cognitive stuff that's

3385
01:57:26,399 --> 01:57:28,879
terrifying all kinds of systems of

3386
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:30,480
autism yes

3387
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:32,319
and then you look at the same thing with

3388
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:34,559
the vaccine

3389
01:57:32,319 --> 01:57:36,238
and there seems to be less of that

3390
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:38,000
but of course you don't know

3391
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:40,319
if it's some kind of dormant thing

3392
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,760
that's just going to you won't know it's

3393
01:57:40,319 --> 01:57:43,679
you have to

3394
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:46,000
make a judgment and for a lot of people

3395
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:48,000
they can't right because they don't have

3396
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,279
the tools to make the judgment i totally

3397
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,599
understand that

3398
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:53,920
and we have

3399
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:55,599
we have let people down a few times

3400
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:57,440
in medicine right

3401
01:57:55,599 --> 01:58:00,239
and i know two very

3402
01:57:57,439 --> 01:58:02,960
specific examples the first polio

3403
01:58:00,238 --> 01:58:05,598
vaccine ever made the salk vaccine was

3404
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:07,679
released in 1955.

3405
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:09,840
and immediately within months

3406
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:13,039
few hundred cases of paralysis and kids

3407
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:15,279
who got it because it was not properly

3408
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:17,118
inactivated

3409
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:19,279
now you have to understand parents were

3410
01:58:17,118 --> 01:58:21,759
dying for a polio vaccine because kids

3411
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:23,679
were getting paralyzed every summer 30

3412
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:26,480
000 kids a year

3413
01:58:23,679 --> 01:58:28,158
and so they went and took it they took

3414
01:58:26,479 --> 01:58:30,718
the word of the medical establishment

3415
01:58:28,158 --> 01:58:32,719
that it was safe and it wasn't

3416
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:34,000
big letdown never going to forget

3417
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:36,480
something although i think a lot of

3418
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,198
people today don't don't aren't aware of

3419
01:58:36,479 --> 01:58:38,718
that

3420
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:40,719
i think that was a big problem that's

3421
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:41,520
everlasting then

3422
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:43,279
the

3423
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:44,800
attenuated vaccine that we talked about

3424
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:46,880
the infectious

3425
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,199
causing polio

3426
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:50,159
yet parents continued to bring their

3427
01:58:49,198 --> 01:58:51,678
kids

3428
01:58:50,158 --> 01:58:53,439
to be vaccinated because they were said

3429
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:55,279
this is the right thing to do and i have

3430
01:58:53,439 --> 01:58:57,198
to say i was involved in several

3431
01:58:55,279 --> 01:58:59,439
lawsuits where

3432
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:01,198
parents of a kid who got paralyzed from

3433
01:58:59,439 --> 01:59:02,638
the polio vaccine decided to sue the

3434
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:04,559
manufacturer

3435
01:59:02,639 --> 01:59:06,560
and get some some money for their for

3436
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:07,920
their kid and so

3437
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:09,679
they got mad

3438
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:12,480
and and i think

3439
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:13,920
you could not

3440
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:16,638
the first

3441
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:18,319
issue could have been prevented

3442
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:19,679
could have been prevented by and

3443
01:59:18,319 --> 01:59:22,000
activating it properly i think the

3444
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:24,399
company just did the wrong thing

3445
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,840
the second we had evidence for and we

3446
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:27,279
should probably have not used that

3447
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:29,440
vaccine any longer but i think that

3448
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:31,118
destroys public confidence but those

3449
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:32,559
aren't they're not long minority of

3450
01:59:31,118 --> 01:59:34,399
cases there's a minority this is a very

3451
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:36,239
rare event yeah but nevertheless science

3452
01:59:34,399 --> 01:59:38,559
is an institution

3453
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:40,559
uh didn't

3454
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:42,800
make corrections in that case no they

3455
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:44,639
didn't so what do you

3456
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:46,960
make of

3457
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:50,239
that i mean it's very unfortunate that

3458
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:51,840
those few things can destroy trust

3459
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:54,079
but i don't think that lasts till today

3460
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,599
i think today is a different era right

3461
01:59:54,079 --> 01:59:58,559
yeah and most people don't know about

3462
01:59:55,599 --> 02:00:00,159
those stories i tell them to you because

3463
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:02,159
that's what could happen i think it

3464
02:00:00,158 --> 02:00:04,559
could happen today

3465
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:07,519
if you look at the history of

3466
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:09,760
the the polio vaccine

3467
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:12,639
the u.s public health service wanted

3468
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:14,719
kids to be vaccinated so they did things

3469
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:17,520
that probably weren't correct to get the

3470
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:19,520
vaccine back online right but they they

3471
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:21,440
did it and they pushed it through

3472
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:23,679
um so where

3473
02:00:21,439 --> 02:00:24,559
the question is what do we do today

3474
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:26,639
so

3475
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:28,239
i can look at

3476
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:29,118
as we just said i can look at what might

3477
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:29,919
happen

3478
02:00:29,118 --> 02:00:31,039
and

3479
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:32,639
i can

3480
02:00:31,039 --> 02:00:34,560
make reasonable

3481
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:36,880
decisions about the likelihood of them

3482
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:38,960
happening and i can also say

3483
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:41,679
i don't want to get covet of any kind

3484
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:42,960
because i've seen how nasty it can be

3485
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:45,199
and i decide

3486
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:46,639
i'm taking the risk whatever small of a

3487
02:00:45,198 --> 02:00:48,960
long-term effect i'm going to take the

3488
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:51,199
risk my family took the risk and many

3489
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:52,480
other people did of a vaccine of getting

3490
02:00:51,198 --> 02:00:54,238
vaccinated

3491
02:00:52,479 --> 02:00:56,000
because i think it's very small but i

3492
02:00:54,238 --> 02:00:58,479
understand where people can't make that

3493
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,920
decision and that begs the question what

3494
02:00:58,479 --> 02:01:01,598
would they need

3495
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:03,279
to make a decision so if you're

3496
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:06,719
concerned about

3497
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:09,118
an effect in 40 years

3498
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:10,880
we're not going to know for 40 years

3499
02:01:09,118 --> 02:01:12,880
yeah so i think if i were to speak

3500
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:14,960
because i suppose as i talked to like i

3501
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:16,880
mentioned offline to joe rogan and his

3502
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:18,639
podcast yesterday i talked to him all

3503
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:21,520
the time about this

3504
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:23,599
i think the concern

3505
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:25,199
is less about

3506
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:27,199
the uh

3507
02:01:25,198 --> 02:01:29,919
long-term effects

3508
02:01:27,198 --> 02:01:32,719
like on paper it's more about the

3509
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:35,359
the ins like um

3510
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:37,359
people like anthony fauci and

3511
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:40,479
people at the top are simply

3512
02:01:37,359 --> 02:01:43,118
misrepresenting the data or like are are

3513
02:01:40,479 --> 02:01:45,198
not accurately being transparent not

3514
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:47,198
collecting the data properly not

3515
02:01:45,198 --> 02:01:49,198
reporting on the data properly not being

3516
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:50,559
transparent not representing the

3517
02:01:49,198 --> 02:01:51,279
uncertainties

3518
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,159
not

3519
02:01:51,279 --> 02:01:54,800
us

3520
02:01:52,158 --> 02:01:57,279
openly saying they were wrong two months

3521
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,920
ago like in a way that's not like

3522
02:01:57,279 --> 02:02:01,840
dramatic but uh revealing the basic

3523
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:04,239
process of science when you have to do

3524
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:06,560
your best under uncertainty just also

3525
02:02:04,238 --> 02:02:07,678
just being inauthentic there's a there's

3526
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,880
a sense

3527
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:10,639
especially with like a younger

3528
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:12,880
generation now there's a certain way on

3529
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:14,159
the internet like the internet can smell

3530
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:16,079


3531
02:02:14,158 --> 02:02:16,799
much better than previous generations

3532
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:19,439
could

3533
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:20,599
and so they they see there's a kind of

3534
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:23,359
um

3535
02:02:20,599 --> 02:02:24,480
inauthenticity that comes with being

3536
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:27,039
uh

3537
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:30,399
like representing authority like i am a

3538
02:02:27,039 --> 02:02:32,319
scientist i'm an expert i have a phd i

3539
02:02:30,399 --> 02:02:34,479
have four decades of work therefore

3540
02:02:32,319 --> 02:02:37,118
everyone should listen to me got it and

3541
02:02:34,479 --> 02:02:38,479
somehow that maps to

3542
02:02:37,118 --> 02:02:41,039
this feeling

3543
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:43,359
of well what are they hiding if they're

3544
02:02:41,039 --> 02:02:45,760
speaking from authority like this if

3545
02:02:43,359 --> 02:02:47,839
everyone is in agreement like this that

3546
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:49,360
means they all have emails between each

3547
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:50,719
other they said we're going to tell this

3548
02:02:49,359 --> 02:02:51,759
this is the message we're going to tell

3549
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:53,439
the public

3550
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:55,760
then what is the truth

3551
02:02:53,439 --> 02:02:58,399
the actual truth maybe there's a much

3552
02:02:55,760 --> 02:03:00,239
bigger uncertainty maybe there's dead

3553
02:02:58,399 --> 02:03:02,879
people in the basement that they're

3554
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:05,039
hiding from from bad mrna vaccine

3555
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:07,039
experiments maybe they're and then and

3556
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:08,079
then the conspiracy theories start to

3557
02:03:07,039 --> 02:03:10,000
grow

3558
02:03:08,079 --> 02:03:12,800
uh naturally when there's this kind of

3559
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:15,840
mistrust of the that so it's less about

3560
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:15,840
kind of

3561
02:03:16,079 --> 02:03:18,960
like a deep concern about long-term

3562
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,960
effects

3563
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:24,079
it's a concern about

3564
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:24,079
long-term effects

3565
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:28,800
if we find out that there's some secret

3566
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:30,960
stuff that we're not being told it all

3567
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:32,960
runs on that so what what the heck i

3568
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:35,599
mean i so i put the blame not on the

3569
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:37,198
data but basically on the leaders and

3570
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:39,199
the community communicators of the

3571
02:03:37,198 --> 02:03:42,319
science at the top

3572
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:43,598
well to that i would say

3573
02:03:42,319 --> 02:03:47,039
all the data

3574
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:49,440
as far as i know are made public

3575
02:03:47,039 --> 02:03:51,840
so you can dive into it and i know a lot

3576
02:03:49,439 --> 02:03:53,519
of people ask me questions and i just

3577
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:55,039
say it's right here

3578
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:57,280
in the data and i know a lot of people

3579
02:03:55,039 --> 02:03:59,279
can't do that they can't dive into it

3580
02:03:57,279 --> 02:04:01,759
but that's one solution for people who

3581
02:03:59,279 --> 02:04:04,158
are able it's now you could argue well

3582
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:06,000
maybe they've left data out well then

3583
02:04:04,158 --> 02:04:07,679
not even i can help because then they're

3584
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,599
hiding it from me too and i think that's

3585
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:12,078
highly unlikely i think for the most

3586
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:14,880
part the fda requires the release of all

3587
02:04:12,078 --> 02:04:17,039
the clinical trial data right so okay

3588
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:18,639
what so this clinical trial data that's

3589
02:04:17,039 --> 02:04:20,560
one thing so that's the data that we

3590
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:22,880
should be focusing on right is it so

3591
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:25,280
there's there's a lot of different

3592
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:26,639
data sets here so there's preclinical

3593
02:04:25,279 --> 02:04:28,158
data which is

3594
02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:29,920
everything that was done in the lab

3595
02:04:28,158 --> 02:04:32,158
before this vaccine ever went into a

3596
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:33,840
human arm it's all the cell culture work

3597
02:04:32,158 --> 02:04:35,839
that we talked about a little

3598
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:38,480
experiments in animals

3599
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:40,560
all of that is publicly accessible most

3600
02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:44,158
of it gets published and then there's

3601
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:46,000
the initial drug filing which is huge

3602
02:04:44,158 --> 02:04:47,598
the books of dot you can get that and

3603
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,520
look at it right this is me sort of

3604
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:50,840
asking sort of difficult questions here

3605
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:53,840
right okay

3606
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:57,039
uh so there is a there's a lot of money

3607
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:58,319
to be made by makers of the vaccine

3608
02:04:57,039 --> 02:04:59,039
so

3609
02:04:58,319 --> 02:05:00,399
for

3610
02:04:59,039 --> 02:05:02,800
these company obviously there's a

3611
02:05:00,399 --> 02:05:04,158
distrust of those folks too they've done

3612
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:05,440
a lot of really good things in this

3613
02:05:04,158 --> 02:05:07,679
world but they've

3614
02:05:05,439 --> 02:05:10,000
there's the incentives are such that you

3615
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:13,199
want to sweep stuff under the rug

3616
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,439
if if you're not 100

3617
02:05:13,198 --> 02:05:16,559
pure in your ethics

3618
02:05:15,439 --> 02:05:19,279
and

3619
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:20,560
how hard is it for for that data to be

3620
02:05:19,279 --> 02:05:22,960
fabricated

3621
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:25,280
uh manipulated

3622
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:27,039
like what's your intuition for the the

3623
02:05:25,279 --> 02:05:28,078
pre-trial stuff i think when you when

3624
02:05:27,039 --> 02:05:31,359
you start

3625
02:05:28,078 --> 02:05:32,319
fabricating then you get inconsistencies

3626
02:05:31,359 --> 02:05:34,719
which are

3627
02:05:32,319 --> 02:05:36,960
pretty easy to pick up when you talk

3628
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:38,000
about some large-scale things of this

3629
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:40,319
nature

3630
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,560
because then you can look through the

3631
02:05:40,319 --> 02:05:44,238
data very you're gonna i mean we require

3632
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:45,840
looking very carefully but you will see

3633
02:05:44,238 --> 02:05:46,799
inconsistencies from one trial to

3634
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:48,800
another

3635
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:50,719
and uh that might ring a bell that

3636
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:52,560
something's been done

3637
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:53,920
yeah

3638
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:56,639
it's like it's like the moon landing

3639
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:59,359
thing i think sometimes like going to

3640
02:05:56,639 --> 02:06:00,078
the moon is easier than faking it

3641
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:01,759
right

3642
02:06:00,078 --> 02:06:03,679
in the sense it might be it might be

3643
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:05,920
easier to do a large-scale trial and get

3644
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:07,039
an effective vaccine versus faking it

3645
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:09,279
but you know when you brought up the

3646
02:06:07,039 --> 02:06:10,800
for-profit issue i i think that is

3647
02:06:09,279 --> 02:06:14,559
always been

3648
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:14,560
an issue i've always felt that

3649
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:21,679
having your health depend on for-profit

3650
02:06:17,439 --> 02:06:23,118
industry may not be the best solution

3651
02:06:21,679 --> 02:06:25,039
and i don't know how else to do it

3652
02:06:23,118 --> 02:06:26,238
people tell me i'm a dreamer that

3653
02:06:25,039 --> 02:06:27,679
thinking that

3654
02:06:26,238 --> 02:06:29,759
you know all medicines could be

3655
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:31,440
non-profit but i also think that the

3656
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:32,960
world should have one health system that

3657
02:06:31,439 --> 02:06:35,359
takes care of everyone right because

3658
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:37,599
there are some countries that can't and

3659
02:06:35,359 --> 02:06:38,479
other countries have an excess like us

3660
02:06:37,599 --> 02:06:40,560
so

3661
02:06:38,479 --> 02:06:42,000
i wish we could do that well the

3662
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:44,239
argument is

3663
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,840
the speed of which the vaccines for

3664
02:06:44,238 --> 02:06:48,559
covet were produced

3665
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:50,480
would never happen in a non-profit

3666
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:52,960
system would never happen in a

3667
02:06:50,479 --> 02:06:54,959
non-capitalist system oh i could set up

3668
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:57,760
a vaccine production

3669
02:06:54,960 --> 02:07:00,000
institute in the u.s that would get the

3670
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:01,920
vaccines done because you just need to

3671
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,078
put money into it that's what made these

3672
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:05,840
vaccines get done money they poured

3673
02:07:04,078 --> 02:07:06,880
billions of dollars and they got it done

3674
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:08,960
quickly

3675
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:11,199
but if i set up a non-profit institutes

3676
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:12,880
of vaccines throughout the u.s staffed

3677
02:07:11,198 --> 02:07:15,359
with really talented people pay them

3678
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:16,880
well keep them motivated you'll get your

3679
02:07:15,359 --> 02:07:19,598
vaccine no but

3680
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:22,480
that's the thing with capitalism is that

3681
02:07:19,599 --> 02:07:24,880
uh the selection of who to hire like

3682
02:07:22,479 --> 02:07:26,479
good when you say good people yeah the

3683
02:07:24,880 --> 02:07:28,880
capitalist has a machine

3684
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:30,879
that still fires people who are not good

3685
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:33,279
and selects people are good

3686
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:35,279
coming from the soviet union the dream

3687
02:07:33,279 --> 02:07:36,479
of communism is is similar to what

3688
02:07:35,279 --> 02:07:38,238
you're saying

3689
02:07:36,479 --> 02:07:40,799
broadly defined it certainly doesn't

3690
02:07:38,238 --> 02:07:43,279
work in the broad the question whether

3691
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:44,079
it works in the healthcare

3692
02:07:43,279 --> 02:07:45,198
uh

3693
02:07:44,078 --> 02:07:46,238
space

3694
02:07:45,198 --> 02:07:48,479
you know

3695
02:07:46,238 --> 02:07:51,279
there is some aspect to the machine of

3696
02:07:48,479 --> 02:07:53,439
capitalism being the most effective way

3697
02:07:51,279 --> 02:07:56,238
to select for good people and to

3698
02:07:53,439 --> 02:07:57,519
effectively produce the thing and but

3699
02:07:56,238 --> 02:07:58,959
then of course

3700
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:01,040
a lot of people would argue the current

3701
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:03,198
even the current healthcare is not

3702
02:08:01,039 --> 02:08:05,279
with like regulations there's some weird

3703
02:08:03,198 --> 02:08:07,598
mix where there's a lot of opportunities

3704
02:08:05,279 --> 02:08:09,359
for inefficiencies there's a lot of

3705
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:10,960
opportunities for bureaucracy so you

3706
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:12,479
have like the worst of

3707
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:15,118
all the world can't there be some

3708
02:08:12,479 --> 02:08:16,799
intermediate that works because

3709
02:08:15,118 --> 02:08:18,559
i mean the other issue that we haven't

3710
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:20,000
mentioned is that politics gets thrown

3711
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:21,679
into this and

3712
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,520
that really messes up and it should

3713
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:26,078
never be mixed with health care but it's

3714
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:27,760
it is because a lot of funding comes

3715
02:08:26,078 --> 02:08:30,000
from the government so that's another

3716
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:32,239
confounding factor but

3717
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,319
i i really think i could make

3718
02:08:32,238 --> 02:08:36,559
a vaccine institute that

3719
02:08:34,319 --> 02:08:38,319
if someone didn't do well i'd fire them

3720
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:40,320
no you're not going to stay if you can't

3721
02:08:38,319 --> 02:08:41,920
do your job and do it well you don't

3722
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:44,479
give them incentives but it doesn't have

3723
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:46,560
to be the two extremes i think it has

3724
02:08:44,479 --> 02:08:47,359
there has to be a solution that people

3725
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:50,639
don't

3726
02:08:47,359 --> 02:08:52,639
have this mistrust for a company making

3727
02:08:50,639 --> 02:08:54,880
huge profits off of a drug but you know

3728
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:57,359
what it's funny

3729
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:59,599
it seems that vaccines and antivirals

3730
02:08:57,359 --> 02:09:01,198
bear the brunt of this criticism yet

3731
02:08:59,599 --> 02:09:02,319
there are many other pharmaceuticals

3732
02:09:01,198 --> 02:09:04,799
that people

3733
02:09:02,319 --> 02:09:06,399
rely on yeah of all sorts they don't

3734
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:07,599
seem to question and have issues with

3735
02:09:06,399 --> 02:09:10,078
those and they have far more side

3736
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:11,199
effects than vaccines it's very strange

3737
02:09:10,078 --> 02:09:14,238
how we're

3738
02:09:11,198 --> 02:09:17,359
picking that way but i should also say

3739
02:09:14,238 --> 02:09:20,638
that when you know if you have one big

3740
02:09:17,359 --> 02:09:21,839
vaccine institute one of the other

3741
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:24,159
like

3742
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:26,639
sets of uh

3743
02:09:24,158 --> 02:09:28,319
vaccine conspiracies

3744
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:30,719
i mean i would say they're

3745
02:09:28,319 --> 02:09:33,840
a little farther out into the into the

3746
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:35,840
wild set of ideas but it's you know

3747
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:37,119
that's one way to con control the

3748
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:38,880
populace

3749
02:09:37,118 --> 02:09:42,319
is by injecting

3750
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:44,239
substances into them right people i mean

3751
02:09:42,319 --> 02:09:45,599
part of that

3752
02:09:44,238 --> 02:09:48,000
funny enough is probably has to do with

3753
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:49,520
needles versus uh something you put in

3754
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,279
your mouth yeah but there's something

3755
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:53,760
about the government especially when

3756
02:09:51,279 --> 02:09:56,479
it's governor mandated injection of a

3757
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:58,000
substance into you i don't it doesn't i

3758
02:09:56,479 --> 02:10:00,959
don't care what the science says if it's

3759
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:04,319
100 effective 100 safe

3760
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:06,719
there's a natural distrust of what like

3761
02:10:04,319 --> 02:10:08,880
even if this is effective

3762
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:11,520
and safe

3763
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:13,118
giving the government power to do this

3764
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:17,520
yeah aren't they going to start getting

3765
02:10:13,118 --> 02:10:20,799
ideas down the line for you know uh

3766
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:22,560
i i think that they can barely govern i

3767
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:24,639
don't think they're gonna do that but

3768
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:26,000
you don't have to take

3769
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:27,840
unless you're a federal employee you

3770
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:32,078
don't have to take a covet vaccine right

3771
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:33,679
yeah but that's that largely has to do

3772
02:10:32,078 --> 02:10:36,880
not largely but

3773
02:10:33,679 --> 02:10:37,760
there is an individualistic

3774
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:39,279
uh

3775
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:41,280
spirit

3776
02:10:39,279 --> 02:10:43,439
you know to them to the american people

3777
02:10:41,279 --> 02:10:45,840
there's this like you're not going to

3778
02:10:43,439 --> 02:10:47,839
take my gun away from me sure you're not

3779
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:50,159
going and i think that

3780
02:10:47,840 --> 02:10:50,159
you know

3781
02:10:51,279 --> 02:10:54,319
that's that's

3782
02:10:52,639 --> 02:10:56,400
that's something that

3783
02:10:54,319 --> 02:10:58,319
makes america what it is just coming

3784
02:10:56,399 --> 02:11:00,799
from the soviet union there's a power to

3785
02:10:58,319 --> 02:11:02,719
sort of resisting the overreach of

3786
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:04,400
government that's quite interesting

3787
02:11:02,719 --> 02:11:05,840
because i'm a believer

3788
02:11:04,399 --> 02:11:08,000
i i hope

3789
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:10,480
that it's possible to have

3790
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:13,039
to strive towards a a government that

3791
02:11:10,479 --> 02:11:15,118
works extremely well i think at its best

3792
02:11:13,039 --> 02:11:16,880
a government represents the people and

3793
02:11:15,118 --> 02:11:20,078
functions in the similar way that you're

3794
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:21,679
you're mentioning but that like pushback

3795
02:11:20,078 --> 02:11:23,279
even if it turns into conspiracy

3796
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:26,000
theories sometimes i think is actually

3797
02:11:23,279 --> 02:11:28,319
healthy in the long arc of history it

3798
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:30,800
can be frustrating sometimes but that

3799
02:11:28,319 --> 02:11:33,599
mechanism of pushing back against power

3800
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:35,920
against authority can be healthy i i

3801
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:38,159
agree i think it's fine to question the

3802
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:40,078
vaccines what i have issue with is that

3803
02:11:38,158 --> 02:11:41,359
many people

3804
02:11:40,078 --> 02:11:43,679
put out

3805
02:11:41,359 --> 02:11:45,679
incorrect information and i'm not sure

3806
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:48,560
what their motivations are and it's very

3807
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:51,599
hard to fight that because then it's my

3808
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:54,239
word versus theirs and i'm happy to talk

3809
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:56,639
with people about any of their concerns

3810
02:11:54,238 --> 02:11:58,879
but if you start getting into the stuff

3811
02:11:56,639 --> 02:12:00,960
that just isn't true then we have a

3812
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:03,279
problem the thing i struggle with is

3813
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:04,800
conspiracy theories

3814
02:12:03,279 --> 02:12:07,198
whatever language you want to use but

3815
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:10,719
sort of

3816
02:12:07,198 --> 02:12:13,598
ideas that challenge the mainstream

3817
02:12:10,719 --> 02:12:15,520
quote unquote narrative

3818
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:17,920
given our current social media and

3819
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:19,040
internet like the way it operates they

3820
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:20,960
can become

3821
02:12:19,039 --> 02:12:22,960
viral much easier there's something much

3822
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:25,039
more compelling about them sure like i

3823
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:27,679
have a secret

3824
02:12:25,039 --> 02:12:29,599
that about the way things really work

3825
02:12:27,679 --> 02:12:31,359
that becomes viral and that's very

3826
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:33,599
frustrating because then you're not

3827
02:12:31,359 --> 02:12:35,359
having a conversation on level ground

3828
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:37,119
the

3829
02:12:35,359 --> 02:12:38,719
you know when you're trying to present

3830
02:12:37,118 --> 02:12:40,399
scientific ideas and then there's

3831
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:42,800
conspiracy theories the conspiracy

3832
02:12:40,399 --> 02:12:44,158
theories become much viral much faster

3833
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:46,639
and then you're not just having a

3834
02:12:44,158 --> 02:12:47,679
discussion on level ground it's

3835
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:49,279
um

3836
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:51,760
that that's the frustrating part that

3837
02:12:49,279 --> 02:12:53,679
it's not an even discussion

3838
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:55,039
can i just say one more thing so i mean

3839
02:12:53,679 --> 02:12:56,560
the internet is here to stay so we're

3840
02:12:55,039 --> 02:12:59,359
gonna have to figure out how to deal

3841
02:12:56,560 --> 02:13:01,520
with it right but from my perspective i

3842
02:12:59,359 --> 02:13:04,158
was skeptical that these mrna vaccine

3843
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:06,480
that any coveted vaccine would be

3844
02:13:04,158 --> 02:13:07,920
ready within a year yeah that's amazing

3845
02:13:06,479 --> 02:13:08,718
me too plus

3846
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:11,279
these

3847
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:14,480
the way i look at the mrna vaccine as a

3848
02:13:11,279 --> 02:13:17,599
scientist it's g-whiz to me it's amazing

3849
02:13:14,479 --> 02:13:19,439
that it worked and i think the data are

3850
02:13:17,599 --> 02:13:21,840
great so i want it

3851
02:13:19,439 --> 02:13:24,559
well as a scientist i wanted one of the

3852
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:28,800
really sad things again with me too as a

3853
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:28,800
scientist or as a admirer of science is

3854
02:13:29,679 --> 02:13:33,760
i don't know if it's politics but one of

3855
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:34,880
the sad things to me about the previous

3856
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:36,000
year

3857
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:38,560
is that

3858
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,960
i i wasn't free to celebrate the

3859
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:43,440
incredible accomplishment of science

3860
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:45,920
with the vaccines i was very skeptical

3861
02:13:43,439 --> 02:13:47,678
as possible to develop a vaccine

3862
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:48,560
so quickly

3863
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:50,639
so

3864
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:52,880
it's unfortunate that we can't celebrate

3865
02:13:50,639 --> 02:13:54,960
how amazing humans are to to come up

3866
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:57,199
with this vaccine now this vaccine might

3867
02:13:54,960 --> 02:14:00,078
have long-term effects

3868
02:13:57,198 --> 02:14:02,479
that doesn't mean this is not incredible

3869
02:14:00,078 --> 02:14:04,559
why why um

3870
02:14:02,479 --> 02:14:06,238
why couldn't you celebrate

3871
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:08,159
um

3872
02:14:06,238 --> 02:14:09,839
because i would love to inspire the

3873
02:14:08,158 --> 02:14:11,279
world with the amazing things science

3874
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:12,960
can do

3875
02:14:11,279 --> 02:14:14,639
and you know when you say something

3876
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:16,399
about the vaccines they're not listening

3877
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:18,078
to the science a lot of people are not

3878
02:14:16,399 --> 02:14:18,960
listening to the science what they hear

3879
02:14:18,078 --> 02:14:21,359
is

3880
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:23,599
oh you're um

3881
02:14:21,359 --> 02:14:25,359
you're a republican or you're a democrat

3882
02:14:23,599 --> 02:14:27,119
and you're social signaling of doing

3883
02:14:25,359 --> 02:14:28,719
some kind of signaling no i think that

3884
02:14:27,118 --> 02:14:31,359
the vaccine you're talking about

3885
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:32,399
injecting something into you and maybe

3886
02:14:31,359 --> 02:14:34,078
you're right

3887
02:14:32,399 --> 02:14:36,479
that the rhetoric is like you better

3888
02:14:34,078 --> 02:14:38,319
take this or you're or you're dumb

3889
02:14:36,479 --> 02:14:39,759
you know it's not the right approach

3890
02:14:38,319 --> 02:14:41,439
i've seen actually it's kind of

3891
02:14:39,760 --> 02:14:42,960
interesting i think both sides kind of

3892
02:14:41,439 --> 02:14:45,039
imply that

3893
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:48,880
so the

3894
02:14:45,039 --> 02:14:52,319
the people who are against the vaccine

3895
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:55,679
are dumb for not trusting science

3896
02:14:52,319 --> 02:14:57,599
and the people who are for the vaccine

3897
02:14:55,679 --> 02:15:00,000
are called dumb

3898
02:14:57,599 --> 02:15:01,760
for trusting science the scientific

3899
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:05,279
nobody wins yeah

3900
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:07,840
and they both kind of have a point

3901
02:15:05,279 --> 02:15:10,238
like because because you can always it's

3902
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:13,840
like a glass half full or half empty

3903
02:15:10,238 --> 02:15:16,959
because you can always look at um

3904
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:20,000
like science from a perspective of

3905
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:22,960
certain individuals that don't represent

3906
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:25,439
uh perhaps not greatest leaders

3907
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:27,599
uh almost like political leaders there's

3908
02:15:25,439 --> 02:15:30,719
a lot of you know i've

3909
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:32,800
yesterday went on a whole rant um

3910
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:34,800
against i said a lot of positive things

3911
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:36,880
about anthony fauci before i went on a

3912
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:39,520
rant i guess

3913
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:41,920
uh because ultimately

3914
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:43,760
you know i think he failed as a leader

3915
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:45,359
and i know it's very difficult to be a

3916
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:47,199
leader but i still wanted to hold him

3917
02:15:45,359 --> 02:15:49,359
accountable for that

3918
02:15:47,198 --> 02:15:51,279
as a great communicator of science and

3919
02:15:49,359 --> 02:15:54,719
as a great leader what what do you think

3920
02:15:51,279 --> 02:15:54,719
he didn't do right i'm curious

3921
02:15:55,039 --> 02:15:59,359
so

3922
02:15:57,198 --> 02:16:01,359
the core of the problem

3923
02:15:59,359 --> 02:16:02,799
is

3924
02:16:01,359 --> 02:16:04,559
the

3925
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:06,960
several characteristics of the way he

3926
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:09,520
was communicating to the public so one

3927
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:10,319
is the general inauthenticity

3928
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:12,800
uh

3929
02:16:10,319 --> 02:16:15,759
two is a thing that

3930
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:17,520
it's very hard to put into words but

3931
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:18,639
there are certain ways of speaking to

3932
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:20,560
people

3933
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:21,599
that sounds like you're hiding something

3934
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:23,920
from them

3935
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:25,840
that sounds like you're full of

3936
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:29,599
that's the authenticity piece like it

3937
02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:32,880
sounds like you're not

3938
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:36,318
really speaking to the full truth

3939
02:16:32,879 --> 02:16:38,398
of what you know and that you did some

3940
02:16:36,318 --> 02:16:39,359
shady in your past

3941
02:16:38,398 --> 02:16:41,760
you're

3942
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:43,920
trying to hide so that's a way of

3943
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:45,679
communicating that i think the internet

3944
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:47,280
and people in general are becoming much

3945
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:49,439
better at detecting it's like you said

3946
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:51,439
they're good bs detection yeah good bs

3947
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:53,679
detectors uh then

3948
02:16:51,439 --> 02:16:58,079
but contributing to that is speaking

3949
02:16:53,679 --> 02:17:02,478
from authority yes speaking um with with

3950
02:16:58,079 --> 02:17:04,478
uh with authority and confidence where

3951
02:17:02,478 --> 02:17:05,358
neither is deserved

3952
02:17:04,478 --> 02:17:08,239
so

3953
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:11,040
first of all nobody's an authority on on

3954
02:17:08,239 --> 02:17:13,439
this new virus right we're facing a

3955
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:14,240
deadly pandemic and threatens especially

3956
02:17:13,439 --> 02:17:16,079
in

3957
02:17:14,239 --> 02:17:17,439
the early stages it was unclear how

3958
02:17:16,079 --> 02:17:19,679
deadly it would be

3959
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:22,479
it was unclear probably still unclear

3960
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:24,318
fully how it's transmitted the full

3961
02:17:22,478 --> 02:17:25,599
dynamics of the virus

3962
02:17:24,318 --> 02:17:26,879
the full

3963
02:17:25,599 --> 02:17:28,478
the full understanding of which

3964
02:17:26,879 --> 02:17:31,199
solutions work and not

3965
02:17:28,478 --> 02:17:33,358
how well masks of different kinds work

3966
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:36,079
how easy or difficult it is to create

3967
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:38,960
tests how many months or years is going

3968
02:17:36,079 --> 02:17:42,079
to take to create a vaccine

3969
02:17:38,959 --> 02:17:44,079
how well in history or currently do

3970
02:17:42,079 --> 02:17:46,398
quarantine methods or lockdown methods

3971
02:17:44,079 --> 02:17:48,079
work how you know what are the different

3972
02:17:46,398 --> 02:17:49,119
data mechanisms

3973
02:17:48,079 --> 02:17:50,879
that are

3974
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:52,800
data collection mechanisms that are

3975
02:17:50,879 --> 02:17:54,398
being implemented what are the clear

3976
02:17:52,799 --> 02:17:57,518
plans they need to

3977
02:17:54,398 --> 02:17:59,679
uh happen what the epidemiology that's

3978
02:17:57,519 --> 02:18:00,719
happening what is the uncertainty around

3979
02:17:59,679 --> 02:18:02,318
that

3980
02:18:00,718 --> 02:18:04,398
um

3981
02:18:02,318 --> 02:18:08,478
then then there's the geopolitical stuff

3982
02:18:04,398 --> 02:18:10,959
with with china you know like what uh

3983
02:18:08,478 --> 02:18:12,558
uh i you know personally believe there

3984
02:18:10,959 --> 02:18:15,119
should have been much more openness

3985
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:17,679
about the the origins of the virus

3986
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:19,679
whether a leak from a lab or not i think

3987
02:18:17,679 --> 02:18:21,120
communicating that you're open to these

3988
02:18:19,679 --> 02:18:23,599
ideas

3989
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:25,679
is actually the way

3990
02:18:23,599 --> 02:18:28,639
to get people to trust you that you're

3991
02:18:25,679 --> 02:18:30,398
legitimately open to ideas that are very

3992
02:18:28,638 --> 02:18:32,558
unpleasant that go against the

3993
02:18:30,398 --> 02:18:34,799
mainstream

3994
02:18:32,558 --> 02:18:37,679
showing that openness is going to get

3995
02:18:34,799 --> 02:18:39,920
people to trust you when you finally

3996
02:18:37,679 --> 02:18:42,159
decrease the variance in your

3997
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:43,840
uncertainty like decrease uncertainty

3998
02:18:42,159 --> 02:18:45,519
and have we still have a lot of

3999
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:47,840
uncertainty but this is the best course

4000
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:50,478
of action vaccines still have a lot of

4001
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:52,558
uncertainty around them mrna is a new

4002
02:18:50,478 --> 02:18:54,159
technology but we have increasing

4003
02:18:52,558 --> 02:18:56,879
amounts of data and here's the data

4004
02:18:54,159 --> 02:18:58,638
sources and like laying them out in a

4005
02:18:56,879 --> 02:19:00,558
very clear way

4006
02:18:58,638 --> 02:19:02,318
of this is the best course of action

4007
02:19:00,558 --> 02:19:04,879
that we have now we don't know if it's

4008
02:19:02,318 --> 02:19:07,039
the perfect course of action but it's by

4009
02:19:04,879 --> 02:19:09,679
far the best course of action and that

4010
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:12,319
would that would come from a leader that

4011
02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:14,960
has earned the capital of of trust from

4012
02:19:12,318 --> 02:19:17,439
people i mean i think

4013
02:19:14,959 --> 02:19:20,558
in recent history the worst pandemic is

4014
02:19:17,439 --> 02:19:22,559
1918 flew right but that's mainly

4015
02:19:20,558 --> 02:19:24,318
because we didn't know what to do we

4016
02:19:22,558 --> 02:19:26,398
didn't have many tools at our disposal

4017
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:28,638
and that was tied up with world war one

4018
02:19:26,398 --> 02:19:30,718
that's right that's right so the the

4019
02:19:28,638 --> 02:19:33,438
leadership there i mean but i don't know

4020
02:19:30,718 --> 02:19:35,759
what what is a lot of deaths right and

4021
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:37,439
any one person is someone's family so to

4022
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:40,398
them it's a lot right

4023
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:41,679
but that logic we don't apply that logic

4024
02:19:40,398 --> 02:19:42,879
generally

4025
02:19:41,679 --> 02:19:44,879
because there's a lot of people

4026
02:19:42,879 --> 02:19:46,239
suffering and dying throughout the world

4027
02:19:44,879 --> 02:19:47,839
and we turn

4028
02:19:46,239 --> 02:19:50,000
turn the other way all the time and

4029
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:52,079
that's the story of history so saying

4030
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:54,639
saying you all of a sudden what bothers

4031
02:19:52,079 --> 02:19:57,840
me though i mean personally i don't like

4032
02:19:54,639 --> 02:19:59,439
anyone dying anywhere but and especially

4033
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:01,439
considering what

4034
02:19:59,439 --> 02:20:02,960
technology we're able to muster yet we

4035
02:20:01,439 --> 02:20:04,559
still kill each other it's just a

4036
02:20:02,959 --> 02:20:06,559
dichotomy to me

4037
02:20:04,559 --> 02:20:08,959
yeah but i mean this is the what is the

4038
02:20:06,559 --> 02:20:10,318
paul farmer uh

4039
02:20:08,959 --> 02:20:12,159
there's these great stories i mean

4040
02:20:10,318 --> 02:20:14,318
that's that's the

4041
02:20:12,159 --> 02:20:16,478
that's the um

4042
02:20:14,318 --> 02:20:19,039
that's the burden of

4043
02:20:16,478 --> 02:20:20,559
being in health care being a doctor

4044
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:22,000
is

4045
02:20:20,559 --> 02:20:24,559
you have

4046
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:26,959
to help you can't help but help a person

4047
02:20:24,559 --> 02:20:28,879
in front of you who's hurting sure

4048
02:20:26,959 --> 02:20:31,599
but you also are burdened by the

4049
02:20:28,879 --> 02:20:33,759
knowledge that you helping them you

4050
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:34,880
spending money and effort and time on

4051
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:36,800
them

4052
02:20:34,879 --> 02:20:38,559
means you're not going to help others

4053
02:20:36,799 --> 02:20:40,559
and you cannot possibly allocate that

4054
02:20:38,559 --> 02:20:42,398
amount of time to everybody so you're

4055
02:20:40,559 --> 02:20:43,600
choosing which person lives and which

4056
02:20:42,398 --> 02:20:45,840
person dies

4057
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:47,200
sure and you're doing so the reason

4058
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:48,639
you're helping the person in front of

4059
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:51,439
you because is because they're in front

4060
02:20:48,639 --> 02:20:54,079
of you and so the reason right now we

4061
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:56,479
care a lot about kovid is because the

4062
02:20:54,079 --> 02:20:58,398
the eye of the world has turned to covet

4063
02:20:56,478 --> 02:21:00,318
but we're not seeing all the all the

4064
02:20:58,398 --> 02:21:02,318
other atrocities going on in the world

4065
02:21:00,318 --> 02:21:04,159
they're not necessarily related to

4066
02:21:02,318 --> 02:21:05,920
deaths they're related to suffering

4067
02:21:04,159 --> 02:21:07,359
human suffering which you could argue is

4068
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:09,920
worse than death

4069
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:13,280
prolonged suffering of course so there's

4070
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:15,120
al there's all these questions and and

4071
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:18,159
the the fundamental question

4072
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:20,160
here is are we overreacting to kovid in

4073
02:21:18,159 --> 02:21:22,559
our policies so the

4074
02:21:20,159 --> 02:21:24,398
this is the

4075
02:21:22,559 --> 02:21:26,799
when we turn our eye and care about this

4076
02:21:24,398 --> 02:21:28,799
particular thing and not other things

4077
02:21:26,799 --> 02:21:30,639
are we dismissing the pain that business

4078
02:21:28,799 --> 02:21:33,759
owners who've lost their businesses are

4079
02:21:30,639 --> 02:21:36,478
going to feel and then the long

4080
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:39,280
talking about long covid the long-term

4081
02:21:36,478 --> 02:21:41,760
effects economic effects on the millions

4082
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:43,760
of people that will suffer that suffer

4083
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:44,800
financially but also suffer from their

4084
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:47,280
dreams

4085
02:21:44,799 --> 02:21:48,799
being completely collapsed so a lot of

4086
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:51,359
people seek

4087
02:21:48,799 --> 02:21:52,719
gain meaning from work and if you take

4088
02:21:51,359 --> 02:21:54,880
away that work

4089
02:21:52,719 --> 02:21:57,279
there's anger that can be born there's

4090
02:21:54,879 --> 02:21:59,358
pain and so what does that lead to that

4091
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:02,239
can lead to the

4092
02:21:59,359 --> 02:22:04,318
rising up of charismatic leaders that

4093
02:22:02,239 --> 02:22:06,000
channel that anger towards destructive

4094
02:22:04,318 --> 02:22:08,478
things that's been done throughout

4095
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:11,280
history it's like you have to balance

4096
02:22:08,478 --> 02:22:12,879
that with the policies that you have and

4097
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:16,159
covid and then

4098
02:22:12,879 --> 02:22:17,438
i mean uh very much my main opposition

4099
02:22:16,159 --> 02:22:19,439
to uh

4100
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:23,040
fauci is not on the details but the

4101
02:22:19,439 --> 02:22:25,120
final result which is i just observe

4102
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:26,800
that there's a significant decrease in

4103
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:29,200
trust in science

4104
02:22:26,799 --> 02:22:31,119
as a

4105
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:32,960
not the institution but the various sort

4106
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:35,760
of mechanisms of science i think

4107
02:22:32,959 --> 02:22:37,279
sciences is both beautiful and powerful

4108
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:39,120
and the reason why we have so many

4109
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:40,479
amazing things and such a high quality

4110
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:41,120
of life

4111
02:22:40,478 --> 02:22:43,599
and

4112
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:45,680
distrust in that that the thing we need

4113
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:46,559
now to get out of all the troubles we're

4114
02:22:45,680 --> 02:22:48,159
in

4115
02:22:46,559 --> 02:22:50,159
continue getting out of the troubles

4116
02:22:48,159 --> 02:22:53,200
we're in is science the scientific

4117
02:22:50,159 --> 02:22:54,879
process broadly defined like innovation

4118
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:57,439
technological innovation scientific

4119
02:22:54,879 --> 02:23:00,959
innovation all of that

4120
02:22:57,439 --> 02:23:03,680
distrust in that is is uh is totally the

4121
02:23:00,959 --> 02:23:04,799
wrong thing we need and so anybody who

4122
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:07,200
gets in

4123
02:23:04,799 --> 02:23:08,239
who uh causes a distrust in science to

4124
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,760
me

4125
02:23:08,239 --> 02:23:10,719
um

4126
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:12,159
um

4127
02:23:10,719 --> 02:23:14,239
you know um

4128
02:23:12,159 --> 02:23:16,959
carries the responsibility of that

4129
02:23:14,239 --> 02:23:19,119
and uh should be in because the response

4130
02:23:16,959 --> 02:23:20,000
means should be fired should be should

4131
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:22,079
be

4132
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:24,239
or at least uh

4133
02:23:22,079 --> 02:23:26,559
openly have to carry the burden of that

4134
02:23:24,239 --> 02:23:28,639
of having caused of that kind of level

4135
02:23:26,559 --> 02:23:31,039
of mistrust now it may be unfair to

4136
02:23:28,639 --> 02:23:34,398
place it on any one individual but you

4137
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:36,479
have to uh i think in your pocket

4138
02:23:34,398 --> 02:23:37,519
the buck stops at the top like

4139
02:23:36,478 --> 02:23:40,000
the leaders

4140
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:42,399
no no there's a clear leader here yes

4141
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,600
absolutely so even if it's not directly

4142
02:23:42,398 --> 02:23:46,879
his fault

4143
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:48,239
you know he has to carry uh uh carry the

4144
02:23:46,879 --> 02:23:50,079
price of that

4145
02:23:48,239 --> 02:23:53,520
do you think we should

4146
02:23:50,079 --> 02:23:55,120
at this point say okay we have vaccines

4147
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:57,439
you can decide whether you take them or

4148
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:59,120
not let's move forward

4149
02:23:57,439 --> 02:24:02,239
maybe you can help me understand this

4150
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:04,560
because it seems like

4151
02:24:02,239 --> 02:24:07,199
why is that not the right solution

4152
02:24:04,559 --> 02:24:10,079
completely open society the vaccines at

4153
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:11,200
least in the in the united states as i

4154
02:24:10,079 --> 02:24:12,239
understand

4155
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:14,159
are

4156
02:24:12,239 --> 02:24:15,520
widely available

4157
02:24:14,159 --> 02:24:17,119
so

4158
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:20,000
this is the american way you have the

4159
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:22,560
decision to make if you have

4160
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:24,879
uh conditions that make you worried to

4161
02:24:22,559 --> 02:24:26,719
get coveted and go to the hospital then

4162
02:24:24,879 --> 02:24:29,438
you should get vaccinated because here's

4163
02:24:26,719 --> 02:24:31,119
the data that shows that it's much less

4164
02:24:29,439 --> 02:24:33,359
likely for you to die

4165
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:35,120
uh right if you take if you get

4166
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:37,200
vaccinated if you don't want to get

4167
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:39,520
vaccinated because you're worried about

4168
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:41,439
a long-term effects of vaccine that you

4169
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:43,040
don't have to but then you suffered the

4170
02:24:41,439 --> 02:24:44,398
consequences of that

4171
02:24:43,040 --> 02:24:46,800
and that's it

4172
02:24:44,398 --> 02:24:49,358
so i here's what i think is driving

4173
02:24:46,799 --> 02:24:50,159
the i think it's all about kids

4174
02:24:49,359 --> 02:24:51,200
right

4175
02:24:50,159 --> 02:24:52,398
because they're going to go back to

4176
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:55,680
school in the fool and many of them

4177
02:24:52,398 --> 02:24:58,478
can't be vaccinated right so

4178
02:24:55,680 --> 02:25:01,120
if they get infected they do have less

4179
02:24:58,478 --> 02:25:02,559
frequency of disease but it's not zero

4180
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:03,760
they do get sick and they can have

4181
02:25:02,559 --> 02:25:05,840
long-term

4182
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:08,398
consequences and

4183
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:10,478
at that age it would be

4184
02:25:08,398 --> 02:25:12,239
a shame right and not even their choice

4185
02:25:10,478 --> 02:25:13,840
they can't decide

4186
02:25:12,239 --> 02:25:16,079
to get vaccinated or not because they

4187
02:25:13,840 --> 02:25:18,880
can't have access to it so i think that

4188
02:25:16,079 --> 02:25:20,478
would that's what would drive my

4189
02:25:18,879 --> 02:25:23,199
efforts to try and get more people at

4190
02:25:20,478 --> 02:25:25,119
least in schools vaccinated but i might

4191
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:26,720
be wrong it may not be that so can you

4192
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:29,439
kind of dig into that a little bit so

4193
02:25:26,719 --> 02:25:29,438
there's um

4194
02:25:30,879 --> 02:25:35,119
see you're saying that there should be

4195
02:25:32,478 --> 02:25:38,799
an effort for increased vaccinations

4196
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:40,640
of of kids going to school just not for

4197
02:25:38,799 --> 02:25:42,959
societal benefit but for the benefit of

4198
02:25:40,639 --> 02:25:45,199
each individual kid right so right now

4199
02:25:42,959 --> 02:25:47,519
kids under

4200
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:49,760
12 right you're not yet vaccinated is

4201
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:51,760
that correct yeah i think so

4202
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:53,600
and it's going to be it's not gonna

4203
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:55,040
be in time for school opening that they

4204
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:56,640
get vaccinated

4205
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:58,160
um

4206
02:25:56,639 --> 02:25:59,920
and then

4207
02:25:58,159 --> 02:26:01,920
i mean i suppose the teachers are all

4208
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:03,760
gonna be vaccinated it makes sense for

4209
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:05,280
them to do that but i'm just worried the

4210
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:07,439
kids are gonna be transmitting it

4211
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:10,079
amongst them and many states don't allow

4212
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:12,800
mass mandate in school so

4213
02:26:10,079 --> 02:26:14,000
i think that's what's driving the larger

4214
02:26:12,799 --> 02:26:16,559
narrative

4215
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:18,159
in the u.s to protect kids

4216
02:26:16,559 --> 02:26:19,680
it's kind of what i hear from daniel

4217
02:26:18,159 --> 02:26:21,680
griffin

4218
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:24,239
because increasing numbers of kids are

4219
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:26,159
being admitted to hospitals now because

4220
02:26:24,239 --> 02:26:27,600
they're the they're becoming the major

4221
02:26:26,159 --> 02:26:29,200
unvaccinated

4222
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:30,559
population they're hanging out over the

4223
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:32,240
summer and that's just going to get

4224
02:26:30,559 --> 02:26:34,559
worse in the fall

4225
02:26:32,239 --> 02:26:36,719
and so you could have a lot of kids with

4226
02:26:34,559 --> 02:26:38,239
long covered and disabled their entire

4227
02:26:36,719 --> 02:26:39,358
lives right so

4228
02:26:38,239 --> 02:26:41,280
and of course

4229
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:43,840
hearing from people who are vaccine

4230
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:46,399
hesitant i hear exactly the kids

4231
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:48,880
statement but they're saying

4232
02:26:46,398 --> 02:26:50,398
they don't want the long

4233
02:26:48,879 --> 02:26:52,159
vaccine

4234
02:26:50,398 --> 02:26:54,799
the long-term effects of the vaccine to

4235
02:26:52,159 --> 02:26:57,439
affect the kids that's the of the co of

4236
02:26:54,799 --> 02:26:59,840
this new vegetable which i would say is

4237
02:26:57,439 --> 02:27:01,359
as i said before you can't say

4238
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:04,079
never but

4239
02:27:01,359 --> 02:27:06,720
we do know that long

4240
02:27:04,079 --> 02:27:08,318
covid exists we don't know for how long

4241
02:27:06,719 --> 02:27:11,119
because we've only looked out six or

4242
02:27:08,318 --> 02:27:12,799
eight months we know that exists and the

4243
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:15,040
frequency is increasing it certainly

4244
02:27:12,799 --> 02:27:17,438
exists in young kids and we have no idea

4245
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:19,680
about long vaccine effects so i think

4246
02:27:17,439 --> 02:27:22,398
they have to make their decision

4247
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:22,398
based on that

4248
02:27:22,799 --> 02:27:27,519
but yeah but your question is why don't

4249
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:29,520
we just open up

4250
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:31,040
society say here we have these vaccines

4251
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:33,040
if you want to protect yourself i think

4252
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:35,359
it's mainly the school that's driving

4253
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:38,000
the whole narrative that's my opinion in

4254
02:27:35,359 --> 02:27:40,399
which direction not to open up or no to

4255
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,920
open up but to try and get

4256
02:27:40,398 --> 02:27:44,000
you know their efforts at the federal

4257
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:46,000
level to get people vaccinated right but

4258
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:48,398
see how high are the risk for kids i

4259
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:51,359
mean as my understanding was it's i mean

4260
02:27:48,398 --> 02:27:52,239
yes it's non-zero but it's very low

4261
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:55,960
for

4262
02:27:52,239 --> 02:27:58,559
but what is the numbers now 70 000

4263
02:27:55,959 --> 02:28:02,639
hospitalizations so far in kids as of

4264
02:27:58,559 --> 02:28:03,680
last week so yes it's low but

4265
02:28:02,639 --> 02:28:07,358
i i

4266
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:08,800
polio was low polio was 20 30 000 kids a

4267
02:28:07,359 --> 02:28:09,680
year paralyzed

4268
02:28:08,799 --> 02:28:11,438
and

4269
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:13,439
well many people have actually argued

4270
02:28:11,439 --> 02:28:15,280
that that vaccine wasn't necessary you

4271
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:16,880
know

4272
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:18,399
that wasn't a substantial enough health

4273
02:28:16,879 --> 02:28:21,438
problem but paralyzed is different than

4274
02:28:18,398 --> 02:28:23,039
hospital so what does hospitalized mean

4275
02:28:21,439 --> 02:28:24,880
but this is the long covered question i

4276
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:27,840
mean this is the open question it was

4277
02:28:24,879 --> 02:28:29,279
long covered in kids what is that so

4278
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:31,200
well

4279
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:32,319
a lot of the same issues cognitive

4280
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:34,399
issues

4281
02:28:32,318 --> 02:28:36,079
motor issues

4282
02:28:34,398 --> 02:28:39,199
respiratory

4283
02:28:36,079 --> 02:28:40,959
gi dysfunction how long

4284
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:43,200
we don't know

4285
02:28:40,959 --> 02:28:46,079
i mean it could end in a year

4286
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:48,079
as you know there are other post acute

4287
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:50,959
infectious sequelae that we know about

4288
02:28:48,079 --> 02:28:52,639
you know chronic fatigue mecfs

4289
02:28:50,959 --> 02:28:54,879
is thought to be a post-infectious

4290
02:28:52,639 --> 02:28:56,559
sequelae which has gone for many decades

4291
02:28:54,879 --> 02:28:59,599
now and many millions of people this

4292
02:28:56,559 --> 02:29:00,959
could be another another one of those so

4293
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:03,600
i'm just saying it

4294
02:29:00,959 --> 02:29:06,159
might be worth airing on the side of

4295
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:09,520
not letting the kids get infected yeah

4296
02:29:06,159 --> 02:29:11,200
but well i'm trying to keep an open mind

4297
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:14,560
here and i appreciate you doing you're

4298
02:29:11,200 --> 02:29:14,560
doing the same of course i

4299
02:29:14,879 --> 02:29:18,639
uh lean on

4300
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:20,560
definitely not requiring people to get

4301
02:29:18,639 --> 02:29:23,519
vaccinated but i do think

4302
02:29:20,559 --> 02:29:26,079
getting vaccinated is just um

4303
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:28,319
the wiser choice if looking uh

4304
02:29:26,079 --> 02:29:31,200
all the different trajectories before us

4305
02:29:28,318 --> 02:29:32,318
getting vaccinated is um

4306
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:34,240
seems like

4307
02:29:32,318 --> 02:29:36,559
from the data it seems like the obvious

4308
02:29:34,239 --> 02:29:38,000
choice frankly but i'm also trying to

4309
02:29:36,559 --> 02:29:39,359
keep an open mind

4310
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,799
because some things in the past that

4311
02:29:39,359 --> 02:29:42,000
seemed obvious would turn out to be

4312
02:29:40,799 --> 02:29:44,719
completely wrong

4313
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,239
so i'm trying to keep an open mind here

4314
02:29:44,719 --> 02:29:48,079
so for example

4315
02:29:46,239 --> 02:29:50,478
one of the things

4316
02:29:48,079 --> 02:29:52,398
i'd love to get your thoughts on this is

4317
02:29:50,478 --> 02:29:55,920
uh antiviral

4318
02:29:52,398 --> 02:29:58,318
ideas so ideas outside of the vaccine

4319
02:29:55,920 --> 02:30:00,398
so ivermectin

4320
02:29:58,318 --> 02:30:01,920
something that uh brett weinstein and a

4321
02:30:00,398 --> 02:30:03,519
few others have been talking about

4322
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:05,680
there's been a few studies some of them

4323
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:07,120
have been shown not to be very good

4324
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:08,960
studies

4325
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:11,439
but nevertheless

4326
02:30:08,959 --> 02:30:12,719
there seems to be some promise

4327
02:30:11,439 --> 02:30:14,639
and

4328
02:30:12,719 --> 02:30:16,799
i wanted to talk to brett

4329
02:30:14,639 --> 02:30:18,478
about this particular topic for two

4330
02:30:16,799 --> 02:30:20,559
reasons one i was really bothered by

4331
02:30:18,478 --> 02:30:21,920
censorship of this that's a whole other

4332
02:30:20,559 --> 02:30:24,079
topic

4333
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:26,398
i i just

4334
02:30:24,079 --> 02:30:27,760
i'm bothered by sensors there's a gray

4335
02:30:26,398 --> 02:30:28,719
area of course

4336
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:29,920
um

4337
02:30:28,719 --> 02:30:31,438
but

4338
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:33,200
i it just feels like that should not

4339
02:30:31,439 --> 02:30:35,520
have been censored from youtube like

4340
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:38,000
discussions of vibramectin we can we can

4341
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:41,200
set that aside the the other thing i was

4342
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:43,520
bothered by the lack of open-mindedness

4343
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:44,880
mindedness on exploring things like

4344
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:46,720
avermectin

4345
02:30:44,879 --> 02:30:49,119
in the early days

4346
02:30:46,719 --> 02:30:51,519
especially when at least i thought the

4347
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:54,640
vaccine would take a long time

4348
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:57,439
i mean it's not just ivermectin it's um

4349
02:30:54,639 --> 02:30:59,680
really seriously at a large scale

4350
02:30:57,439 --> 02:31:01,280
rigorously exploring the effectiveness

4351
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:03,520
of masks

4352
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:05,520
and the big one for me is testing

4353
02:31:03,520 --> 02:31:06,960
like the fact that that wasn't explored

4354
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:09,120
aggressively

4355
02:31:06,959 --> 02:31:11,438
to lead to mass manufacturing like may

4356
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:12,960
2020 is as absurd

4357
02:31:11,439 --> 02:31:14,880
anyway

4358
02:31:12,959 --> 02:31:17,199
so i was bothered by these solutions not

4359
02:31:14,879 --> 02:31:19,920
being explored and not by now having

4360
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:21,200
really good ivermectin studies so can i

4361
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:22,960
talk about ivory mechanics yeah i would

4362
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:24,000
love that yeah sure so full disclosure

4363
02:31:22,959 --> 02:31:26,079
my wife

4364
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:27,600
worked on ivermectin at merck for 20

4365
02:31:26,079 --> 02:31:28,478
years

4366
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:29,760
okay

4367
02:31:28,478 --> 02:31:31,358
so

4368
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:32,398
they just want people to know but i

4369
02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:33,040
didn't

4370
02:31:32,398 --> 02:31:34,559
i

4371
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:36,160
don't talk to her all the time about it

4372
02:31:34,559 --> 02:31:38,959
anyway she hasn't been at merc for a

4373
02:31:36,159 --> 02:31:40,959
long time as you know ivermectin is a

4374
02:31:38,959 --> 02:31:43,599
very safe drug used to treat certain

4375
02:31:40,959 --> 02:31:45,358
parasitic infections yes right

4376
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:47,760
and

4377
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:49,680
it is approved it's amazing you can take

4378
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:51,920
one dose a year and be protected against

4379
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:53,439
river blindness in africa and certain

4380
02:31:51,920 --> 02:31:54,559
parts of africa it's remarkably

4381
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:58,079
effective

4382
02:31:54,559 --> 02:31:59,840
and so um it's quite a safe drug at the

4383
02:31:58,079 --> 02:32:01,200
doses that are

4384
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:04,318
that are approved

4385
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:06,000
now uh early last year a study was done

4386
02:32:04,318 --> 02:32:08,799
i believe in australia which showed in

4387
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:10,959
cells in the lab if you infect with

4388
02:32:08,799 --> 02:32:12,639
source cov2 and them and put ivermectin

4389
02:32:10,959 --> 02:32:14,318
and it would inhibit the virus

4390
02:32:12,639 --> 02:32:15,920
production substantially it was quite

4391
02:32:14,318 --> 02:32:18,639
clear right

4392
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:20,559
but the concentrations they were using

4393
02:32:18,639 --> 02:32:22,879
were rather high and

4394
02:32:20,559 --> 02:32:25,920
could not be achieved by

4395
02:32:22,879 --> 02:32:28,239
uh the the approved dosing so you would

4396
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:30,398
need to do a dosing study to make sure

4397
02:32:28,239 --> 02:32:32,079
it's safe and b and the reason is that i

4398
02:32:30,398 --> 02:32:34,318
have a mechanism binds to receptors in

4399
02:32:32,079 --> 02:32:36,639
your brain and it can have high doses a

4400
02:32:34,318 --> 02:32:38,079
lot of some people take high doses

4401
02:32:36,639 --> 02:32:40,318
inappropriately and they have

4402
02:32:38,079 --> 02:32:42,559
neurological consequences so

4403
02:32:40,318 --> 02:32:44,559
if you needed 10 times more ivermectin

4404
02:32:42,559 --> 02:32:45,760
you'd have to make sure it would be safe

4405
02:32:44,559 --> 02:32:47,279
in people so this is a question of

4406
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:49,040
safety too right

4407
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:51,200
so

4408
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:52,880
my i think it has always been the case

4409
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:53,920
that it should have been properly

4410
02:32:52,879 --> 02:32:55,519
studied

4411
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:57,600
but it wasn't there are lots of trials

4412
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:59,439
here and there lots of improperly

4413
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:01,120
controlled trials where someone would

4414
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:02,880
just treat some patients and say hey

4415
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:04,800
they all did fine but have no control

4416
02:33:02,879 --> 02:33:06,398
arm and there were some controlled

4417
02:33:04,799 --> 02:33:08,559
trials but they were very small

4418
02:33:06,398 --> 02:33:11,599
so right now

4419
02:33:08,559 --> 02:33:14,239
a four thousand person trial is unroll

4420
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:16,559
enrolling to test in a randomly

4421
02:33:14,239 --> 02:33:18,159
controlled trial setting

4422
02:33:16,559 --> 02:33:20,398
whether it works or not there's still

4423
02:33:18,159 --> 02:33:22,079
plenty of cases that you can do that so

4424
02:33:20,398 --> 02:33:23,199
you can ask whether in their whether

4425
02:33:22,079 --> 02:33:26,318
there are any side effects i think

4426
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:28,640
that's completely fine and if it says

4427
02:33:26,318 --> 02:33:31,199
it works then we should use it in the

4428
02:33:28,639 --> 02:33:32,959
meantime i always tell people

4429
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:35,840
if you want to use ivermectin you can do

4430
02:33:32,959 --> 02:33:37,119
it off label it's fda approved and if

4431
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:38,639
your physician says i'm going to give

4432
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:42,240
you this off label

4433
02:33:38,639 --> 02:33:44,799
i don't have a any objection but i don't

4434
02:33:42,239 --> 02:33:46,478
know if it's going to work now i a

4435
02:33:44,799 --> 02:33:48,799
friend of ours

4436
02:33:46,478 --> 02:33:50,398
last week in new jersey got

4437
02:33:48,799 --> 02:33:53,279
covered he went to his local hospital

4438
02:33:50,398 --> 02:33:55,358
and their regimen was rem deservier

4439
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:57,600
dexamethasone

4440
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:59,359
ivermectin it's written that's what they

4441
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:02,800
do for every coven patient they just

4442
02:33:59,359 --> 02:34:05,200
give it to them automatically and um wow

4443
02:34:02,799 --> 02:34:07,279
so he's he recovered so

4444
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:10,800
who's to say it was or were not was not

4445
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:13,040
ivermectin right so i don't have any

4446
02:34:10,799 --> 02:34:15,119
strong ideological opposition i just

4447
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:17,520
think it should be tested for what you

4448
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:19,520
want to use it for yeah and that's being

4449
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:22,319
done and i think that's fine is it

4450
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:24,720
strange to you that um

4451
02:34:22,318 --> 02:34:26,318
ivermectin or other things like it

4452
02:34:24,719 --> 02:34:27,599
weren't tested aggressively in the

4453
02:34:26,318 --> 02:34:29,279
beginning like

4454
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:30,800
from a broad

4455
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:32,000
scientific

4456
02:34:30,799 --> 02:34:33,519
community

4457
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,680
aspect

4458
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:36,960
you know i can be a little bit

4459
02:34:34,680 --> 02:34:39,439
conspiratorial and this is what people

4460
02:34:36,959 --> 02:34:41,039
talk about with ivamectin yeah is with

4461
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:42,960
the vaccines there's quite a lot of

4462
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:44,560
money to be made

4463
02:34:42,959 --> 02:34:45,599
a with then there's not as much money to

4464
02:34:44,559 --> 02:34:48,799
be made

4465
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:50,479
is is that too conspiratorial like why

4466
02:34:48,799 --> 02:34:51,438
didn't we try more solutions in the

4467
02:34:50,478 --> 02:34:53,358
beginning

4468
02:34:51,439 --> 02:34:55,200
well um

4469
02:34:53,359 --> 02:34:57,200
well all the money was put into vaccines

4470
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:58,640
right very little was put into antivirus

4471
02:34:57,200 --> 02:35:00,640
because the mission decision was made at

4472
02:34:58,639 --> 02:35:03,358
a very high level probably involving dr

4473
02:35:00,639 --> 02:35:06,159
fauci yeah we're going to put 24 billion

4474
02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:07,920
into vaccines right yeah

4475
02:35:06,159 --> 02:35:09,920
and i think part of the reasoning is

4476
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:11,600
they give you years worth of protection

4477
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:14,000
whereas an antiviral works and you have

4478
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:16,318
to keep dosing and so forth but

4479
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:18,318
vermectin is not trivial and that's i i

4480
02:35:16,318 --> 02:35:20,478
agree it should have been tested early

4481
02:35:18,318 --> 02:35:22,879
on but we had a really bad experience

4482
02:35:20,478 --> 02:35:25,438
with hydroxychloroquine which we can

4483
02:35:22,879 --> 02:35:27,119
talk about too

4484
02:35:25,439 --> 02:35:28,720
ever ivermectin is very hard to

4485
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:29,840
synthesize

4486
02:35:28,719 --> 02:35:32,478
most

4487
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:34,639
drugs you synthesize chemically you

4488
02:35:32,478 --> 02:35:36,000
devise a formulation in a synthesis and

4489
02:35:34,639 --> 02:35:38,559
they do it they scale it up and it's

4490
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:40,879
fine hyvermectin is really hard and so

4491
02:35:38,559 --> 02:35:42,478
what they do instead is they take the

4492
02:35:40,879 --> 02:35:44,318
culture of the

4493
02:35:42,478 --> 02:35:45,760
bacterium that makes it and they grow it

4494
02:35:44,318 --> 02:35:47,119
up and they ferment it and then they

4495
02:35:45,760 --> 02:35:48,960
purify it

4496
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:51,280
and merck owns

4497
02:35:48,959 --> 02:35:54,239
the bacteria

4498
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:57,040
a number of years ago two employees of

4499
02:35:54,239 --> 02:35:58,398
merck stole it and left the company

4500
02:35:57,040 --> 02:36:00,319
and tried to market and they were

4501
02:35:58,398 --> 02:36:02,719
arrested and they got put in jail so

4502
02:36:00,318 --> 02:36:03,680
they protect it very carefully

4503
02:36:02,719 --> 02:36:05,760
so

4504
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:07,680
you can't just make it

4505
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:10,079
if you do it's incredibly expensive and

4506
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:12,639
now india it's very cheap apparently

4507
02:36:10,079 --> 02:36:14,239
they use it uh quite liberally there and

4508
02:36:12,639 --> 02:36:15,920
i don't know how they're they're making

4509
02:36:14,239 --> 02:36:18,318
it maybe they've licensed it from merc

4510
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:20,719
and so forth but

4511
02:36:18,318 --> 02:36:22,719
that's why it hasn't been tested more

4512
02:36:20,719 --> 02:36:24,079
widely i think there's complexities in

4513
02:36:22,719 --> 02:36:26,719
terms of getting a lot of it and

4514
02:36:24,079 --> 02:36:28,318
manufacturing a lot of it yes okay so

4515
02:36:26,719 --> 02:36:31,199
what was the other the hydrogen

4516
02:36:28,318 --> 02:36:33,680
hydroxychloroquine was also shown

4517
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:36,079
uh early on to inhibit virus in cell

4518
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:37,200
culture

4519
02:36:36,079 --> 02:36:39,200
and that's not surprising

4520
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:41,120
hydroxychloroquine of course

4521
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:43,920
is used for malaria

4522
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:43,920
and what it does

4523
02:36:44,318 --> 02:36:48,159
when you're when your cell takes up

4524
02:36:45,760 --> 02:36:50,159
things from the from the plasma membrane

4525
02:36:48,159 --> 02:36:52,000
including viruses it goes through a

4526
02:36:50,159 --> 02:36:53,600
pathway called the endocytic pathway

4527
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,719
which involves a vesicle moving through

4528
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:57,439
the cell and as it moves through the

4529
02:36:54,719 --> 02:36:59,119
cell its ph drops

4530
02:36:57,439 --> 02:37:01,439
and that lets a lot of viruses out

4531
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:03,120
actually and hydroxychloroquine blocks

4532
02:37:01,439 --> 02:37:05,840
that so it blocks infection with a lot

4533
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:05,840
of viruses

4534
02:37:06,239 --> 02:37:10,000
so the problem with those early studies

4535
02:37:08,559 --> 02:37:12,559
that were published

4536
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:14,000
is that they were done in kidney cells

4537
02:37:12,559 --> 02:37:16,159
in culture

4538
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,639
where the only way the virus can get in

4539
02:37:16,159 --> 02:37:20,879
is through the endosome

4540
02:37:18,639 --> 02:37:22,719
and hydroxychloroquine inhibits that and

4541
02:37:20,879 --> 02:37:24,959
that's why it inhibits

4542
02:37:22,719 --> 02:37:26,079
in kidney cells and culture but lung

4543
02:37:24,959 --> 02:37:28,079
cells

4544
02:37:26,079 --> 02:37:30,000
and respiratory cells of humans where

4545
02:37:28,079 --> 02:37:31,920
the virus reproduces

4546
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,559
can get in two different ways it can get

4547
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:37,760
in from this endocytic pathway

4548
02:37:34,559 --> 02:37:40,159
which is inhibited by hydroxychloroquine

4549
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:42,040
or it can get in at the cell surface

4550
02:37:40,159 --> 02:37:43,760
which is not inhibited by

4551
02:37:42,040 --> 02:37:46,399
hydroxychloroquine so when you treat

4552
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:47,760
patients it has no effect in the lung

4553
02:37:46,398 --> 02:37:50,000
because

4554
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:51,439
the virus can just bypass it

4555
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,159
and all the

4556
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:56,318
usage initially were based on

4557
02:37:54,159 --> 02:37:59,039
uh the the studies done in kidney cells

4558
02:37:56,318 --> 02:38:01,199
and culture so that was just wrong

4559
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:03,359
scientifically incorrect yet it drove a

4560
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:06,800
lot of and today many people still think

4561
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:09,280
they should be taking it but so like the

4562
02:38:06,799 --> 02:38:10,799
that not panning out kind of resulted in

4563
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:13,040
a

4564
02:38:10,799 --> 02:38:15,519
loss of optimism about other similar

4565
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:18,000
things well that and many other drugs

4566
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:20,880
repurposed drugs were tried right a lot

4567
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:22,318
of hiv antivirals were tried i think the

4568
02:38:20,879 --> 02:38:24,079
problem with with hydrox i think

4569
02:38:22,318 --> 02:38:26,318
hydroxycork would influence the

4570
02:38:24,079 --> 02:38:29,280
ivermectin narrative right people

4571
02:38:26,318 --> 02:38:30,879
thought that the data was being hidden

4572
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:32,159
about hydroxychloroquine so they said

4573
02:38:30,879 --> 02:38:33,438
well they must be doing the same thing

4574
02:38:32,159 --> 02:38:35,280
with hydromaxim but with

4575
02:38:33,439 --> 02:38:37,680
hydroxychloroquine it just

4576
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:39,920
scientifically could not work

4577
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:42,000
as an antiviral

4578
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:45,760
the other problem that is more broad

4579
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,760
that is important to point out is that

4580
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:48,960
when you

4581
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:50,479
when you have covet and you need an

4582
02:38:48,959 --> 02:38:52,799
anti-virulence usually because you can't

4583
02:38:50,478 --> 02:38:54,000
breathe and you go in the hospital

4584
02:38:52,799 --> 02:38:55,599
because if you're mildly ill you're

4585
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,520
never going to go to your doctor and ask

4586
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:59,439
for an antiviral and the problem is when

4587
02:38:57,520 --> 02:39:02,159
you can't breathe it's no longer a viral

4588
02:38:59,439 --> 02:39:04,159
issue it is now an inflammatory issue

4589
02:39:02,159 --> 02:39:05,280
and no antiviral in the world is going

4590
02:39:04,159 --> 02:39:08,159
to help you

4591
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:09,760
so if that's why rem deserver doesn't

4592
02:39:08,159 --> 02:39:11,520
work very well because it's mainly given

4593
02:39:09,760 --> 02:39:13,359
intravenously to people who go in a

4594
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:16,560
hospital

4595
02:39:13,359 --> 02:39:18,079
if you get ivermectin in the hospital

4596
02:39:16,559 --> 02:39:19,760
it's not going to do anything for for

4597
02:39:18,079 --> 02:39:21,840
reducing virus because by that time you

4598
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:23,200
have very little virus to begin with you

4599
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:25,920
have an inflammatory problem that you

4600
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:28,399
need to treat in other ways so

4601
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:30,799
this is why a lot of the antivirals

4602
02:39:28,398 --> 02:39:33,279
failed because they're used too late

4603
02:39:30,799 --> 02:39:34,879
what you need is a pill you take on that

4604
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:36,720
first positive test when you have a

4605
02:39:34,879 --> 02:39:39,599
scratchy throat

4606
02:39:36,719 --> 02:39:42,318
you get a pcr in 15 minutes i'm positive

4607
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:44,800
take a pill boom that's going to inhibit

4608
02:39:42,318 --> 02:39:46,639
it if you wait till you can't breathe

4609
02:39:44,799 --> 02:39:48,719
and that's why the monoclonals even

4610
02:39:46,639 --> 02:39:51,439
don't work if if you're in hospital that

4611
02:39:48,719 --> 02:39:54,079
well because it's too late and that the

4612
02:39:51,439 --> 02:39:56,159
approach now is if you're in a high risk

4613
02:39:54,079 --> 02:39:59,280
group if you're over 65

4614
02:39:56,159 --> 02:40:01,840
if you are obese or have diabetes or any

4615
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:04,840
other comorbidities your first sign of a

4616
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:07,359
scratchy throat positive you get

4617
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:09,120
monoclonals then they might help you but

4618
02:40:07,359 --> 02:40:11,280
if you wait till you go into hospital

4619
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:14,399
it's too late because the viral curve

4620
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:16,159
drops after that first symptom

4621
02:40:14,398 --> 02:40:19,519
within three days you're you're no

4622
02:40:16,159 --> 02:40:21,600
longer shedding enough virus to transmit

4623
02:40:19,520 --> 02:40:23,120
drops really quickly so that's the

4624
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:24,559
reason a lot of these antivirals failed

4625
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:25,840
because they were tested in hospitalized

4626
02:40:24,559 --> 02:40:28,159
patients

4627
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:30,000
and we have nothing but rem deserve here

4628
02:40:28,159 --> 02:40:32,000
now unfortunately so it was the wrong

4629
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,879
approach we should have

4630
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,478
been

4631
02:40:32,879 --> 02:40:36,719
giving it to people who just tested

4632
02:40:34,478 --> 02:40:38,719
positive from the start or just even for

4633
02:40:36,719 --> 02:40:40,799
preventative and see you could do that

4634
02:40:38,719 --> 02:40:42,000
too yeah but i have to say the other

4635
02:40:40,799 --> 02:40:44,719
issue is

4636
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:48,398
this monument is a drug in phase three

4637
02:40:44,719 --> 02:40:51,039
now it's an oral antiviral it looks good

4638
02:40:48,398 --> 02:40:52,719
if we go ahead with just one

4639
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:54,399
we're going to get resistance within a

4640
02:40:52,719 --> 02:40:56,719
few months and it will be useless we

4641
02:40:54,398 --> 02:40:59,039
need to have at least two or three drugs

4642
02:40:56,719 --> 02:41:00,959
that we can give in combinations and we

4643
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:03,680
know that because that's what took care

4644
02:41:00,959 --> 02:41:06,398
of hiv that's what took care of hcv

4645
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:09,120
hepatitis c virus it really reduces the

4646
02:41:06,398 --> 02:41:10,959
emergence of resistance

4647
02:41:09,120 --> 02:41:14,399
joe rogan got quite a bit of heat

4648
02:41:10,959 --> 02:41:16,478
recently about mentioning a paper

4649
02:41:14,398 --> 02:41:18,478
and a broader idea

4650
02:41:16,478 --> 02:41:21,358
which i didn't i don't think is that

4651
02:41:18,478 --> 02:41:22,799
controversial but maybe we can expand on

4652
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:24,880
it

4653
02:41:22,799 --> 02:41:26,799
and the idea is that

4654
02:41:24,879 --> 02:41:29,438
vaccines

4655
02:41:26,799 --> 02:41:32,318
uh create selective pressure

4656
02:41:29,439 --> 02:41:35,200
for a virus to mutate

4657
02:41:32,318 --> 02:41:37,278
and for variance to form

4658
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:38,800
what um

4659
02:41:37,279 --> 02:41:40,319
first of all from a biological

4660
02:41:38,799 --> 02:41:42,959
perspective

4661
02:41:40,318 --> 02:41:44,318
can you explain this process and

4662
02:41:42,959 --> 02:41:46,079
from a

4663
02:41:44,318 --> 02:41:48,159
societal perspective what are we

4664
02:41:46,079 --> 02:41:50,318
supposed to do about that so let's get

4665
02:41:48,159 --> 02:41:52,879
the terminology right so as we talked

4666
02:41:50,318 --> 02:41:56,559
about earlier viruses are always

4667
02:41:52,879 --> 02:41:58,879
mutating so no vaccine or no drug makes

4668
02:41:56,559 --> 02:42:00,639
a virus mutate right that's the wrong

4669
02:41:58,879 --> 02:42:02,478
perspective which you look at

4670
02:42:00,639 --> 02:42:04,959
what the what the

4671
02:42:02,478 --> 02:42:07,199
immune response is is putting pressure

4672
02:42:04,959 --> 02:42:08,639
selection pressure on the virus and if

4673
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:10,800
there's a

4674
02:42:08,639 --> 02:42:12,799
one particle with the right

4675
02:42:10,799 --> 02:42:15,199
mutation that can escape the antibody

4676
02:42:12,799 --> 02:42:17,039
that will emerge right

4677
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:20,159
so that's what happens with influenza

4678
02:42:17,040 --> 02:42:21,439
virus right we vaccinate every year

4679
02:42:20,159 --> 02:42:23,039
and there are not a lot of people that

4680
02:42:21,439 --> 02:42:24,800
get infected so they get natural

4681
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:28,319
immunity

4682
02:42:24,799 --> 02:42:30,959
and then the virus is incredibly

4683
02:42:28,318 --> 02:42:32,559
varied it mutates like crazy and there's

4684
02:42:30,959 --> 02:42:34,559
in some person somewhere there's one

4685
02:42:32,559 --> 02:42:36,478
variant that escapes the antibody which

4686
02:42:34,559 --> 02:42:38,799
has been induced either by infection or

4687
02:42:36,478 --> 02:42:40,879
vaccination it can be both

4688
02:42:38,799 --> 02:42:42,239
and that drives the emergence of the new

4689
02:42:40,879 --> 02:42:43,920
variant so the next year we need to

4690
02:42:42,239 --> 02:42:44,879
change the vaccine

4691
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:46,398
so

4692
02:42:44,879 --> 02:42:49,039
i would say

4693
02:42:46,398 --> 02:42:50,000
both natural infection and vaccination

4694
02:42:49,040 --> 02:42:52,399
sure

4695
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:54,398
select for variance absolutely there's

4696
02:42:52,398 --> 02:42:56,159
no question because they're inducing

4697
02:42:54,398 --> 02:42:58,398
immunity now

4698
02:42:56,159 --> 02:43:00,879
what happened last year was

4699
02:42:58,398 --> 02:43:03,039
at the beginning of 2020 very few people

4700
02:43:00,879 --> 02:43:05,839
in the world were immune as the virus

4701
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:07,920
first started spreading

4702
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:09,920
but you can see in the sequences of

4703
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:12,478
those isolates from the beginning of

4704
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:14,559
2020 you can see

4705
02:43:12,478 --> 02:43:16,879
all of the changes that are now present

4706
02:43:14,559 --> 02:43:18,559
in the variants of concern at very very

4707
02:43:16,879 --> 02:43:21,119
low frequencies they were already there

4708
02:43:18,559 --> 02:43:24,079
but there was no selection for them to

4709
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:26,640
emerge until november when we now had

4710
02:43:24,079 --> 02:43:28,559
many millions of people who had

4711
02:43:26,639 --> 02:43:31,358
mostly been infected but also some

4712
02:43:28,559 --> 02:43:34,239
vaccinated then we saw the alpha variant

4713
02:43:31,359 --> 02:43:37,200
emerge in england probably because of

4714
02:43:34,239 --> 02:43:38,959
immune selection now the the virus

4715
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:40,319
that had the change that evaded the

4716
02:43:38,959 --> 02:43:41,839
antibody

4717
02:43:40,318 --> 02:43:43,359
had an advantage

4718
02:43:41,840 --> 02:43:44,799
and that virus drove through the

4719
02:43:43,359 --> 02:43:46,079
population so that's what we're seeing

4720
02:43:44,799 --> 02:43:48,719
we're seeing all these variants are

4721
02:43:46,079 --> 02:43:51,920
simply antigenic selection so so the the

4722
02:43:48,719 --> 02:43:55,358
variance the mutations that are at the

4723
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:56,799
core of these quantum core variants

4724
02:43:55,359 --> 02:43:58,318
they were always there all along the

4725
02:43:56,799 --> 02:44:00,639
vaccine

4726
02:43:58,318 --> 02:44:02,559
or the infections did not create them no

4727
02:44:00,639 --> 02:44:05,760
infections don't create they're selected

4728
02:44:02,559 --> 02:44:08,159
it's like the vaccine wipe out

4729
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:08,960
a lot of the variants

4730
02:44:08,159 --> 02:44:09,840
right

4731
02:44:08,959 --> 02:44:12,398
and then

4732
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:14,478
um by being immune by making your body

4733
02:44:12,398 --> 02:44:17,680
immune to them and so but some of them

4734
02:44:14,478 --> 02:44:19,438
survive yeah exactly and there's another

4735
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:23,760
tree that's built

4736
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:26,159
and it's unclear what that tree leads to

4737
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:28,398
i mean it could make things much worse

4738
02:44:26,159 --> 02:44:30,239
or much better don't we don't know well

4739
02:44:28,398 --> 02:44:32,398
with flu we see year after year the

4740
02:44:30,239 --> 02:44:33,520
virus changes we change the vaccine we

4741
02:44:32,398 --> 02:44:35,439
deal with it

4742
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:37,520
we change it again there's an unending

4743
02:44:35,439 --> 02:44:38,559
but see that's a very different story if

4744
02:44:37,520 --> 02:44:41,920
do you think

4745
02:44:38,559 --> 02:44:42,879
do you think covid will be

4746
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:44,639
um

4747
02:44:42,879 --> 02:44:46,879
with some likelihood

4748
02:44:44,639 --> 02:44:50,959
uh like the flu whereas basically

4749
02:44:46,879 --> 02:44:52,639
variants will never be able to um

4750
02:44:50,959 --> 02:44:54,719
eradicate it

4751
02:44:52,639 --> 02:44:56,000
it will never eradicate it

4752
02:44:54,719 --> 02:44:57,278
in any case

4753
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,398
ever

4754
02:44:57,279 --> 02:45:00,960
well

4755
02:44:58,398 --> 02:45:03,039
come up with a vaccine that uh

4756
02:45:00,959 --> 02:45:05,599
makes you immune to enough variance to

4757
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:06,399
where there's not enough evolutionary

4758
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:08,399
like

4759
02:45:06,398 --> 02:45:10,879
room well if you cut down the number of

4760
02:45:08,398 --> 02:45:13,439
infections then you reduce the diversity

4761
02:45:10,879 --> 02:45:16,239
sure yes right the problem is if let's

4762
02:45:13,439 --> 02:45:18,239
say you're a cynic and you say well

4763
02:45:16,239 --> 02:45:20,239
vaccination is just selecting for

4764
02:45:18,239 --> 02:45:21,520
variance so let's stop it but then

4765
02:45:20,239 --> 02:45:23,359
you're going to have infection and

4766
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:25,359
that's going to select for variance and

4767
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:26,840
they're the more you're more likely to

4768
02:45:25,359 --> 02:45:29,200
get very sick because we know the

4769
02:45:26,840 --> 02:45:30,960
vaccines are really good at preventing

4770
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:33,200
you from dying so

4771
02:45:30,959 --> 02:45:35,919
that's why it still makes sense to use

4772
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:38,319
vaccines because they prevent you from

4773
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:40,159
dying yeah that's the bottom line but

4774
02:45:38,318 --> 02:45:42,398
can we ever make

4775
02:45:40,159 --> 02:45:44,559
a vaccine that deals

4776
02:45:42,398 --> 02:45:46,799
with all variants

4777
02:45:44,559 --> 02:45:48,799
absolutely and the reason i say that is

4778
02:45:46,799 --> 02:45:51,438
because

4779
02:45:48,799 --> 02:45:53,438
people who get

4780
02:45:51,439 --> 02:45:56,800
naturally infected with psoriasis they

4781
02:45:53,439 --> 02:45:59,520
develop covid they recover

4782
02:45:56,799 --> 02:46:01,679
if you give them one vaccine dose

4783
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:02,880
they make an immune response that

4784
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:04,720
handles

4785
02:46:02,879 --> 02:46:05,679
all the variants that are around right

4786
02:46:04,719 --> 02:46:07,599
now

4787
02:46:05,680 --> 02:46:10,559
all of them much better than people

4788
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:11,840
who've gotten two doses of vaccine for

4789
02:46:10,559 --> 02:46:13,680
some reason

4790
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:15,359
their immune response is suddenly

4791
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:16,800
broadened after the infection

4792
02:46:15,359 --> 02:46:18,399
vaccination

4793
02:46:16,799 --> 02:46:20,079
and they can handle all the variants

4794
02:46:18,398 --> 02:46:21,439
that we know of so far so that tells me

4795
02:46:20,079 --> 02:46:23,760
we can

4796
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:26,079
devise a strategy to do the same thing

4797
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:27,840
with a vaccine that makes a really broad

4798
02:46:26,079 --> 02:46:30,000
vaccine that'll handle all the variables

4799
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:31,680
well you actually uh on the virology

4800
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:33,439
blog i don't know if you're the author

4801
02:46:31,680 --> 02:46:35,920
of that but i am

4802
02:46:33,439 --> 02:46:37,680
yes oh the blog yes but there's a

4803
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:39,439
particular post that's talking about

4804
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:41,439
reporting in a paper

4805
02:46:39,439 --> 02:46:44,479
the mix-and-match strategy oh yes that's

4806
02:46:41,439 --> 02:46:46,720
one of my co-writers trudy ray yeah yeah

4807
02:46:44,478 --> 02:46:48,239
that's a it's an interesting idea that

4808
02:46:46,719 --> 02:46:50,159
there's some

4809
02:46:48,239 --> 02:46:52,398
early evidence now that

4810
02:46:50,159 --> 02:46:54,959
mixing and matching vaccines

4811
02:46:52,398 --> 02:46:56,478
like one shot of pfizer and one of like

4812
02:46:54,959 --> 02:46:58,959
modern or something

4813
02:46:56,478 --> 02:47:00,559
that creates a much better

4814
02:46:58,959 --> 02:47:03,039
uh immunity

4815
02:47:00,559 --> 02:47:05,600
than uh does two shots of laser i think

4816
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:07,120
that's worth exploring absolutely

4817
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:08,960
and this is relevant what we're doing

4818
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:10,479
with influenza

4819
02:47:08,959 --> 02:47:12,318
you know instead of having to vaccinate

4820
02:47:10,478 --> 02:47:14,159
people every year why can't we devise a

4821
02:47:12,318 --> 02:47:16,159
vaccine which you'd get once in your

4822
02:47:14,159 --> 02:47:17,359
lifetime or maybe once every 10 years

4823
02:47:16,159 --> 02:47:18,318
okay

4824
02:47:17,359 --> 02:47:20,559
so

4825
02:47:18,318 --> 02:47:21,920
the the spike of influenza

4826
02:47:20,559 --> 02:47:24,239
it's a long

4827
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:26,239
protein kind of like the spike of saurus

4828
02:47:24,239 --> 02:47:28,478
cov2 it's stuck in the virus membrane

4829
02:47:26,239 --> 02:47:30,719
and the very tip

4830
02:47:28,478 --> 02:47:32,239
that's the part that changes

4831
02:47:30,719 --> 02:47:33,599
every year that's where the antibodies

4832
02:47:32,239 --> 02:47:35,359
bind

4833
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:37,439
but the stem

4834
02:47:35,359 --> 02:47:39,760
doesn't change

4835
02:47:37,439 --> 02:47:41,760
and if you make antibodies to the stem

4836
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:42,800
they can also prevent infection it's

4837
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:44,719
just that

4838
02:47:42,799 --> 02:47:46,559
when people are infected or with the

4839
02:47:44,719 --> 02:47:48,719
current vaccines they'll make many

4840
02:47:46,559 --> 02:47:50,559
antibodies to that stem part

4841
02:47:48,719 --> 02:47:52,559
but we're trying to figure out how to

4842
02:47:50,559 --> 02:47:54,239
make those and we think they would be

4843
02:47:52,559 --> 02:47:57,760
broadly protective and you'd never be

4844
02:47:54,239 --> 02:48:00,478
able to or more rarely be able to

4845
02:47:57,760 --> 02:48:02,398
have a variant emerge that that escaped

4846
02:48:00,478 --> 02:48:06,478
it and i think we can do the same thing

4847
02:48:02,398 --> 02:48:08,318
with with coronavirus too for sure

4848
02:48:06,478 --> 02:48:09,679
can i ask you about testing

4849
02:48:08,318 --> 02:48:11,680
sure

4850
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:15,359
sure so you mentioned pcr what kind of

4851
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:18,000
tests are there the antigen test

4852
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:20,159
uh what what are your thoughts on each

4853
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:22,478
maybe this is a good place to uh to also

4854
02:48:20,159 --> 02:48:24,398
mention like viral load

4855
02:48:22,478 --> 02:48:26,719
and um

4856
02:48:24,398 --> 02:48:29,119
the history of the virus as it passes

4857
02:48:26,719 --> 02:48:31,358
through your body in terms of the

4858
02:48:29,120 --> 02:48:33,279
okay what's being tested for and all

4859
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:35,520
those kinds of things

4860
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:37,040
so the the first tests that were

4861
02:48:35,520 --> 02:48:38,319
developed

4862
02:48:37,040 --> 02:48:40,319
were

4863
02:48:38,318 --> 02:48:42,478
pcr polymerase chain reaction they're

4864
02:48:40,318 --> 02:48:43,600
basically nucleic acid amplification

4865
02:48:42,478 --> 02:48:45,039
tests

4866
02:48:43,600 --> 02:48:47,279
and they were very first ones they stuck

4867
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:48,560
the swab all the way up into your brain

4868
02:48:47,279 --> 02:48:50,159
almost

4869
02:48:48,559 --> 02:48:53,278
you know i had that done a couple of

4870
02:48:50,159 --> 02:48:56,079
weeks ago oh my gosh it's really nasty

4871
02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:57,760
but now they do an anterior nary swab

4872
02:48:56,079 --> 02:48:59,520
they get a little

4873
02:48:57,760 --> 02:49:01,359
they get a bunch of cells and some mucus

4874
02:48:59,520 --> 02:49:04,159
which has virus and

4875
02:49:01,359 --> 02:49:06,720
parts of virus stick it in a test tube

4876
02:49:04,159 --> 02:49:08,879
and then they run a reaction which by

4877
02:49:06,719 --> 02:49:11,840
the way involves reverse transcriptase

4878
02:49:08,879 --> 02:49:14,159
because it converts the viral rna to dna

4879
02:49:11,840 --> 02:49:15,719
and then you amplify it

4880
02:49:14,159 --> 02:49:18,959
and you can

4881
02:49:15,719 --> 02:49:21,039
specify what part of the viral rna you

4882
02:49:18,959 --> 02:49:22,398
want to amplify and then a machine will

4883
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:25,200
detect it

4884
02:49:22,398 --> 02:49:27,760
and it can be done in 15 minutes

4885
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:29,760
you're detecting pieces of rna not

4886
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:32,318
infectious virus so we're measuring

4887
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:34,239
viral rna loads right

4888
02:49:32,318 --> 02:49:36,398
and a common

4889
02:49:34,239 --> 02:49:37,920
mistake that many people who should know

4890
02:49:36,398 --> 02:49:40,559
better you know physicians and

4891
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:43,520
scientists of all kinds they think that

4892
02:49:40,559 --> 02:49:44,879
indicates how much virus you have

4893
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:47,439
it doesn't

4894
02:49:44,879 --> 02:49:49,358
it it's a diagnostic of whether you have

4895
02:49:47,439 --> 02:49:52,318
bits of rna in you and it

4896
02:49:49,359 --> 02:49:54,640
probably means you're infected but

4897
02:49:52,318 --> 02:49:56,719
you can't use it to shed light on what's

4898
02:49:54,639 --> 02:49:58,879
going on and i'll tell you why in a bit

4899
02:49:56,719 --> 02:50:01,119
but first we have to explain some other

4900
02:49:58,879 --> 02:50:01,119
things

4901
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:05,840
so until you get to about a million

4902
02:50:04,318 --> 02:50:07,439
copies

4903
02:50:05,840 --> 02:50:10,799
of rna so you can measure the copy

4904
02:50:07,439 --> 02:50:13,279
number in this test this pcr test

4905
02:50:10,799 --> 02:50:14,959
it's it's a number called ct or cycle

4906
02:50:13,279 --> 02:50:16,720
threshold the test the way the machine

4907
02:50:14,959 --> 02:50:18,398
works it goes through cycles in every

4908
02:50:16,719 --> 02:50:19,920
cycle it amplifies

4909
02:50:18,398 --> 02:50:20,959
what you put in

4910
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:23,279
and

4911
02:50:20,959 --> 02:50:25,119
the more cycles you need to see

4912
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:26,560
something that means there's not a lot

4913
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:28,560
of rna there

4914
02:50:26,559 --> 02:50:30,959
so if you see a if you do a test and you

4915
02:50:28,559 --> 02:50:33,600
have a cycle threshold of 35

4916
02:50:30,959 --> 02:50:35,759
you have very little rna in you

4917
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:37,920
contrary if you have a cycle threshold

4918
02:50:35,760 --> 02:50:40,559
of 10 you have a ton of rna it only took

4919
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:42,719
10 cycles to detect it

4920
02:50:40,559 --> 02:50:45,278
and you can extrapolate from that number

4921
02:50:42,719 --> 02:50:46,799
the number of copies you have per sample

4922
02:50:45,279 --> 02:50:49,279
say per swap and if you don't have a

4923
02:50:46,799 --> 02:50:51,199
million you're not infectious you're not

4924
02:50:49,279 --> 02:50:54,000
going to infect anyone so in the early

4925
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:55,840
days no matter what ct whatever what pcr

4926
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:57,840
result you had they would quarantine you

4927
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:58,880
and that was wrong because you're not

4928
02:50:57,840 --> 02:51:00,719
shedding you don't need to be

4929
02:50:58,879 --> 02:51:02,639
quarantined but but

4930
02:51:00,719 --> 02:51:04,559
wasn't thought through properly right

4931
02:51:02,639 --> 02:51:06,318
that's where you had like 14 days or

4932
02:51:04,559 --> 02:51:08,079
something like that

4933
02:51:06,318 --> 02:51:09,359
which is now we know is too long because

4934
02:51:08,079 --> 02:51:11,680
you don't shed

4935
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:14,000
for that long in a normal infection now

4936
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:16,159
it's 10 days should be fine

4937
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:18,318
so what happens is you get infected you

4938
02:51:16,159 --> 02:51:20,398
don't know it of course the virus starts

4939
02:51:18,318 --> 02:51:21,840
to grow very quickly and within four or

4940
02:51:20,398 --> 02:51:23,519
five days

4941
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:24,239
you reach a peak

4942
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:26,560
of

4943
02:51:24,239 --> 02:51:28,318
shedding you're making a lot of rna

4944
02:51:26,559 --> 02:51:30,318
and you may be asymptomatic you're

4945
02:51:28,318 --> 02:51:32,079
shedding it can affect others and then

4946
02:51:30,318 --> 02:51:33,840
you may or may not have your symptom

4947
02:51:32,079 --> 02:51:35,520
onset

4948
02:51:33,840 --> 02:51:37,600
so you shed for a couple of days before

4949
02:51:35,520 --> 02:51:38,479
symptoms and then within three days four

4950
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:40,159
days

4951
02:51:38,478 --> 02:51:42,000
the viral rna crashes and you're no

4952
02:51:40,159 --> 02:51:43,840
longer shedding you're no longer

4953
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:45,359
transmitting so that's the one kind of

4954
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:47,520
test we have it can tell you if you're

4955
02:51:45,359 --> 02:51:48,960
infected at the moment

4956
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:50,720
but it won't tell you

4957
02:51:48,959 --> 02:51:52,559
if you're going to be infected tomorrow

4958
02:51:50,719 --> 02:51:54,398
right because if you're negative today

4959
02:51:52,559 --> 02:51:56,159
you could be positive tomorrow you just

4960
02:51:54,398 --> 02:51:58,159
might be on in a different part of the

4961
02:51:56,159 --> 02:51:59,600
incubation period right

4962
02:51:58,159 --> 02:52:03,119
so that's one test

4963
02:51:59,600 --> 02:52:05,120
been used the most you can now

4964
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:07,120
get 15-minute versions of them in a

4965
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:08,720
walk-in or whatever fine then there are

4966
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:11,840
antigen tests which look for the

4967
02:52:08,719 --> 02:52:13,599
proteins that the virus is making so as

4968
02:52:11,840 --> 02:52:16,000
it's reproducing in your nose it's not

4969
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:17,120
only making genomes it's making proteins

4970
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:19,359
and so these you can buy in the

4971
02:52:17,120 --> 02:52:21,840
drugstore and

4972
02:52:19,359 --> 02:52:23,840
these would have been great if they had

4973
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:26,000
you know michael minna last year had the

4974
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:27,760
idea that if we could make a little

4975
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:29,359
stick a little piece of paper that you

4976
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:30,719
would suck on and it would tell you if

4977
02:52:29,359 --> 02:52:32,479
you're infected or not if this could

4978
02:52:30,719 --> 02:52:34,879
cost less than a buck

4979
02:52:32,478 --> 02:52:36,959
everybody could test which they can cost

4980
02:52:34,879 --> 02:52:38,719
less than a buck by the way

4981
02:52:36,959 --> 02:52:39,839
yeah but they were never made right

4982
02:52:38,719 --> 02:52:40,719
right

4983
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:42,960
uh

4984
02:52:40,719 --> 02:52:45,358
they're never mass manufactured so his

4985
02:52:42,959 --> 02:52:47,278
idea is to do like daily tests so yeah

4986
02:52:45,359 --> 02:52:49,760
daily and then a kid's going to school

4987
02:52:47,279 --> 02:52:51,040
he's positive or she's positive

4988
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:52,639
well if it's cheap enough you just take

4989
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:54,640
another test because they have a certain

4990
02:52:52,639 --> 02:52:56,239
error frequency if it's positive twice

4991
02:52:54,639 --> 02:52:57,119
you stay home and the next day you try

4992
02:52:56,239 --> 02:52:58,799
again

4993
02:52:57,120 --> 02:53:01,040
and this i think this would have

4994
02:52:58,799 --> 02:53:03,119
revolutionized because the pcr tests are

4995
02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:05,279
more expensive at the time and they take

4996
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:06,240
longer to do and so forth

4997
02:53:05,279 --> 02:53:07,760
but

4998
02:53:06,239 --> 02:53:10,079
it never happened but now we do have

4999
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:12,318
twenty dollar binax now and others that

5000
02:53:10,079 --> 02:53:14,478
you can buy and people buy them and see

5001
02:53:12,318 --> 02:53:16,000
but that can still happen right and this

5002
02:53:14,478 --> 02:53:16,959
is a very frustrating thing to me

5003
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:19,439
because

5004
02:53:16,959 --> 02:53:21,839
i'm worried about variance but i'm also

5005
02:53:19,439 --> 02:53:23,520
worried about future much more deadly

5006
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:24,960
pandemics

5007
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:27,279
like

5008
02:53:24,959 --> 02:53:28,318
i know we kind of said yes covey lots of

5009
02:53:27,279 --> 02:53:30,479
deaths

5010
02:53:28,318 --> 02:53:33,600
but like it could be a lot worse

5011
02:53:30,478 --> 02:53:35,679
too and like so i'm thinking

5012
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:36,960
what is going to be the right response

5013
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:39,040
for the future

5014
02:53:36,959 --> 02:53:41,039
pandemic of its kind and what's the

5015
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:42,560
right response for continued number of

5016
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:44,479
variants and some of the variants might

5017
02:53:42,559 --> 02:53:47,600
be deadlier

5018
02:53:44,478 --> 02:53:48,799
or more transmissible well we we can the

5019
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:50,079
antigen

5020
02:53:48,799 --> 02:53:51,119
tests

5021
02:53:50,079 --> 02:53:52,639
will pick up

5022
02:53:51,120 --> 02:53:55,279
the variance that's not a question the

5023
02:53:52,639 --> 02:53:58,159
pcr may be influenced by changes but you

5024
02:53:55,279 --> 02:53:59,840
can quickly adapt the primers that you

5025
02:53:58,159 --> 02:54:02,079
use that's what i mean like to me all

5026
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:03,359
these discussions about vaccines and so

5027
02:54:02,079 --> 02:54:05,200
on

5028
02:54:03,359 --> 02:54:08,000
vaccines we got very lucky that they

5029
02:54:05,200 --> 02:54:10,159
took so little time right

5030
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:11,680
and and you have to be aware no matter

5031
02:54:10,159 --> 02:54:13,920
what that there's hesitancy with the

5032
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:16,000
vaccines in this country before i mean

5033
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:18,159
yeah if that's a reality you can't just

5034
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:20,398
be like magically saying that

5035
02:54:18,159 --> 02:54:22,159
right you're going to overcome that

5036
02:54:20,398 --> 02:54:23,920
and i don't think there's any hesitancy

5037
02:54:22,159 --> 02:54:26,559
and cheap tests at home

5038
02:54:23,920 --> 02:54:28,159
i agree i think if someone so the

5039
02:54:26,559 --> 02:54:29,760
question is if someone tested positive

5040
02:54:28,159 --> 02:54:31,439
would they stay home that's the question

5041
02:54:29,760 --> 02:54:33,600
what if their what if their job depends

5042
02:54:31,439 --> 02:54:36,318
on them going in i i mean that's well

5043
02:54:33,600 --> 02:54:38,399
you have to look at sort of aggregate

5044
02:54:36,318 --> 02:54:39,840
yeah how many people would decide and i

5045
02:54:38,398 --> 02:54:41,199
think

5046
02:54:39,840 --> 02:54:43,120
um

5047
02:54:41,200 --> 02:54:45,359
again a lot of that is in leadership but

5048
02:54:43,120 --> 02:54:47,040
i think a lot of them mo i would say

5049
02:54:45,359 --> 02:54:49,600
most people stay home

5050
02:54:47,040 --> 02:54:51,520
i think that mina had the idea and it

5051
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:53,920
would have changed the whole

5052
02:54:51,520 --> 02:54:56,239
situation for sure if it could have been

5053
02:54:53,920 --> 02:54:58,559
made when we talked to him last spring i

5054
02:54:56,239 --> 02:55:00,318
think or summer

5055
02:54:58,559 --> 02:55:01,840
we would have gotten around a lot of the

5056
02:55:00,318 --> 02:55:03,119
issues that we're in today because i

5057
02:55:01,840 --> 02:55:04,799
think people would have stayed home and

5058
02:55:03,120 --> 02:55:08,000
not transmitted and i think it's still

5059
02:55:04,799 --> 02:55:10,398
valuable to this day in the fall if we

5060
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:12,719
don't have vaccine uptake we could just

5061
02:55:10,398 --> 02:55:14,159
test kids every day yeah and get them

5062
02:55:12,719 --> 02:55:15,278
and keep them home when they're infected

5063
02:55:14,159 --> 02:55:17,520
it cuts

5064
02:55:15,279 --> 02:55:19,840
it's and we don't have it

5065
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:21,600
but i think and i'm not privy to what

5066
02:55:19,840 --> 02:55:23,439
was going on but

5067
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:26,000
i don't think a lot of emphasis was put

5068
02:55:23,439 --> 02:55:27,760
on testing early on you know the cdc

5069
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:29,439
developed the first one it was flawed

5070
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:31,279
they had to recall the kits i mean

5071
02:55:29,439 --> 02:55:33,600
there's a fiasco they should have had

5072
02:55:31,279 --> 02:55:34,640
100 companies making the tests initially

5073
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:36,239
right

5074
02:55:34,639 --> 02:55:38,318
so for the future

5075
02:55:36,239 --> 02:55:40,799
i think what we have learned is we need

5076
02:55:38,318 --> 02:55:42,159
to have a rapid antigen test right off

5077
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:43,519
the bat

5078
02:55:42,159 --> 02:55:45,359
that's doable

5079
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:47,600
you can't do it in a day like you can

5080
02:55:45,359 --> 02:55:49,760
for pcr because

5081
02:55:47,600 --> 02:55:51,439
you need to make antibodies to the

5082
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:53,680
protein that you're looking for and you

5083
02:55:51,439 --> 02:55:55,439
need to do those and animals but you can

5084
02:55:53,680 --> 02:55:57,600
do it in weeks

5085
02:55:55,439 --> 02:55:59,359
and we should be ready for that

5086
02:55:57,600 --> 02:56:00,880
yeah because

5087
02:55:59,359 --> 02:56:03,359
i mean to me that's obvious that's

5088
02:56:00,879 --> 02:56:06,239
obviously the best solution uh second to

5089
02:56:03,359 --> 02:56:08,399
that if we understood how well masks

5090
02:56:06,239 --> 02:56:09,439
work

5091
02:56:08,398 --> 02:56:11,358
like

5092
02:56:09,439 --> 02:56:14,000
maybe let me ask you this question let's

5093
02:56:11,359 --> 02:56:16,559
put masks aside

5094
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:18,000
how will do we understand how covet is

5095
02:56:16,559 --> 02:56:20,079
transmitted

5096
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:21,600
there's there's droplets of different

5097
02:56:20,079 --> 02:56:26,398
sizes

5098
02:56:21,600 --> 02:56:28,159
uh aerosols tiny tiny droplets

5099
02:56:26,398 --> 02:56:30,478
it seems like that's a very difficult

5100
02:56:28,159 --> 02:56:32,559
thing to understand thoroughly

5101
02:56:30,478 --> 02:56:34,000
uh so it seems like it's transmitted

5102
02:56:32,559 --> 02:56:36,478
both ways

5103
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:39,359
it's unclear how exactly

5104
02:56:36,478 --> 02:56:40,879
so how how how much do we understand

5105
02:56:39,359 --> 02:56:43,359
and why is it so difficult to understand

5106
02:56:40,879 --> 02:56:44,959
hopefully i think it's clear that it's

5107
02:56:43,359 --> 02:56:47,439
transmitted through the air

5108
02:56:44,959 --> 02:56:49,358
mostly it's not touching we thought

5109
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:50,800
initially it would be a lot of touch but

5110
02:56:49,359 --> 02:56:52,318
very little of that

5111
02:56:50,799 --> 02:56:54,719
it's through the air

5112
02:56:52,318 --> 02:56:56,639
and when you talk mainly when you talk

5113
02:56:54,719 --> 02:56:58,719
you you expel a lot of

5114
02:56:56,639 --> 02:57:01,439
droplets right even the plosives that

5115
02:56:58,719 --> 02:57:03,199
your foam thing here is are meant to

5116
02:57:01,439 --> 02:57:06,000
pee right that you send out little

5117
02:57:03,200 --> 02:57:08,720
sprays and those have viruses in them

5118
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:10,879
and the big drops fall to the ground

5119
02:57:08,719 --> 02:57:13,358
and the little ones can go 100 feet or

5120
02:57:10,879 --> 02:57:16,318
more right but the little ones also have

5121
02:57:13,359 --> 02:57:19,120
less virus in them

5122
02:57:16,318 --> 02:57:20,719
so i'm not sure well we certainly do not

5123
02:57:19,120 --> 02:57:23,120
know how much virus you need to be

5124
02:57:20,719 --> 02:57:26,000
infected right but it's probably at

5125
02:57:23,120 --> 02:57:26,800
least several thousand particles if not

5126
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,398
more

5127
02:57:26,799 --> 02:57:30,799
and it could be that

5128
02:57:28,398 --> 02:57:32,879
for most people

5129
02:57:30,799 --> 02:57:35,199
the tiny droplets don't have enough

5130
02:57:32,879 --> 02:57:37,920
virus to infect someone else but there's

5131
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:41,040
one observation about this virus it's

5132
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:44,159
really interesting and that is that

5133
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:46,960
80 of transmissions are done by 20 of

5134
02:57:44,159 --> 02:57:50,318
the people of the infected people

5135
02:57:46,959 --> 02:57:51,759
not every infected person transmits

5136
02:57:50,318 --> 02:57:54,559
that's been borne out in multiple

5137
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:56,318
studies and in fact there's a study at

5138
02:57:54,559 --> 02:57:57,359
university of colorado

5139
02:57:56,318 --> 02:57:59,760
where they

5140
02:57:57,359 --> 02:58:01,760
quantified the viral rna loads and all

5141
02:57:59,760 --> 02:58:04,318
the swabs that had been done of students

5142
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:06,239
for like a six month period

5143
02:58:04,318 --> 02:58:08,959
and

5144
02:58:06,239 --> 02:58:10,478
most of the infectious fire most of the

5145
02:58:08,959 --> 02:58:12,799
rna copies

5146
02:58:10,478 --> 02:58:15,519
were found in

5147
02:58:12,799 --> 02:58:16,799
15 to 20 percent of the people the rest

5148
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:18,880
had really low and they're probably

5149
02:58:16,799 --> 02:58:20,239
that's probably why they don't transmit

5150
02:58:18,879 --> 02:58:22,159
so

5151
02:58:20,239 --> 02:58:24,318
those are the ones that might get by

5152
02:58:22,159 --> 02:58:27,119
enough virus in the tiny droplets to be

5153
02:58:24,318 --> 02:58:29,359
able to infect someone at a distance and

5154
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:31,439
i think that's entirely possible

5155
02:58:29,359 --> 02:58:34,239
why is it hard to study

5156
02:58:31,439 --> 02:58:36,479
you can't do it in real life because you

5157
02:58:34,239 --> 02:58:37,680
don't know who's infected and if you do

5158
02:58:36,478 --> 02:58:39,438
this there's not a controlled

5159
02:58:37,680 --> 02:58:40,960
environment to measure droplets and so

5160
02:58:39,439 --> 02:58:43,200
forth you'd have to do it in a

5161
02:58:40,959 --> 02:58:44,879
laboratory situation if you use an

5162
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:46,399
animal you just don't know what the

5163
02:58:44,879 --> 02:58:48,318
relevance of that is

5164
02:58:46,398 --> 02:58:50,559
to people you'd have to use

5165
02:58:48,318 --> 02:58:52,079
human and do challenge experiments and

5166
02:58:50,559 --> 02:58:53,840
you know we we don't do that at this

5167
02:58:52,079 --> 02:58:55,439
point at least not for this virus so

5168
02:58:53,840 --> 02:58:58,318
that's why it's hard to know what's

5169
02:58:55,439 --> 02:59:00,479
going on so we have to make inferences

5170
02:58:58,318 --> 02:59:02,000
from epidemiological

5171
02:59:00,478 --> 02:59:04,239
associations where you're studying say

5172
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:06,159
transmission in a household where people

5173
02:59:04,239 --> 02:59:07,840
are stuck in the same rooms together and

5174
02:59:06,159 --> 02:59:09,920
you can get an idea of

5175
02:59:07,840 --> 02:59:11,840
what kind of droplets were involved so

5176
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:13,840
that makes it much harder to if you're

5177
02:59:11,840 --> 02:59:15,920
if you're leaning on epidemiological

5178
02:59:13,840 --> 02:59:17,520
stuff as opposed to like biophysics or

5179
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:18,398
something like the the mechanic very

5180
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:19,439
hard

5181
02:59:18,398 --> 02:59:21,119
so

5182
02:59:19,439 --> 02:59:23,279
that makes it but that makes it really

5183
02:59:21,120 --> 02:59:25,359
hard to then develop solutions like

5184
02:59:23,279 --> 02:59:28,399
masks to ask the question how will the

5185
02:59:25,359 --> 02:59:30,880
masks work because then to answer that

5186
02:59:28,398 --> 02:59:32,239
question you can lean on epidemiological

5187
02:59:30,879 --> 02:59:34,000
stuff again

5188
02:59:32,239 --> 02:59:36,478
like looking at populations that wear

5189
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:37,760
masks versus don't wear masks

5190
02:59:36,478 --> 02:59:39,199
as opposed to

5191
02:59:37,760 --> 02:59:40,159
actually saying

5192
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:41,840
uh

5193
02:59:40,159 --> 02:59:44,079
like from an engineering perspective

5194
02:59:41,840 --> 02:59:46,639
like what kind of material

5195
02:59:44,079 --> 02:59:49,200
and what kind of tightness

5196
02:59:46,639 --> 02:59:51,439
by which amount decreases

5197
02:59:49,200 --> 02:59:53,359
the viral load that's received on the

5198
02:59:51,439 --> 02:59:55,279
other end but

5199
02:59:53,359 --> 02:59:57,520
some experiments have been done with

5200
02:59:55,279 --> 03:00:00,239
masks and just droplets with no virus in

5201
02:59:57,520 --> 03:00:02,000
them right right yes and you can measure

5202
03:00:00,239 --> 03:00:03,439
the efficiency of different mask

5203
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:06,159
materials at

5204
03:00:03,439 --> 03:00:08,000
keeping those in so if i say that this

5205
03:00:06,159 --> 03:00:12,239
mask stops

5206
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:13,840
70 percent of this or larger size

5207
03:00:12,239 --> 03:00:17,039
droplet

5208
03:00:13,840 --> 03:00:18,799
that leads to this percent decreased

5209
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:21,840
transmission

5210
03:00:18,799 --> 03:00:24,879
um and also on both the

5211
03:00:21,840 --> 03:00:27,520
the generation and the the the

5212
03:00:24,879 --> 03:00:29,759
the receiving end and the giving end

5213
03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:31,920
sure so how will the mask protect you

5214
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:34,159
from others how well do you do mass

5215
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:36,318
protect uh others from you

5216
03:00:34,159 --> 03:00:39,119
like all of those things

5217
03:00:36,318 --> 03:00:42,318
seem like they could be more rigorously

5218
03:00:39,120 --> 03:00:44,960
studied there's no doubt about it and

5219
03:00:42,318 --> 03:00:46,000
now is the time because once this is

5220
03:00:44,959 --> 03:00:48,318
over

5221
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:51,439
nobody's gonna do it nobody's gonna care

5222
03:00:48,318 --> 03:00:52,799
no right but it seems like to me so test

5223
03:00:51,439 --> 03:00:54,720
is one thing

5224
03:00:52,799 --> 03:00:55,679
but masks

5225
03:00:54,719 --> 03:00:56,719
like

5226
03:00:55,680 --> 03:00:59,040
the

5227
03:00:56,719 --> 03:01:01,199
good mask whatever the good means

5228
03:00:59,040 --> 03:01:04,160
whatever that means like some level of a

5229
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:06,399
quality of material on your face

5230
03:01:04,159 --> 03:01:08,959
if it's shown to actually like

5231
03:01:06,398 --> 03:01:11,680
thoroughly shown to work well

5232
03:01:08,959 --> 03:01:13,199
that seems like an obvious solution

5233
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:15,680
uh to

5234
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:18,000
reopen society with if you have a good

5235
03:01:15,680 --> 03:01:19,439
understanding of how well they work

5236
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,639
because if you don't have a good

5237
03:01:19,439 --> 03:01:23,200
understanding if there's a lot of

5238
03:01:20,639 --> 03:01:24,879
uncertainty that's when you get and you

5239
03:01:23,200 --> 03:01:26,240
have people speaking from authority

5240
03:01:24,879 --> 03:01:27,839
that's when you start getting the

5241
03:01:26,239 --> 03:01:30,879
politicization

5242
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:33,279
of the solutions of course no the data

5243
03:01:30,879 --> 03:01:36,239
there are some data

5244
03:01:33,279 --> 03:01:37,920
most they're mostly epidemiological

5245
03:01:36,239 --> 03:01:40,000
and they show some effect in some

5246
03:01:37,920 --> 03:01:42,398
countries right but they could be way

5247
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:44,799
better yeah and

5248
03:01:42,398 --> 03:01:46,639
but the fact that they're not perfect

5249
03:01:44,799 --> 03:01:48,239
then people take advantage of and say

5250
03:01:46,639 --> 03:01:49,920
well look they don't work that well so

5251
03:01:48,239 --> 03:01:53,600
i'm not going to wear it i think as you

5252
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:55,840
said people can use it as an excuse but

5253
03:01:53,600 --> 03:01:58,640
even if it works so daniel always says

5254
03:01:55,840 --> 03:01:59,600
it a mask will cut down transmission by

5255
03:01:58,639 --> 03:02:01,840
50

5256
03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:04,318
to 60 percent and then distance will do

5257
03:02:01,840 --> 03:02:05,680
another 30 yeah those numbers are made

5258
03:02:04,318 --> 03:02:07,199
up though

5259
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:08,318
i mean they're not made up but they're

5260
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:10,000
estimates

5261
03:02:08,318 --> 03:02:11,519
absolutely

5262
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:13,840
and many of them are made

5263
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:16,000
based on models right yeah we make this

5264
03:02:13,840 --> 03:02:17,520
model and let's say the mask cuts down

5265
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:19,439
this much what's what will be the effect

5266
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:22,000
on i mean yeah they're models and it's

5267
03:02:19,439 --> 03:02:23,680
for the same reason i i don't believe

5268
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:25,520
the transmission

5269
03:02:23,680 --> 03:02:27,520
uh of the variants because it's all

5270
03:02:25,520 --> 03:02:29,520
based on statistical models as well not

5271
03:02:27,520 --> 03:02:31,439
biological experiments done in the lab

5272
03:02:29,520 --> 03:02:33,120
so that in that sense vaccine data is

5273
03:02:31,439 --> 03:02:35,200
much better than masks

5274
03:02:33,120 --> 03:02:37,439
for sure for sure so

5275
03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:38,800
my my problem with the mask date which i

5276
03:02:37,439 --> 03:02:40,318
always thought was fascinating i stopped

5277
03:02:38,799 --> 03:02:42,398
talking about it i was in the paper

5278
03:02:40,318 --> 03:02:43,600
about masks i stopped talking about it

5279
03:02:42,398 --> 03:02:45,599
because

5280
03:02:43,600 --> 03:02:47,920
what what started happening is mass

5281
03:02:45,600 --> 03:02:49,920
created on both sides

5282
03:02:47,920 --> 03:02:51,760
the people that were like in silicon

5283
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:54,239
valley friends of mine that were wearing

5284
03:02:51,760 --> 03:02:55,520
masks the way they look at others who

5285
03:02:54,239 --> 03:02:57,520
don't

5286
03:02:55,520 --> 03:02:59,040
is like that's that's a whole nother

5287
03:02:57,520 --> 03:03:00,720
issue right that's yeah but that what

5288
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:03,200
that i understand that's happens when

5289
03:03:00,719 --> 03:03:05,358
you don't have solid science understood

5290
03:03:03,200 --> 03:03:07,680
they that now start judging you like

5291
03:03:05,359 --> 03:03:10,720
you're less a human being you're not

5292
03:03:07,680 --> 03:03:12,479
only uh dumb but you're just you're

5293
03:03:10,719 --> 03:03:14,559
almost like evil you're doing bad for

5294
03:03:12,478 --> 03:03:17,438
society by not wearing masks and then

5295
03:03:14,559 --> 03:03:19,039
the people looking in the other way

5296
03:03:17,439 --> 03:03:21,200
are seeing you for the that

5297
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:22,800
you're being for judging them

5298
03:03:21,200 --> 03:03:24,560
uh unrightfully so they almost want to

5299
03:03:22,799 --> 03:03:26,559
say fu by not wearing the mask and

5300
03:03:24,559 --> 03:03:28,079
there's this division that's created

5301
03:03:26,559 --> 03:03:31,039
that that was heartbreaking to me

5302
03:03:28,079 --> 03:03:33,359
because masks like testing is a solution

5303
03:03:31,040 --> 03:03:35,439
that was available early on

5304
03:03:33,359 --> 03:03:37,520
and if understood well it could be

5305
03:03:35,439 --> 03:03:39,120
deployed in a mass scale and it seems

5306
03:03:37,520 --> 03:03:41,359
like there's some historical evidence

5307
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:43,600
for other viruses where it does yes very

5308
03:03:41,359 --> 03:03:46,000
well that's correct and so like

5309
03:03:43,600 --> 03:03:47,120
the fact that this was politicized

5310
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,879
um

5311
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:51,920
yeah was a little bit heartbreaking you

5312
03:03:48,879 --> 03:03:53,519
can find in the literature studies

5313
03:03:51,920 --> 03:03:56,159
mostly of healthcare workers and

5314
03:03:53,520 --> 03:03:57,520
influenza where you can actually

5315
03:03:56,159 --> 03:03:59,119
because you see the people every day

5316
03:03:57,520 --> 03:04:02,079
they can sample them you can actually

5317
03:03:59,120 --> 03:04:04,079
see what masking does and some of them

5318
03:04:02,079 --> 03:04:06,559
show an effect and others do not then

5319
03:04:04,079 --> 03:04:08,318
that's the problem that's like any trial

5320
03:04:06,559 --> 03:04:10,478
sometimes if it's not big enough and

5321
03:04:08,318 --> 03:04:12,559
then people latch on to that see it

5322
03:04:10,478 --> 03:04:14,239
doesn't really work but i think the main

5323
03:04:12,559 --> 03:04:17,600
issue is that

5324
03:04:14,239 --> 03:04:20,000
in january both cdc and who said masks

5325
03:04:17,600 --> 03:04:22,239
don't work don't use them

5326
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:24,318
that was the kiss of death for masks

5327
03:04:22,239 --> 03:04:25,840
because when they then changed their

5328
03:04:24,318 --> 03:04:28,079
mind

5329
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:29,760
they didn't say we screwed up

5330
03:04:28,079 --> 03:04:32,959
they just said wear masks if they had

5331
03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:34,880
said we made a mistake we were wrong

5332
03:04:32,959 --> 03:04:37,199
i think more people would have worn

5333
03:04:34,879 --> 03:04:38,239
masks but they didn't yeah and like you

5334
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:39,760
said

5335
03:04:38,239 --> 03:04:40,559
admitting you're wrong is

5336
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:42,639
like

5337
03:04:40,559 --> 03:04:44,239
a real big part of that i think almost

5338
03:04:42,639 --> 03:04:45,358
the better way is not just saying you're

5339
03:04:44,239 --> 03:04:47,279
kind of

5340
03:04:45,359 --> 03:04:48,840
saying you're wrong but

5341
03:04:47,279 --> 03:04:51,359
in january

5342
03:04:48,840 --> 03:04:53,600
saying like revealing the uncertainty

5343
03:04:51,359 --> 03:04:56,000
under which we operate like actually

5344
03:04:53,600 --> 03:04:57,840
like uh reveal what was done

5345
03:04:56,000 --> 03:05:00,000
uh and with the spanish food at the the

5346
03:04:57,840 --> 03:05:00,880
beginning of the previous century

5347
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,079
uh

5348
03:05:00,879 --> 03:05:03,839
because there's a lot of mass

5349
03:05:02,079 --> 03:05:05,039
controversy then too it went back and

5350
03:05:03,840 --> 03:05:06,960
forth and that was actually the source

5351
03:05:05,040 --> 03:05:09,439
of a lot of distrust there too

5352
03:05:06,959 --> 03:05:11,358
so and then uh look at influenza like

5353
03:05:09,439 --> 03:05:14,720
how is it effective with that and just

5354
03:05:11,359 --> 03:05:15,600
reveal this we don't we don't know but

5355
03:05:14,719 --> 03:05:18,000
uh

5356
03:05:15,600 --> 03:05:20,079
with like with some probability this is

5357
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:22,000
the best option we got right currently

5358
03:05:20,079 --> 03:05:23,760
and then and then in a month or two

5359
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:26,079
adjust it

5360
03:05:23,760 --> 03:05:27,920
saying that you know what our like

5361
03:05:26,079 --> 03:05:29,439
uncertainty decreased a little bit we

5362
03:05:27,920 --> 03:05:31,920
have a better idea

5363
03:05:29,439 --> 03:05:33,760
like that was a that was an incorrect

5364
03:05:31,920 --> 03:05:36,000
estimate but reveal that you're

5365
03:05:33,760 --> 03:05:37,760
struggling it's not like this weird

5366
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:40,079
binary clock that goes one direction or

5367
03:05:37,760 --> 03:05:43,120
the other you're struggling in

5368
03:05:40,079 --> 03:05:44,879
with uncertainty and like trusting

5369
03:05:43,120 --> 03:05:47,040
people maybe criticize me sometimes with

5370
03:05:44,879 --> 03:05:48,879
this but i i think most people are

5371
03:05:47,040 --> 03:05:50,240
actually intelligent

5372
03:05:48,879 --> 03:05:52,959
like trusting the public to be

5373
03:05:50,239 --> 03:05:54,959
intelligent uh with if you give them if

5374
03:05:52,959 --> 03:05:57,919
you have transparent and give them

5375
03:05:54,959 --> 03:05:59,519
information in a real authentic way like

5376
03:05:57,920 --> 03:06:01,200
don't look like you're hiding something

5377
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:03,359
i think they're intelligent enough to

5378
03:06:01,200 --> 03:06:05,840
use that data to make decisions it's the

5379
03:06:03,359 --> 03:06:07,520
same thing as with the testing is if if

5380
03:06:05,840 --> 03:06:08,799
you put that power into people's hands

5381
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:10,000
to know if they're sick or not they're

5382
03:06:08,799 --> 03:06:12,959
going to make

5383
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:15,520
unmask the right decision i think

5384
03:06:12,959 --> 03:06:17,919
it's uh that the masks and the testing

5385
03:06:15,520 --> 03:06:20,000
has been a bit heartbreaking

5386
03:06:17,920 --> 03:06:21,200
i think it's a good point though that

5387
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,959
most people don't seem to have an

5388
03:06:21,200 --> 03:06:25,359
objection to testing

5389
03:06:22,959 --> 03:06:26,959
that's a good point yes yeah and then

5390
03:06:25,359 --> 03:06:29,279
obviously makamina makes that point

5391
03:06:26,959 --> 03:06:30,239
brilliantly and still there's very

5392
03:06:29,279 --> 03:06:33,200
little

5393
03:06:30,239 --> 03:06:35,039
excitement around that

5394
03:06:33,200 --> 03:06:36,640
but he said he was going to do it i

5395
03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:38,640
don't understand i mean i haven't spoken

5396
03:06:36,639 --> 03:06:40,639
to him since then so i don't know why

5397
03:06:38,639 --> 03:06:43,278
he's pushing it well i mean but he can't

5398
03:06:40,639 --> 03:06:46,879
do it alone he has to get so one of the

5399
03:06:43,279 --> 03:06:48,079
one of the resistances fda doesn't like

5400
03:06:46,879 --> 03:06:48,959
cheap things

5401
03:06:48,079 --> 03:06:50,398
yeah

5402
03:06:48,959 --> 03:06:52,959
they don't want to approve it so it

5403
03:06:50,398 --> 03:06:55,039
makes the mass manufacturer

5404
03:06:52,959 --> 03:06:57,358
like uh with the emergency exceptions

5405
03:06:55,040 --> 03:06:58,960
all those kinds of things very difficult

5406
03:06:57,359 --> 03:07:01,600
and then there's not much money to be

5407
03:06:58,959 --> 03:07:03,759
made on it without that i don't know

5408
03:07:01,600 --> 03:07:05,760
i think there's just economic pressures

5409
03:07:03,760 --> 03:07:08,398
against it and because so much

5410
03:07:05,760 --> 03:07:08,398
investment

5411
03:07:08,719 --> 03:07:12,799
was uh placed on the vaccines and

5412
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:14,880
obviously there's an incentive mechanism

5413
03:07:12,799 --> 03:07:17,119
there where the companies sure you know

5414
03:07:14,879 --> 03:07:19,358
lobbyists and all those because

5415
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:20,319
there's this machine that says

5416
03:07:19,359 --> 03:07:22,239
um

5417
03:07:20,318 --> 03:07:24,879
arguing for tests is difficult because

5418
03:07:22,239 --> 03:07:27,119
the thing that's worked for most severe

5419
03:07:24,879 --> 03:07:28,879
viruses in the past is vaccines

5420
03:07:27,120 --> 03:07:30,319
now we have vaccines why the hell would

5421
03:07:28,879 --> 03:07:32,079
you need tests

5422
03:07:30,318 --> 03:07:34,559
at that time

5423
03:07:32,079 --> 03:07:36,318
like why the hell do you need tests when

5424
03:07:34,559 --> 03:07:37,760
we could be working on vaccines it seems

5425
03:07:36,318 --> 03:07:40,639
like the obvious thing to be working is

5426
03:07:37,760 --> 03:07:43,040
the vaccines from from their perspective

5427
03:07:40,639 --> 03:07:45,199
but it's not obvious at all to me

5428
03:07:43,040 --> 03:07:46,720
i think you should have both i think you

5429
03:07:45,200 --> 03:07:48,319
have vaccines and good testing and that

5430
03:07:46,719 --> 03:07:49,438
covers you

5431
03:07:48,318 --> 03:07:51,920
really well because you're always going

5432
03:07:49,439 --> 03:07:52,880
to have people who don't get vaccinated

5433
03:07:51,920 --> 03:07:54,719
i don't know if you've been paying

5434
03:07:52,879 --> 03:07:56,879
attention to this there's a guy named

5435
03:07:54,719 --> 03:07:58,000
brett weinstein there's a guy named sam

5436
03:07:56,879 --> 03:08:00,639
harris

5437
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:03,120
they have good representations

5438
03:08:00,639 --> 03:08:04,000
i would say of uh

5439
03:08:03,120 --> 03:08:06,240
of

5440
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:09,600
two sides of a perspective on vaccines

5441
03:08:06,239 --> 03:08:12,159
so from sam harris's perspective

5442
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:14,880
it's obvious that everybody should

5443
03:08:12,159 --> 03:08:16,559
get vaccinated and

5444
03:08:14,879 --> 03:08:18,398
it's irresponsible

5445
03:08:16,559 --> 03:08:20,879
to not get vaccinated

5446
03:08:18,398 --> 03:08:24,239
i think he represents a lot of people's

5447
03:08:20,879 --> 03:08:25,759
belief in that and then uh

5448
03:08:24,239 --> 03:08:28,398
brett

5449
03:08:25,760 --> 03:08:31,520
is talks a lot about ivermectin

5450
03:08:28,398 --> 03:08:33,599
but also talks about the hesitancy

5451
03:08:31,520 --> 03:08:35,279
towards the vaccine for

5452
03:08:33,600 --> 03:08:37,040
for people who are healthy who are

5453
03:08:35,279 --> 03:08:38,399
people who are younger that kind of

5454
03:08:37,040 --> 03:08:40,319
thing

5455
03:08:38,398 --> 03:08:41,680
and saying we should consider long-term

5456
03:08:40,318 --> 03:08:42,959
effects of

5457
03:08:41,680 --> 03:08:45,120
the vaccine

5458
03:08:42,959 --> 03:08:47,438
in making this calculation

5459
03:08:45,120 --> 03:08:49,359
what do you make about this conversation

5460
03:08:47,439 --> 03:08:50,880
some of it happens on twitter

5461
03:08:49,359 --> 03:08:53,359
some of it happens in the space of

5462
03:08:50,879 --> 03:08:55,358
podcasts

5463
03:08:53,359 --> 03:08:56,239
um do you pay attention to this kind of

5464
03:08:55,359 --> 03:08:58,399
thing

5465
03:08:56,239 --> 03:08:59,920
what's your role in this

5466
03:08:58,398 --> 03:09:01,920
what do you hope

5467
03:08:59,920 --> 03:09:03,920
is the way to resolve this conversation

5468
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:05,680
do you think it's healthy

5469
03:09:03,920 --> 03:09:09,200
well a conversation is always healthy

5470
03:09:05,680 --> 03:09:11,200
but to make definitive statements is not

5471
03:09:09,200 --> 03:09:13,520
because it suggests you have information

5472
03:09:11,200 --> 03:09:15,040
that you don't have so

5473
03:09:13,520 --> 03:09:16,399
um

5474
03:09:15,040 --> 03:09:18,319
you know we talked about long-term

5475
03:09:16,398 --> 03:09:20,478
effects i think you need to balance

5476
03:09:18,318 --> 03:09:22,478
those versus long-term effects of the

5477
03:09:20,478 --> 03:09:23,679
disease and you can make your decision

5478
03:09:22,478 --> 03:09:24,879
i don't think

5479
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:26,800
you need to

5480
03:09:24,879 --> 03:09:28,959
tell everybody to get vaccinated i think

5481
03:09:26,799 --> 03:09:30,719
you need to present the case you say

5482
03:09:28,959 --> 03:09:32,159
here we made good vaccines here the

5483
03:09:30,719 --> 03:09:34,559
safety profile

5484
03:09:32,159 --> 03:09:36,238
here's the risk benefit balance and you

5485
03:09:34,559 --> 03:09:37,840
should decide you're a smart person you

5486
03:09:36,238 --> 03:09:39,119
should decide

5487
03:09:37,840 --> 03:09:40,639
now

5488
03:09:39,120 --> 03:09:42,399
companies are going to do differently

5489
03:09:40,639 --> 03:09:44,318
right companies may say you have to be

5490
03:09:42,398 --> 03:09:45,439
vaccinated to work here my employer

5491
03:09:44,318 --> 03:09:47,039
columbia

5492
03:09:45,439 --> 03:09:48,318
said we have to be vaccinated to work in

5493
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:50,080
the fallen if you want to be a student

5494
03:09:48,318 --> 03:09:52,159
you have to be vaccinated so you decide

5495
03:09:50,079 --> 03:09:53,200
whether you want to go or not

5496
03:09:52,159 --> 03:09:56,478
but

5497
03:09:53,200 --> 03:09:56,479
the the idea that

5498
03:09:56,799 --> 03:10:00,079
you should make a decision based on

5499
03:09:58,478 --> 03:10:02,559
long-term

5500
03:10:00,079 --> 03:10:03,920
effects there is no evidence right so

5501
03:10:02,559 --> 03:10:05,840
how can you make a decision when we

5502
03:10:03,920 --> 03:10:06,960
don't have evidence whereas we do have

5503
03:10:05,840 --> 03:10:08,639
evidence that there are long-term

5504
03:10:06,959 --> 03:10:10,478
effects of getting covet so i don't

5505
03:10:08,639 --> 03:10:13,199
think that's a fair argument and it just

5506
03:10:10,478 --> 03:10:14,639
makes people scared to say that

5507
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:17,120
yeah but on the other hand for someone

5508
03:10:14,639 --> 03:10:18,639
to say it's a no-brainer and

5509
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:20,079
to denigrate people for not being

5510
03:10:18,639 --> 03:10:21,358
vaccinated that's not the approach

5511
03:10:20,079 --> 03:10:22,719
either because

5512
03:10:21,359 --> 03:10:24,559
they're going to dig in

5513
03:10:22,719 --> 03:10:26,719
and say i'm not doing this because you

5514
03:10:24,559 --> 03:10:28,478
tell me too right i think the middle

5515
03:10:26,719 --> 03:10:31,840
ground is to say

5516
03:10:28,478 --> 03:10:34,000
take a bit of both and say

5517
03:10:31,840 --> 03:10:36,159
hear the potential issues and hear the

5518
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:37,680
benefits and

5519
03:10:36,159 --> 03:10:39,200
this is what i would do and you have to

5520
03:10:37,680 --> 03:10:40,559
just decide on your own i'd leave it to

5521
03:10:39,200 --> 03:10:42,319
them i say you decide and if you don't

5522
03:10:40,559 --> 03:10:44,318
want to you know it's up to you you

5523
03:10:42,318 --> 03:10:45,840
don't have to get vaccinated

5524
03:10:44,318 --> 03:10:49,359
and you'll probably get infected at some

5525
03:10:45,840 --> 03:10:49,359
point and maybe you'll be okay

5526
03:10:49,920 --> 03:10:54,879
but here's the best available data and

5527
03:10:51,680 --> 03:10:56,960
it looks like the vaccines are pretty uh

5528
03:10:54,879 --> 03:10:58,238
a pretty damn smart solution they seem

5529
03:10:56,959 --> 03:10:59,919
to work i think you

5530
03:10:58,238 --> 03:11:02,238
tell people what you did

5531
03:10:59,920 --> 03:11:04,238
and present both sides calmly and i

5532
03:11:02,238 --> 03:11:05,760
think digging in you know as like in a

5533
03:11:04,238 --> 03:11:09,119
debate i don't think that's terribly

5534
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:10,800
useful yeah so that's my view i i mean

5535
03:11:09,120 --> 03:11:12,960
people come to me all the time and ask

5536
03:11:10,799 --> 03:11:12,959
me

5537
03:11:13,279 --> 03:11:16,560
i'm worried what should i do and i'd say

5538
03:11:15,279 --> 03:11:18,880
what are you worried about let's talk

5539
03:11:16,559 --> 03:11:20,079
about it and go through it calmly

5540
03:11:18,879 --> 03:11:21,519
and if they want to still take

5541
03:11:20,079 --> 03:11:22,478
ivermectin i said it's fine it's your

5542
03:11:21,520 --> 03:11:24,960
choice

5543
03:11:22,478 --> 03:11:27,199
i have a problem with that i love that i

5544
03:11:24,959 --> 03:11:29,358
love that's the way you think uh people

5545
03:11:27,200 --> 03:11:32,000
should definitely listen to this week in

5546
03:11:29,359 --> 03:11:34,079
virology

5547
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:36,159
and follow your work is brilliant i've

5548
03:11:34,079 --> 03:11:38,000
been really enjoying it lately it's it's

5549
03:11:36,159 --> 03:11:39,359
like it's my favorite way to stay in

5550
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,159
touch with

5551
03:11:39,359 --> 03:11:42,960
the

5552
03:11:40,159 --> 03:11:45,439
the happenings of covid obviously you

5553
03:11:42,959 --> 03:11:47,278
put in a lot of other stuff in there but

5554
03:11:45,439 --> 03:11:50,159
we used to do other viruses before

5555
03:11:47,279 --> 03:11:52,479
covert it was quite interesting um and

5556
03:11:50,159 --> 03:11:55,279
i'm trying to slip other viruses in

5557
03:11:52,478 --> 03:11:56,799
because i think they're informative

5558
03:11:55,279 --> 03:11:57,920
in many ways and we're going to do more

5559
03:11:56,799 --> 03:12:00,398
and more of that but i have to say i

5560
03:11:57,920 --> 03:12:02,079
canceled usually i record on tuesday and

5561
03:12:00,398 --> 03:12:03,199
friday and i canceled today so i could

5562
03:12:02,079 --> 03:12:05,520
be with you

5563
03:12:03,200 --> 03:12:07,840
huge honor i appreciate that no no it's

5564
03:12:05,520 --> 03:12:10,159
fine um i think a couple of other people

5565
03:12:07,840 --> 03:12:12,159
were going to be away anyway so

5566
03:12:10,159 --> 03:12:14,639
so i do a lot of different pods they're

5567
03:12:12,159 --> 03:12:15,600
all on youtube but i also do a live

5568
03:12:14,639 --> 03:12:17,840
stream

5569
03:12:15,600 --> 03:12:19,840
on wednesday nights on youtube which you

5570
03:12:17,840 --> 03:12:21,920
can find and that's where people can

5571
03:12:19,840 --> 03:12:25,120
come and ask questions we don't have an

5572
03:12:21,920 --> 03:12:27,359
agenda we just start and by 30 minutes

5573
03:12:25,120 --> 03:12:28,720
in there's 700 people with questions

5574
03:12:27,359 --> 03:12:30,960
that i can't even get through because

5575
03:12:28,719 --> 03:12:33,760
there's so many of them and i'm actually

5576
03:12:30,959 --> 03:12:35,599
astounded that so many people are

5577
03:12:33,760 --> 03:12:38,000
have really good questions

5578
03:12:35,600 --> 03:12:39,520
most of them are reasonable and and they

5579
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:41,920
come back every week so it's a great

5580
03:12:39,520 --> 03:12:44,079
it's turning into a great uh forum to

5581
03:12:41,920 --> 03:12:46,879
have a nice discussion

5582
03:12:44,079 --> 03:12:49,200
and the youtube channel is called what

5583
03:12:46,879 --> 03:12:52,879
so you could search for my name which is

5584
03:12:49,200 --> 03:12:58,239
vincent dracquiniello it'll turn up or

5585
03:12:52,879 --> 03:12:58,238
my handle on youtube is prof vrr

5586
03:12:58,840 --> 03:13:03,120
p-r-o-f-e-r-r have you read uh the

5587
03:13:00,959 --> 03:13:04,719
plague by kamu by any chance

5588
03:13:03,120 --> 03:13:07,439
years ago

5589
03:13:04,719 --> 03:13:09,438
years ago i have to read it again that's

5590
03:13:07,439 --> 03:13:11,040
really relevant well let me just sort of

5591
03:13:09,439 --> 03:13:12,880
ask you a question about it

5592
03:13:11,040 --> 03:13:15,040
it describes a town that's overtaken by

5593
03:13:12,879 --> 03:13:16,318
a plague and it's blocked off from the

5594
03:13:15,040 --> 03:13:18,080
rest of the world

5595
03:13:16,318 --> 03:13:20,079
and it kind of reveals the best the

5596
03:13:18,079 --> 03:13:22,079
worst of human nature that's like how

5597
03:13:20,079 --> 03:13:23,359
people respond to that sort of the

5598
03:13:22,079 --> 03:13:25,680
encroaching

5599
03:13:23,359 --> 03:13:27,840
that their own mortality their own death

5600
03:13:25,680 --> 03:13:30,000
on the horizon i think what are the

5601
03:13:27,840 --> 03:13:32,079
messages in the book that

5602
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:34,879
ultimately

5603
03:13:32,079 --> 03:13:36,799
like love for others so it's like a lot

5604
03:13:34,879 --> 03:13:38,959
of people want to become isolated and

5605
03:13:36,799 --> 03:13:40,799
they hide from each other but ultimately

5606
03:13:38,959 --> 03:13:43,919
the thing that saves you is

5607
03:13:40,799 --> 03:13:46,238
is love which is one of the things i've

5608
03:13:43,920 --> 03:13:47,680
just watching this pandemic

5609
03:13:46,238 --> 03:13:48,799
you know with the distance with the

5610
03:13:47,680 --> 03:13:50,479
masks

5611
03:13:48,799 --> 03:13:53,840
that's all fine

5612
03:13:50,478 --> 03:13:56,639
but there's a distancing from people

5613
03:13:53,840 --> 03:13:58,639
of that that that um the tension the

5614
03:13:56,639 --> 03:14:00,719
breaking of the common humanity between

5615
03:13:58,639 --> 03:14:02,238
people that's one of the reasons i when

5616
03:14:00,719 --> 03:14:05,039
i came to austin

5617
03:14:02,238 --> 03:14:06,719
earlier this year just to visit

5618
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:08,880
i fell in love with the city because

5619
03:14:06,719 --> 03:14:13,199
even with the masks in the distance

5620
03:14:08,879 --> 03:14:15,438
there were still um a camaraderie like a

5621
03:14:13,200 --> 03:14:18,000
like a i don't know just a love for each

5622
03:14:15,439 --> 03:14:19,760
other just a kindness towards each other

5623
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:20,879
and uh that's what i took away from the

5624
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:23,279
plague

5625
03:14:20,879 --> 03:14:25,438
mostly it's told the story of the doctor

5626
03:14:23,279 --> 03:14:26,960
who basically

5627
03:14:25,439 --> 03:14:29,359
gives in

5628
03:14:26,959 --> 03:14:31,919
and uh just gives himself as a service

5629
03:14:29,359 --> 03:14:33,439
to others and that that love is the

5630
03:14:31,920 --> 03:14:35,120
thing that liberates him from his own

5631
03:14:33,439 --> 03:14:38,159
conception of mortality the fact that

5632
03:14:35,120 --> 03:14:40,399
he's here he's going to die what do you

5633
03:14:38,159 --> 03:14:42,238
think about this

5634
03:14:40,398 --> 03:14:43,760
the effect of the virus we talked a lot

5635
03:14:42,238 --> 03:14:47,279
about biology but

5636
03:14:43,760 --> 03:14:49,520
the effect of the virus and the

5637
03:14:47,279 --> 03:14:51,279
the the fabric of the common humanity

5638
03:14:49,520 --> 03:14:54,319
that connects us

5639
03:14:51,279 --> 03:14:55,359
well that's what a pandemic does it

5640
03:14:54,318 --> 03:14:57,840
really

5641
03:14:55,359 --> 03:15:00,800
cuts that right because small outbreaks

5642
03:14:57,840 --> 03:15:03,040
are local they don't have global effects

5643
03:15:00,799 --> 03:15:04,000
but when you have something this big

5644
03:15:03,040 --> 03:15:07,359
where

5645
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:08,639
pretty much nobody escapes

5646
03:15:07,359 --> 03:15:10,238
and not just

5647
03:15:08,639 --> 03:15:10,959
making people sick

5648
03:15:10,238 --> 03:15:13,520
it

5649
03:15:10,959 --> 03:15:15,438
changes your life right people lose jobs

5650
03:15:13,520 --> 03:15:17,200
they change jobs they move somewhere

5651
03:15:15,439 --> 03:15:18,840
else

5652
03:15:17,200 --> 03:15:21,120
they have all kinds of

5653
03:15:18,840 --> 03:15:23,840
disruptions you know kids can't go to

5654
03:15:21,120 --> 03:15:25,439
school it really shows you i mean i

5655
03:15:23,840 --> 03:15:28,159
always like to say

5656
03:15:25,439 --> 03:15:30,318
a tiny virus can bring

5657
03:15:28,159 --> 03:15:31,920
earth to its knees

5658
03:15:30,318 --> 03:15:33,359
tiny viruses you can't even see them

5659
03:15:31,920 --> 03:15:35,200
that most people don't even think about

5660
03:15:33,359 --> 03:15:37,760
most of the time

5661
03:15:35,200 --> 03:15:41,279
and the real effect is not just sickness

5662
03:15:37,760 --> 03:15:43,520
it's what it does to people because

5663
03:15:41,279 --> 03:15:45,520
in the end we are animals and most

5664
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:46,880
animals like each other and they

5665
03:15:45,520 --> 03:15:48,960
interact they have great social

5666
03:15:46,879 --> 03:15:50,639
structures and that makes them

5667
03:15:48,959 --> 03:15:52,559
do well

5668
03:15:50,639 --> 03:15:54,719
and i guess the exception is people in

5669
03:15:52,559 --> 03:15:56,478
ai right

5670
03:15:54,719 --> 03:15:57,920
they could be on their own

5671
03:15:56,478 --> 03:15:59,840
well that's why you build robots that

5672
03:15:57,920 --> 03:16:02,799
you fall in love with that's right and

5673
03:15:59,840 --> 03:16:04,079
so i think when uh when a the real story

5674
03:16:02,799 --> 03:16:06,478
is what it does

5675
03:16:04,079 --> 03:16:09,120
to society for sure which has

5676
03:16:06,478 --> 03:16:10,478
ramifications way beyond the number of

5677
03:16:09,120 --> 03:16:12,399
people dying

5678
03:16:10,478 --> 03:16:14,478
in the vaccines and the tests and all of

5679
03:16:12,398 --> 03:16:16,398
that and this one has really

5680
03:16:14,478 --> 03:16:18,159
made a big rupture and you could tell

5681
03:16:16,398 --> 03:16:20,238
not now so much i think being out and

5682
03:16:18,159 --> 03:16:22,478
about now things look

5683
03:16:20,238 --> 03:16:24,719
pretty normal except you know for some

5684
03:16:22,478 --> 03:16:25,840
people wearing masks you would now never

5685
03:16:24,719 --> 03:16:27,438
know i mean

5686
03:16:25,840 --> 03:16:29,120
the airport this morning was completely

5687
03:16:27,439 --> 03:16:31,439
jammed people go and they're all on

5688
03:16:29,120 --> 03:16:33,200
vacation or wearing shorts right

5689
03:16:31,439 --> 03:16:34,318
so they're they're back to normal it's

5690
03:16:33,200 --> 03:16:36,880
august

5691
03:16:34,318 --> 03:16:38,559
but last year it's really different in

5692
03:16:36,879 --> 03:16:40,079
new york where you're

5693
03:16:38,559 --> 03:16:42,959
used to lots of people on the street it

5694
03:16:40,079 --> 03:16:44,559
was eerie it's just quiet

5695
03:16:42,959 --> 03:16:46,000
but you know under it all people are

5696
03:16:44,559 --> 03:16:47,840
still

5697
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:50,000
most people help each other when they

5698
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:52,238
have to right

5699
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:54,079
most people are willing to uh

5700
03:16:52,238 --> 03:16:56,079
if something happens to someone to reach

5701
03:16:54,079 --> 03:16:57,279
out and help them

5702
03:16:56,079 --> 03:16:58,799
you know there are always exceptions

5703
03:16:57,279 --> 03:16:59,920
where people are mean

5704
03:16:58,799 --> 03:17:01,840
and that's

5705
03:16:59,920 --> 03:17:03,760
you know that's just the way animals are

5706
03:17:01,840 --> 03:17:05,359
we're not the only ones that can be mean

5707
03:17:03,760 --> 03:17:06,559
to our own species

5708
03:17:05,359 --> 03:17:10,000
yeah but

5709
03:17:06,559 --> 03:17:11,519
i think most of the motivation for

5710
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:13,520
everything that was done is to help

5711
03:17:11,520 --> 03:17:14,800
other people i mean i i do think that

5712
03:17:13,520 --> 03:17:16,640
the vaccine

5713
03:17:14,799 --> 03:17:18,398
manufacturers maybe not the leaders but

5714
03:17:16,639 --> 03:17:20,079
the people working in the labs really

5715
03:17:18,398 --> 03:17:22,799
wanted to get this out

5716
03:17:20,079 --> 03:17:24,840
quickly and help people right yeah i

5717
03:17:22,799 --> 03:17:27,519
think at every level people who are

5718
03:17:24,840 --> 03:17:29,520
contributing really wanted to help other

5719
03:17:27,520 --> 03:17:32,560
people and feel proud that they're able

5720
03:17:29,520 --> 03:17:34,319
to do that so there's i view it as

5721
03:17:32,559 --> 03:17:35,600
you know we're never going to be 100

5722
03:17:34,318 --> 03:17:37,680
good

5723
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:38,880
because animals are not

5724
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:40,960
evolution

5725
03:17:38,879 --> 03:17:43,438
made us i mean we're lucky we somehow

5726
03:17:40,959 --> 03:17:45,039
rose above by having incredible brain

5727
03:17:43,439 --> 03:17:47,040
and so forth but a lot of our base

5728
03:17:45,040 --> 03:17:49,040
instincts are animals and you know they

5729
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:51,120
chase each other and

5730
03:17:49,040 --> 03:17:52,640
and have alpha males and all that stuff

5731
03:17:51,120 --> 03:17:56,079
and and we always have a little bit of

5732
03:17:52,639 --> 03:17:59,199
that in us but we do have some

5733
03:17:56,079 --> 03:18:00,879
humanity that this really ripped up it

5734
03:17:59,200 --> 03:18:04,560
really did

5735
03:18:00,879 --> 03:18:07,039
and i think for me someone who studied

5736
03:18:04,559 --> 03:18:09,680
viruses for over 40 years it's just

5737
03:18:07,040 --> 03:18:11,200
amazing that an invisible thing can do

5738
03:18:09,680 --> 03:18:12,800
that right

5739
03:18:11,200 --> 03:18:14,479
it goes back to the thing you found

5740
03:18:12,799 --> 03:18:16,879
fascinating which is a virus affecting

5741
03:18:14,478 --> 03:18:18,639
human behavior yes or uh behavior of the

5742
03:18:16,879 --> 03:18:20,159
organism

5743
03:18:18,639 --> 03:18:22,478
yes so

5744
03:18:20,159 --> 03:18:24,318
you know humans can make weapons and do

5745
03:18:22,478 --> 03:18:26,079
harm and you can see that but this you

5746
03:18:24,318 --> 03:18:27,680
can't even see yeah

5747
03:18:26,079 --> 03:18:29,840
you can't and look what it has done and

5748
03:18:27,680 --> 03:18:31,040
it'll do it again there'll be more i

5749
03:18:29,840 --> 03:18:33,040
just

5750
03:18:31,040 --> 03:18:36,560
i wish we would be more prepared because

5751
03:18:33,040 --> 03:18:39,279
we know what to do we know we should be

5752
03:18:36,559 --> 03:18:42,159
making antivirals vaccines masks testing

5753
03:18:39,279 --> 03:18:43,279
masks making test mode modalities that

5754
03:18:42,159 --> 03:18:46,000
we can

5755
03:18:43,279 --> 03:18:48,319
really quickly redesign

5756
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:50,159
but after sars one all that went out the

5757
03:18:48,318 --> 03:18:52,719
door people didn't do anything and

5758
03:18:50,159 --> 03:18:54,559
that's why we're in this situation so

5759
03:18:52,719 --> 03:18:56,398
i you know people ask me this all the

5760
03:18:54,559 --> 03:18:57,680
time are we going to be ready for the

5761
03:18:56,398 --> 03:18:59,840
next one

5762
03:18:57,680 --> 03:19:02,159
and i always say we should be we have

5763
03:18:59,840 --> 03:19:04,799
all the information we need to know what

5764
03:19:02,159 --> 03:19:07,279
to do but somehow i think

5765
03:19:04,799 --> 03:19:11,358
people forget

5766
03:19:07,279 --> 03:19:12,640
uh that said sometimes uh we we really

5767
03:19:11,359 --> 03:19:14,880
step up

5768
03:19:12,639 --> 03:19:17,119
when the tragedies run in front of us we

5769
03:19:14,879 --> 03:19:18,719
do on the catastrophe so i don't know

5770
03:19:17,120 --> 03:19:20,319
somehow humans have still survived the

5771
03:19:18,719 --> 03:19:22,000
fact that we had nuclear weapons for so

5772
03:19:20,318 --> 03:19:24,079
many decades and we're still not blowing

5773
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:26,159
each other up whether by terrorists or

5774
03:19:24,079 --> 03:19:28,000
by nation is amazing it's quite

5775
03:19:26,159 --> 03:19:30,079
surprising

5776
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:32,879
so always after reading the pentagon

5777
03:19:30,079 --> 03:19:35,200
papers it's even more amazing right

5778
03:19:32,879 --> 03:19:37,519
so i don't know how we do it i i tend to

5779
03:19:35,200 --> 03:19:39,200
believe as there's uh

5780
03:19:37,520 --> 03:19:40,800
there's that

5781
03:19:39,200 --> 03:19:44,000
you know at the surface you notice the

5782
03:19:40,799 --> 03:19:46,079
greed the corruption the the evil but

5783
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:47,439
the core of human nature of the human

5784
03:19:46,079 --> 03:19:49,520
spirit is

5785
03:19:47,439 --> 03:19:51,680
is uh one in the scientific realm is

5786
03:19:49,520 --> 03:19:54,399
curiosity and

5787
03:19:51,680 --> 03:19:56,318
more deeply is kindness compassion and

5788
03:19:54,398 --> 03:19:59,278
like wanting to do good for the world

5789
03:19:56,318 --> 03:20:01,439
like i i believe that desire to do good

5790
03:19:59,279 --> 03:20:03,680
out powers all the other stuff

5791
03:20:01,439 --> 03:20:05,520
uh by a large amount and that's why we

5792
03:20:03,680 --> 03:20:07,439
don't we have not yet destroyed

5793
03:20:05,520 --> 03:20:09,359
ourselves we kind of there's a lot of

5794
03:20:07,439 --> 03:20:11,840
bickering there's a lot of wars on the

5795
03:20:09,359 --> 03:20:14,880
surface but underneath it all there's

5796
03:20:11,840 --> 03:20:17,439
there's this ocean of uh

5797
03:20:14,879 --> 03:20:21,278
love for each other i mean i think

5798
03:20:17,439 --> 03:20:23,439
there's a evolutionary advantage to that

5799
03:20:21,279 --> 03:20:25,200
and uh it would be a good explanation

5800
03:20:23,439 --> 03:20:27,359
why we still haven't destroyed ourselves

5801
03:20:25,200 --> 03:20:29,120
oh we had so many opportunities yeah if

5802
03:20:27,359 --> 03:20:32,880
you look at all the wars in history so

5803
03:20:29,120 --> 03:20:34,640
many yeah i was just my son was

5804
03:20:32,879 --> 03:20:35,920
telling me about the ottoman empire

5805
03:20:34,639 --> 03:20:37,358
right

5806
03:20:35,920 --> 03:20:40,000
it's just

5807
03:20:37,359 --> 03:20:42,479
you know war after war and then other

5808
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:46,398
countries splitting up countries with no

5809
03:20:42,478 --> 03:20:47,358
regard to who's living where right

5810
03:20:46,398 --> 03:20:50,318
it's just

5811
03:20:47,359 --> 03:20:51,920
how can these people do this yeah it's

5812
03:20:50,318 --> 03:20:54,478
fascinating human history is fascinating

5813
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:56,799
and we're still young as a species

5814
03:20:54,478 --> 03:20:58,478
we have a lot very young yeah more time

5815
03:20:56,799 --> 03:21:00,559
to go and a lot

5816
03:20:58,478 --> 03:21:02,719
more ways to distort ourselves do you

5817
03:21:00,559 --> 03:21:04,559
have advice like you said you have many

5818
03:21:02,719 --> 03:21:07,039
decades of research and an incredible

5819
03:21:04,559 --> 03:21:09,199
like career in life you have advice for

5820
03:21:07,040 --> 03:21:11,680
young people about

5821
03:21:09,200 --> 03:21:13,279
career about life people in high school

5822
03:21:11,680 --> 03:21:15,680
people in college

5823
03:21:13,279 --> 03:21:17,359
of um how to live a life that can be

5824
03:21:15,680 --> 03:21:19,920
proud of

5825
03:21:17,359 --> 03:21:21,920
so i what i like to do is tell people

5826
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:24,318
don't plan it because i didn't plan

5827
03:21:21,920 --> 03:21:26,559
anything everything i did was one step

5828
03:21:24,318 --> 03:21:28,398
at a time you don't have to plan

5829
03:21:26,559 --> 03:21:30,719
i just

5830
03:21:28,398 --> 03:21:32,079
found things that were interesting to me

5831
03:21:30,719 --> 03:21:34,398
and so i

5832
03:21:32,079 --> 03:21:36,159
my father was a doctor and

5833
03:21:34,398 --> 03:21:38,959
he wanted me to be a doctor but i was

5834
03:21:36,159 --> 03:21:39,680
not interested in taking care of people

5835
03:21:38,959 --> 03:21:41,519
i

5836
03:21:39,680 --> 03:21:43,920
learned that

5837
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:45,760
but i couldn't say no to him so

5838
03:21:43,920 --> 03:21:49,520
you know i was a biology major in

5839
03:21:45,760 --> 03:21:51,680
college and i i graduated and

5840
03:21:49,520 --> 03:21:54,238
i didn't have anything to do

5841
03:21:51,680 --> 03:21:56,000
so i liked science so i got a job in the

5842
03:21:54,238 --> 03:21:58,719
lab

5843
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:59,760
and it was very exciting and

5844
03:21:58,719 --> 03:22:01,438
that led

5845
03:21:59,760 --> 03:22:03,920
to everything else that i've done one

5846
03:22:01,439 --> 03:22:05,840
step at a time and i think

5847
03:22:03,920 --> 03:22:07,120
the most important thing you can do well

5848
03:22:05,840 --> 03:22:08,719
they're two important things you could

5849
03:22:07,120 --> 03:22:11,200
be really curious all the time you

5850
03:22:08,719 --> 03:22:12,879
mentioned curiosity i think curiosity is

5851
03:22:11,200 --> 03:22:15,520
essential

5852
03:22:12,879 --> 03:22:17,438
you have to be curious about everything

5853
03:22:15,520 --> 03:22:19,120
and if you are you're never going to be

5854
03:22:17,439 --> 03:22:21,040
bored yeah

5855
03:22:19,120 --> 03:22:22,960
and so people who say they're bored i

5856
03:22:21,040 --> 03:22:25,600
say you are not curious you should just

5857
03:22:22,959 --> 03:22:27,519
think about things and say look at

5858
03:22:25,600 --> 03:22:28,880
something and say how does that work or

5859
03:22:27,520 --> 03:22:30,479
what what is it doing and how do they

5860
03:22:28,879 --> 03:22:31,679
get there and you'll never be bored and

5861
03:22:30,478 --> 03:22:32,719
the other thing is when you find

5862
03:22:31,680 --> 03:22:34,398
something

5863
03:22:32,719 --> 03:22:36,879
which may take time

5864
03:22:34,398 --> 03:22:38,559
it's fine

5865
03:22:36,879 --> 03:22:40,799
you have to be passionate about it you

5866
03:22:38,559 --> 03:22:44,238
have to put everything into it

5867
03:22:40,799 --> 03:22:47,199
and that's what i did with viruses so

5868
03:22:44,238 --> 03:22:49,760
i i think they're amazing and

5869
03:22:47,200 --> 03:22:52,000
i tell my classes

5870
03:22:49,760 --> 03:22:53,439
i love viruses they're amazing and

5871
03:22:52,000 --> 03:22:55,359
people think i'm morbid because

5872
03:22:53,439 --> 03:22:56,559
obviously they kill they kill people and

5873
03:22:55,359 --> 03:22:57,920
i shouldn't love something that but

5874
03:22:56,559 --> 03:22:59,920
that's not the point that's not what i

5875
03:22:57,920 --> 03:23:01,279
mean i love them in the way they have

5876
03:22:59,920 --> 03:23:03,200
emerged and

5877
03:23:01,279 --> 03:23:04,319
how they work and and so forth and all

5878
03:23:03,200 --> 03:23:06,319
that we don't know about them so you

5879
03:23:04,318 --> 03:23:08,318
need to be curious and passionate and

5880
03:23:06,318 --> 03:23:09,359
don't plan too much and just find

5881
03:23:08,318 --> 03:23:10,920
something

5882
03:23:09,359 --> 03:23:12,079
that you don't call a job

5883
03:23:10,920 --> 03:23:13,680
[Music]

5884
03:23:12,079 --> 03:23:16,719
because someone said on the live stream

5885
03:23:13,680 --> 03:23:18,559
last week i wish i had a job i liked as

5886
03:23:16,719 --> 03:23:21,199
much as you i said it's not a job i

5887
03:23:18,559 --> 03:23:23,680
never looked at it as a job it's my

5888
03:23:21,200 --> 03:23:25,520
vocation it's my passion

5889
03:23:23,680 --> 03:23:27,520
if it's a job then you're not gonna like

5890
03:23:25,520 --> 03:23:30,880
it yeah something that doesn't feel like

5891
03:23:27,520 --> 03:23:32,079
a job so you said uh viruses are kind of

5892
03:23:30,879 --> 03:23:33,839
um

5893
03:23:32,079 --> 03:23:36,159
passive

5894
03:23:33,840 --> 03:23:39,040
non-living you could say

5895
03:23:36,159 --> 03:23:40,559
uh or even cells are passive and humans

5896
03:23:39,040 --> 03:23:42,239
are kind of active we seem to be making

5897
03:23:40,559 --> 03:23:44,559
our own decisions

5898
03:23:42,238 --> 03:23:46,478
so uh let me ask you the why question

5899
03:23:44,559 --> 03:23:48,639
what do you think is the meaning of this

5900
03:23:46,478 --> 03:23:51,199
life of ours

5901
03:23:48,639 --> 03:23:52,639
oh there's no meaning it just happened

5902
03:23:51,200 --> 03:23:53,600
it's an accident

5903
03:23:52,639 --> 03:23:55,039
um

5904
03:23:53,600 --> 03:23:56,720
i think there's no life elsewhere

5905
03:23:55,040 --> 03:23:58,720
because this is just a rare accident

5906
03:23:56,719 --> 03:24:00,478
that happened and the right conditions i

5907
03:23:58,719 --> 03:24:02,238
mean people all think i'm wrong because

5908
03:24:00,478 --> 03:24:03,920
there are billions and billions of stars

5909
03:24:02,238 --> 03:24:05,119
out there right so there's a lot of

5910
03:24:03,920 --> 03:24:07,600
opportunity

5911
03:24:05,120 --> 03:24:09,520
there's no meaning it's just

5912
03:24:07,600 --> 03:24:12,159
a

5913
03:24:09,520 --> 03:24:14,479
what do they call it a perfect storm of

5914
03:24:12,159 --> 03:24:16,478
events that led to molecules being

5915
03:24:14,478 --> 03:24:18,000
formed and eventually i mean it took a

5916
03:24:16,478 --> 03:24:20,559
long time for

5917
03:24:18,000 --> 03:24:22,559
life to evolve right yeah but it's just

5918
03:24:20,559 --> 03:24:24,000
driven by

5919
03:24:22,559 --> 03:24:25,519
conditions

5920
03:24:24,000 --> 03:24:26,959
if something emerged that worked it

5921
03:24:25,520 --> 03:24:29,279
would then go on to the next step

5922
03:24:26,959 --> 03:24:32,079
there's no meaning other than that the

5923
03:24:29,279 --> 03:24:33,680
only difference is that we

5924
03:24:32,079 --> 03:24:35,279
and i think many other animals can

5925
03:24:33,680 --> 03:24:37,120
probably we we have the ability we're

5926
03:24:35,279 --> 03:24:38,560
sentient right we can influence what

5927
03:24:37,120 --> 03:24:42,319
happens to us

5928
03:24:38,559 --> 03:24:44,318
and we can take medicines right we can

5929
03:24:42,318 --> 03:24:47,119
alter what would normally happen to us

5930
03:24:44,318 --> 03:24:48,639
so we can remove some of the selection

5931
03:24:47,120 --> 03:24:50,239
pressure

5932
03:24:48,639 --> 03:24:53,439
but i think everything else on the

5933
03:24:50,238 --> 03:24:55,359
planet just goes you know looks for food

5934
03:24:53,439 --> 03:24:57,520
and uh give a lot of offspring so you

5935
03:24:55,359 --> 03:24:59,520
can perpetuate it's just a natural

5936
03:24:57,520 --> 03:25:02,000
biological function yeah they're much

5937
03:24:59,520 --> 03:25:03,120
more directly concerned with survival i

5938
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:05,920
think sure humans are able to

5939
03:25:03,120 --> 03:25:08,560
contemplate their mortality we can like

5940
03:25:05,920 --> 03:25:10,960
see that even if we're okay today we're

5941
03:25:08,559 --> 03:25:12,959
eventually going to die and we're we

5942
03:25:10,959 --> 03:25:15,039
really don't like that

5943
03:25:12,959 --> 03:25:16,719
so we try to come up with ways to uh

5944
03:25:15,040 --> 03:25:18,319
push that deadline farther and farther

5945
03:25:16,719 --> 03:25:20,478
away well we have really

5946
03:25:18,318 --> 03:25:22,879
i mean we used to die in our 30s right

5947
03:25:20,478 --> 03:25:23,840
now it's 70s 80s well most of us used to

5948
03:25:22,879 --> 03:25:24,799
die

5949
03:25:23,840 --> 03:25:27,120
in our

5950
03:25:24,799 --> 03:25:29,039
in the first few weeks that's true

5951
03:25:27,120 --> 03:25:30,000
yeah infant death

5952
03:25:29,040 --> 03:25:32,080
i i

5953
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:34,159
always tell people the only thing that's

5954
03:25:32,079 --> 03:25:35,680
100 is death

5955
03:25:34,159 --> 03:25:36,799
that's the only thing in in the world

5956
03:25:35,680 --> 03:25:38,639
that's a hundred percent think about

5957
03:25:36,799 --> 03:25:40,639
your own mortality i never think about

5958
03:25:38,639 --> 03:25:42,879
it i'm just enjoying

5959
03:25:40,639 --> 03:25:46,159
day to day and i don't really you you

5960
03:25:42,879 --> 03:25:48,799
work on viruses you don't contemplate

5961
03:25:46,159 --> 03:25:51,200
your own mortality given the

5962
03:25:48,799 --> 03:25:53,358
the deadliness of the virus i i

5963
03:25:51,200 --> 03:25:55,760
around i never thought covert would kill

5964
03:25:53,359 --> 03:25:57,680
me no i never was afraid of that not at

5965
03:25:55,760 --> 03:26:00,000
all i um

5966
03:25:57,680 --> 03:26:02,159
i mostly feared for other people getting

5967
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:03,520
sick especially people who could die of

5968
03:26:02,159 --> 03:26:05,600
it i didn't want that to happen to them

5969
03:26:03,520 --> 03:26:09,040
but i always thought that

5970
03:26:05,600 --> 03:26:11,680
it's obviously not a realistic

5971
03:26:09,040 --> 03:26:13,760
viewpoint not to be worried

5972
03:26:11,680 --> 03:26:17,040
because many people are

5973
03:26:13,760 --> 03:26:18,719
but i've been relatively healthy

5974
03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:20,560
they should sequence my genome because

5975
03:26:18,719 --> 03:26:22,318
it works really well and have a good

5976
03:26:20,559 --> 03:26:24,559
immune system maybe you'd be the first

5977
03:26:22,318 --> 03:26:27,039
immortal person i don't think that's got

5978
03:26:24,559 --> 03:26:30,159
to be at first so i don't think so

5979
03:26:27,040 --> 03:26:31,760
i think that uh biologically you just

5980
03:26:30,159 --> 03:26:33,439
can't you know the ends of our

5981
03:26:31,760 --> 03:26:35,680
chromosomes keep getting shorter and

5982
03:26:33,439 --> 03:26:36,479
shorter and that's eventually what kills

5983
03:26:35,680 --> 03:26:39,600
us

5984
03:26:36,478 --> 03:26:42,159
um so you just can't keep going on

5985
03:26:39,600 --> 03:26:43,920
but um that's fine i i don't need to

5986
03:26:42,159 --> 03:26:47,279
i understand from the vampires that it's

5987
03:26:43,920 --> 03:26:49,600
not good to live forever

5988
03:26:47,279 --> 03:26:52,238
i guess make the most of the of the time

5989
03:26:49,600 --> 03:26:54,159
you got that's the uh bacteria live a

5990
03:26:52,238 --> 03:26:56,799
much shorter time so we got that on

5991
03:26:54,159 --> 03:26:57,600
bacteria bacteria are

5992
03:26:56,799 --> 03:26:59,358
just

5993
03:26:57,600 --> 03:27:01,840
you know little bags of chemicals that

5994
03:26:59,359 --> 03:27:03,840
that split so they have no

5995
03:27:01,840 --> 03:27:05,600
they have no

5996
03:27:03,840 --> 03:27:07,279
stake in the matter at all it doesn't

5997
03:27:05,600 --> 03:27:10,880
doesn't bother and i think you have to

5998
03:27:07,279 --> 03:27:13,439
go a long ways before you get into some

5999
03:27:10,879 --> 03:27:15,438
kind of consciousness but it's weird

6000
03:27:13,439 --> 03:27:17,920
that this bag of chemicals

6001
03:27:15,439 --> 03:27:19,120
has a stake in the matter like our human

6002
03:27:17,920 --> 03:27:21,520
body

6003
03:27:19,120 --> 03:27:23,040
is uh consciousness is a weird thing not

6004
03:27:21,520 --> 03:27:25,040
just in us but they make half of the

6005
03:27:23,040 --> 03:27:27,040
oxygen on the planet 20 of the oxygen

6006
03:27:25,040 --> 03:27:29,600
comes from bacteria

6007
03:27:27,040 --> 03:27:32,640
um and they made in the beginning of

6008
03:27:29,600 --> 03:27:35,439
earth they made enough oxygen to start

6009
03:27:32,639 --> 03:27:36,879
oxygenation going life going i mean it's

6010
03:27:35,439 --> 03:27:39,920
they have an incredible role it's all an

6011
03:27:36,879 --> 03:27:39,920
accident just happened

6012
03:27:40,840 --> 03:27:46,079

um and thank you for everything you do

6018
03:27:52,879 --> 03:27:56,478
in terms of educating about viruses

6019
03:27:54,799 --> 03:27:58,478
about biology microbiology and

6020
03:27:56,478 --> 03:28:00,478
everything else i can't wait everybody

6021
03:27:58,478 --> 03:28:02,959

and now let me leave you with some words

6030
03:28:18,639 --> 03:28:23,199
from isaac asimov

6031
03:28:20,879 --> 03:28:25,920
the saddest aspect of life right now is

6032
03:28:23,200 --> 03:28:28,640
that science gathers knowledge faster

6033
03:28:25,920 --> 03:28:30,238
than society gathers wisdom

6034
03:28:28,639 --> 03:28:33,959
thank you for listening and hope to see

6035
03:28:30,238 --> 03:28:33,959
