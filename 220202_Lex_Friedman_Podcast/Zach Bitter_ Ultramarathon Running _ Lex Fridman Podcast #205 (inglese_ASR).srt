many of the things

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,960
zack has done in the past this is a big

12
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,759
fascinating challenge

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,039
quick mention of our sponsors ladder

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,519

16
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:32,879
the description

17
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,079
to support this podcast as a side note

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,000
let me say that zach

19
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,759
has been advising and coaching me on my

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,759
own running journey

21
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,199
i want to mention that zach sent me some

22
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,039
running shoes from ultra

23
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,280
which i think is a company that sponsors

24
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,439
him when i put those shoes on

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,439
i feel like zack is watching me and i

26
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,399
get that extra motivation to make him

27
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,799
proud

28
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
and by that i mean i want to put a lot

29
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,000
of miles on those shoes

30
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,159
running is something that has always

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,719
been difficult for me but i love it

32
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,919
because it is difficult the hardest part

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,118
is i'm left alone

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,118
with my thoughts for one or two hours

35
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,560
some thoughts are dark like thinking

36
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,959
about mortality

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,400
my own and that of others some are

38
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,798
self-critical like

39
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,840
personal weaknesses or dreams not

40
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,320
realized

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,359
some are simply human feelings of

42
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,118
loneliness

43
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:25,118
personal and existential and yet

44
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,400
there are the moments during a run when

45
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,640
all that fades

46
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,240
and i'm left empty of negative thoughts

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,879
and full of appreciation

48
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,759
for the beauty of experience of nature

49
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,319
life

50
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,519
the whole thing this is why i return to

51
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,158
running

52
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,920
not to get in shape but to face myself

53
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,600
and to run through it

54
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,118
that's why i'm inspired by people like

55
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,919
zac and

56
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,519
by david goggins and others like them

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
who seek to find the limits of their

58
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,039
body

59
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,600
and mind this is the lex friedman

60
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,200
podcast and here is my conversation

61
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,239
with zach bitter where does your mind go

62
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,960
when you're running

63
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,920
an ultra marathon are there a lot of

64
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,640
positive thoughts

65
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,200
negative thoughts demons inspirational

66
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,280
things

67
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,120
maybe no thoughts at all yeah that's the

68
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,239
really interesting part of the sport i

69
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,759
think because you can

70
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,878
essentially what it is when we're

71
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,639
looking at like the hundred mile

72
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:17,759
distance or anything that's like all day

73
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,159
long

74
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,840
is you're gonna have the full range of

75
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,079
the full spectrum of emotions

76
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
of mental processes both kind of

77
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,440
positive negative and in between so it

78
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,439
almost feels like

79
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,400
you've lived multiple multiple lives or

80
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,318
a full life maybe

81
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
as it was way to say it in that one time

82
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,318
period so it's like a it's almost like a

83
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,439
simulation of what you may experience in

84
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:40,878
a long period of time in a very

85
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,878
condensed period of time

86
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,399
and i think that's just a weird mental

87
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,518
process to reflect upon and that's what

88
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,400
kind of draws people

89
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,120
back to it but i mean it's a battle too

90
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
because

91
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,759
if you're looking at it from a

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,560
performance standpoint versus an

93
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,759
experience

94
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
you obviously want to minimize the

95
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,840
negative mindset stuff you want to try

96
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,439
to keep those emotions and those

97
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,080
thought processes at a low and i think

98
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,079
when you can keep yourself from letting

99
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,719
those thoughts creep in

100
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
they you end up having better races and

101
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,800
it's it can spiral in either direction

102
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,639
like

103
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,120
i notice like there's there's kind of

104
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,399
like this scenario that occurs where

105
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,840
in the beginning like a negative thing

106
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
creeps in your mind it's like super easy

107
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,640
just to slap it down

108
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,840
say like get out of here uh you know

109
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,439
i've did the training i'm fit

110
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,878
i'm feeling fresh still you know

111
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,079
everything's going well at this point in

112
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,399
time

113
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,920
you get a little further along in the

114
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,120
race and you're starting to feel a bit

115
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,878
of the fatigue

116
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,400
i mean a little bit of self-doubt creeps

117
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,759
in you start asking yourself well you

118
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
know maybe i should done one more long

119
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,318
run or

120
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,400
did i did i not quite taper long enough

121
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,598
and those things can kind of spiral into

122
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,319
a negative way and if

123
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,280
if you let it keep going it keeps going

124
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,560
all the way to

125
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,000
like why am i here why am i doing this

126
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,280
this is stupid all the way to like

127
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,560
there's another one of these two weeks

128
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,919
from now i'm gonna drop out of this one

129
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
and sign up for that one instead and

130
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,000
then you just find yourself in the exact

131
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,959
same situation

132
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,400
so you kind of have to go through the

133
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,959
process i think

134
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,080
it's why i think the there's kind of a i

135
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,560
won't say it's a rule of thumb

136
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,640
necessarily but something i think is

137
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,640
fairly valuable is if you do a hundred

138
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,958
miler the first time

139
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,159
make sure you get it done even if it

140
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,839
means like

141
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,359
you know death marching is what they'll

142
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,959
call it in the alternate community the

143
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,560
end of the race

144
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,079
just to say like you got that full

145
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,000
experience you experienced the highs the

146
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,519
lows the full thing the starting

147
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,959
the crossing the finish line that

148
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,399
release of emotion when you're done and

149
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,799
all that stuff

150
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,799
uh so that when you go back to do it

151
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,720
again you have like a template to build

152
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
off of then you know

153
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,680
or you just have some data to pull from

154
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,639
about how your mind's gonna work as well

155
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
as your body so

156
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,600
that you can start practicing well what

157
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,680
do i have to do to kind of keep my mind

158
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
from spiraling in a negative direction

159
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,199
or how do i

160
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,400
catch some positive momentum and kind of

161
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,840
keep sending it that way

162
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,599
and things like that and that that just

163
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,758
i think you just

164
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,000
add to that over a career of running

165
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,680
them or a series of running them and

166
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,279
it would it's it sharpens it's kind of

167
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,478
like any sport with that where

168
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,799
you know you always have this balance

169
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,639
between the youthfulness that you may

170
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,000
have earlier in your career versus the

171
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,759
the wise intelligence that you have

172
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
maybe near the end of your career

173
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,520
so in terms of wisdom is there

174
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,160
mechanisms by which

175
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,680
you kind of observe the negative

176
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,560
thoughts and let them go

177
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
so you have people like the david

178
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
goggins

179
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,038
who kind of they he seems to almost like

180
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,319
separate his mind

181
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:31,120
into there's the weak

182
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,599
david that he hates and then there's a

183
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,680
strong

184
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
strong one i mean there's like a very

185
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,639
contentious relationship there

186
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,478
so he basically says like i refuse to be

187
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,360
that person and he's almost like angry

188
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:42,959
at that person

189
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,038
it's almost like sometimes literally

190
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,159
yelling at that person the weak version

191
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,000
of themselves

192
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
and then there's another more sort of

193
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,800
sam heresy approach

194
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,478
which is like just observe the thought

195
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,319
and let it go

196
00:05:54,478 --> 00:06:01,279
maybe knowing that this too shall pass

197
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,800
like no matter what it this moment will

198
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,318
not last forever and kind of sort of

199
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,038
accepting the natural flow of things and

200
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,000
taking one

201
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,360
step at a time and allowing whatever the

202
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,319
negativity whatever the pain you're

203
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,038
experiencing

204
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,160
just to pass even if it means a death

205
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,759
march

206
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,840
which one is more effective for you

207
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,520
which one like would you say generally

208
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,638
speaking to the population is more

209
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,799
effective

210
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,960
yeah that's a really good question it it

211
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,919
it's probably unique to the individual i

212
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,638
wouldn't argue that

213
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,879
you know david is finding success with

214
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,960
his approach

215
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,560
some may argue it's an extreme version

216
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,318
uh you know sam has obviously thought

217
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,038
about these things and

218
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,960
and uh really probably you know i see

219
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,318
those guys as kind of

220
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,560
two ends of the spectrum and just the

221
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,479
way that they kind of come across

222
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,079
in general where like david's like

223
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,478
really at you kind of high energy

224
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,199
and sam's kind of this calming soft

225
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,038
presence

226
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,720
and he's just gonna slowly methodically

227
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,879
lay it all out there

228
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,759
and i think there's value on in both of

229
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,279
those i think

230
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,038
most people are probably gonna get a

231
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,119
benefit from

232
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,240
pulling some from each i mean there's

233
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
times where

234
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,079
where i need a kick in the ass and then

235
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,598
it's like have the strong zack tell the

236
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,839
weak zac to get moving

237
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,038
but there's also times where you know

238
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,439
it's just like you know

239
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,800
a subtle voice entering my head about

240
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,478
you know i don't know if i feel quite

241
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,960
right now should i

242
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,758
maybe pull back on the pace and i think

243
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,079
that

244
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,840
little subtle voice is best approached

245
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,560
with a subtle positive voice where it's

246
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,079
more like

247
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,319
okay well let's think this through here

248
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,120
for a second you're 40 miles into 100

249
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,919
mile race

250
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,478
you spent four months preparing for it

251
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:35,918
uh

252
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,240
you know from the workouts you did that

253
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:41,279
you're ready for this there really isn't

254
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,000
any real reason for you to slow down

255
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,559
or to fall off your goal your pace or

256
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,879
you know

257
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,280
reassess what you're doing let's just

258
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,360
give this another mile or two

259
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,198
and then we can reassess if we need to

260
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,120
in in order to kind of figure out if i'm

261
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,000
doing the right things or not

262
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,360
and i think like in that situation um

263
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,879
you definitely probably want to lean

264
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
more towards the sam harris approach

265
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,800
with that because there's really no

266
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,318
reason to

267
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,000
it's almost like the same thing you see

268
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,319
with like just

269
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,240
training and even nutrition to a degree

270
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,039
where like some folks they just want to

271
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,280
be like

272
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,519
kind of like drilled they want to be

273
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,959
like yelled at and said like get going

274
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,159
get doing this and that helps and that

275
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,120
motivates and that helps them stay

276
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,520
accountable

277
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,720
other people need some softer love with

278
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,318
it where it's like

279
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,240
you know this isn't necessarily your

280
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,319
thought your your fault you were put in

281
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,439
this environment that kind of created an

282
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,120
atmosphere of

283
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,120
lethargy and maybe poor nutritional

284
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,080
choices and things like that and

285
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,639
and like so but it's it's correctable so

286
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,560
we need to

287
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,838
we need to step away from that and we

288
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,119
need to kind of start heading in the

289
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,159
direction that we know is going to bear

290
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,158
fruit down the road

291
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,439
and that person may respond better to

292
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,759
that so

293
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,720
i think both those guys have great value

294
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,000
with their approaches they're just

295
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,360
probably polar ends of that of the

296
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,879
spectrum and

297
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
i think most people are probably going

298
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,159
to benefit like anything right you get

299
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,759
the polarizing ones and those are going

300
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,958
to work right for the polarizing people

301
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,559
but then most people are going to fit

302
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,000
somewhere in the middle so

303
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,278
they're probably going to be able to

304
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,559
kind of pull from both of those if

305
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:04,958
they're able to sit down and kind of

306
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,479
like

307
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,000
assess which one's going to work better

308
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,159
in which situation so the

309
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,799
quitting thing you mentioned the like

310
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,958
the final stage which actually i get to

311
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,719
much quicker than you seem to which is

312
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,919
like why am i doing this

313
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,120
i get there with basically anything i do

314
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,559
it's like this is uh this is probably

315
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,000
the stupidest thing i've ever done is

316
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,599
the feeling i get often

317
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,360
and then immediately you have these

318
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,879
excuses they're like

319
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,959
there's all these other better things

320
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,200
you should be doing

321
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,399
or uh or the other alternative that like

322
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,640
you said

323
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,879
i'm not prepared enough for this moment

324
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,000
i'll be much more prepared in two weeks

325
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,639
for the next event so like why let's try

326
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,480
this again

327
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,919
let's start over let's start over in two

328
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,600
weeks how do you deal with that quit

329
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:54,000
like uh so

330
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,639
maybe do you still go through that

331
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
process

332
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,559
and by way of advice for people that are

333
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
more sort of

334
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,119
amateurish like me uh how to deal with

335
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,879
that quitting boys

336
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,039
i think a lot of times when the quitting

337
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,679
voice kind of comes in

338
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,319
it what it does is it kind of just it

339
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,679
comes in

340
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,278
with the added disadvantage i guess

341
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,120
in this situation of being kind of a

342
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,240
narrow scoped view where you're looking

343
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,360
at like

344
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,720
uh what it's doing to you in the moment

345
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,959
or how you're feeling in the moment

346
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,639
versus how are you feeling about the

347
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,000
whole process

348
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,159
so one thing that i started doing in

349
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,919
2019

350
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,679
and i think i don't think it's

351
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,479
necessarily

352
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,919
uh i think i think i think this was a

353
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,320
big reason why i had one of my best

354
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:43,120
racing seasons in 2019 that i had

355
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,399
to that date uh it was part of it was i

356
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,919
started i think

357
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,600
putting a little more emphasis on the

358
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,759
big picture versus

359
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,440
putting emphasis on like this is one

360
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,480
opportunity or one day

361
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,440
of work uh and this is one

362
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,759
one emotional kind of flare-up but how

363
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,480
does that actually relate to my general

364
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,200
broader picture so when i decide to do a

365
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,959
race

366
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
or an event or something like that it's

367
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,958
often four or six months out

368
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,440
ahead of time you're planning to like

369
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,719
kind of do a series of workouts and a

370
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,920
flow of things where you're going

371
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,120
through the process of getting fit

372
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,360
getting ready preparing for the

373
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,959
specifics of the day and all that stuff

374
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,560
and then you get to the race itself for

375
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,759
the event itself and

376
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,599
it's very easy to look at that and think

377
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,439
that's in isolation like i'm going to

378
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,720
run 12 hours today or i'm going to run

379
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,519
100 miles today or whatever it ends up

380
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,200
being

381
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,919
and it's a lot easier to quit when

382
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,360
you think to yourself i'm 40 miles into

383
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:40,000
100 mile race

384
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,039
you know that's just a 40 mile run which

385
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,200
sounds kind of silly

386
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:44,399
to most people but in perspective when

387
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,519
we're talking about the ultra marathon

388
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,879
running community

389
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,399
you know it's a lot easier just to say

390
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,439
like well you know i'll scrap this 40

391
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,639
miles and try again

392
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,800
it's a lot harder to say i'm gonna scrap

393
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,799
the entire last four months the entire

394
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,399
reason why i was doing it the countless

395
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,159
hours i spent in there

396
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,320
so i think i just try to reposition it

397
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,078
of like i'm in a bad place right now

398
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,600
maybe in my head or i'm not i'm hitting

399
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,958
a low point here

400
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,560
but i'm 99 of the way towards the goal i

401
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,799
set out four months ago when i add in

402
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,278
all the work i did leading up to that

403
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,559
so i think it's important to ask

404
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,559
yourself why

405
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,838
because i mean there are times when

406
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,039
you're doing something and you ask

407
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,920
yourself why you don't have a good

408
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,399
reason

409
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,360
and then maybe it is advantageous to

410
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,039
step back and

411
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,480
and really reflect on that and decide is

412
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,319
this something i actually want to invest

413
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,959
time and energy into because

414
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,000
you know someone like yourself who is

415
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,078
very much

416
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,320
into a variety of different things it

417
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,879
can be easy probably to

418
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,399
overextend and get i mean i'm a very

419
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,000
curious person so there's like

420
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,600
100 things i would love to do if i

421
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,039
wasn't doing what i'm doing yeah and i

422
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,600
know how to enjoy all of them

423
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,039
so at a certain point though you have to

424
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,120
say okay which one is gonna

425
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,639
be the most meaningful for me and if the

426
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,159
answer keeps coming back to saying i

427
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,839
guess this is still the most meaningful

428
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,600
to me out of that hundred things that i

429
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,600
could otherwise be doing

430
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,879
then then i know that i'm in the in it

431
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,040
for the right reason then i just need to

432
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,120
identify some other things like well

433
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,240
why did this one take the top spot out

434
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,360
of the hundred things that i could have

435
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,919
picked from

436
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,278
and keeping like a list of those in your

437
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,319
head so that when you get to that point

438
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,720
where you start

439
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,320
saying why am i doing this why am i here

440
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,120
you just have those kind of ready loaded

441
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,879
in your head to say

442
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,320
well i already took inventory on that

443
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,519
before i started this and i knew this

444
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,720
voice is going to come at some point

445
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,039
whether it's early

446
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,320
middle or late and and then you just

447
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,519
remind yourself kind of what you're

448
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
thinking when you had a little more of a

449
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,600
level head

450
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,040
well there's something about the thing

451
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,560
you mentioned when you mention the death

452
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,838
march it seems

453
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:40,958
extremely valuable to just never

454
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,079
quitting like in the moment if you

455
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:46,638
decide to do something

456
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,078
like never quitting even if it you do go

457
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,720
through the process and realize that

458
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,120
it's not

459
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,199
uh it's not the wisest thing to be doing

460
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,519
within the full context of your life

461
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,519
like once you decide to do it it seems

462
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,159
like never quitting

463
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,959
prevents you from sort of having that

464
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:04,159
escape

465
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,000
clause from other things in your life so

466
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,480
i've i've quit on a few things in my

467
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,519
life and

468
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,800
i think i still i deeply regret that

469
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,639
because it opened that door

470
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,639
it's almost like a muscle i don't know

471
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,278
so i

472
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,680
i think i'm i don't maybe everyone is

473
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:25,039
but i think i'm kind of a quitter

474
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,278
you know what i mean like um like i'm

475
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,559
really good at coming up with reasons to

476
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,600
quit

477
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,838
my mind is really good at that and i

478
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,399
it feels like i have to come up with uh

479
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,199
like really work hard to make sure

480
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,039
that there's no quit that never allow

481
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,240
myself to quit no matter how stupid the

482
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:43,679
thing i'm doing is

483
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,680
i don't know if any of that makes sense

484
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,000
but it just

485
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,198
maybe to rephrase this whole thing do

486
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,198
you think

487
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,838
is good to live life by the ethos of

488
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,439
never quit yeah that's a really

489
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,079
interesting thing and i think it

490
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,760
actually resonates with a lot of ultra

491
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:02,479
marathon runners because there seems to

492
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,519
be

493
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,519
a trend when you have someone who's been

494
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,120
in the sport for a long time where

495
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,639
there's a point where they start the

496
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,159
sport right and they're like

497
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,680
super excited about everything

498
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,439
everything's new uh

499
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,479
it's very easy not to quit because

500
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
you're like oh this is the first time

501
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,440
i've ever run a 50 case the first time

502
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:20,799
i've ever run a 50 miles the first time

503
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
ever in 100k it's the first time i've

504
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,319
ever

505
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,919
100 miles and so on and so forth and

506
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,160
when you're doing that for the first

507
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,240
time i think there's a heightened

508
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,360
uh motivation to not quit because you

509
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,959
don't want your first attempt to be a

510
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,720
failure

511
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:38,479
and then you get a little further along

512
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,160
and you start reflecting on the

513
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,440
landscape and all the opportunities that

514
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,120
are out there and you find yourself

515
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,160
quitting on an event

516
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,639
and there does seem to be a trend where

517
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,278
once you do that once now all of a

518
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,000
sudden

519
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,278
like you you described perfectly that

520
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,320
quit

521
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,000
pops up in your head maybe a little

522
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,519
sooner the next time yeah or maybe a

523
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,360
little bit before and i've certainly had

524
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,078
these experiences in my career as well

525
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
and

526
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,198
what happens i think if you stick with

527
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,680
it

528
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,039
um again i think it is important to

529
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:08,159
assess whether you really want to be

530
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,319
doing what you're doing

531
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,759
but if you start recognizing that about

532
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
yourself in a certain activity where

533
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,360
it's like

534
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,600
i think i might be pulling the plug

535
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,800
early on some of this stuff uh

536
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,360
i think you just need to kind of get

537
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,719
into a position where you just

538
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
at that point you need to make a

539
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,440
decision do i want to keep doing this if

540
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,278
the answer is yes

541
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,199
you hold yourself accountable to not

542
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,879
quitting and eventually what will happen

543
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:29,439
is you'll find yourself in a position

544
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,799
where

545
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,000
i'll use ultra marathons for example

546
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,599
where you're just clicking on all

547
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
cylinders for that day

548
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,120
and you still get those scenarios where

549
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,039
doubt creeps in your mind

550
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,639
you have these low points but for

551
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,599
whatever reason when those low points

552
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,720
come

553
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,399
you're able to push through them better

554
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,480
than you would have in the past and then

555
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,600
you push through maybe two or three more

556
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,240
than you did

557
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,519
after you had quit the time before then

558
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,120
it's accountability time

559
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,560
right because then you have to look back

560
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,519
at that and say

561
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,198
well why did this time was i able to be

562
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,679
mentally more strong

563
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,000
and kind of push through those those

564
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,438
those extra opportunities to quit when i

565
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,838
wasn't before

566
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,959
and it can be easy to look back and say

567
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,599
and live kind of like

568
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,120
retroactively in the sense where you're

569
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,558
like regretting well why did i drop out

570
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,479
of those races why did i do this

571
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:17,519
wrong there and and that i just think

572
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,038
that's where you have to kind of catch

573
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,199
yourself and say no those opera

574
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,720
those things happen to me in order to

575
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,318
put me in a position where i decided

576
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,120
well this time i'm not gonna quit

577
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,519
no matter what minus my leg falling off

578
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,159
uh

579
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,599
like i'm not gonna quit and then you put

580
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,038
yourself in position to have that day

581
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:34,159
where you push through more times than

582
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,000
you ever have before and you just

583
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,360
redefine what you're capable of

584
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,759
and then once i think you do that you

585
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,479
start looking at those earlier lessons

586
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,879
as

587
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,919
as lessons you know were they failures

588
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,960
on paper at the time

589
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,640
probably but can you pull things from

590
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,480
them to learn as to like well where is

591
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,919
your actual threshold where is the limit

592
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,440
actually for you

593
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,679
and then kind of start redefining that

594
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,640
stuff um

595
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,000
so i think like the never quit mentality

596
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,759
can be good

597
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,679
in certain situations but i don't think

598
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,160
it's necessarily like a

599
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,440
like a holistic thing where you need to

600
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,960
be in something where it's

601
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,720
never quit always do more because then

602
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,400
you end up in a situation where you find

603
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,600
this like margin of diminishing returns

604
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
especially when it comes to training and

605
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,759
workouts and things like that where

606
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,879
there are times where often there are

607
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,400
times where you want to

608
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,000
actually quit a little bit before you

609
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,960
would have to because the stress that

610
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,079
was required to elicit a growth response

611
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,519
has already occurred and

612
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,038
just to do more is just gonna require

613
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,519
more recovery time to get back and do it

614
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:31,839
again

615
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,200
yeah this is the tricky trade-off living

616
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,879
by the

617
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,558
never quit mentality you're not going to

618
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,380
achieve optimal performance

619
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,160
in your head you might

620
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,360
[Laughter]

621
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,160
it seems like when you look at the full

622
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:49,759
arc of human history

623
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,480
the people who do great things

624
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,798
are more leaning tones than never quit

625
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,759
like

626
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,000
uh i feel like at any one moment you're

627
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,679
more

628
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,759
in danger of quitting than you are of

629
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,120
being suboptimal

630
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,919
so like in terms of advice it just feels

631
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,959
like

632
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,559
never quitting is always the right

633
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,798
advice

634
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:13,200
unless you deeply know the person maybe

635
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,038
this is like wrestling mentality

636
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,400
i've seen too many and because i'm

637
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,798
annoyed with the current culture

638
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,320
telling me to relax and and have a

639
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:22,160
work-life balance and all those kinds of

640
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,519
things

641
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,160
uh we should all have a deep deep truth

642
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,839
to them

643
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,759
but the reality is like there's not

644
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,079
enough people

645
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,640
that walk up to me and like slap me and

646
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:37,599
say get your together

647
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,120
like don't quit work harder i think we

648
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:42,240
need to hear that more

649
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:45,279
i and like i remember that um

650
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,279
from the wrestling rooms like that

651
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,200
when you're pushed that way when you're

652
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:49,918
forced to the very limit and you don't

653
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,240
quit

654
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,600
that makes better humans i think people

655
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,240
need to get that

656
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,918
in their life i think they need to have

657
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,679
situations where

658
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,840
that becomes kind of the reality for

659
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,400
them so they can see that avenue

660
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,519
experience that avenue um where i think

661
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,759
it's maybe

662
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,200
to the extreme is if it becomes like

663
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,919
your entire

664
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,200
life philosophy where like every little

665
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,320
thing you do is never quit

666
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,400
but life is short zach like why

667
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,000
i mean this is the problem i have this

668
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,679
is probably the programming thing too

669
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,079
is over optimization is dangerous

670
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,120
uh it's like every once in a while i

671
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,038
mean you're

672
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,959
you do this kind of stuff you're not for

673
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,558
example with a hundred mile run you're

674
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,240
i mean you could just be doing that for

675
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:34,558
the rest of your life and do like the

676
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,359
most

677
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,279
optimal 100 mile run ever but you keep

678
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,519
taking on like new challenges

679
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,319
and there's a lot more chaos than that

680
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,480
and there

681
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,918
it feels like the muscle of never quit

682
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,679
will be much more important than the

683
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,759
optimality of your training

684
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,720
yeah so there's probably a couple sides

685
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,359
to me

686
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,759
with that kind of a thing where for one

687
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,558
i think

688
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,240
when we talk about the why so like i

689
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,399
think the why

690
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,558
can kind of shift a bit and it probably

691
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,798
will if you do something long enough

692
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,240
or evolve maybe is a better way to call

693
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,918
to put it and for me

694
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,359
like one of my big drives and one of my

695
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,799
big passions within

696
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,519
ultra running is to first of all find an

697
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:17,200
event that i

698
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,720
really really love to train for and

699
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,880
participate in so for me i feel like

700
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,120
i've kind of identified that to a degree

701
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,919
and that's kind of runnable 100 milers

702
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,798
so

703
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,240
once i found that it became more of a

704
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,200
driver for me to see

705
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,640
like well how fast can i run 100 miles

706
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,519
in a very controlled environment so

707
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,759
let's eliminate

708
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,639
weather let's eliminate you know

709
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,879
elevation

710
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,120
let's eliminate like having to wait

711
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,080
extra long to get crew or support

712
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,000
and that sort of thing and that's how

713
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,599
you find yourself on a 400 meter track

714
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,599
running 100 miles

715
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,639
but for me like the important part of

716
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,079
that is that

717
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,520
i can control the environment enough

718
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:56,319
where if i come back year after year

719
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,158
i can re-test myself and have a decent

720
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,839
ability to kind of say i improved or i

721
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,840
regressed or i stayed stagnant and i

722
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,000
think that's a big driver for me

723
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,879
um but one thing i've recognized within

724
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,839
that

725
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,120
is if you just keep doing that like if i

726
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,439
could probably pick

727
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,319
three flat runnable hundred milers a

728
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,200
year

729
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,079
and optimally prepare race recover and

730
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,960
repeat

731
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,759
without like burning myself out but one

732
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,360
thing i think i

733
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,440
learned also in 2019 was uh

734
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,479
that sometimes you kind of need to step

735
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,200
away from

736
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,919
some of these really really kind of

737
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,640
important

738
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,840
markers in your like your performance or

739
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,880
in whatever you're trying to do and take

740
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,519
a step away from it and try

741
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,280
do something a little different uh in

742
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:40,158
order to kind of hit the reset button on

743
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,480
just like

744
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,480
what i would call just like your mental

745
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,839
energy to be able to continue to do it

746
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,400
at a high level

747
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,759
so almost like happiness exactly well

748
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,960
and here's the example like i mean i

749
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,720
love running in trails too

750
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,480
most people would consider me a flat

751
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,798
road track runner runnable

752
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,000
ultra runner um but i like to do trailer

753
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,200
runs too so in

754
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,359
at the end of 2018 i

755
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,880
recognized that i had been kind of

756
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,798
pushing

757
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,000
the gas pedal on trying to run fast

758
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:09,679
hundred milers

759
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,759
for quite a while without really a break

760
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,440
in that where it was like okay i did one

761
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,038
now i'm gonna you know take a brief

762
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,480
offseason but then i'm gonna ultimately

763
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,158
build up in peak for another one i might

764
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,038
introduce some fun trail races in the

765
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,240
context

766
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:21,759
but they're gonna be b races they're

767
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,200
gonna be training races time on feet

768
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,519
type of stuff that are gonna kind of

769
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,679
mimic like a long run essentially

770
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,960
and uh but the main focus the always in

771
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,960
the back of my mind was like

772
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,640
getting on the track and seeing how much

773
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,120
faster i can 100 miles and that just

774
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,600
kind of

775
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,879
that energy that it takes to continually

776
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:38,879
think by that that

777
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,278
i think the motivation to keep that

778
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,640
stoke high enough to really meet your

779
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,159
full potential

780
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,159
fades if you don't step away from it for

781
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,320
a little bit so i took

782
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,840
essentially half a year away from

783
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,359
runnable stuff and just decided i'm

784
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,158
gonna prepare for the san diego hundred

785
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:55,599
mile

786
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,000
which is like a much more elevation

787
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,359
uh technical trail type of an event

788
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,319
isn't that trail run or no

789
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,319
yeah it's a trail hundred miler uh

790
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,599
actually just talking just outside of uh

791
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,359
uh san diego and yeah it goes through

792
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,278
it goes over part of the pacific crest

793
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,199
trail and stuff so it's very different

794
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,759
than running on a runnable surface so

795
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,679
to give you some context like i ran was

796
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:18,000
it i think just under 17 hours for that

797
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,759
race

798
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,440
whereas on a flat surface i can run 11

799
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,400
hours and 19 minutes so

800
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,440
just the environment alone added an

801
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,480
extra

802
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,080
you know five plus hours to the day so

803
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,079
um it's just a different experience

804
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,960
different skill set and what it did is

805
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:37,439
it allowed me to kind of step away from

806
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,400
kind of focusing on like splits on a

807
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,120
track

808
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,480
uh running flat stuff like preparing for

809
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,678
things specifically for a flat

810
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,960
environment and start training for

811
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,798
something that's more

812
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,038
climbing into sending more technical

813
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:52,000
running skill sets and things like that

814
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,679
and the cool part about it was uh first

815
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,960
of all you know when you step away from

816
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,320
something and enter something a lot

817
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,000
different i mean it's still running

818
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,439
there's still a huge

819
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,480
advantage i had from the running i'd

820
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
done in the past that was going to put

821
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,679
me in a good position to be successful

822
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,440
but there was a much higher uh

823
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,720
or a much bigger range of potential

824
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,120
improvement for me

825
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,278
so through the like you know four plus

826
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,879
months i spent preparing for that race

827
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,319
you know i noticed oh wow i'm getting

828
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,000
faster on this climb

829
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,918
or i'm getting better at descending this

830
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,278
technical trail it's one of the most fun

831
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,600
races i've run actually so it was kind

832
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:26,079
of a cool experience i ended up

833
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,439
taking the lead at like 93 miles so

834
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,639
you're racing racing like you were

835
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,038
trying to get first

836
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,320
so still a race yeah so what was the

837
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:33,679
enjoyable aspect of it

838
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,759
i don't think i recognized it so much

839
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,798
while i was doing it actually it

840
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,158
surfaced afterwards

841
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:39,200
i mean the enjoyment of the race itself

842
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,480
is like when you find yourself in a

843
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,159
position where you're sitting in

844
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,839
basically second place all day long and

845
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,480
then you take the lead at 90

846
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,278
i think it was like 91 or 92 miles nice

847
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,599
it's like

848
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,720
yeah that's kind of a cool way to race

849
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:52,480
um yeah

850
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,919
but afterwards i recognized a few things

851
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,278
just about kind of pacing

852
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,480
and you know how to maybe pace the first

853
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,278
half of a hundred miler

854
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,720
versus the second half i also recognized

855
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,119
shortly thereafter

856
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,640
uh once i finished recovered and decided

857
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:08,000
my next event was going to be a flat

858
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,960
runnable race

859
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,919
that wow i really was way more excited

860
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,840
to do the workouts

861
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,278
that i needed to do to get ready to run

862
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,319
a fast flat hundred miler

863
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,159
and i don't think that would have been

864
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,158
the case had i just tried to do another

865
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,559
flat fast hundred miler

866
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,000
earlier or during that year and end up

867
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,839
in a situation where like i

868
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,558
maybe had like normalized a sub-optimal

869
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,879
like uh outlook on like something that i

870
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,038
just done so many times already

871
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,720
and i recognized that just every workout

872
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,640
i did i was like i did this workout a

873
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,600
year ago and it was not nearly this much

874
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,440
fun

875
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,798
or you know you then the interesting

876
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,278
thing about these track hundreds too is

877
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:44,960
like

878
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,400
you find yourself doing like your

879
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,400
peaking phase where you're running your

880
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,000
long runs which for me are usually like

881
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,240
you know around 30 miles or so and i'll

882
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,558
do them on back to back days and you

883
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,159
know

884
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:55,440
i try to replicate the environment i'm

885
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,480
going to race on so i'm find myself on a

886
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,200
400 meter track

887
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,558
yeah and it's like when i started doing

888
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
that again i just felt like i was super

889
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:03,278
motivated to go out there saturday and

890
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:05,038
sunday and do those back-to-back long

891
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:06,159
runs and see the progress

892
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,319
and then head out again the next we can

893
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,919
do it again so i had some of my

894
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,359
more enjoyable long runs which are going

895
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,799
to be the most specific to race day

896
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,558
environment that i had

897
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,400
in quite some time and i think that was

898
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:17,678
really beneficial and kind of putting me

899
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,278
in the right spot to be able to push

900
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,720
through barriers on race day

901
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:22,558
and put me in a position where quitting

902
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,759
was going to be much less of a

903
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,440
likelihood

904
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,038
given the enjoyment i had in the months

905
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,159
leading into the race itself yeah even

906
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,359
the thought of quitting

907
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,960
yeah yeah so you mentioned the track

908
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,879
you've also ran 100 miles on the

909
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,600
treadmill and

910
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,000
the trail 100 mile broadly if we zoom

911
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,278
out

912
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,159
what does it take to run 100 miles

913
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:46,558
for for most of the world that seems

914
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,960
like a crazy distance to run

915
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,480
so maybe it's interesting to ask not

916
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,278
only is just setting the world record

917
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,480
but

918
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,558
purely running what does it take to run

919
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,558
that far yeah i mean i think people

920
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,720
probably overestimate what it takes

921
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,480
in terms of just getting it done i think

922
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,200
this is consistent

923
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,640
in just running in general i think the

924
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,720
marathon was always a big one with that

925
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,799
where people thought like well

926
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,319
you have to do this training or you just

927
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,158
literally won't physically be able to

928
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,720
complete a marathon and then we got into

929
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,320
an era of kind of like running as

930
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,839
more of an enjoyment thing versus a

931
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,720
performance thing and then you'd have

932
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:22,158
people running

933
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,079
granted much slower i think if you look

934
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,720
at the boston marathon average finishing

935
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,398
times it

936
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,440
goes from like or maybe it wasn't the

937
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:28,959
boston marathon it might have just been

938
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,720
marathons in general went from like

939
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,519
three hours to five hours or something

940
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,000
like that

941
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,200
so it's like people i think got past the

942
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,880
fact that

943
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,798
you can only do it if you're optimally

944
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,640
prepared to well i can do it and maybe

945
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:41,200
not meet my full potential if i'm gonna

946
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,200
like

947
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,720
not do much training which i wouldn't

948
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,960
necessarily advise but

949
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,798
uh i mean i've i've talked to people who

950
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,840
basically run 100 miles sometimes almost

951
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,240
off the couch and it's

952
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,678
like it's to me what that says is just

953
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,038
the human body is incredible

954
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,640
and what it can tolerate above and

955
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,480
beyond what it's been exposed to if it

956
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,720
has to or if it feels like it has to

957
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,679
so that's the basic sort of getting from

958
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,839
point a

959
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,759
from the start to the finish it's the

960
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,158
human body and the human mind is capable

961
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:11,200
of doing it without much preparation

962
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,360
but then you start to increase the

963
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
the goal of performance and you try to

964
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:16,798
get actually a good

965
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,919
like the most out of your body that you

966
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,158
can

967
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,919
how does that start to change then yeah

968
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,080
going from fun to performance

969
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,000
yeah i think uh once you start putting

970
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,439
marks or goals on outside of just

971
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,798
finishing that's where it starts getting

972
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,798
interesting because now you can maybe go

973
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:31,759
in with multiple goals where like if one

974
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:33,200
falls off

975
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,038
due to something that you didn't expect

976
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,720
then you have another one to target but

977
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,000
you can always build those up and try to

978
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,360
think like well i want to run faster

979
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,679
than last time or i want to

980
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,839
you know break a course record or an age

981
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,960
group record or something like that

982
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,319
and that that i think is just going to

983
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,000
be a little bit of a different mindset

984
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,879
because now you're looking at

985
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,319
every little thing from what do i need

986
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,600
to do to prepare as well as what do i

987
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,158
need to do to be efficient on the day

988
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:58,319
itself

989
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,760
so like transitioning aid stations and

990
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,558
things like that or

991
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,278
uh do i want a pacer or not or does this

992
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,918
race allow

993
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,200
someone to like hand me a bottle at a

994
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,960
certain spot or do i have to be in

995
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,600
specific areas to get that type of stuff

996
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,000
and

997
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,599
and what it ends up doing is it ends up

998
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,480
bringing a lot more variables to the

999
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,839
table

1000
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,679
and i think it's it's interesting

1001
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,558
because there's always going to be more

1002
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,919
variables

1003
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,798
on the day than you are able to account

1004
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,720
for

1005
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,079
so at a certain degree you have to kind

1006
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,839
of find yourself in a position where i'm

1007
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:28,480
gonna make sure i take care of the big

1008
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:30,079
ones

1009
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,079
or the ones that are like obviously i

1010
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,319
need to be ready for like my fueling

1011
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:35,439
strategy my hydration strategy my pacing

1012
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:36,558
strategy

1013
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,558
you know what workouts are going to put

1014
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:41,278
me in a position to physiologically

1015
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,480
have this process go as well as possible

1016
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,240
how am i going to like

1017
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,079
you know hold myself accountable in aid

1018
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,640
station transition so i'm not like

1019
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,639
having a ton of non-moving time uh

1020
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,200
versus moving time and that's so cool

1021
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,399
so there's these like big variables that

1022
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,480
you're aware of and you're trying to

1023
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,558
optimize over the space of variables

1024
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,000
so you get to start to play with that

1025
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,519
when you're looking for performance

1026
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,200
it's almost like moving from checkers to

1027
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,679
chess right you have like

1028
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,880
or maybe even like connect four or

1029
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,240
something like that

1030
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,840
where it goes from just kind of like

1031
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,960
well one foot in front of the other and

1032
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,240
when i get to the next stage station

1033
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,798
i'll just eat whatever looks good drink

1034
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,919
whatever

1035
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,398
you know quenches my thirst and then

1036
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,000
move on to the next one to like

1037
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:19,119
well which one of these food products is

1038
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,480
actually going to make me move a little

1039
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,119
faster the next aid station

1040
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,319
or you know which one of these pacing

1041
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:25,518
strategies is going to get me to the

1042
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,278
finish line

1043
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,558
faster than the other one and that sort

1044
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,200
of stuff so

1045
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,240
uh it gets more complicated more

1046
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,720
interesting

1047
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,679
and uh in my opinion anyway also there i

1048
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,798
mean but there's a breaking point with

1049
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,559
that too because

1050
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,720
like i said there's an endless number of

1051
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:42,398
variables you could account for

1052
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,240
and as a distance gets longer that list

1053
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,398
gets longer too so

1054
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,240
you find yourself in this position where

1055
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,518
where you have to at some point say okay

1056
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,120
i've accounted for everything i can

1057
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,880
reasonably account for

1058
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,639
now i need to be in a mental space where

1059
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,679
when something happens that i wasn't

1060
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,840
able to account for

1061
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,759
i'm able to respond to it with the right

1062
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,319
decision and keep going and not dwell on

1063
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,200
it

1064
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,398
because that's another thing i mean

1065
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,759
you're running slow enough when you're

1066
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:04,719
doing 100 miles where if you make a

1067
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,879
mistake

1068
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,720
you can sit there and just fixate on

1069
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,880
that mistake and say why did i do that

1070
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,159
that cost me 10 minutes blah blah blah

1071
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,760
when in reality what you need to do is

1072
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,120
that happened everyone else out here is

1073
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,599
gonna have a situation like that at some

1074
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,000
point

1075
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,678
mine happened now uh i need to figure

1076
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,319
out how i can move forward

1077
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,080
at the fastest sustainable pace and not

1078
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,200
think about what happened back there

1079
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,359
and that's where i think it gets really

1080
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,759
interesting what uh

1081
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,398
would you say it takes to set a world

1082
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,720
record

1083
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,319
in the hundred miler well first of all i

1084
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,519
think you probably have to focus

1085
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,359
on that specific event um i mean there's

1086
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,278
the interesting about ultra running

1087
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,479
where it maybe deviates a bit from just

1088
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,720
other endurance sports

1089
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,919
is there's such a wide range i mean we

1090
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,600
talked about a little bit when i talk

1091
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,679
with the san diego hundred versus

1092
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:52,240
kind of flat runnable stuff so can you

1093
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,600
maybe paint a picture of what are

1094
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,359
there's a huge range of different kinds

1095
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,879
of ultra marathon events

1096
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,479
what are like the big ones in your mind

1097
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,080
so marathon we know the distance from a

1098
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,720
marathon there's

1099
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:05,439
50k what are different kinds there's 100

1100
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,440
mile

1101
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,200
that in your mind like kind of these

1102
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,600
islands were

1103
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,399
where people gather often yep yeah so

1104
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:14,480
there's a few that

1105
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:16,398
really stand out i would say the three

1106
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,919
biggest ultra marathons right now

1107
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,759
even from a historic maybe not

1108
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,000
necessarily a historical standpoint but

1109
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:24,240
uh in modern day ultra running is going

1110
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,079
to be the western states 100

1111
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,640
that's the biggest most competitive 100

1112
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,720
miler it's on the trail side of things

1113
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,240
in the united states then there's ultra

1114
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,079
trail mount blanc which is probably the

1115
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,880
most competitive 100 miler on the planet

1116
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,558
right now

1117
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,080
in previous years it's been debatable as

1118
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:39,278
weather western states are ultra trauma

1119
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:40,000
and blacks more competitive i think in

1120
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:41,440
the most

1121
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,839
recent few years you're just seeing a

1122
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,679
lot more like of the bulk of

1123
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:47,519
international talent on the trail side

1124
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,759
of the sport heading over that way

1125
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,720
and then you have the road running side

1126
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:52,720
of things where

1127
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,480
the comrades marathon which is

1128
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,919
technically 56 miles but they call it

1129
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,079
the comrades marathon

1130
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,278
uh is gonna generally be the most

1131
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,359
competitive

1132
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,720
ultra marathon the the weird thing is

1133
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,038
the distance thing right because most

1134
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,919
people

1135
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:05,599
think of endurance sports they're

1136
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,519
thinking about precise distances like

1137
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,878
five kilometers 10 kilometers

1138
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,398
and all that stuff and then then you get

1139
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,000
into the ultra running world and it's

1140
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,598
like sometimes it's the event so like

1141
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,639
the western force itself is much more

1142
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,639
important than the distance

1143
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,320
right yeah so the western states 100 is

1144
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,919
actually 100.2 miles

1145
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,119
which isn't that big of a deviation when

1146
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,239
you think about it especially when you

1147
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,760
figure like tangents they're going to

1148
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,279
probably account for more than 0.2 miles

1149
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,599
on a 100 mile race

1150
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,399
but the ultra trail mount blanc you know

1151
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,838
that's

1152
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:31,759
listed as a 100 miler but it's actually

1153
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,480
i think like 100 and 405 miles

1154
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,079
so you know it's more there's different

1155
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,599
cultures too so the united states is

1156
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,519
definitely more

1157
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,879
motivated i think to try to get as close

1158
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,239
to the exact distance you're gonna hear

1159
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,519
maybe a little more grumbling if someone

1160
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,519
says i signed up for this hundred miler

1161
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,000
and it turned out to be 103 miles

1162
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,440
uh versus like over in europe they don't

1163
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,480
really care too much about the distance

1164
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,918
they're more interested in like a

1165
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,000
specific route or a loop

1166
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,440
is consistency important in terms of the

1167
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,199
exact length of the

1168
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,800
of the route so like you can compare

1169
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,799
performances from previous years

1170
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,640
or are they a little bit more flexible

1171
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,359
like they redefine the trail from year

1172
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,960
to year

1173
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,279
yeah i mean it's definitely hard to

1174
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,880
compare i mean there's events that

1175
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,760
um take for example i would say the best

1176
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,240
ultra marathoner in the world today on

1177
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,839
the men's side is jim walmsley uh the

1178
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,479
reason i think jim wells is the best is

1179
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,519
because he

1180
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,440
is the most versatile and not only the

1181
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,039
most versatile but he's

1182
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,880
arguably the best at almost everything

1183
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,800
up to 100 miles so

1184
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,320
there's a race called the angelus crest

1185
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,400
hunter miler they

1186
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,559
the the trail has drastically changed

1187
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,920
from when they originally had that event

1188
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:37,920
and it's a different time of year so

1189
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,079
it's much warmer on that course

1190
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,960
and jim's not the kind of guy who would

1191
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,200
uh

1192
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,720
sit back and say like i can't chase that

1193
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:46,159
record but i think angela crest when he

1194
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,439
looks at the segments and the pacing for

1195
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,279
that one he's like

1196
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,880
that one is maybe not even the same

1197
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,079
event anymore so you have that

1198
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,680
you have some that are a little more

1199
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,400
controlled and a little more kind of

1200
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,000
like

1201
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,680
preserved i guess you would say but i

1202
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,159
think it gets really rare on the trail

1203
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:59,598
side

1204
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:00,960
i mean comrades is going to be very

1205
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,400
comparable from one year to the next

1206
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,159
because that's a road race

1207
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,760
and that's where you get you maybe get

1208
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,399
like the split in the sport from people

1209
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
who really

1210
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,838
want that kind of like i want to compare

1211
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,320
myself to someone who ran this course in

1212
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:17,519
1970. versus like someone who just says

1213
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,200
i want to be competitive today and

1214
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,800
you know maybe the weather is going to

1215
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,399
be 30 degrees different from one year to

1216
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,440
the next on this course but if i beat

1217
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,119
everyone on this day then i'm the

1218
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,720
champion of that big name race like

1219
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,519
ultra trail montblanc or western states

1220
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,519
100 and

1221
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,199
my legacy will be cemented because i won

1222
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,719
that big race and it doesn't matter when

1223
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,838
or how the course was or what the time

1224
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,078
even was to some degree

1225
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,199
when you were optimizing for trying to

1226
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,000
set the world record

1227
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,439
in 100 miler were you doing like

1228
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,039
analysis

1229
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,320
of maybe like what were the variables

1230
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,960
you were looking at

1231
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,400
is it more in the realm of the actual

1232
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,000
race day

1233
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,160
the track what it looks like versus like

1234
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,119
the variables of the training leading up

1235
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,679
to the

1236
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,480
to the race i mean it evolved a bit like

1237
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:02,159
i think the

1238
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,599
as i learned more about just like what

1239
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,078
is required

1240
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,519
to kind of really do that stuff so

1241
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,160
there's some variables you can control

1242
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,599
for

1243
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,598
you know i try to control for as many as

1244
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,800
i can the big one that kind of stands

1245
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,200
out that you can't necessarily control

1246
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,200
for

1247
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,960
is it's pretty rare where you get an

1248
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,239
event where they're just doing 100 miles

1249
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,599
on a track it's usually

1250
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,799
like a like an event of like a series of

1251
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,440
different events where there might be

1252
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,200
like

1253
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,039
some people out there doing 50k some

1254
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:28,319
people out there doing 24 or something

1255
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,279
like the event i did that there's six

1256
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,640
day folks out there they're trying to

1257
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,240
see how far they can get in six days so

1258
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,879
you have like this

1259
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,399
much wider range of pacing just due to

1260
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,960
like the distance

1261
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,599
so you know track protocol is always

1262
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,920
like

1263
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,640
you pass on the outside so if you're

1264
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,760
running

1265
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,519
one of the faster paces of the day um

1266
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,200
which when you're going up to six days

1267
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,239
you're gonna and you're doing 100 miles

1268
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,919
you're probably going to be running

1269
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,519
faster than most people out there

1270
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,119
then you know you just end up running

1271
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:56,559
more because you end up running in lane

1272
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,440
two around the turns and sometimes lane

1273
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,039
three around the turns

1274
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,800
so it's down to those little details

1275
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,320
that have a big impact yep so i had to

1276
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,519
build that into my pacing strategy i

1277
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,079
also have to build into the pacing

1278
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,119
strategy

1279
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,440
like relative non-moving time uh

1280
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,200
you know i did a race just recently i

1281
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,280
was the us track and field hundred mile

1282
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,639
road championships and i did not stop

1283
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,920
once other than like i guess i

1284
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,440
technically stopped like

1285
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,599
in the aid station for like a few

1286
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,119
seconds to like grab bottles and

1287
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,720
get myself wet because it was like 94

1288
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,720
degrees that day but

1289
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,239
i didn't like stop at all during that

1290
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,559
race from like

1291
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,000
what i would say is like a long period

1292
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,639
of time where we're getting up to like a

1293
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,800
minute

1294
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:35,679
but that's pretty rare even on the track

1295
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,280
like when i ran 11 hours and 19 minutes

1296
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,199
uh i think i stopped three times for

1297
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,240
maybe a total of like i believe

1298
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,199
i have to look back for sure but i think

1299
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:42,639
it was like three to four minutes or

1300
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,039
something like that so you gotta you

1301
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:44,879
gotta

1302
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:46,559
figure that into your pacing strategy

1303
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,280
especially if you're chasing a specific

1304
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,279
time

1305
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,960
because you know if i'm pacing for you

1306
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,320
know at the time the world record was 11

1307
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,358
28 um so if i'm pacing for say

1308
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,559
11 27 30 or something like that and i

1309
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,480
don't account for that

1310
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:02,078
three minutes of stoppage then i might

1311
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,280
run the exact pace i had planned on but

1312
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,839
then i'm a minute off of the world

1313
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,040
record

1314
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:08,639
so 11 28 we're talking about 11 hours

1315
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,559
we're talking about 100 miles

1316
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,239
can you mention what the world record

1317
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,000
was what uh

1318
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,358
what kind of world record you set can

1319
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,199
you tell your own story here

1320
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:18,960
of uh of what you were able to

1321
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,879
accomplish that world record that i

1322
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,920
broke actually just recently got rebroke

1323
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:27,760
um by a guy um over in lithuania

1324
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,440
uh alex sorkin um phenomenal race

1325
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,960
i mean he's he's won the 24-hour world

1326
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,320
championships he's won the spartathlon

1327
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,320
which is another big historic

1328
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,838
ultramarathon it's 153 miles so it's

1329
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,640
getting a little more lengthy than

1330
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,159
some of the stuff that i've

1331
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:43,039
traditionally done um he ran 11 14

1332
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:45,838
i believe it was 56 or 57. um so his

1333
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,719
pace was 645 per mile mine was 647 and a

1334
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:48,000
half

1335
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,399
in terms of just like the pacing

1336
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,960
strategy it's it's just really cool

1337
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,240
because

1338
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,280
for me the motivation

1339
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:59,199
with chasing the world record was it was

1340
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,400
multi-faceted i think there was

1341
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,399
as i kind of moved through because i

1342
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,160
mean it took me almost six years from

1343
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,119
the day i decided i wanted to chase that

1344
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:08,000
time

1345
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,200
to the day i actually did it uh and

1346
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
through that

1347
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,199
five to six years i think i emerged from

1348
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,960
just like my

1349
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,598
number one goal was to try to break the

1350
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,760
world record to my number one goal is

1351
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,039
how fast can i run this thing and then

1352
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,800
ultimately

1353
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:24,559
um what needs to be done for a human to

1354
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,359
break 11 hours and 100 miles because i

1355
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,759
think that's gonna be

1356
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:28,960
i think that's going to happen wow soon

1357
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,520
i think it's going to happen

1358
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,358
in the next few years would that be um

1359
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,440
sub 11 would be i think like i

1360
00:40:33,358 --> 00:40:36,960
think it's like 6 35 right about per

1361
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,720
mile you're moving

1362
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,480
quick but not so quick that like you're

1363
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,000
you're you know void of being able to

1364
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,920
think about everything as it's happening

1365
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,039
so what's the pace in terms of if you

1366
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,159
look

1367
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:53,279
for each of the one-mile segments

1368
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:56,239
for the 100 miles is it pretty steady

1369
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,960
six like in order to break 11 hours

1370
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,279
would it be pretty steady 635 does it go

1371
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,400
up

1372
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,240
and down do you speed up at the very end

1373
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,079
like what's what's the pacing if you

1374
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,519
were to and maybe how much variability

1375
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,760
is there in the pacing

1376
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:11,039
for an optimal performance here yeah so

1377
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,560
if you're talking about someone let's

1378
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:13,838
say that there's someone well let's just

1379
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:15,039
take me for example let's say that we

1380
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,279
could just like

1381
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,639
we had this infinite knowledge and we

1382
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,079
knew for a fact

1383
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,078
a perfect performance for me would

1384
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,280
produce a 10 59 but i'm not going a

1385
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,640
second faster

1386
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,440
and i need to do everything right in

1387
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:30,639
order to run a 1059. uh

1388
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,119
i would definitely want to either have a

1389
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:33,679
slight negative or a slight positive

1390
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,720
split

1391
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,598
so when um and i think there's i think

1392
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,439
there's uh

1393
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,680
there's a range in there where like

1394
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,880
being a little bit faster the first half

1395
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,239
the second half isn't going to

1396
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,720
necessarily

1397
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,559
change your outcome or being a little

1398
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:50,159
bit slower the first half

1399
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:51,679
and a little bit faster the second half

1400
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:52,639
isn't going to drastically change your

1401
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,838
outcome

1402
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,598
so that's what you're referring to the

1403
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,039
split is you're looking at the first 50

1404
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,880
miles in the second 15 miles

1405
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:00,159
and you can break it down as as tiny as

1406
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,838
you want like i think

1407
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,118
when you take out the outlier laps where

1408
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:04,719
i stopped to use the bathroom which

1409
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,079
would have been that like three to four

1410
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,039
minute non-moving time that i talked

1411
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,359
about before

1412
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,639
my splits were really tight um i had a

1413
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,039
couple that were

1414
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:14,318
um it was weird because that that track

1415
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:17,838
that i did that on was actually

1416
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:19,759
400 and some weird number like 400 and

1417
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:21,519
like 38 meters or something like that so

1418
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,200
i actually like ran like my numbers

1419
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:24,719
based on that so they're

1420
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:26,159
they're normally i'm dealing with 400

1421
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:28,399
meters and then it's a little more like

1422
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,759
clean as to like what my lap splits

1423
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,280
are gonna range from one event to the

1424
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,640
next so we're talking about running 100

1425
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,599
miles on a track

1426
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,559
yeah and so that you can be really

1427
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,599
scientific about

1428
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,838
yes getting the the the the um

1429
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,440
the pacing right and uh you're you're

1430
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,679
running on the inside lane

1431
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,639
or is there some kind of tricks to this

1432
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,000
like are you

1433
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:51,440
alternating directions

1434
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,280
yeah they'll switch directions at most

1435
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,200
events every four hours so

1436
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,880
you'll do four hours one way and then

1437
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,279
they usually put a cone out

1438
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,800
and once it hits like like let's say it

1439
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,480
hits four hours

1440
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,760
you finish the lap you're on and then

1441
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,318
you do a loop around and then you start

1442
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,839
the next

1443
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,318
your next laptop would you say you take

1444
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:10,239
the exact same number of steps

1445
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:11,679
like when you're really in the groove

1446
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:13,279
when you're taking the pacing

1447
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,279
are we talking about that level of

1448
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,920
precision or is it a little bit more

1449
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,480
feel you mean like foot strike frequency

1450
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,599
yeah like

1451
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,519
frequency then over the distance to the

1452
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,280
lap would you say it's so precise that

1453
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,000
you're like you get in this groove where

1454
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,920
it's like perfect

1455
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,280
yeah gosh you're making me wish i would

1456
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,119
have strapped more like a foot pod to

1457
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,040
mine

1458
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,720
but like yeah so i think like my guess

1459
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,000
is it's pretty precise like it's

1460
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:37,199
is there a video of this sorry i keep

1461
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,760
interrupting is there a video of this

1462
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,118
because

1463
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,040
i i've actually this is now three years

1464
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,519
ago build a computer vision

1465
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:47,119
algorithm that counts foot strikes oh

1466
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:50,400
really yeah for fun

1467
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,599
yeah i was trying to understand uh we'll

1468
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,039
talk about that we have the same

1469
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,359
definition of fun when

1470
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,039
i've got my find myself on a track for

1471
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:58,480
all day and you find yourself counting

1472
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:00,480
foot strikes

1473
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,000
i was trying to understand if if there's

1474
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,000
how much variability there's

1475
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,719
in uh extreme like elite performers

1476
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,719
within a particular race but also across

1477
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,838
races it was just interesting to me

1478
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:15,519
from a robotics perspective if like

1479
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:18,318
how much variability there is in the

1480
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,358
human body in in the way they use legs

1481
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,318
to move quickly

1482
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:23,759
i think my guess would be that at the

1483
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:25,838
individual level it's going to be pretty

1484
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,040
precise assuming the pacing

1485
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:30,159
is consistent so you get so my pacing on

1486
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,400
that day

1487
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,920
i ran two minutes faster the second 50

1488
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,000
miles and i did the first 50 miles so my

1489
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,519
splits were very even most of the day

1490
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,599
i actually ran some of my fastest miles

1491
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:40,639
at the end uh so there's going to be

1492
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,880
probably a slight

1493
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:44,159
variance from my fastest mile to my

1494
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,640
slowest mile in

1495
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,399
like your cadence or your foot strike

1496
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:49,838
but probably not by a huge margin but

1497
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,200
you might have a pretty big variance

1498
00:44:49,838 --> 00:44:53,679
from one person to the next

1499
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,199
so you get someone whose gait is just a

1500
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,440
little bit different so like for me

1501
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,439
i supinate which means i kind of come

1502
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,880
down on the outside of my foot

1503
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,639
and i'm kind of more of a mid-forefoot

1504
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,720
striker so that's going to kind of

1505
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,480
impact my cadence to a degree whereas

1506
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,279
you might have someone who

1507
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,880
is kind of more mid to rear of their

1508
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,319
foot or heel striker and they might

1509
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,280
pronate where their foot kind of rolls

1510
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:14,639
in

1511
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,720
so that person may have a little bit of

1512
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,480
a different cadence as well so

1513
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,639
you get someone and i think you see this

1514
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,039
in elite marathoning too which is gonna

1515
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:24,078
probably

1516
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:26,000
just be a much larger data pool uh much

1517
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,640
much more probably precise from just

1518
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,280
like a number of opportunities to study

1519
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:30,799
this

1520
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,480
and i think even their ranges from one

1521
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,640
person the next can be

1522
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,000
i wouldn't say drastic but you know to

1523
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,159
the degree of like

1524
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,599
10 to maybe even 20 steps per minute or

1525
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:40,639
something like that from one person to

1526
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,480
the next

1527
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:43,679
but most people the faster they go the

1528
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,880
higher their cadence is going to be the

1529
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:45,598
slower they go the lower their cadence

1530
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,358
is going to be

1531
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,880
but there's going to be probably a range

1532
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,679
of optimal

1533
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,318
lowness and i don't know what probably

1534
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:54,480
optimal

1535
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:56,639
highness too than that if you can just

1536
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,800
linger in 11 hours

1537
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,960
the person first of all would you like

1538
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,680
to be a the person that breaks 11 hours

1539
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,440
and second of all the person that does

1540
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,559
break 11 hours like what would

1541
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,760
what would it take and third question is

1542
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,039
is it even possible

1543
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,240
and you're in yeah i mean i would def

1544
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:15,199
i would be lying to you if i said i

1545
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,879
didn't want to be the first person to

1546
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:17,838
break 11 hours and 100 miles i think

1547
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,880
that'll be

1548
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:22,400
um would be a cool like barrier to be

1549
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,079
the one to usher that in

1550
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,519
but with that said i think i'm much more

1551
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,440
motivated in

1552
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:31,199
seeing it done from the sense that like

1553
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,679
i think when when we're talking about

1554
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,838
records it's something that

1555
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:36,960
is inevitable that it's gonna get broken

1556
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,119
so i mean we were talking about

1557
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,159
happiness before this right so

1558
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,559
i've contemplated this in the past where

1559
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:46,639
i was thinking to myself like

1560
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,239
if my motivation is to break a world

1561
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:49,598
record or any record for that matter

1562
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,879
course record

1563
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,599
and have that be my defining reason

1564
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,720
or my defining motivator i probably need

1565
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,359
to do

1566
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:01,039
an assessment of what i'm kind of where

1567
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:04,480
my mind is at and where my

1568
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:07,199
focus is at uh and just

1569
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,240
reflect on how i'm behaving in life

1570
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,078
because

1571
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,358
it's gonna get broken right i mean i

1572
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,720
could run

1573
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:17,119
10 50 tomorrow and in

1574
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:18,639
10 years chances are that's no longer

1575
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,480
gonna be my the world record anymore

1576
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:23,920
someone's gonna run faster than that

1577
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,960
so if you're living to hold on to a

1578
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,838
record versus

1579
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,599
living to try to move the sport forward

1580
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:31,838
which any time you break a world record

1581
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,359
you're moving the sport forward then

1582
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:34,799
then you have to look at that as like

1583
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,598
that was my contribution

1584
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,200
and whether i contribute again or not is

1585
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,920
kind of besides the point

1586
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,439
what you want is that your performance

1587
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,720
your contribution brings

1588
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,559
new people into the sport who are

1589
00:47:44,719 --> 00:47:48,399
excited motivated

1590
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,079
and they can make their contribution and

1591
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,838
then we can ultimately see well how fast

1592
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,119
can someone run a controlled environment

1593
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:55,279
hundred miler

1594
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,800
and that's what i really want to see uh

1595
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,000
because i think i've gotten so much

1596
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,200
enjoyment from the sport i mean i've

1597
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,039
gotten so much enjoyment from the sport

1598
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:03,598
i've been able to turn it into a career

1599
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,719
and i think there's there's other people

1600
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,160
who can do the same thing

1601
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:08,719
and it's not necessarily going to come

1602
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:10,159
at the expense of my career

1603
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,358
but it's going to bring more attention

1604
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:12,799
to the sport it's going to bring more

1605
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:13,679
interest in the sport it's going to open

1606
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,880
this board up to people who maybe

1607
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:16,159
otherwise would have never thought about

1608
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,559
it seen it

1609
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,598
considered it and to me i think that's

1610
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:23,599
like a much more rewarding goal

1611
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,039
than saying i want to break this record

1612
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,640
and i want to hold it for

1613
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:28,159
decades or i want to die with this

1614
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,000
record so i never have to see someone

1615
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,000
go faster than me well that's the

1616
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,679
progress of human civilization we stand

1617
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,280
on the shoulders of giants and we keep

1618
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,960
creating cool stuff well and it's

1619
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,720
it's the other thing is just like if

1620
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,760
you're honest with yourself too it's uh

1621
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:41,118
i mean we're seeing this right now in

1622
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,800
the running world where

1623
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,400
you know new innovations come in new

1624
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,280
technologies come in new nutritional

1625
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,079
approaches come in

1626
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,519
and then we see like the new crop of

1627
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,559
folks have advantages that the old crop

1628
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:52,239
didn't have

1629
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,599
and it can be easy to look back on that

1630
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,078
and say like hey well

1631
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,200
um you know if i would have had that

1632
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,920
product or if i would have done that i

1633
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:59,358
would have run this but then you're

1634
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,760
getting into that negative

1635
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:03,759
you know thought process again which i

1636
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,000
generally try to stay out of it

1637
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,839
i think the caveman if if i had fire i

1638
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,119
would have done right better with this

1639
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:10,880
look at look at these idiots up there

1640
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,599
with their cars if i had a car back then

1641
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,800
i would have been

1642
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,200
yeah ruled the world um let me just zoom

1643
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,318
out

1644
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:21,519
just briefly and and ask you about

1645
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:23,039
kind of beauty and love

1646
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,039
what's the most beautiful thing about

1647
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,279
running to you why do you love it

1648
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:29,119
i think uh there's kind of a couple

1649
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,480
directions to look at it through

1650
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,318
or lens is looking through there's like

1651
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,920
the in the moment right there's always

1652
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:36,000
going to be that run where

1653
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,159
uh you're clicking along and things just

1654
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,639
feel great you get some endorphins

1655
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,159
and you get the you know the the quote

1656
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:43,759
unquote runners high and that sort of

1657
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:45,519
stuff and that's like just like this

1658
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,920
great feeling that you can kind of tap

1659
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:50,880
into on the like real like

1660
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,838
like in the moment type of level uh you

1661
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,119
know you've

1662
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:54,639
my wife and i talk about this because

1663
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,200
she's a competitive ultra honor as well

1664
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:58,318
and

1665
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,919
um you will you'll we'll have a day

1666
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:01,358
where you know we'll take a forced day

1667
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,960
off or something like that and it's

1668
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:06,159
necessary right it's gonna

1669
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,000
allow the enjoyment to continue but

1670
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:09,440
you get into this like routine of i wake

1671
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,519
up in the morning i do this run and that

1672
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,440
kind of gets my day started that gets my

1673
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:15,280
my energies up i get that runner's high

1674
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,800
afterwards you remove that from the

1675
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,800
equation for a rest day

1676
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,800
and you just sort of like uh man i don't

1677
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,400
feel like i never got started today like

1678
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,480
you know it's just this weird thing it's

1679
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,480
almost i think it's it's funny because

1680
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,760
non-runners don't always like

1681
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,039
necessarily recognize it because for

1682
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,480
them it's the complete opposite they're

1683
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:31,599
like if i can get away from

1684
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,838
not having to run today that's going to

1685
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,760
be a good day versus

1686
00:50:33,838 --> 00:50:36,960
yeah but it's one of those things that i

1687
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,720
think gets more addictive the more you

1688
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,838
do it so

1689
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,000
that's purely from the running

1690
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:43,920
perspective there's this joy of

1691
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,679
uh of the runner's high of the post

1692
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,960
after the run you feel like you can take

1693
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:48,558
on the world that kind of thing

1694
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,400
yes and i think that's one of the

1695
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,599
drivers from just a quality of life

1696
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,920
standpoint

1697
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,440
uh just uh you know and in the moment

1698
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,800
immediate gratification

1699
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,318
uh standpoint but then there's like i

1700
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,839
think the bigger picture stuff for the

1701
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:03,279
longer term stuff

1702
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:06,078
and for me that enjoyment is like

1703
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,200
just the process like of uh okay i'm

1704
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,480
starting at this

1705
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:12,159
fitness level and i'm going to do these

1706
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,679
workouts and by doing these workouts i'm

1707
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:14,159
going to see incremental progress from

1708
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:15,679
them

1709
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:17,358
and then that's another kind of like

1710
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:18,239
kind of short-term gratification that's

1711
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:19,519
maybe a little longer than the

1712
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:22,159
day-to-day but

1713
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,800
um still like shorter than like a career

1714
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:24,960
or a

1715
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,160
or a build up for a particular race

1716
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,679
where you're saying you're seeing

1717
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:29,279
yourself like okay maybe i'm focusing on

1718
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:31,919
short intervals right now

1719
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,760
and on week one i covered this much

1720
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,440
distance in three minutes but by week

1721
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,440
four i'm covering this much distance and

1722
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,679
you can just see that progress

1723
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,119
it's almost like uh in elementary school

1724
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,639
when you get the gold star for reading a

1725
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,079
book it's like did that gold star really

1726
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:45,279
mean anything

1727
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,280
i don't know but it felt great when they

1728
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,640
gave it to me yeah

1729
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,240
there's something about just finding

1730
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,920
improvement and people love to see

1731
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:54,399
improvement i think so

1732
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,680
that's where uh i think you can also get

1733
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,519
some value and it would be saying like i

1734
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,679
started here and i got there

1735
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,199
um and then i think there's also just

1736
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:02,318
like uh

1737
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,399
what i would call this maybe more the

1738
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:06,079
cherry on top which is like where you

1739
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,599
express your work which is the race

1740
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,119
itself where that's going to be kind of

1741
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,160
the thing that kind of like

1742
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,838
uh shows up on the end result and

1743
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,440
where it kind of identifies whether you

1744
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:16,880
did things right or wrong yeah so

1745
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,519
there's a sense which

1746
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,640
in which training is a kind of uh

1747
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,920
preparation

1748
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:25,838
towards race day and race day being

1749
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,358
the thing where you get to be the artist

1750
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,679
you get to create this

1751
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:31,199
this piece of art and they might suck it

1752
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:34,000
might be beautiful

1753
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:35,679
i mean i i i see in the grappling world

1754
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,440
i see competition in the same way when i

1755
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:40,318
feel the best about it

1756
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,599
which is like it sounds pretentious to

1757
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:43,119
say but like

1758
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,880
i'm trying to be the best version of

1759
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:48,400
myself in this particular

1760
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,440
day of competition and to do something

1761
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,160
that i'll be proud of in in

1762
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,000
an artist way not in a kind of some kind

1763
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:59,118
of numerical way but

1764
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,119
like as a holistic sense like

1765
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,318
do something cool like in grappling that

1766
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:05,519
means for me

1767
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,480
that means like not stalling like taking

1768
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,440
big risks

1769
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,880
and trying to dominate another person in

1770
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,639
the context of grappling

1771
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:17,519
and and do it like push myself to limit

1772
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,920
both cardio wise and technique wise and

1773
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:19,599
just

1774
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,960
play play beautifully i mean you see

1775
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,559
this in kind of chess

1776
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,000
there's systematic chess players and

1777
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,760
there's people that

1778
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,079
allow themselves to have those moments

1779
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,400
of genius where they take the big risk

1780
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,440
that eventually pays off or doesn't and

1781
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,079
that to me is art

1782
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,280
that i mean there's art within running

1783
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,359
there's art within chess

1784
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,519
there's art within grappling and you get

1785
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:41,679
a chance like all the training

1786
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:43,759
is more like science and then it feels

1787
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:45,838
like the competition day's art

1788
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,599
yeah i think that that that's a really

1789
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:47,920
cool cool way to look at and i think

1790
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,838
it's

1791
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,519
when you really open up the perspective

1792
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:53,519
of that too it's like

1793
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,358
even uh obviously you know having a

1794
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:56,559
great day like winning the tournament or

1795
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:58,000
you know getting further than you were

1796
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,280
expected to or beating someone who

1797
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,239
you've never beaten before or something

1798
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,839
like that

1799
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:03,598
or in the running perspective like

1800
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,358
achieving that goal time

1801
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,720
uh that sort of stuff obviously those

1802
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:08,078
are kind of like the ones you

1803
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,000
you if when you're honest yourself you

1804
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,160
really want and you're gonna probably

1805
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,679
get the most satisfaction out of but

1806
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:15,279
even when they don't go wrong like maybe

1807
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:17,838
like with your grappling tournament

1808
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,319
uh analogy the you know maybe the guy

1809
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,318
you're

1810
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:21,599
grappling against does a move on you and

1811
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:22,079
you're like i was not prepared for that

1812
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,200
move

1813
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,039
so now the enjoyment becomes okay

1814
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:28,480
back to the drawing board and now i need

1815
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:29,838
to find out what do i do when that

1816
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,920
happens to me next time

1817
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:33,440
and that's where the i think the y comes

1818
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,119
in again same thing with running like

1819
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,000
maybe i make a mistake and

1820
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,200
you know like eat something i didn't

1821
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,719
really want to eat or

1822
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:42,558
or thought was gonna work but didn't

1823
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:43,759
work and it costs me more time than i

1824
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,960
gained by having it or something like

1825
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,640
that and then i go back to the drawing

1826
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,720
board and say okay well

1827
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:50,078
i can't do that that didn't work or if

1828
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,159
i'm gonna do that i need to be more

1829
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,200
prepared to be able to do it and

1830
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:56,798
i love that part of the sport um

1831
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,318
just the rearranging of things and

1832
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:00,000
adjusting and tinkering

1833
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:02,558
there's some sense in which the mistakes

1834
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,280
and like the flaws give us meaning

1835
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,720
because like if if everything if you

1836
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,200
weren't able to find

1837
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:10,879
mistakes and something you've done it

1838
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:14,000
feels like

1839
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,440
the life would be void of meaning it's a

1840
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,719
lost opportunity too

1841
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:23,039
like if i mean like when i look at

1842
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:24,558
even my hundred mile race of 1119

1843
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:26,239
i can find spots in there where i was

1844
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,680
like uh you know what i could clean that

1845
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,879
up a little bit maybe if i do this

1846
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:31,759
differently

1847
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,960
and i mean that's gonna get me you know

1848
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,880
a little bit faster

1849
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,240
if i sat back and said hey well things

1850
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,519
went great that day

1851
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:41,039
cool let's see if we can replicate it

1852
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:42,639
then you know i probably run 11 19 again

1853
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,880
so can we talk about training a little

1854
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:48,000
bit yeah what does your uh

1855
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:51,920
training look like year-round

1856
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,400
day-to-day hour to hour like optimal

1857
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,519
maybe uh maybe you want to pick a race

1858
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,559
in the context of what you want to

1859
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,079
discuss that

1860
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,920
but and also people should follow you on

1861
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,519
instagram you have a lot of kind of

1862
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,159
interesting um like little

1863
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,679
glances into your training process into

1864
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,118
your training thinking which is quite

1865
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,000
fascinating but if you look at an

1866
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:11,599
optimal

1867
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,318
training process what does that look

1868
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,079
like yeah so i think uh

1869
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,159
the if we're looking at it from like a

1870
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,720
philosophical level or like an approach

1871
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:20,000
level

1872
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,399
i think there's some things that carry

1873
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,400
over from regardless of the distance

1874
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:29,119
so i think working on your weaknesses

1875
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,798
and things that are least specific to

1876
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,318
what you're going to do on race day

1877
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,318
but are still going to be important

1878
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:35,279
things in terms of improving your

1879
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:37,519
ability

1880
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,880
to perform on race day or maximizing

1881
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:41,039
your potential

1882
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,240
uh with the things that are specific you

1883
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:45,920
do first

1884
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:46,879
i say that but the there's a caveat with

1885
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,400
endurance sport i think

1886
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,920
maybe even more specifically with things

1887
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,798
like our ultra marathons or 100 milers

1888
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,639
where

1889
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:54,960
you want a really strong aerobic

1890
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:57,519
foundation or like a base

1891
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,720
before you really start i think

1892
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:01,920
structuring things

1893
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:04,639
towards a specific one so for me i think

1894
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:07,760
like a target for me is oftentimes like

1895
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:10,000
uh you know getting really fit at

1896
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,440
like what my pace would be at like my

1897
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,039
aerobic threshold or what a lot of

1898
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,079
people may call like a maximum aerobic

1899
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:15,519
function

1900
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,400
um i mean the running world is kind of

1901
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,838
weird where we have like these

1902
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,280
terminologies where there's sometimes

1903
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,358
multiple words that essentially mean the

1904
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,599
same thing but one is from like a

1905
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:25,279
just an actual physiological reaction

1906
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,440
and one is just like a feeling and stuff

1907
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:31,200
like that so you mentioned time on feet

1908
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:33,280
versus time in optimal physiological

1909
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:35,279
state like how important is it just to

1910
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,880
get like running done

1911
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,480
versus like running in a particular pace

1912
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,280
that would depend on the event i would

1913
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,440
say to a degree and and there's contra

1914
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,280
conflicting ideas about like kind of how

1915
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,000
to structure it i think a lot of times

1916
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,880
like

1917
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,480
uh you do want to like time on feet in

1918
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,519
most cases is just going to be like i'm

1919
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,519
running easy whatever

1920
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,798
feels easy that day and that can be

1921
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:58,159
different from one day to the next like

1922
00:57:56,798 --> 00:58:00,000
i might feel great

1923
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:01,679
and you know that produces a much faster

1924
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,838
pace than if i you know feel really

1925
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,078
miserable or something like that

1926
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:08,078
um so that's why i think a lot of times

1927
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,720
running will they'll do they're called

1928
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,039
perceived

1929
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:12,558
perceived effort or perceived exertion

1930
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:15,199
and they're

1931
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,760
you're looking at kind of understanding

1932
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:18,480
the

1933
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,960
response your body has to a certain

1934
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,318
effort

1935
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,079
level and you're supposed to target a

1936
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:25,199
certain effort level in order to like

1937
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,480
get a certain response so to maybe

1938
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:27,439
simplify that a little bit or make it a

1939
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,838
little clearer like

1940
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,280
i think i focus on essentially like

1941
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:33,759
short intervals

1942
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,200
i focus on longer intervals or tempo

1943
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,880
runs

1944
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:40,239
i focus on um like race pace intensity

1945
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,318
which is a lot of times what i'll build

1946
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:44,719
my long run around um

1947
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:46,000
but also like those are kind of like the

1948
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,118
small pieces to the puzzle

1949
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,280
those are the options you're working

1950
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:51,200
with yeah but i'm gonna always try to

1951
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,720
work with those options on top of a

1952
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:53,838
massive aerobic base which is going to

1953
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:55,118
probably be like 80

1954
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:56,558
of the work so how do you build that

1955
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,920
massive aerobic base what are we talking

1956
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,720
about just distance

1957
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,920
distance and essentially so i like to

1958
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:02,959
call it micro stressing because you're

1959
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,400
going to always start at a different

1960
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,838
spot depending on your fitness level's

1961
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,960
at and depending on where you're at as

1962
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:08,480
an individual

1963
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,400
i'm gonna be targeting my aerobic

1964
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,880
threshold i'm gonna get right up to it

1965
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,000
but not necessarily cross over it um

1966
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,358
it's it you know it's

1967
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,119
it's been popularized with maximum

1968
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:18,078
aerobic function as kind of a training

1969
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,280
philosophy

1970
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:23,119
that philosophy in itself i think maybe

1971
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,280
is a little more like holistic where

1972
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,160
they're saying do this basically all the

1973
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,798
time

1974
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:29,759
and by doing so you're gonna like you're

1975
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,480
gonna raise

1976
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,000
your aerobic potential by so much that

1977
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,679
you know you can kind of like

1978
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,119
race yourself into shape at that point

1979
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:38,480
and this would be maybe more specific

1980
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,920
for like shorter distance

1981
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,440
or endurance runs where you're not going

1982
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,000
to race yourself in the shape of 100

1983
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,679
milers

1984
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
but for 5ks you might you might do like

1985
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,759
a huge base building phase

1986
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,199
where you're going up to that maximum

1987
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,160
aerobic function

1988
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,838
or that aerobic threshold and you're

1989
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:55,920
watching your pace come down

1990
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:57,119
at that so the rule there is basically

1991
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,960
like if you're seeing

1992
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,480
improvement that's the sign you're

1993
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,240
looking for or which would just be your

1994
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,838
pace dropping at that heart rate or at

1995
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,078
that intensity

1996
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:06,960
and uh if you're seeing that continually

1997
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,400
go down you're heading in the right

1998
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,599
direction if you start seeing it go the

1999
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,680
opposite way

2000
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,039
you're you're probably overreaching or

2001
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:15,039
you're trying to do too much of it so

2002
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:16,719
that's kind of dictates how much the

2003
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:18,480
dose i guess you'd say when we talk

2004
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:18,798
about max aerobic function we're talking

2005
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,639
about

2006
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:22,239
heart rate as the ultimate as the really

2007
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:23,679
important metric here so

2008
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:26,239
maintaining a particular heart rate

2009
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:27,759
during the run uh

2010
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,199
is that the measure that like how do you

2011
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,079
know you're in the right yeah yeah and

2012
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:31,598
then that's where it gets a little

2013
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,000
tricky because like unless you go into a

2014
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,838
lab

2015
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,358
and get your aerobic threshold tested

2016
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,400
it's really hard to have like an exact

2017
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:38,558
number on it

2018
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,160
um you know dr phil maffetone with the

2019
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,079
maximum function process

2020
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:43,920
he'll say 180 minus your age is going to

2021
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,280
give you your yeah that's the math 180

2022
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,280
formula that i thought was

2023
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,480
fascinating for it's like in the same

2024
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,480
way e equals

2025
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,838
e equals m c squared it's fascinating

2026
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,519
that there could be a formula that

2027
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:55,358
captures like optimal running

2028
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:58,239
yeah so that for people who don't know

2029
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:59,838
that's 180 minus your age

2030
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:01,118
if you train at that heart rate if you

2031
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:02,000
run at that heart rate you're going to

2032
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,200
progress a lot

2033
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,039
and here's the advantage of that i think

2034
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,960
like with any of these things you want

2035
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:08,639
to look at it through

2036
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,000
where are the advantages here and i need

2037
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:11,440
to account for those and then where are

2038
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
the potential disadvantages

2039
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,440
and then decide for me as an individual

2040
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,400
do these advantages outweigh the

2041
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,920
disadvantages

2042
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,358
and what's the alternative approach and

2043
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,159
is that going to produce more advantages

2044
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:22,798
or less

2045
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:24,000
so with with maximum work function uh

2046
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:27,920
here's some advantages like

2047
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,559
it is low enough intensity where you can

2048
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,920
train pretty consistently at a fairly

2049
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:34,960
high volume

2050
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,039
with a very low injury risk with uh

2051
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,400
very low like things that are gonna

2052
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,318
maybe lower your quality of life like

2053
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,480
muscle damage and things like that

2054
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,159
um it's a more efficient way in the

2055
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,240
sense that you're gonna be like

2056
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:48,000
prioritizing like fat metabolization

2057
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:49,358
which um i mean if you're looking at

2058
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,199
like jeff folick and

2059
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:52,960
or dr jeff folik and dr dominic

2060
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:54,159
d'agostino some of their research and

2061
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,760
things like that like

2062
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:57,199
they're going to show that you know

2063
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,880
that's going to be a little cleaner way

2064
01:01:57,199 --> 01:01:59,759
to go about things from just a recovery

2065
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,920
standpoint

2066
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,240
a breakdown standpoint so they could be

2067
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,680
like a what they call like a fat adapted

2068
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:08,399
athlete so you can

2069
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:08,798
go to your fat stores for energy if

2070
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,039
you're

2071
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:12,400
applying this map what is it called by

2072
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:14,400
the way math 180

2073
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,160
is that is that a good is it what are

2074
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,480
your thoughts about in general

2075
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:20,879
for yourself and for the broader

2076
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,440
population i think the maf 180 formula

2077
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,160
is

2078
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:26,000
about as good of a formula as you're

2079
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:27,519
going to find in terms of capturing

2080
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,199
as many people as you can get away with

2081
01:02:27,519 --> 01:02:30,239
capturing with a kind of a universal

2082
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,480
thing

2083
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:34,078
like any of these things i mean it's

2084
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,798
more likely kind of on a bell curve

2085
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,680
where

2086
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:38,880
like the bulk of that 180 minus three is

2087
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:40,318
probably going to be a pretty good at

2088
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,200
least starting point to kind of figure

2089
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:42,480
out where that is

2090
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:44,719
there's some other things you can like

2091
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,039
maybe use to kind of check it

2092
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:49,038
that i like to do if i'm let's say i

2093
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,039
just i did 180 minus my age i went out

2094
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:53,200
and i started running and it was like

2095
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:54,559
i'm running along and i'm just like my

2096
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:56,960
my breathing is labored

2097
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,200
i'm you know i'm struggling to get a

2098
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,639
sentence out without gasping for breath

2099
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:02,960
well that's my body telling me i'm

2100
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:04,879
probably not actually at my true

2101
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,480
like math number or my true like

2102
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,960
underneath my true aerobic threshold

2103
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,480
like

2104
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,838
aerobic threshold and maximum function

2105
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,358
you should be able to do that for hours

2106
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:12,159
and you should be able to breathe pretty

2107
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:15,199
efficiently

2108
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:16,000
and talk yep carry a conversation other

2109
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,358
people will say like

2110
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,880
you another way to kind of gauge it if

2111
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:19,679
you can breathe in your nose and out

2112
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,280
your mouth

2113
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:23,118
that's not necessarily the best way to

2114
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,480
do on a from a performance standpoint

2115
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:26,798
but it can be a good

2116
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,519
kind of governor that will allow you to

2117
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:28,719
like if you can

2118
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:29,920
if you can no longer breathe in your

2119
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:31,598
nose and out your mouth you're probably

2120
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,880
going too fast actually technically be

2121
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,920
at your math pace or under your math

2122
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,960
pace yeah i had a

2123
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:39,280
actually when i was in in better shape

2124
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,159
i had trouble getting to that math

2125
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,119
number

2126
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:44,000
i found myself like either i would be

2127
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,318
doing way too much

2128
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,318
work like it's too hard to do it was too

2129
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:48,880
hard to get to that number i was running

2130
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:51,920
a much

2131
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,880
lower heart rate like 10 to 20 what do

2132
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,000
you call that beats

2133
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,680
lower and that's i was still for myself

2134
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,079
happy with the pace it was good pace and

2135
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:01,118
yeah and i was felt good i was smiling

2136
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,160
and enjoying life

2137
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,440
and yeah uh i did and with the moment i

2138
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:08,480
take myself to that

2139
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,240
uh level of like the math 180 level

2140
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,318
that's like definitely like a real

2141
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:13,118
workout yeah and it felt like i can't do

2142
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:16,239
that for five

2143
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:18,318
10 15 miles like i i started feeling it

2144
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:22,078
like this is a one or two mile thing

2145
01:04:18,318 --> 01:04:25,199
now but i think his answer to that uh

2146
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:28,640
i feel me don't answer is maybe

2147
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:30,239
you're supposed to like uh what

2148
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:31,920
maybe do some more sprints or something

2149
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:34,558
like that or build up your

2150
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,119
maybe like i'm too weak yeah musculature

2151
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,000
wise

2152
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:39,280
to like uh yeah like that that's a sign

2153
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,639
that you need to work on some stuff you

2154
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,839
can't just keep enjoying life

2155
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:43,759
there's there's two ways to look at that

2156
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:44,880
i think and i think you're you're you're

2157
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,440
right on i think that

2158
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,920
what the advice from that from that kind

2159
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,039
of a

2160
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,240
process would say is either you you're

2161
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,000
doing too much of it

2162
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:56,078
so it's getting too hard for where your

2163
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,318
skeletal muscle system is currently at

2164
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,760
for that particular activity so like i

2165
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:01,199
mean it can be different too like if

2166
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,480
you're cycling versus running you know

2167
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:04,159
that's a little bit of different

2168
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,000
mechanic where it can be different where

2169
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:08,879
you could take a super fit

2170
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
cyclist and then put them on you know

2171
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,798
the amount of volume they're gonna be

2172
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,318
able to tolerate

2173
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:13,920
relative to what you're gonna do when

2174
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:14,798
you remove like impact forces and things

2175
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,159
like that

2176
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:18,000
is gonna be lower if they haven't been

2177
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:20,078
practicing that activity so for you like

2178
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,639
you know you're prioritizing like uh

2179
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:24,079
uh wrestling and mixed martial are not

2180
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:25,118
mixed martial arts but jiu jitsu type

2181
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:27,920
stuff so

2182
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,640
uh you know running is maybe kind of

2183
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,039
that

2184
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:32,558
that uh that secondary activity versus

2185
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,240
the primary activity

2186
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,680
but yeah so what they would say is

2187
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:36,479
probably like maybe instead of doing

2188
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:37,919
that

2189
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,679
at let's say you were doing that for

2190
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,519
like 30 miles a week or something like

2191
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:42,399
that and it was getting too hard to

2192
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:44,719
continue

2193
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,960
they'd say you know come back to 20 get

2194
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:48,798
used to 20 get comfortable with 20.

2195
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:51,119
then let's get you up to 25 and 30 and

2196
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:54,079
kind of just like inch you along

2197
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,838
one of the intuitions i had about the

2198
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,400
ways i was failing at running

2199
01:05:55,838 --> 01:06:00,239
is the form was probably not great like

2200
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:04,079
the the way to get

2201
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:04,639
to those 30 40 miles is to get the form

2202
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,640
right

2203
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:07,838
maybe i was doing too big of steps not

2204
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:09,199
so like

2205
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:10,960
playing with a different gate playing

2206
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:12,719
with a different kind of um

2207
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,798
the form kind of you have your form the

2208
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,399
economy the efficiency yeah

2209
01:06:14,798 --> 01:06:18,159
so that was the intuition like i was

2210
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,440
doing something wrong but i suppose

2211
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:21,358
that's the benefit of these kind of

2212
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,119
formulas it challenges you to think like

2213
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:25,838
how can i improve this kind of stuff

2214
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,400
well and it also it simplifies it so

2215
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:28,159
much

2216
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,838
that you're forced to right you're

2217
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:32,879
forced to optimize within that

2218
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:34,239
real strict parameter versus am i doing

2219
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,318
my short intervals right

2220
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,479
but my long run is wrong or am i doing

2221
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:39,279
my like long intervals right but my

2222
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,719
short intervals and

2223
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,920
you just it kind of complicates things

2224
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:42,719
when you start throwing a lot of stuff

2225
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,920
there

2226
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:45,838
and for most people especially when

2227
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,960
they're first getting started you know

2228
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:48,639
you're

2229
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,000
you can't over complicate it or you're

2230
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:51,038
just gonna like you're gonna do like a

2231
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,798
bunch of half

2232
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:54,559
right half wrong things and then not

2233
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:56,318
really know where your progress or your

2234
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:58,798
deficits are necessarily at

2235
01:06:56,318 --> 01:06:59,519
so i do think this is an amazing

2236
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:00,798
approach

2237
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:02,719
especially for people who are just

2238
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:04,000
getting into it and building that that

2239
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:06,959
foundation

2240
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
um where where i think maybe you want to

2241
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,039
deviate from that a little bit

2242
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,880
especially when you start to get into

2243
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:14,000
these events that are operating

2244
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,400
well outside that intensity so you take

2245
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,920
something like um you know let's say

2246
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,599
it's a race that takes you

2247
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,358
in the neighborhood of around like 12

2248
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:22,480
minutes or something like that

2249
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:24,000
then you're gonna be running

2250
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,920
significantly faster than your your

2251
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,719
maximum function pace

2252
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,920
so most of the research is going to say

2253
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:31,598
at some point in time you need to get

2254
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,880
around to practicing the pace at which

2255
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,599
you're going to perform at

2256
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,280
and really fine-tuning the mechanics the

2257
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,760
efficiencies

2258
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,960
how it feels how to judge it how to pace

2259
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,559
it at the pace

2260
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,159
you're going to try to compete at so

2261
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,280
there's obviously like a large range of

2262
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:46,879
targets there when we talk about the

2263
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,160
endurance world in general where

2264
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,680
you know you have these shorter events

2265
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:51,440
like five kilometers and you also have

2266
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:52,960
100 mile races which are gonna

2267
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,880
typically be quite a bit below your

2268
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,720
maximum road function and especially on

2269
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,599
these trailer races i need to admit

2270
01:07:56,719 --> 01:07:59,679
something so i

2271
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,680
don't measure the runs at all in terms

2272
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:04,558
of uh time

2273
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:05,038
uh because i get competitive with myself

2274
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,798
so i

2275
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,240
kind of decided that running for me is

2276
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:08,960
going to be this thing where i just go

2277
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:11,919
by feel

2278
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,318
is it possible to be that kind of runner

2279
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,838
and

2280
01:08:12,318 --> 01:08:16,318
you know still have running as part of

2281
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:16,880
your life and be a good performer in

2282
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,640
running

2283
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,239
i actually think that's that's where you

2284
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,838
want to get to

2285
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:24,399
the problem is most people have a hard

2286
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:24,798
time getting to that because they'll go

2287
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:26,318
out

2288
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:27,920
and they'll run with a friend and match

2289
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:29,520
their pace or they'll go out and they'll

2290
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,039
say well i want to run this pace so

2291
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,679
they'll target that pace

2292
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:36,000
or target a specific heart rate which is

2293
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,560
you know not necessarily how they maybe

2294
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,119
feel good doing it right so i think like

2295
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,039
once you

2296
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:42,640
i mean obviously i think when you put a

2297
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:44,079
race on the calendar

2298
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,679
if your goal is performance it's a

2299
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:46,719
little harder to just say like well i'm

2300
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,359
going to run whatever it feels good

2301
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,158
today

2302
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:50,480
because eventually you have to get

2303
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:51,920
around to doing what's specific but from

2304
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:53,759
just a fitness standpoint health

2305
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,920
standpoint enjoyment standpoint

2306
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,198
um i think it's totally fine to go out

2307
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,560
and say i'm gonna run what feels good

2308
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:59,759
today and you know maybe someday you

2309
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,199
will feel like at the end of the run i'm

2310
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,600
gonna do a couple sprints just to get

2311
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:03,519
some

2312
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,120
you know that because it does that one's

2313
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,640
a hard one to kind of jump start but

2314
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:07,920
once you do it and you realize how kind

2315
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,359
of good it feels maybe to throw in a few

2316
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,679
accelerations at the end of a run and

2317
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,440
then

2318
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:12,560
you you say oh wow that feels pretty

2319
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,278
good to do that i feel a little more

2320
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,880
accomplished

2321
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:16,719
that's right that's a forcing function

2322
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,279
but i i like to finish runs with sprints

2323
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,480
anyway

2324
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,239
okay because you're already there

2325
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:20,718
without right you don't need to the

2326
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:23,198
timing

2327
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,239
i'm afraid of the time of becoming a

2328
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:26,000
drug

2329
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:27,838
but the flip side of that it's a useful

2330
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,640
tool to get you to learn the right form

2331
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:31,679
the right

2332
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,640
feel like what it feels like to have to

2333
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,158
be in good shape

2334
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,759
and then you can throw out the time well

2335
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,879
i think too with with feel

2336
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,920
running and what i mean by that is

2337
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,759
that's kind of back to that perceived

2338
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,920
effort thing where like you do enough of

2339
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:44,640
it and you start being able to recognize

2340
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,440
like i can go out and if you said okay

2341
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,440
run

2342
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,479
you know 60 minutes at your aerobic

2343
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:51,039
threshold

2344
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:52,079
i could go i could know where that is on

2345
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:53,359
my heart rate

2346
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:54,719
and i could go there and just say like

2347
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,320
okay i know what that feels like and go

2348
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:58,480
and run that feel

2349
01:09:56,319 --> 01:09:59,599
and i'm going to hit that spot like i

2350
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:01,119
bet you if we looked at my heart right

2351
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,079
dad after it'd be right in there and i

2352
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:03,198
wouldn't have to look in some of that's

2353
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:05,679
just experience

2354
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:06,399
someone's just understanding like when

2355
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,000
like

2356
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:09,839
noticing the physiological responses

2357
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,960
when you cross over versus step a little

2358
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,560
bit to below it

2359
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,319
uh you can get yourself daydreaming and

2360
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,760
forget i'll do this sometimes too where

2361
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:17,840
i'll be tar because i'm kind of like you

2362
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:20,000
two or when i'm getting really fit

2363
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:22,000
uh especially with my foundation like i

2364
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,600
gotta you know i'm moving pretty quick

2365
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,198
at my aerobic threshold so

2366
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,480
like if i start daydreaming too much i

2367
01:10:25,198 --> 01:10:27,599
can notice oh i'm drifting back a little

2368
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:29,359
bit i look down on my heart right now oh

2369
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,800
yeah i'm 10 beats under

2370
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:33,039
you know so you do it does take a little

2371
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,760
bit of i think just uh awareness

2372
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:36,880
um but it's also not necessarily

2373
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,239
something where

2374
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,800
you have to be so exact that you're

2375
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:42,238
hitting you know an exact heart rate

2376
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,159
all the time there's usually a range and

2377
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:45,599
there's even like some fluctuations

2378
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:46,639
where like if you've been healthy for a

2379
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,719
year or two

2380
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,480
without any injuries and you've been fit

2381
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,800
that you can probably add five beats to

2382
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:52,158
your

2383
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,520
maximum rolex function if you're using

2384
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:55,439
that as kind of your your target from

2385
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,280
the 180 minus your age formula

2386
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:58,559
so let's try this lay this out for

2387
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:01,439
yourself but for others

2388
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,320
you you offer ready-made plans for

2389
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:04,559
people

2390
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:06,799
you know depending on their i think the

2391
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,920
key the thing there is the distance

2392
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,400
maybe you can elaborate but

2393
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,840
what does that plan look like usually

2394
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:16,238
what are the key

2395
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,880
options as you already kind of mentioned

2396
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:21,678
and how does your week look like

2397
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:24,319
how do a lot of people's week look like

2398
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:26,640
in terms of splits are we talking about

2399
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:27,679
um you know in terms of rest days in

2400
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,239
terms of

2401
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,560
how often do you do speed work versus

2402
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:34,959
longer distance you mentioned long runs

2403
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,199
like is there something you could say

2404
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:40,319
that's generally applicable

2405
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:41,839
about the the structure of these plants

2406
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:44,319
the ready-made plans i definitely follow

2407
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,319
like a philosophy um and it's gonna be

2408
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:48,559
like kind of like a lockstep in that

2409
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:49,840
um so for those like there's just always

2410
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,360
gonna be a sacrifice when you do like a

2411
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,039
ready-made plan because there's

2412
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:54,719
you're removing the individual contacts

2413
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:55,840
there so for folks who are like really

2414
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,960
want to get into the weeds

2415
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,079
i usually do like a personalized

2416
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:59,520
coaching plan with them where we sit

2417
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:00,880
down we actually look at their strengths

2418
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,360
their weaknesses

2419
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,640
and really kind of go in from that

2420
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:06,960
perspective

2421
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,000
and fine-tune it and it also like it

2422
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,119
avoids a situation

2423
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,760
where oh my ready-made plan says i'm

2424
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:13,599
supposed to do

2425
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,960
this run today but i don't feel great

2426
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,760
today so what do i do and then some

2427
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,399
people are fine with that because

2428
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,560
they're

2429
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:20,079
they're they're aware enough of like the

2430
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,679
process that they can

2431
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:23,600
adjust it themselves other folks just

2432
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,960
need a little more support so

2433
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,800
um that's kind of the difference there

2434
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,279
but in terms of the structure of it

2435
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,480
it kind of goes with an approach where

2436
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:32,639
we're saying you build this

2437
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,399
foundation you're going to spend you

2438
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,079
know usually anywhere between 8 to 12

2439
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:37,679
weeks just building up

2440
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:38,960
your your aerobic foundation you're

2441
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:39,440
going to be doing a lot of stuff that

2442
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,679
are kind of

2443
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,198
at i call them base runs but they're

2444
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,640
basically your maximum aerobic function

2445
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:45,678
or you're up to your aerobic threshold

2446
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,960
type stuff

2447
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,480
and they're really going to get really

2448
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,560
fit with that and once they kind of have

2449
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:51,839
that foundation laid then it's time to

2450
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,280
get into the specifics of whatever

2451
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,279
distance they're doing

2452
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:56,639
so if it where it'll differ we'll be

2453
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:57,840
like if they're doing

2454
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,560
right now on those plans i think i've

2455
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:03,279
got 5k half marathon marathon 50k

2456
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,000
80 to 100k and then 100 miles so if they

2457
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:05,519
pick a 5k

2458
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,719
plan the order of operations is going to

2459
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,600
be different than if they picked the 100

2460
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,840
mile plan

2461
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,360
you're going to see some of the same

2462
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,079
workouts show up in that plan it's just

2463
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:15,439
going to be different

2464
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:18,719
areas of it so once they're really fit

2465
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:20,319
at that you know that foundational level

2466
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:21,840
then you know if they're doing say a

2467
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:23,759
hundred mile plan they might start doing

2468
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,840
some short intervals which i would

2469
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,280
on my plans i usually range between 30

2470
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,960
seconds up to four minutes it's kind of

2471
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:30,319
that short interval range

2472
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,079
can you describe what you mean by short

2473
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:35,679
intervals it's like a sprint

2474
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:37,760
and a rest yeah yeah so i'll use

2475
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,600
basically like i'll use like a basically

2476
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,360
a 12-minute time trial

2477
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,120
and that's going to kind of like dictate

2478
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,719
for them what the intensity and the pace

2479
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:46,559
is going to be for some of those

2480
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:47,840
when they're under a minute they'll push

2481
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,600
past that a little bit

2482
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,279
um but usually when we're up to like

2483
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,679
above a minute and certainly up to four

2484
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:54,000
minutes

2485
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:55,679
like whatever pace or intensity that

2486
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,279
they get for that kind of 12-minute time

2487
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,960
trial where they're just seeing how far

2488
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:01,920
they can go in 12 minutes

2489
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,279
is gonna be um kind of like about where

2490
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,480
they're gonna target for those intervals

2491
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:05,198
so then those intervals are gonna be

2492
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:06,399
structured

2493
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:08,158
let's say they're doing two minute

2494
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:08,799
intervals they're gonna do two minutes

2495
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:10,158
at that

2496
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,679
intensity that they could do for 12

2497
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:12,559
minutes at a time trial then they're

2498
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,399
gonna do a two-minute

2499
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,920
real easy job or maybe even walk just to

2500
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,359
kind of bounce back and they're gonna

2501
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,760
repeat it how do you figure out

2502
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:21,599
uh how far you can go in 12 minutes is

2503
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,280
that just a trial and error you build up

2504
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,880
to it there's formulas what

2505
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:26,639
yeah there's some newer formulas that

2506
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:30,719
are probably a little less uh

2507
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:33,280
um brutal uh where you kind of

2508
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:36,000
uh i haven't really dove into these that

2509
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:38,000
that in depth yet i know like um

2510
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
that you can kind of replicate it by

2511
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,719
doing like a short a very short interval

2512
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,399
and then a slightly longer one um

2513
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:45,920
and then like another one where like at

2514
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:47,359
the end when that last one will kind of

2515
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,119
indicate what it is

2516
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:51,198
uh and so you're doing less of it to get

2517
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:53,198
the same answer to the question

2518
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:54,639
but sometimes i think when it's someone

2519
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:56,479
who's new

2520
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,760
i'd rather them just do a 12-minute time

2521
01:14:56,479 --> 01:15:00,079
trial because

2522
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,840
it's easy for them to execute in the

2523
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:03,439
sense that it's pretty clear you do a

2524
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,360
warm-up you do some strides maybe some

2525
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:06,799
dynamic stretches then you just run

2526
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:08,559
as hard as you can for 12 minutes as

2527
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,520
evenly paced as you can manage

2528
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,560
and i mean if the if it's going to

2529
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:17,199
produce the data i'm looking for

2530
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,760
uh no matter what happens it'll produce

2531
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:20,238
the data

2532
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,760
yeah i mean you can you can screw it up

2533
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:23,119
i guess you can go way too fast then you

2534
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,000
have this scenario where like oh it

2535
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:25,119
looks like you're

2536
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,319
you know your first two minutes were

2537
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:27,359
drastically faster than your last two

2538
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:29,920
and then it's like we

2539
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:31,679
maybe screwed that one up but um but i

2540
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,520
mean really like you don't even need to

2541
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,560
do the time trial technically

2542
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,480
um a lot of times you can go off of feel

2543
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:41,920
like what we described with um

2544
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:45,279
the threshold stuff and and you know

2545
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:47,920
it's a high enough intensity where where

2546
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:49,279
like you can start to kind of like your

2547
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,640
body is going to kind of limit you to a

2548
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:52,079
degree where

2549
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,280
if i just said we didn't do the time

2550
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:53,920
trial and just started doing the

2551
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:56,639
intervals

2552
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,920
we could figure out that you know if

2553
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,440
they're doing them right or not

2554
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,719
if we see a scenario where oh it looks

2555
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:02,719
like these first two intervals were

2556
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,480
significantly slower than the last two

2557
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:06,158
chances are we're still not quite dialed

2558
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:07,439
in in terms of what the intensity is

2559
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:09,679
that you should be targeting for those

2560
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:11,519
and as you do a few you just get to know

2561
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:13,039
the pacing of it a little better and

2562
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,239
then you start seeing more even splits

2563
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:15,679
so like you know their first two minute

2564
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:17,039
intervals pretty close within a couple

2565
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,079
seconds of their second or

2566
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:19,920
you know i guess we'd be looking at

2567
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:20,399
distance if we're doing time so like you

2568
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,920
went

2569
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:23,759
approximately the same distance on that

2570
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,719
last one as you did the first one

2571
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,719
and then we're just looking for

2572
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:27,920
improvement over time so you know we

2573
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:29,840
might spend

2574
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,960
four six weeks kind of focusing on

2575
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,719
improving that

2576
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,560
we're going to still include kind of

2577
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:36,000
foundational running volume where you're

2578
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,679
gonna be running like an easy pace an

2579
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,600
enjoyable pace kind of in the interim

2580
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:40,880
and then there's gonna be some rest days

2581
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,360
and that's gonna be where the levels

2582
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,880
come in

2583
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:44,399
my like level one plans are gonna be

2584
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,480
like four day a week training plans

2585
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:48,158
level two are gonna be five day level

2586
01:16:46,479 --> 01:16:48,879
three are gonna be six day with one day

2587
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:50,879
off

2588
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,560
um and you can obviously operate outside

2589
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,679
of those those those are just the ones

2590
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,120
that i put up for the ready made when

2591
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,719
i'm coaching people kind of personalize

2592
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:58,719
we just we look at like what their

2593
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:00,319
history is with running their schedule

2594
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:01,760
all sorts of stuff because

2595
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:03,119
oftentimes people get hung up on like

2596
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,000
well what are the elites doing what are

2597
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,679
the professionals doing what are the

2598
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,279
olympians doing it's like well

2599
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,560
it's like what the olympians are doing

2600
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:09,279
is they're waking up and they're living

2601
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,120
and breathing

2602
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:13,439
everything around this one race that

2603
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:14,719
they're gonna do in four years or

2604
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:16,158
so it's like we need to step away from

2605
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,600
that if you're working you know 10 hours

2606
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:18,399
a day and you've got kids and all this

2607
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,120
other stuff too

2608
01:17:18,399 --> 01:17:22,238
so um there's a lot of variables that

2609
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:23,519
make it more interesting to coach

2610
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:26,079
someone who's actually like

2611
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:28,960
not an elite athlete or someone who's a

2612
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:30,719
professional athlete i should say

2613
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,600
the but but yeah so they're gonna do

2614
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:36,560
that stuff those those shorter intervals

2615
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,360
um for probably about like four to six

2616
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,199
weeks if they're doing

2617
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:41,119
if they're doing a longer race like 100

2618
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:42,719
miles if they were doing say a 5k

2619
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:43,599
we'd start bringing those workouts in

2620
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:44,880
near the end of their plan because

2621
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,440
that's gonna be specific to their race

2622
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,800
pace

2623
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:48,960
that's gonna be the intensity that maybe

2624
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,480
they're doing for you know like a 3k or

2625
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,760
5k or something like that so it's going

2626
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:52,959
to be more relative to what they're

2627
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,960
going to use

2628
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,880
so it follows that philosophy the plans

2629
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,198
follow that philosophy of weaknesses

2630
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,319
and least specific stuff early and then

2631
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:03,678
we start phasing

2632
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:05,359
closer to most specific stuff

2633
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,279
and strengths as you get kind of near to

2634
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:09,039
the end of the plan and and then

2635
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:10,238
the distance of or the time that you're

2636
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:11,760
going to spend out doing whatever event

2637
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:13,119
it is going to dictate how those kind of

2638
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,880
get ordered in there

2639
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:16,319
i wonder if i could ask you for some

2640
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:19,359
sort of advice

2641
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,079
maybe almost uh maybe look at me as a

2642
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:23,759
case study

2643
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:27,439
of a particular runner and then

2644
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:29,920
see how we can plan stuff out so

2645
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:31,519
which contacts to give okay so i have

2646
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,199
been first let me say how much

2647
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,600
we're currently in austin i want to say

2648
01:18:33,198 --> 01:18:38,238
how much i love austin for many reasons

2649
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,800
uh first and foremost people are super

2650
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:41,839
kind

2651
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,760
and just like there's so much love

2652
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,279
that i've experienced immediately when i

2653
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,520
came to the city versus

2654
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:48,399
many of the other cities i've been in

2655
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,719
it's uh

2656
01:18:48,399 --> 01:18:52,399
it's not quite as welcoming and full of

2657
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:54,560
kindness immediately

2658
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,439
i i mean i really love love it here in

2659
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,640
austin

2660
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:58,960
and because i've been going through a

2661
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,920
bunch of stressful stuff i just kind of

2662
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,880
gave myself

2663
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:05,359
a chance to say okay i'm gonna stick to

2664
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:08,880
a diet of carnivore or keto

2665
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:12,399
but i'm going to eat as much as i want

2666
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,199
because uh primarily because this

2667
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:14,960
barbecue

2668
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:17,039
was part of the love i was getting here

2669
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,560
and i was like either i resist or just

2670
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:19,920
give in and i decided to give in and

2671
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,039
actually use this as an opportunity to

2672
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,760
relax and have fun

2673
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:25,039
for the past three four months plus

2674
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,960
whiskey and so on

2675
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:28,479
and then the training kind of i also let

2676
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,239
go of the training a little bit

2677
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:32,559
just to relax to really focus on the

2678
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:33,759
work focus on the love i've been getting

2679
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,920
all those kinds of things

2680
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,960
but now i just kind of want to set a

2681
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:38,960
goal for myself

2682
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,239
to get back into both competing and

2683
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:43,198
grappling

2684
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:44,158
but also doing a um hanging out with

2685
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:46,158
david goggins

2686
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:48,079
and uh doing a conversation with him but

2687
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:50,799
almost this is my own personal kind of

2688
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:53,359
race that i'm looking forward to and

2689
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,199
in terms of distance that means running

2690
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:58,960
with david

2691
01:19:55,198 --> 01:20:01,839
uh something like a marathon plus plus

2692
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,640
it's like it's unclear what plus so my

2693
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,440
goal would be

2694
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,480
to continue eating carnivore which is a

2695
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:07,839
whole other topic

2696
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:10,238
i'd love to talk to you about i feel

2697
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:11,840
great psychologically

2698
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:14,000
sort of in terms of mental performance

2699
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:16,639
in my work when i eat carnivore

2700
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,679
and physically i love it i've never felt

2701
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:22,239
any kind of need for carbs

2702
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:23,760
to uh to improve performance in my

2703
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:25,439
running or anything else

2704
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,880
combine that with fasting intermittent

2705
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:30,638
fasting or eating once a day

2706
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:33,359
i just that's when i feel the best

2707
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:35,679
what else i also feel best and this is

2708
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:38,319
something you can push back on

2709
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:40,319
i feel best when i just run every day

2710
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:43,599
like no breaks ever

2711
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:46,799
and usually the same way

2712
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:48,880
every day so like i know this is

2713
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,119
suboptimal it'd be interesting to hear

2714
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,000
your opinion of just how suboptimal that

2715
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:53,840
is

2716
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,679
uh so i think that actually lays out

2717
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:57,520
like where my mind is i'm happy eating

2718
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:01,199
carnivore once a day

2719
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,560
i like running every day the goal is to

2720
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:05,599
run a marathon in

2721
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:07,520
two months ish two months plus

2722
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,440
and then about three months to do a

2723
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:12,480
bunch of competitions and grappling

2724
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:14,158
okay with those parameters i think like

2725
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:15,839
you actually probably would be a great

2726
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:16,799
candidate for a maximum heroic function

2727
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,639
training strategy

2728
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,480
like you want that consistency where i'm

2729
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:22,960
going to do the same thing each day

2730
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:24,718
uh you don't want to beat yourself up so

2731
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,840
much any one day that you can't get out

2732
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,239
and do it the next one that's the sweet

2733
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:31,600
spot with maximum rolex function is

2734
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:33,839
the the the trademark there is that you

2735
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,920
you can keep going and keep doing it

2736
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,520
again and again and again because

2737
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,880
as long as you're not you know going out

2738
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,920
one day and trying to do twice as much

2739
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:41,840
as what you're ready for

2740
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,039
for that one specific the key for you is

2741
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,600
gonna be picking the right starting

2742
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:45,760
point

2743
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,480
and then building from there on what

2744
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:52,159
that day kind of entails in terms of

2745
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:53,519
how much running you do so um

2746
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:55,198
where you could maybe get creative would

2747
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:58,400
be if you decided that

2748
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:58,879
it's a hard fast rule that you run an

2749
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:00,960
hour

2750
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,319
every day seven days a week but we find

2751
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,639
out that to run

2752
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:06,079
your maximum robot function means you

2753
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:07,039
probably are better off sticking to 30

2754
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:08,639
minutes

2755
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:10,800
then what you would maybe do is you

2756
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:12,719
would run underneath

2757
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,279
your maximum aerobic function for the

2758
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:16,560
first 15 minutes in the last 15 minutes

2759
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:17,840
maybe throw some of those strides in

2760
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,639
there if you want to do that at the very

2761
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,239
end

2762
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,400
and then that middle 30 minutes is going

2763
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:25,599
to be maximum rolex function target

2764
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:26,879
and then maybe after you know four weeks

2765
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,320
you start noticing you know what

2766
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,239
this 30 minutes isn't wearing me out

2767
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:31,599
near as much as it used to um

2768
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:33,198
i feel like i could easily push past

2769
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,719
that well let's up that to 40 minutes so

2770
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:36,799
that's 60. you're always staying within

2771
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:38,639
that 60 minute parameter that keeps

2772
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,639
your schedule consistent your routine

2773
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:41,840
consistent i'm wearing a heart rate

2774
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:44,319
monitor to sort of

2775
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,760
as i run to monitor it sure absolutely

2776
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:48,079
you could do that you could go

2777
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,920
perceived effort um i like to use them

2778
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:50,880
in tandem in the sense that like early

2779
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,079
on i'll

2780
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,400
maybe look at my heart rate a little

2781
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:56,399
more often especially for shorter

2782
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:57,920
length there is heart rate can get messy

2783
01:22:56,399 --> 01:23:00,559
the longer you go so

2784
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,079
i i end up kind of maybe stepping away

2785
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:04,480
from heart rate a little more

2786
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:06,079
than some will at a certain point

2787
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:07,599
because i'm ultimately i'm going to be

2788
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:09,119
usually training or working with someone

2789
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,800
to run like you know a race that's

2790
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:11,840
really long and they have cardiac drift

2791
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,679
dehydration

2792
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,960
heat and things that are gonna make the

2793
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:17,520
heart rate super messy

2794
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,880
yeah but you're probably your ability to

2795
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,760
measure perceived effort is

2796
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,520
exceptionally good

2797
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,119
mine is actually really weak okay heart

2798
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,639
rate then i need to do this still the

2799
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:25,599
work of connecting heart rate to the

2800
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:27,279
perceived effort

2801
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,880
yep and that's exactly what i would use

2802
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:29,359
heart rate for then and you'll get to a

2803
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,279
point

2804
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:32,399
probably by like in the first couple

2805
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:34,800
months where

2806
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:36,559
you you can still lean on heart rate if

2807
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,440
you want but it'll be kind of one of

2808
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,199
those things where you

2809
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:40,719
you keep looking at you're like oh wow i

2810
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:42,000
can guess it you play a game with

2811
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,880
yourself too you can say well how close

2812
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,800
can i guess

2813
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,480
yeah you'll get it so like for me what

2814
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,360
i'll do is i'll go i'll do the run and

2815
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:48,718
then i'll look at the heart rate

2816
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:50,238
afterwards and be like oh cool i was

2817
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:51,520
right there yeah or i remember

2818
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:52,718
feeling like i was speeding up a little

2819
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,040
bit there and there are shows right

2820
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:57,198
there on the heart rate

2821
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:58,479
i also love sort of something we haven't

2822
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:00,079
talked about i love push-ups and

2823
01:23:58,479 --> 01:24:02,879
pull-ups so like body weight

2824
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:04,639
workouts again it's mostly mental i just

2825
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,679
enjoy the mental challenge of it i also

2826
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:07,600
like

2827
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:09,679
it makes me feel like if all i'm doing

2828
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,800
is running it makes me feel i'm

2829
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:14,880
not like uh one-dimensional

2830
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,000
yeah one-dimensional i mean there's some

2831
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,800
aspect to running

2832
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,319
that's not to be like hippy about it but

2833
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,520
like you know you're it's you're with

2834
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:24,079
nature you're running

2835
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:25,440
in it's like we're born to do this thing

2836
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:27,519
in that same way i feel like when i'm

2837
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:29,198
doing push-ups and pull-ups

2838
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,280
i feel like i was born to do that kind

2839
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:33,519
of stuff like it's like this

2840
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:34,319
body weight exercises have that way

2841
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,400
about them

2842
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:38,960
it's it doesn't have that dumbbell feel

2843
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:40,719
or doing bench press or squats

2844
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:42,399
squats with weight when you're just

2845
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:44,239
doing squats

2846
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:45,519
uh body weight when doing push-ups and

2847
01:24:44,238 --> 01:24:48,238
pull-ups body weight

2848
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,199
and just basic ab stuff core stuff body

2849
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:50,959
weight

2850
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:52,319
i don't know i just love the way i feel

2851
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,840
doing that so it's usually

2852
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:55,599
i forgot to mention that part i combine

2853
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,279
that with the running afterwards

2854
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,039
doing some basic body weight stuff yeah

2855
01:24:57,279 --> 01:25:01,119
and i think like you're gonna get

2856
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:03,039
from if we're not looking at it from

2857
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:06,158
like specifically like

2858
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:06,960
training at a pace in order to get both

2859
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:09,198
the

2860
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,039
skeletal muscle adaptations as well as

2861
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:12,479
the cardiovascular benefits

2862
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:13,760
you're probably tapping into some of the

2863
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:14,479
higher intensity stuff with that body

2864
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,520
weight stuff this

2865
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:19,839
and unless you're doing i guess no rest

2866
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,280
it's okay so is it you're getting pretty

2867
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,679
high heart rate from that yeah yeah very

2868
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:23,599
hard

2869
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:25,440
okay higher than running yep so you're

2870
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,960
tracking that box there from just like a

2871
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:29,759
lifestyle

2872
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:31,119
uh enjoyment fitness overall fitness

2873
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,719
standpoint

2874
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:34,800
uh i think you want to keep your running

2875
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:35,119
more aerobic then because you're getting

2876
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,320
that

2877
01:25:35,119 --> 01:25:38,158
and you're probably getting it from like

2878
01:25:36,319 --> 01:25:39,119
your grappling workouts too i would

2879
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:41,279
guess so

2880
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:42,800
there's just not as big of a need for

2881
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:45,198
you from an

2882
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,800
big picture standpoint to be doubling

2883
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:49,519
down on that stuff

2884
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:51,520
with your runs as well and it sounds

2885
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:54,560
like you prefer not to

2886
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:56,480
that's right so i mean um

2887
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,719
what about the distance of marathon

2888
01:25:56,479 --> 01:26:02,319
versus 100 miles is that big difference

2889
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:03,760
what's a good goal to work towards is it

2890
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:06,719
marathon and the rest of it

2891
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:08,400
just takes care of itself like yeah so

2892
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,920
you want to do a marathon and then

2893
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:11,359
ultimately do a hundred mile after that

2894
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,520
is that what you're saying i have no no

2895
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:15,198
i have no idea what the guy uh oh

2896
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,239
he's gonna tell you spot on what you're

2897
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:16,799
doing so you have to be ready for

2898
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:19,678
anything

2899
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,119
for anything right my own personal goal

2900
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:23,199
is to feel

2901
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:24,319
somewhat challenged but comfortable

2902
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:27,359
running a marathon

2903
01:26:24,319 --> 01:26:29,198
the longest i've ever run is 22 miles

2904
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:30,399
but i you know there's been many

2905
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:31,519
stretches in my life where i would

2906
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:33,198
regularly run

2907
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,560
like the long run would be close to 20

2908
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:36,559
miles so i

2909
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,159
you know and then i was comfortably

2910
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,880
running 10 miles

2911
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:42,399
four months ago it was like forever ago

2912
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:44,560
uh

2913
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:46,559
until i injured myself a little bit by

2914
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,800
running in the snow and stubbing my toe

2915
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,480
to where it was like you don't realize

2916
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:53,119
how much you appreciate your toes

2917
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:54,479
until you step big toes where all that

2918
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:57,599
power comes off yeah

2919
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:59,359
and so it's it it was surprising how

2920
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,520
long it took to heal

2921
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:03,279
uh and how essential it was and how

2922
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,239
unpleasant running how much hey hated

2923
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:06,079
running with it

2924
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:08,000
and then i kept like coming trying to

2925
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:09,039
get back out there to run to think i

2926
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,679
think it's okay

2927
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:12,719
and no it's not okay you really need to

2928
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:14,399
let it fully heal

2929
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:16,000
at least that was my experience i

2930
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:17,279
couldn't like just suck it up it was

2931
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,399
making it worse every time

2932
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:20,079
it's one of those injuries that could

2933
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,920
really feel even though it's so small

2934
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:23,519
[Laughter]

2935
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,840
it's essential so is there any

2936
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,400
difference between the goal of marathon

2937
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:30,000
or 100 miles would you say should i be

2938
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:31,198
prepping for 100 miles if that's at all

2939
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,279
a possibility

2940
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:35,599
the big difference is going to be like

2941
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:37,439
you're dropping intensity significantly

2942
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,719
by going up to 100 miles versus the

2943
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:40,479
marathon so

2944
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:41,840
the maximum roving function i think is

2945
01:27:40,479 --> 01:27:43,198
actually going to feed into that maybe a

2946
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,239
little bit better it's probably a little

2947
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:47,279
closer

2948
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:48,959
um depending on where i mean all it all

2949
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:50,639
varies a bit because like people people

2950
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,960
focus on specific distances and they'll

2951
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:54,319
get

2952
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,639
very efficient and very adapted to that

2953
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:57,759
so

2954
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:59,520
like the it kind of like it's what makes

2955
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,159
running kind of messy where like you'll

2956
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,639
get

2957
01:28:00,158 --> 01:28:04,960
for for example like the average person

2958
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,400
can hit their like lactate threshold for

2959
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,359
probably about like 60 minutes or

2960
01:28:06,399 --> 01:28:09,439
something like that whereas you get

2961
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:10,719
these elite marathoners who've been

2962
01:28:09,439 --> 01:28:12,719
basically spending their entire life

2963
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:13,520
preparing for a marathon race they can

2964
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:15,359
push

2965
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,960
almost up to their lactate threshold and

2966
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:19,359
after lactate threshold for

2967
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:21,520
almost like two hours so it gets a

2968
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:23,679
little messy when you start

2969
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,639
um looking at it from that lens but you

2970
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:25,920
don't really have to worry about that

2971
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:26,880
too much because you're not really

2972
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,039
focusing on

2973
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,560
being the best possible 100 miler or the

2974
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:31,359
best possible marathoner you could be

2975
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:33,039
you want

2976
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:34,399
enough overall fitness that you can just

2977
01:28:33,039 --> 01:28:36,639
do either one of them

2978
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:38,479
without absolute misery because you did

2979
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:41,279
the couch to 100 miles

2980
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:42,000
exactly so i think like for 100 miles

2981
01:28:41,279 --> 01:28:44,000
the biggest difference

2982
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,158
i think given your contacts is just like

2983
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,359
the more physical things you are doing

2984
01:28:46,158 --> 01:28:50,319
the better prepared you're going to be

2985
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:52,799
for the 100 mile so it's almost

2986
01:28:50,319 --> 01:28:54,158
given your context i wouldn't say

2987
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,520
irrelevant you want to be doing running

2988
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:56,719
but you're going to be doing that once

2989
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,080
you put it in your program it sounds

2990
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:01,119
like it's going to be pretty

2991
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:01,679
locked in um you're going to want to

2992
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:04,479
also

2993
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:05,760
like it if you view it this way it's

2994
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:07,359
probably going to be more mentally

2995
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,679
beneficial too where

2996
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:11,119
hey today i did my run i did my

2997
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,480
bodyweight exercises i did some

2998
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:14,800
grappling practice

2999
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:16,559
you know i spent three hours working out

3000
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,960
today yeah if you think of it like that

3001
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,880
then

3002
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:20,719
you know you're you're moving your body

3003
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,600
you're doing things that are

3004
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:24,079
active for a good chunk of the day

3005
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,560
especially

3006
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:28,399
relative to most people so that's gonna

3007
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,880
actually be very helpful for you

3008
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:32,559
uh the the problem or the the battle to

3009
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:35,039
get over is gonna just be like

3010
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,719
the you know you're gonna break down

3011
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:37,920
physically running a hundred miles

3012
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:39,920
and you're gonna break down physically

3013
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,560
running a marathon too so

3014
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:44,000
like the you might just have to push

3015
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,679
through a little more discomfort

3016
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,039
like from a physical standpoint compared

3017
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,359
to be if you decided

3018
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:50,238
i'm gonna do everything i can in these

3019
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:53,198
next like

3020
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:54,158
24 weeks to be able to run a full

3021
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:56,158
hundred

3022
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:59,359
a hundred miler would you say it's

3023
01:29:56,158 --> 01:30:01,599
physical or is it mental discomfort like

3024
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:02,639
uh i mean isn't everything physically

3025
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,039
uncomfortable like

3026
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:06,800
what uh do you train for if you're

3027
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:08,800
training for

3028
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:10,560
the chaos of uh so it's not necessarily

3029
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,639
100 miles it's the chaos of the

3030
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,239
unexpected which might include 100 miles

3031
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,880
but it might also include a thousand

3032
01:30:14,238 --> 01:30:16,638
push-ups

3033
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,079
yeah in my case so like you need a big

3034
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:19,679
jack-of-all-trades it's what you need to

3035
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,198
be yeah but also like building up the

3036
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:23,039
confidence

3037
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:24,479
or maybe not i don't know how do you

3038
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:27,119
survive um

3039
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:28,638
a thousand push-ups it's a combination

3040
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:30,238
of confidence that

3041
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:32,319
you have to know that you can do that

3042
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:34,238
kind of thing not necessarily the actual

3043
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:37,679
number but like

3044
01:30:34,238 --> 01:30:40,399
doing crazy stuff and the

3045
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:41,199
the second is probably okay the the base

3046
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:45,198
strength

3047
01:30:41,198 --> 01:30:47,759
and endurance and also just the

3048
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:49,439
practicing that process of not quitting

3049
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,679
i feel like that's one of the things i

3050
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:53,599
really need to do in the running space

3051
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:55,840
is like doing slightly unpleasant things

3052
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,560
where i'm practicing that like bringing

3053
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,679
my mind back

3054
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,400
and saying nope uh i'm gonna keep doing

3055
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,560
it and

3056
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:03,920
part of the running every day has that

3057
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,880
benefit because some days you really

3058
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,639
don't want to

3059
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:10,000
don't feel like running and doing that

3060
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:12,719
then you're practicing that muscle of um

3061
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,920
of doing it anyway um i don't know if

3062
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:15,359
there's something you can say in terms

3063
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,560
of advice how to practice

3064
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:19,519
the like doing something unpleasant

3065
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:21,679
every day

3066
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:22,639
yeah frequently yeah what i would do

3067
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:25,279
with that

3068
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:26,560
is i would try to make the unpleasant

3069
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:28,479
thing

3070
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,679
be different from one day to the next if

3071
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:32,319
you can so

3072
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:34,158
the fear i would have with making

3073
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:37,039
running unpleasant every time

3074
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:38,479
would be it becomes like a negative

3075
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:41,039
feedback loop

3076
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:42,319
in your physiologically potentially as

3077
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:45,279
well as mentally where

3078
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:46,479
if the entire running process is

3079
01:31:45,279 --> 01:31:47,759
miserable

3080
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:48,879
you're gonna be miserable when you step

3081
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,639
on that starting line whether it's a

3082
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:52,400
marathon or a hundred miles so

3083
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:54,400
you've trained yourself then running

3084
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:56,000
equals miserable well and here's the

3085
01:31:54,399 --> 01:31:56,319
thing like i mean if you look at just

3086
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,840
like

3087
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:59,359
here's where the literature says on

3088
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:01,440
paper are like the

3089
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:02,479
you know dozen workouts you should do in

3090
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:03,839
a training plan

3091
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:05,759
and this is how you should structure

3092
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,319
them right down to the minute and you

3093
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,000
just say

3094
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:09,759
like i'm gonna give everyone this

3095
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,600
schedule and they're gonna do this every

3096
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:14,480
time rinse and repeat

3097
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,800
my biggest concern with that approach is

3098
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:16,399
you

3099
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,480
are potentially putting them in a

3100
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:20,158
position where the training is so boring

3101
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:23,039
and so monotonous

3102
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:23,679
that like if they hit a roadblock

3103
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:25,279
mentally

3104
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:26,719
they're gonna fall apart very quick

3105
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:28,000
because they've already exhausted

3106
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:29,600
themselves mentally just trying to do

3107
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
the same old interval every time

3108
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,719
doing the same old you know workout and

3109
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,840
it doesn't

3110
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:37,600
have to be like one specific plan in its

3111
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,840
entirety could just be like

3112
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,039
like the the mix of things within it so

3113
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,199
like rather than like

3114
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:44,560
if i just said well we're gonna do three

3115
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:46,079
minute intervals through this entire

3116
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,960
short interval process or two-minute

3117
01:32:46,079 --> 01:32:48,399
intervals or

3118
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:50,719
four-minute intervals or 60-second

3119
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:52,638
intervals you know by that

3120
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:54,000
sixth week they might be so sick of that

3121
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:55,600
they're not actually maximizing their

3122
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,800
potential within that because there's no

3123
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,639
flavor there

3124
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,920
and and then they're also actually

3125
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:00,639
getting less out of themselves than they

3126
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,800
would if we just

3127
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:04,719
got a little more creative and said okay

3128
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:07,039
let's mix this up and let's do

3129
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:08,719
uh you know four one minute intervals

3130
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:10,399
then take a like a little bit of a break

3131
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:11,920
and then we'll do three minute intervals

3132
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:12,879
or at least changing it up from week to

3133
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,158
week so that they have something

3134
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,119
different showing up even though we're

3135
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:17,039
addressing the same kind of

3136
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:20,319
physiological adaptation

3137
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:21,760
uh so like i think what you want to do

3138
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:23,599
is you want to introduce the misery you

3139
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,440
want to be able to test yourself to the

3140
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,120
degree where like when you can recognize

3141
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:29,759
these points if i don't want to be here

3142
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:30,960
but i can do it push through it but

3143
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:34,079
recognize that

3144
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:35,600
like there's not necessarily going to be

3145
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:37,119
one event that you want to lean on to

3146
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,159
get that from because you won't want to

3147
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:39,359
make that one event

3148
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:40,879
so miserable that you don't want to do

3149
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:41,519
it when it comes time for the challenge

3150
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,920
so

3151
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,960
if you can possibly say like okay on

3152
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:48,079
tuesdays

3153
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:49,600
the push-up workout i'm going to go 10

3154
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:50,880
push-ups more than i want to i'm going

3155
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,920
to get to that point where i'm like

3156
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,719
there's no more and then i'm going to do

3157
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,679
10 more

3158
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:55,760
and you're going to make that one

3159
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:58,719
miserable and then maybe on

3160
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:00,400
uh you know thursdays you decide to do

3161
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:01,760
like some of those sprints or something

3162
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:03,039
at the end where

3163
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,560
you do a few of them and you're like

3164
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:05,760
okay this is where i'd be comfortable to

3165
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,800
stop like well i'm gonna do two more of

3166
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,920
them because i know i don't want to do

3167
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,159
two more of them

3168
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,840
but mix that up so you're not so at

3169
01:34:10,158 --> 01:34:12,319
least you're getting enjoyment from some

3170
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,159
of it

3171
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:15,359
and not just getting complete disgust

3172
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:17,920
from the entire process yeah

3173
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:19,599
there's actually quite a lot of ways

3174
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,440
that i can introduce misery into the

3175
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,920
push-ups and the running get creative

3176
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:25,519
including um you know even just like

3177
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,119
stuff outside of the running like taking

3178
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:29,040
uh freezing cold showers those kinds of

3179
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:31,279
things just introducing

3180
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:32,158
random kind of chaos into the into the

3181
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:34,079
system

3182
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:36,719
um or having conversations with people

3183
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:39,840
as an introvert it's terrifying

3184
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:44,480
more podcasts so

3185
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:46,159
i'm now starting uh the training and

3186
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:48,319
zac you've been kind enough to also kind

3187
01:34:46,158 --> 01:34:50,079
of be willing to help me out

3188
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:51,679
throughout this process so i look

3189
01:34:50,079 --> 01:34:54,479
forward to where that goes it's kind of

3190
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:55,679
uh fascinating um on the diet side

3191
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:58,718
you're

3192
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:01,118
one of one of the many things that uh

3193
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,880
make you fascinating is you've played

3194
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:05,519
with diet as well and you're

3195
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:07,118
um somewhat famous i would say for doing

3196
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,560
low carb or playing with low carb or

3197
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:11,198
meat based diets

3198
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,960
can you describe the potential like how

3199
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:16,079
you're thinking about that has evolved

3200
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,920
and the potential beneficial role of

3201
01:35:16,079 --> 01:35:19,118
a carnivore diet or a keto diet or a

3202
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,359
meat-based diet in

3203
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:22,799
training as an ultra marathon runner

3204
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:23,679
yeah and i think like where a lot of

3205
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,360
times things get

3206
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:27,520
confusing for people here is the context

3207
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:31,198
of it too where it's like they want an

3208
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:33,040
answer as to what do i eat for endurance

3209
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:34,638
sport it's like well endurance sport is

3210
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:36,000
quite wide ranging as we've talked about

3211
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:37,359
many many times here

3212
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,800
so there's going to be differences i

3213
01:35:37,359 --> 01:35:40,839
think in just like what you want to

3214
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,760
maybe necessarily prioritize

3215
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:45,360
uh both for the event you're doing and

3216
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,199
the intensity that's required for it the

3217
01:35:45,359 --> 01:35:48,639
training that's required for that event

3218
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:49,678
and then also the individual component

3219
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:52,480
too where i think this one

3220
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:53,760
often gets overlooked where we tend to

3221
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:56,079
say like well

3222
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,480
we've got all these olympic medalists at

3223
01:35:56,079 --> 01:36:01,039
the marathon in below distance who

3224
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:02,399
are you know eating a moderate to high

3225
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:03,920
carbohydrate diet so

3226
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:05,759
everyone needs to do that if they want

3227
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:09,520
to reach their potential in

3228
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:11,199
you know say the 3k to the marathon and

3229
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,800
you know in a perfect world maybe that

3230
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:14,238
would be true but

3231
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,840
there's a lot of other variables that

3232
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:18,079
often get forgotten then

3233
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:20,000
that could positively or negatively

3234
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:22,000
impact that decision choice so

3235
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,600
i think dr jeff volk has done a great

3236
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
job of kind of highlighting this in the

3237
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,679
sense

3238
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,880
that you know when he works with people

3239
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,880
he works with people in the health

3240
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,639
sphere as well as the performance sphere

3241
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,000
and you know he's one of the main guys

3242
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:34,800
at virta health who's uh

3243
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,158
they've got like a 60 a success rate

3244
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:39,600
with working with folks with

3245
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:41,519
type 2 diabetes to reverse their type 2

3246
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,440
diabetes

3247
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,960
and i mean that's an astounding when you

3248
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:46,719
when you think of just any nutritional

3249
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,600
protocol at success rate they're all

3250
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:49,198
incredibly low

3251
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,039
they're very very low and the big

3252
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:52,559
difference with his

3253
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:54,158
is the coaching aspect of it like they

3254
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,440
give support so these people like have

3255
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:56,960
someone to turn to when they make a

3256
01:36:55,439 --> 01:36:58,000
mistake or if they're thinking about

3257
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,000
doing something differently or they

3258
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:01,920
don't know what to do rather than just

3259
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,359
kind of throwing throwing it all up in

3260
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,960
the air and quitting they

3261
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:06,238
they have a resource there and that's

3262
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,679
probably a big reason why that's the

3263
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:09,118
success rate that they have with that is

3264
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,920
they put those support mechanisms in

3265
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:12,639
place

3266
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:14,000
that picture needs to be carried in to

3267
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:15,118
the performance world or the running

3268
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,158
world too where

3269
01:37:15,118 --> 01:37:18,880
you know we may have just been

3270
01:37:17,158 --> 01:37:23,039
identifying

3271
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:26,319
that uh you olympic distance athletes

3272
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:28,880
that can tolerate a very large portion

3273
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:30,880
of their diet come from carbohydrate

3274
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:32,719
is gonna just it's gonna filter those

3275
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,880
ones towards the olympics

3276
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:36,880
filter those towards interesting yeah

3277
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:39,679
and that doesn't mean that like

3278
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:41,118
uh if we would have taken say the gold

3279
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:42,560
medals in the 5k and put them on a low

3280
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:43,359
carb diet they'd run faster they

3281
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,719
probably wouldn't

3282
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:45,759
because we may have already selected

3283
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:47,359
that that person's thriving on

3284
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,360
carbohydrate

3285
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:50,719
what i would be interested in is like

3286
01:37:49,359 --> 01:37:51,920
you have let's say we have someone with

3287
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:54,880
equal talent

3288
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:56,319
but got weeded out along the way

3289
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,440
potentially because

3290
01:37:56,319 --> 01:37:59,279
for whatever reason they just weren't

3291
01:37:57,439 --> 01:38:00,559
able to tolerate like the both the

3292
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:01,840
training and the nutrition requirements

3293
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,199
that they're being told to do so the

3294
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:04,800
coach is kind there's a culture where

3295
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:05,599
the coaches would really push a carb

3296
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,000
heavy diet

3297
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,280
and that that would in itself would do

3298
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,479
the filtering process

3299
01:38:09,279 --> 01:38:13,840
of people that are not

3300
01:38:12,479 --> 01:38:15,599
it would filter out the people that are

3301
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,279
not able to tolerate carbs

3302
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,199
as part of their training i mean i might

3303
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:22,000
be an example of this actually where

3304
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:23,118
you know you take someone where uh they

3305
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,800
for whatever reason the carbs aren't

3306
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:26,319
working for them like it's unsustainable

3307
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,520
for them to continue that path or if

3308
01:38:26,319 --> 01:38:28,799
they do they might have a shortened

3309
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,000
career so they might be able to eke out

3310
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,880
a few really good years but then you

3311
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,319
know they're not going to be the person

3312
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,920
they're like wow that person's

3313
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:36,158
38 and they're still competing at the

3314
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,399
olympics type of a person yeah

3315
01:38:36,158 --> 01:38:39,279
and you know you you put them on a low

3316
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:41,439
carb diet

3317
01:38:39,279 --> 01:38:43,118
uh if you can control everything else

3318
01:38:41,439 --> 01:38:45,279
like their entire lifestyle is based

3319
01:38:43,118 --> 01:38:48,559
around training and racing

3320
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:51,359
then uh you know they may still

3321
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,719
have better potential by introducing

3322
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:55,198
carbohydrates

3323
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:55,840
at a higher level but if that's not

3324
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:57,359
gonna

3325
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,880
if that's not gonna be sustainable for

3326
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:01,039
them as a person

3327
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:03,279
then you know what's the point kind of

3328
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:05,600
at that unless they want to be like a

3329
01:39:03,279 --> 01:39:06,559
kind of a spark in the pan so to speak i

3330
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,199
just feel good

3331
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:10,639
eating meat performance wise well i

3332
01:39:09,198 --> 01:39:13,118
think there's that group too

3333
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:15,520
and they may just not be the olympians

3334
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:16,960
yeah and so we're not talking

3335
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,960
i guess this conversation has several

3336
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:22,000
layers one is for the olympics

3337
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:25,520
and one is for like

3338
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:27,520
what is it active athletes

3339
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:29,360
they're like amateurs whatever whatever

3340
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:31,280
category i put myself into like people

3341
01:39:29,359 --> 01:39:34,000
that exercise regularly

3342
01:39:31,279 --> 01:39:35,439
and then um maybe people and then

3343
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:39,520
there's people who like exercise

3344
01:39:35,439 --> 01:39:41,759
rarely so on all of those fronts

3345
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:43,360
i mean do you think it's possible to

3346
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:46,800
live a happy

3347
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:49,359
uh active life eating meat only

3348
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,320
or mostly meat yeah what have you

3349
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:52,639
learned about this

3350
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:53,519
yeah i think uh so for for some context

3351
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:55,039
like i followed

3352
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,719
what i would call a low carbohydrate

3353
01:39:55,039 --> 01:39:59,198
diet for the last 10 years

3354
01:39:56,719 --> 01:40:01,039
and just like kind of the training i

3355
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:02,559
periodize it to a degree where there are

3356
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:04,319
parts of my training where i do bring

3357
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:05,440
back a little more carbohydrate

3358
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:06,479
and there's periods of my training

3359
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:08,158
especially like the off season where i'm

3360
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:10,559
like very low and i might be like

3361
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:12,479
kind of in that ballpark of uh like you

3362
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,520
know ketogenic strict ketogenic or no

3363
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:15,279
carbohydrates for

3364
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,719
for periods of time and what kind of

3365
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:18,960
food are we talking about

3366
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:20,639
what's what's a strict low carb diet

3367
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:22,158
i've ranged everywhere from like mostly

3368
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:24,480
plant-based low-carb keto

3369
01:40:22,158 --> 01:40:25,759
to like mostly animal-based i've very

3370
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:27,359
rarely

3371
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,199
gone much more than like two weeks

3372
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:31,679
strict where it's like i'm

3373
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:32,638
strict carnivore or strict plant-based

3374
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:34,639
or anything like that

3375
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:37,039
like we're talking probably more like 95

3376
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:38,800
percent at that at the peak

3377
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:40,399
um in terms of any type of like like

3378
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:43,119
longer lasting

3379
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:43,920
uh from my personal experience of like

3380
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:46,319
being like

3381
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:48,319
either in like the animal food camp or

3382
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:49,359
like the plant based camp kind of of a

3383
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:51,118
process

3384
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:52,880
um so i've tried all of them things that

3385
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:54,639
stayed consistent over the 10 years is

3386
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,239
kind of the macronutrient profile

3387
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:57,679
that i've done throughout the course so

3388
01:40:56,238 --> 01:40:59,439
one didn't win over the other in terms

3389
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:00,800
of meat based versus plant-based oh for

3390
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:02,960
me meat based definitely

3391
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,960
was i mean i was i was my highest meat

3392
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:06,480
consumption in 2019 and that was by far

3393
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,480
my best racing season

3394
01:41:06,479 --> 01:41:10,079
yeah we keep coming back to that year

3395
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:11,839
that was a good year for many reasons

3396
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:13,519
philosophically and nutritionally

3397
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,920
yeah only 2020 happened and now i

3398
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:18,320
haven't had a really good chance to

3399
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:18,960
improve we'll see hopefully i've got

3400
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:20,479
some more

3401
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,639
yeah some more in the tank that's

3402
01:41:20,479 --> 01:41:24,799
strange there's so most athletes that

3403
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:27,118
compete at your level

3404
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:27,920
have more carbs integrated into their

3405
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:29,920
diets

3406
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,158
so what have you learned about using

3407
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:34,399
meat in high performance

3408
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:35,359
i think it's maybe less about the meat

3409
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:38,000
and it's more about

3410
01:41:35,359 --> 01:41:38,880
like what are you what is it replacing

3411
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,920
so

3412
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:43,440
if we go if we step away from like me

3413
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:45,039
specifically

3414
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:46,399
and just like the people that because i

3415
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:47,920
mean we're getting to the point i get

3416
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:49,279
it's anecdotes but like

3417
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,719
like that's what we have at the moment

3418
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:51,840
because there's i mean there is actually

3419
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:53,760
a study being done on

3420
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,360
like i think i guess they call it hyper

3421
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,960
carnivore where they're like

3422
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,880
i think above 80 percent of their intake

3423
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:00,158
from meat um

3424
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,319
and they're looking at a few different

3425
01:42:00,158 --> 01:42:04,559
things there but it's so weird and i

3426
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:06,399
keep interrupting but it's so weird that

3427
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:08,719
it sounds unhealthy

3428
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:10,479
uh hyper carnivore yeah but it makes me

3429
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:14,000
feel really good

3430
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:17,039
so it's the individual thing right yeah

3431
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,639
there's countless people now who like

3432
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:20,639
and i'm not saying that they could not

3433
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:20,960
have found another route myself included

3434
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:23,118
like

3435
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,880
in 2011 when i switched from moderate to

3436
01:42:23,118 --> 01:42:27,519
high carbohydrate low carbohydrate

3437
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,079
and saw some very noticeable differences

3438
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,639
in the way i

3439
01:42:28,079 --> 01:42:31,198
felt the way i performed in all this

3440
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:32,880
stuff

3441
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:34,799
that doesn't mean that there wasn't

3442
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,480
another path i just did not find that

3443
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:39,760
path and

3444
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:40,079
the the the fact that i found a path

3445
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:41,840
that

3446
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:43,359
was producing the results i was looking

3447
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,719
for is really all that matters in my

3448
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:45,679
mind you know like

3449
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:48,158
i don't really care if there was a

3450
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:51,039
parallel path that works just as well or

3451
01:42:48,158 --> 01:42:52,879
you know something like that because

3452
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:54,319
ultimately we only have one shot at

3453
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:55,920
everything we're doing so like

3454
01:42:54,319 --> 01:42:57,118
it'd be great if i could go back and try

3455
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,158
four or five different things well the

3456
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:00,238
annoying thing is

3457
01:42:58,158 --> 01:43:01,359
that the the body adjusts to whatever

3458
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:02,879
the heck you're doing so

3459
01:43:01,359 --> 01:43:04,479
you can't it's hard to do good science

3460
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,560
even on yourself yeah i've referenced my

3461
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:08,479
2019 racing season a few times and it's

3462
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:10,239
like it'd be silly for me to put all of

3463
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:12,559
the emphasis on my nutrition plan for

3464
01:43:10,238 --> 01:43:14,638
that because it also comes with

3465
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:16,639
two decades of endurance training so

3466
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:18,400
it's possible and it's very likely that

3467
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:20,159
a huge portion of that success was just

3468
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:22,079
the culmination of a lot of work over

3469
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:23,920
time from the training side of things

3470
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:25,198
i just think like any time you hyper

3471
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:27,920
focus on one

3472
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:28,960
area or pick a couple variables and just

3473
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,560
target those

3474
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:32,639
you find yourself in a position where

3475
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:35,440
you are you're putting other things in

3476
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:37,760
the most uncharitable light possible

3477
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:39,759
so so then you have this situation where

3478
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,360
like it's actually a combination of a

3479
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,400
variety of different things so where are

3480
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:45,118
the big movers

3481
01:43:42,399 --> 01:43:46,799
and you know for me nutritional shift

3482
01:43:45,118 --> 01:43:48,799
was pretty clear that that improved my

3483
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:51,520
sleep in my recovery

3484
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,000
and i mean people can say well there's

3485
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:54,400
the placebo

3486
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,319
effect which is a very real concern but

3487
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:57,679
you know for me personally a 10-year

3488
01:43:56,319 --> 01:44:00,960
placebo effect would be a

3489
01:43:57,679 --> 01:44:02,719
quite lengthy placebo effect and

3490
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:04,158
i do think it's individual though i i

3491
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:05,920
emphasize that a lot because i mean i've

3492
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:07,279
worked with tons of people with this and

3493
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,800
i do see a range

3494
01:44:07,279 --> 01:44:10,880
from person to person i've worked with

3495
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:13,039
people who come to me

3496
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:15,039
and they're like strict keto and we

3497
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:16,560
raise up their carbohydrates a bit

3498
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:18,479
and they're like okay i feel way better

3499
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:20,159
doing it this way and i've worked with

3500
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:21,759
people who they come to me moderate

3501
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:22,479
carbohydrate but they're interested

3502
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,199
enough

3503
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:27,039
um they want to try a lower carb so we

3504
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:28,079
you know we titrate them down and i've

3505
01:44:27,039 --> 01:44:29,519
had clients where

3506
01:44:28,079 --> 01:44:31,519
i'm like okay i'm gonna give them this

3507
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,239
workout and they're gonna wish they

3508
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,199
brought back a little bit of

3509
01:44:32,238 --> 01:44:34,319
carbohydrate

3510
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:36,479
and then they go and they nail the

3511
01:44:34,319 --> 01:44:37,519
workout and i'm just like baffled that

3512
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:39,198
because because they're different from

3513
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,199
me and every time you know when you have

3514
01:44:39,198 --> 01:44:43,439
your own personal experience

3515
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:45,198
the first the kind of guttural response

3516
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:46,319
is oh if i had done it would have gone

3517
01:44:45,198 --> 01:44:47,599
this way why did it go completely

3518
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:48,719
opposite way for them

3519
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,480
and you kind of have to just kind of

3520
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:51,840
step out of your own perspective a bit

3521
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:53,839
and say like okay well

3522
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,119
they're different you know for whatever

3523
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:57,840
reason they're getting

3524
01:44:55,118 --> 01:44:59,279
getting along like this i've had like

3525
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,199
several moments in my life where you

3526
01:44:59,279 --> 01:45:03,439
kind of realized

3527
01:45:01,198 --> 01:45:05,839
the body is weird and it's weirder than

3528
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:09,359
the average advice like one of them is

3529
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:12,159
how well i perform for my own standards

3530
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:14,639
when i fast uh first of all

3531
01:45:12,158 --> 01:45:17,439
intellectually but that's more known and

3532
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,880
and understandable but like physically

3533
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:22,000
yeah the fact that i could train

3534
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:23,679
like not eat 20 hours 24 hours and then

3535
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,840
do a hard

3536
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:26,800
like jiu jitsu session for like two

3537
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,760
hours

3538
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,000
like hard it's incredible to me like

3539
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,679
this

3540
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,158
makes no sense because i used to eat

3541
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:35,679
like many times a day

3542
01:45:34,158 --> 01:45:36,879
of course you have to eat like you don't

3543
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:38,399
want to eat too close to the training

3544
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:40,000
session what's my thinking

3545
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:41,439
but you definitely need to load up on

3546
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,359
carbs like three hours before

3547
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:44,960
like in order to have enough energy the

3548
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:48,319
fact that he could not eat

3549
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:50,560
and have like incredible focus but also

3550
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:53,198
athleticism like both

3551
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:55,119
endurance and explosive i mean jiu-jitsu

3552
01:45:53,198 --> 01:45:57,118
is a special thing it's like more like

3553
01:45:55,118 --> 01:45:59,279
chess yeah it's not like power lifting

3554
01:45:57,118 --> 01:46:02,079
no not power lifting olympic lifting

3555
01:45:59,279 --> 01:46:03,599
where it's like true explosiveness but

3556
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:05,039
that's fascinating and it makes me

3557
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:08,159
wonder like what other things

3558
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:09,039
are there to to um to discover about

3559
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:10,879
yourself

3560
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:12,560
the the annoying thing about food is

3561
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,560
it's delicious

3562
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,480
and so it's hard to do good science on

3563
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:19,039
yourself like to do

3564
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:19,599
you know for two weeks or a month to do

3565
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:22,800
like

3566
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:23,760
strict no carbs and then maybe next

3567
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:25,840
month you add

3568
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:26,960
20 grams or 40 grams of carbs and see

3569
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:29,360
how you actually feel

3570
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:30,960
right not like in that moment but over a

3571
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:32,639
period of several weeks

3572
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,239
and then doing everything else like

3573
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:35,840
right with based on

3574
01:46:34,238 --> 01:46:37,839
best available science like with the

3575
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:39,920
electrolytes and then vitamins

3576
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:41,279
but then also like remove all the humans

3577
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:43,199
from your life that affect you

3578
01:46:41,279 --> 01:46:45,039
yep positively or negatively because you

3579
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:46,960
might feel amazing because you're

3580
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:49,039
hanging out with cool people and then

3581
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:50,239
uh you know like removing basically all

3582
01:46:49,039 --> 01:46:52,319
the variables

3583
01:46:50,238 --> 01:46:54,399
it's kind of fascinating and you kind of

3584
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:56,079
all of us land in a place

3585
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:58,079
where we find something that worked for

3586
01:46:56,079 --> 01:46:59,840
us and then we maybe use some of the

3587
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:02,960
placebo effect to help us out

3588
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:04,400
to stick in that place and then uh

3589
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,079
i suppose that's the way to live life

3590
01:47:04,399 --> 01:47:07,198
because it's impossible to find the

3591
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:09,439
optimal for

3592
01:47:07,198 --> 01:47:11,359
any of us but carnivore is an

3593
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:14,638
interesting

3594
01:47:11,359 --> 01:47:16,319
new kind of caveat a new challenge to

3595
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:18,159
the nutritional community

3596
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:19,920
because more and more people seem to be

3597
01:47:18,158 --> 01:47:21,679
doing well under carnivore

3598
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:23,118
yeah well the nutrition community is

3599
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:24,800
probably we just got

3600
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:26,238
done like dealing with the vegans and

3601
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,600
now we got this opposite end of the

3602
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:29,359
spectrum coming at us

3603
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,800
but i think well i mean what this all

3604
01:47:29,359 --> 01:47:33,519
tells

3605
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,480
what this all tells me is like there is

3606
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:37,679
uh for one

3607
01:47:34,479 --> 01:47:40,319
like in our food environment like

3608
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:41,440
the failure rate of any one approach at

3609
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:42,399
a population level is going to be

3610
01:47:41,439 --> 01:47:44,638
incredibly high

3611
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:45,599
i mean it's why we have you know what is

3612
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:47,199
it like 88

3613
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,639
of the population has some sort of like

3614
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:50,399
metabolic syndrome

3615
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:51,840
and it's it's like you know it's because

3616
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:52,479
there's an endless quantity of

3617
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,520
everything

3618
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:55,839
that you can get your hands on for

3619
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:57,600
relatively cheap um

3620
01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:00,880
and i think that's that that presents a

3621
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:03,280
problem if your mindset is going to be

3622
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,159
we need this set of parameters for

3623
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:06,319
nutrition and

3624
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:07,439
everyone needs to adhere to that or

3625
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:08,559
you're wrong

3626
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:11,359
and it's like we'll tell that to the

3627
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:13,760
person who like went carnivore and

3628
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:14,639
cleared up some like crazy skin ailment

3629
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,719
or something like that

3630
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:18,719
that's a weird one yeah like where the

3631
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:21,520
carnivore seems to treat

3632
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:22,639
like like depression uh-huh it's like

3633
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,000
like mental stuff

3634
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:26,239
it's fascinating there's all these

3635
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,479
stories again it's anecdotes but it's

3636
01:48:26,238 --> 01:48:29,599
like

3637
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:31,439
the mental one i think may

3638
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,719
i'm stepping out a bit on a limb here

3639
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:34,399
but i want to say like

3640
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:36,399
some of the research of dominic d

3641
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:37,359
agostino and and jeff wallick was

3642
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:40,238
looking at

3643
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:40,719
the ketogenic diet which a carnivore

3644
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:43,039
diet

3645
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:44,399
is basically going to be a part of a

3646
01:48:43,039 --> 01:48:45,039
ketogenic i mean you could always go

3647
01:48:44,399 --> 01:48:47,118
like

3648
01:48:45,039 --> 01:48:49,279
way too high on the protein i guess but

3649
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:50,719
most people that i see doing carnivore

3650
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:52,880
they're cognizant

3651
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:54,399
enough that at least if they're doing it

3652
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:56,560
for therapeutic reasons

3653
01:48:54,399 --> 01:48:58,479
they're not going like you know 50

3654
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:02,480
protein 50 they're more like

3655
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:05,519
70 30 80 20 something like that and

3656
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:07,118
and i think like you you do see some

3657
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:08,560
some work with like the brain and so the

3658
01:49:07,118 --> 01:49:10,479
mental stuff i know

3659
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:12,000
some of the i'm not sure if this was

3660
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:15,039
part of the darpa funding that

3661
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,319
that dr dominic d'agostino had

3662
01:49:15,039 --> 01:49:18,639
where they were looking at things like

3663
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:20,639
mental stuff like post-traumatic stress

3664
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:22,159
disorder and that sort of stuff with

3665
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:23,840
with like a strict ketogenic diet so i

3666
01:49:22,158 --> 01:49:25,439
wonder if some of that like the

3667
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,039
depression related stuff has to do with

3668
01:49:25,439 --> 01:49:28,319
that where now like their body is just

3669
01:49:27,039 --> 01:49:29,519
fueling their brain differently than

3670
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:32,399
maybe they were in the past

3671
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:33,520
but um that's just you know wild guesses

3672
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:34,719
on my part

3673
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,400
um and i'm deviating from the

3674
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:36,880
conversation but like no that's

3675
01:49:36,399 --> 01:49:39,920
brilliant

3676
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:40,960
in terms of your own story on food can

3677
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,239
you say something

3678
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:44,239
we were i think we were kind of

3679
01:49:42,238 --> 01:49:46,079
referring to diet broadly

3680
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:48,000
can you say something about how you like

3681
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:51,118
to fuel

3682
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:54,158
your like whether it's race or great

3683
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:55,118
training sessions like maybe the day

3684
01:49:54,158 --> 01:49:58,559
before

3685
01:49:55,118 --> 01:50:01,359
let's go even that far during and maybe

3686
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:02,159
a few hours after okay it'll be a little

3687
01:50:01,359 --> 01:50:04,479
different

3688
01:50:02,158 --> 01:50:05,759
for racing than it will be for like a

3689
01:50:04,479 --> 01:50:06,799
big workout just because

3690
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,239
the interesting thing about ultra

3691
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,119
running is just like you never do the

3692
01:50:08,238 --> 01:50:10,399
race even

3693
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:11,439
like most endurance races you're going

3694
01:50:10,399 --> 01:50:12,719
to cover the distance you're going to

3695
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:15,118
replicate the race almost

3696
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:16,079
up to it in training whereas with 100

3697
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:17,839
miles

3698
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:19,118
you can't you might replicate a third of

3699
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,880
it so so

3700
01:50:19,118 --> 01:50:22,799
i'll do i'll walk you through kind of my

3701
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:23,840
approach for like 100 mile race and i

3702
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,760
can tell you maybe what i would do

3703
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:28,960
differently on like a training day

3704
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:30,159
uh but yeah so for um

3705
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:32,639
where where the community is in

3706
01:50:30,158 --> 01:50:33,920
agreement is that you do want to be

3707
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:35,359
very good at burning fat for

3708
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:36,719
ultramarathons i mean there's just like

3709
01:50:35,359 --> 01:50:40,079
the intensity is low

3710
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:43,039
if you're if your ratios are skewed

3711
01:50:40,079 --> 01:50:44,000
very high towards carbohydrate

3712
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:47,118
metabolism

3713
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,158
then you're going to have to defend your

3714
01:50:47,118 --> 01:50:50,880
muscle glycogen

3715
01:50:48,158 --> 01:50:51,279
through tons of carbohydrate consumption

3716
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,639
and

3717
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:54,399
that's just going to be very hard to do

3718
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:55,840
over the course of an entire day even at

3719
01:50:54,399 --> 01:50:57,598
low intensities

3720
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,960
so it's a fuel tank thing i mean it's

3721
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:00,319
like your your leanest endurance

3722
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:01,920
athletes have way more fat than they do

3723
01:51:00,319 --> 01:51:03,198
glycogen stores

3724
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,880
when you're doing low intensity

3725
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:06,559
performance you want to be burning high

3726
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,920
levels of fat and sparing that muscle

3727
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:10,880
glycogen

3728
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:12,480
what i tend to do is i want to start the

3729
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:13,039
race burning really high levels of fat

3730
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:14,319
so

3731
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:16,158
i'm gonna i'll maybe have some

3732
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:17,279
carbohydrate the night before for dinner

3733
01:51:16,158 --> 01:51:20,559
but then i'm gonna lean into the

3734
01:51:17,279 --> 01:51:22,079
overnight fast breakfast the morning of

3735
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:23,599
i'm gonna stay away from carbohydrates

3736
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:26,000
for a hundred miler anyway

3737
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:26,960
and i'm gonna have something like

3738
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,639
something that's pretty

3739
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:33,118
like a high energy low

3740
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:34,560
volume so like i'll do like an s fuels

3741
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:36,799
uh life bar

3742
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:38,719
they've got like what's in an s fuel

3743
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,440
life bar are we talking about carbs or

3744
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:42,000
we're talking about

3745
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:43,039
proteins basically fat and protein yeah

3746
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,359
fat protein bar

3747
01:51:43,039 --> 01:51:47,760
and they make sure that's awesome yeah

3748
01:51:45,359 --> 01:51:49,359
so it's it's not it's low carb

3749
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:51,360
yeah they make s fuels makes a whole

3750
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:53,839
product line that's like kind of

3751
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:55,679
positioned for a low carb athlete so

3752
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,159
they have some products on their lineup

3753
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:58,079
that

3754
01:51:56,158 --> 01:51:59,198
offer some carbohydrate which is perfect

3755
01:51:58,079 --> 01:52:00,880
for me because i do introduce some

3756
01:51:59,198 --> 01:52:02,638
carbohydrate on racing and some of my

3757
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:05,279
bigger training sessions and things

3758
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:06,400
but the majority of their products are

3759
01:52:05,279 --> 01:52:08,319
low carb

3760
01:52:06,399 --> 01:52:09,598
uh so like they have like you know how

3761
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:11,198
you get like the powders that you put

3762
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:12,880
into like your drinks that are like

3763
01:52:11,198 --> 01:52:14,479
high carbohydrate you know sports

3764
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:15,440
products they make a version of that

3765
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:17,598
that's uh

3766
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:19,118
like fat based oh cool that you can mix

3767
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:20,719
in with water yep

3768
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:22,000
cool yeah so they've got like a creamer

3769
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:23,359
version and then a fruity flavored

3770
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,039
version so you can like replicate the

3771
01:52:23,359 --> 01:52:26,799
taste and the feel of drinking like a

3772
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:28,158
like you know a sports drink science is

3773
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:29,520
awesome i know it is

3774
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:30,399
well and that's so much of it too

3775
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,360
because people are always like well i

3776
01:52:30,399 --> 01:52:32,479
don't know i just i

3777
01:52:31,359 --> 01:52:34,238
just like to have my gatorade or

3778
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:35,759
whatever right yeah it's like well you

3779
01:52:34,238 --> 01:52:36,879
can have it now just uh it won't have

3780
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:38,320
all that you can see you can bring that

3781
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:39,599
kind of thing with you

3782
01:52:38,319 --> 01:52:41,519
yeah so i'm leaning on a lot of those

3783
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:42,719
like kind of liquid calories like those

3784
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:45,360
low

3785
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:46,880
um volume high energy fat protein stuff

3786
01:52:45,359 --> 01:52:48,719
the morning of so that when i start the

3787
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,800
race my body's gonna be encouraged to

3788
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:52,158
start out burning high levels of fat

3789
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:54,639
once i get going

3790
01:52:52,158 --> 01:52:55,920
probably 45 minutes in i'll start

3791
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:58,000
introducing small amounts of

3792
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,000
carbohydrate so at that point my

3793
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,359
body's been revving pretty high fat

3794
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,399
metabolism

3795
01:53:01,359 --> 01:53:05,759
and by introducing some carbohydrate in

3796
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:08,638
the context of the

3797
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,840
you know let's say my hundred mile uh

3798
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:11,599
personal record

3799
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:13,440
you know i'm i'm running approximately

3800
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:14,800
nine miles every hour so i'm

3801
01:53:13,439 --> 01:53:16,799
probably going through about a thousand

3802
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:20,079
calories in an hour's time

3803
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:21,279
uh i'm gonna start just like defending

3804
01:53:20,079 --> 01:53:23,118
muscle glycogen

3805
01:53:21,279 --> 01:53:24,319
by burning super high levels of fat at

3806
01:53:23,118 --> 01:53:26,319
the heart rate i would do for that i'm

3807
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:28,639
probably burning somewhere between 80 90

3808
01:53:26,319 --> 01:53:30,799
fat you know 12 hours of that you can

3809
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:32,000
chip away at your muscle glycogen

3810
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,920
uh to the point where you don't

3811
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,520
necessarily want to go zero carb

3812
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:37,440
so i'm basically just trying to defend

3813
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,760
what i know i'm going to be burning from

3814
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:41,118
the

3815
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:44,159
carbohydrate side of that 80 to 90 fat

3816
01:53:41,118 --> 01:53:45,839
10 to 20 carbohydrate by taking in like

3817
01:53:44,158 --> 01:53:47,839
usually you know i've gone as low as

3818
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:49,760
about 15 grams of carbohydrate per hour

3819
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:51,440
and as high as 40 grams

3820
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:52,960
and the reality is somewhere in between

3821
01:53:51,439 --> 01:53:55,198
is probably the sweet spot but

3822
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:56,000
40 i can get away without any digestion

3823
01:53:55,198 --> 01:53:58,319
issues

3824
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,479
so i'm not really concerned pushing up

3825
01:53:58,319 --> 01:54:01,840
to that during a race since i'm

3826
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:03,519
only concerned about performance on that

3827
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:04,800
is it the car's that's the problem or is

3828
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:07,520
it fiber

3829
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:08,880
or just oh from going above 40 grams or

3830
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,360
just because you mentioned digestion

3831
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:11,840
issues

3832
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:12,399
like one of the things for me it's like

3833
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:14,639
one of the

3834
01:54:12,399 --> 01:54:15,598
cool things about fatty protein protein

3835
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:17,520
or fat

3836
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:18,800
is like my stomach just feels way better

3837
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:21,520
yeah like for

3838
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:22,800
so like carbs introduce like bloating

3839
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:24,639
and just not feeling great

3840
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,320
yeah and i think the funny thing is like

3841
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:28,239
if you look at the position paper for

3842
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:29,039
ultra marathon single day events and

3843
01:54:28,238 --> 01:54:30,559
it's

3844
01:54:29,039 --> 01:54:32,319
you know it's very limited in the sense

3845
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:33,599
that it's not anyone's fault it's just

3846
01:54:32,319 --> 01:54:35,279
we don't have a lot of great research on

3847
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:36,400
100 mile races it's really hard to study

3848
01:54:35,279 --> 01:54:37,519
what's going on when someone's running

3849
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:40,079
100 miles

3850
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:40,719
but they'll say moderate carbohydrate

3851
01:54:40,079 --> 01:54:43,198
diet

3852
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:44,560
is recommended but they'll also say that

3853
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:45,839
it's like something like 60

3854
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:47,440
of participants are gonna report some

3855
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:48,480
sort of like digestion issue during the

3856
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:49,839
event

3857
01:54:48,479 --> 01:54:51,439
so then it kind of becomes an issue of

3858
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:53,360
do you want to flip that coin do you

3859
01:54:51,439 --> 01:54:56,879
want to flip that coin maybe the 40

3860
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:57,759
right exactly so for me what i found is

3861
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,840
like

3862
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:01,920
i can push up to 40 grams without

3863
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:04,719
getting any digestion issues

3864
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:07,520
um do i need 40 grams probably not at

3865
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:10,880
least not based on kind of the numbers

3866
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:12,159
that would be like that that i would see

3867
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,760
on like if i went and actually got

3868
01:55:12,158 --> 01:55:15,920
like a metabolic heart test or something

3869
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:17,440
like that but it's possible i mean if i

3870
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:19,520
had a really good race that i would get

3871
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:21,279
close to burning that per hour

3872
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:22,880
um most folks that are following a

3873
01:55:21,279 --> 01:55:24,880
moderate high carbohydrate are going to

3874
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:26,560
be recommended do like 50 to 70 grams

3875
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,118
during a single day ultra marathon event

3876
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,880
and

3877
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:31,118
you'll see some you know some

3878
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:33,359
recommendations of up to like 100 grams

3879
01:55:31,118 --> 01:55:35,039
uh not so much for ultramarathons but

3880
01:55:33,359 --> 01:55:36,238
just in general from like a performance

3881
01:55:35,039 --> 01:55:37,599
standpoint which

3882
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:39,678
i mean it's one of those things where

3883
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:41,440
it's like application versus

3884
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:42,880
like what you can do in a lab for one

3885
01:55:41,439 --> 01:55:44,158
hour is gonna be a lot different

3886
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:47,359
especially when you're stretching out

3887
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:49,279
distances well past that and you

3888
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:50,639
there's there's i'm diverting a little

3889
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:52,158
here but i mean there's like an approach

3890
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:53,279
of like training your gut so you can

3891
01:55:52,158 --> 01:55:54,479
like

3892
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:55,840
be able to tolerate that much

3893
01:55:54,479 --> 01:55:57,198
carbohydrate which you can do and you

3894
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:58,800
may have to if you're gonna follow a

3895
01:55:57,198 --> 01:56:00,079
high carbohydrate diet

3896
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:02,239
but again we go back to that

3897
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:04,719
practicality standpoint of

3898
01:56:02,238 --> 01:56:06,799
if you're a professional olympian who's

3899
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:08,960
living and breathing performance

3900
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,840
and you're burning two to three times

3901
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:12,639
you're messing

3902
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,360
resting metabolic rate on some days like

3903
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:16,159
you

3904
01:56:13,359 --> 01:56:17,839
you may be able to actually consume 100

3905
01:56:16,158 --> 01:56:19,198
grams of carbohydrate per hour during

3906
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:21,279
your training sessions and

3907
01:56:19,198 --> 01:56:22,638
and just you know barely stay on top of

3908
01:56:21,279 --> 01:56:23,920
your nutritional needs

3909
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:25,679
most people who are running

3910
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:27,039
ultramarathons aren't going to be you

3911
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:28,560
know probably training much past 10

3912
01:56:27,039 --> 01:56:31,519
hours per week

3913
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:32,639
and they're probably not gonna have the

3914
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:35,280
i'll call it their

3915
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:37,118
a dietary budget to tolerate a hundred

3916
01:56:35,279 --> 01:56:38,639
grams of carbohydrate consumption during

3917
01:56:37,118 --> 01:56:40,960
their workouts and still be able to

3918
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:42,159
stay healthy and uh you know so i think

3919
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:45,439
that's kind of like a

3920
01:56:42,158 --> 01:56:46,799
a bit of a of a non a non-starter for

3921
01:56:45,439 --> 01:56:48,719
the majority of people

3922
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:50,639
unless we want to talk about like a tiny

3923
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:52,319
percentage of the one percent of

3924
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:54,000
top performers so maybe you can talk

3925
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:55,198
about the training like feeling yourself

3926
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,800
during training as well

3927
01:56:55,198 --> 01:57:00,238
is there and also as part of that is it

3928
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:04,480
possible to train

3929
01:57:00,238 --> 01:57:08,959
mostly fasted because as a side comment

3930
01:57:04,479 --> 01:57:10,718
let me just say i like again not

3931
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:12,560
you are not even like one tenth of your

3932
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:15,118
level of performance but you know i

3933
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:16,800
i try to push myself and i just feel

3934
01:57:15,118 --> 01:57:19,519
much better when i'm fasted so

3935
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:21,279
water and maybe some salt for longer

3936
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:24,320
runs for anything over like 10

3937
01:57:21,279 --> 01:57:26,000
15 miles but not no food yeah i think i

3938
01:57:24,319 --> 01:57:27,920
mean i like to train on an empty stomach

3939
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,439
uh i do most my my biggest training

3940
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:31,118
session usually in the morning and

3941
01:57:29,439 --> 01:57:32,559
it usually will determine whether i eat

3942
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:33,839
something or not before that is like how

3943
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,880
much do i need to eat that day in order

3944
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:36,239
to stay on top of it to build training

3945
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:38,400
again the next day

3946
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:40,000
so i'll i'll i'll usually do something

3947
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:41,439
similar to what i do before a race if i

3948
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,719
need to kind of stay on top of calories

3949
01:57:41,439 --> 01:57:46,000
for the day so i'm not like

3950
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:46,399
at noon with like no calorie intake and

3951
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,399
like

3952
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:49,920
5 000 calories to try to consume before

3953
01:57:48,399 --> 01:57:52,399
i go to bed that night and get out and

3954
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:55,118
do the same thing the next day uh

3955
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:56,399
but yeah i think uh in if i were if i

3956
01:57:55,118 --> 01:57:59,598
were doing what you're doing

3957
01:57:56,399 --> 01:58:01,759
like if that were my lifestyle i think i

3958
01:57:59,599 --> 01:58:03,360
would do almost all my runs fasted

3959
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:05,199
i don't see why i would be eating a lot

3960
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:07,759
before it because it's like

3961
01:58:05,198 --> 01:58:08,799
um i'm just introducing something that

3962
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:10,239
could

3963
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:12,400
especially if you're noticing like

3964
01:58:10,238 --> 01:58:14,319
here's what i'd say if i was doing that

3965
01:58:12,399 --> 01:58:15,839
and i was like wow this run sucks and

3966
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:17,359
then i introduced something beforehand

3967
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,719
and now my run was feeling great my

3968
01:58:17,359 --> 01:58:19,920
progress was getting better

3969
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:21,198
that's when i would maybe consider

3970
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:23,039
having something before but if you're

3971
01:58:21,198 --> 01:58:24,479
running both of those

3972
01:58:23,039 --> 01:58:26,079
those like self experiments you're

3973
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:27,118
noticing yeah if i eat something before

3974
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:29,118
i go on this workout

3975
01:58:27,118 --> 01:58:30,479
the workout's less enjoyable i'm not

3976
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:32,479
noticing any any

3977
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:34,079
increased improvements on it again it's

3978
01:58:32,479 --> 01:58:35,598
a little messy like we said before it's

3979
01:58:34,079 --> 01:58:37,920
hard to really you can't go back and try

3980
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:39,840
it a different way on that specific day

3981
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,760
but i think i think most people if

3982
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,319
they're just like if they go at it with

3983
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:44,400
like

3984
01:58:42,319 --> 01:58:46,639
no bias in the sense that they're like

3985
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:48,479
trying to make one work versus the other

3986
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:49,679
you can get at least a good enough look

3987
01:58:48,479 --> 01:58:51,759
at it and if

3988
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:52,960
absolute peak performance in one

3989
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:56,079
activity one

3990
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,480
very specific activity isn't your goal

3991
01:58:56,079 --> 01:58:58,319
then

3992
01:58:56,479 --> 01:59:00,559
it's like do you really care if one x

3993
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:01,759
has a two percent performance increase

3994
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,719
that you won't even probably notice

3995
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:05,679
because there's other variables that

3996
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:07,118
will clearly overpower that two percent

3997
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:08,719
one way or the other and there's some

3998
01:59:07,118 --> 01:59:11,519
benefit in terms of freedom

3999
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:12,800
and letting go of like having to think

4000
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:15,280
about some of these variables

4001
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:17,119
i see sort of fasting is even if it's

4002
01:59:15,279 --> 01:59:19,759
like a hit on the performance

4003
01:59:17,118 --> 01:59:20,960
it's worth it to just not think about it

4004
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:24,320
there's some really nice

4005
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:26,800
aspect to just putting on shoes not

4006
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:28,479
caring like what shorts you wear or like

4007
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:30,800
what your outfit is like not being

4008
01:59:28,479 --> 01:59:31,759
optimal in every way just not caring and

4009
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:34,639
just enjoying the

4010
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:35,199
purity of just running yeah no matter

4011
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:37,520
what

4012
01:59:35,198 --> 01:59:39,359
just enjoying the natural aspect yeah

4013
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:39,760
there's a side to me that sometimes just

4014
01:59:39,359 --> 01:59:42,559
like

4015
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:44,079
craves a lifestyle where it's like i

4016
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:47,520
have like such a small

4017
01:59:44,079 --> 01:59:49,198
house and only what i need and just like

4018
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:50,639
a handful of food products that i know i

4019
01:59:49,198 --> 01:59:52,158
enjoy and work well for me and i don't

4020
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:53,039
even have the distraction of the other

4021
01:59:52,158 --> 01:59:54,319
stuff

4022
01:59:53,039 --> 01:59:56,158
there's like a there's like a there's

4023
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:57,519
almost like a weight that comes off your

4024
01:59:56,158 --> 01:59:58,000
shoulders when you can when you think

4025
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,320
even just

4026
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,079
thinking about it like it's so simple so

4027
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:03,840
the reason i i'm mostly a minimalist

4028
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:05,519
like that the reason i have stuff is i

4029
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,520
realize like

4030
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:08,560
you probably have to fit into society

4031
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,679
and if you want to have

4032
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:12,000
other people in your life you should

4033
02:00:09,679 --> 02:00:14,639
probably get used to having stuff yeah

4034
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,319
because because most people like stuff

4035
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:17,279
right yeah well yeah there's that side

4036
02:00:16,319 --> 02:00:19,439
of it too and

4037
02:00:17,279 --> 02:00:21,519
there's there's a whole you don't want

4038
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:23,198
to ostracize yourself too much and

4039
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,800
i think anything you can kind of like

4040
02:00:23,198 --> 02:00:26,079
you can manipulate that a little bit

4041
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:29,119
where there's things that are like

4042
02:00:26,079 --> 02:00:30,639
not specific to uh

4043
02:00:29,118 --> 02:00:31,920
you know that's gonna negatively impact

4044
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:33,679
the people around you or your

4045
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:35,279
experiences with them

4046
02:00:33,679 --> 02:00:37,118
uh so there's a balance like everything

4047
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:38,639
i guess yeah i mean that's why i drink

4048
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:40,559
i think i mentioned you offline drink

4049
02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:43,840
vodka whiskey

4050
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:46,960
sort of alcohol because i don't

4051
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:49,520
feel good about it the day after

4052
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:51,198
or sometimes multiple days after so i

4053
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:52,480
know it's not good for me

4054
02:00:51,198 --> 02:00:54,238
so i do a lot of stuff that's good for

4055
02:00:52,479 --> 02:00:55,839
me everything we talked about exercise

4056
02:00:54,238 --> 02:00:58,399
and diet and all those kinds of things

4057
02:00:55,840 --> 02:01:00,319
but the alcohol almost symbolizes

4058
02:00:58,399 --> 02:01:02,879
embracing the chaos of life

4059
02:01:00,319 --> 02:01:03,679
the the wild and the amazing things that

4060
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,039
could happen

4061
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:07,520
and i think that's really important

4062
02:01:05,039 --> 02:01:08,319
because if you optimize everything about

4063
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:10,639
life

4064
02:01:08,319 --> 02:01:12,719
then you're going to miss most of the

4065
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:14,560
fun stuff that happens in life

4066
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:16,480
so it's not all about the optimization

4067
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:18,800
it's some of it

4068
02:01:16,479 --> 02:01:20,718
like everyone has different things and

4069
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:22,400
what they how they introduce that chaos

4070
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:24,480
in a controlled way for me

4071
02:01:22,399 --> 02:01:26,000
alcohol is that because i'm okay

4072
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:28,879
drinking not too much

4073
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,359
so i can control that aspect even though

4074
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:31,599
it's

4075
02:01:29,359 --> 02:01:32,399
unhealthy it introduces just the right

4076
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:35,360
amount of fun

4077
02:01:32,399 --> 02:01:36,000
that yeah i embrace it yeah and i mean

4078
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:37,839
it is one of those

4079
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,679
things where it's like i'm gonna benefit

4080
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:40,239
now and pay later a little bit too where

4081
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:42,639
like

4082
02:01:40,238 --> 02:01:43,759
and hey if you go and you you go out

4083
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:46,719
with some friends and

4084
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:48,560
and drink and you have memories that

4085
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:50,000
last a lifetime from that experience and

4086
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:51,520
you paid for it for a couple days

4087
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,118
after then hey maybe that's a fair

4088
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:55,119
trade-off from life experience and part

4089
02:01:53,118 --> 02:01:56,000
of the vodka thing is i need to honor my

4090
02:01:55,118 --> 02:01:59,118
ancestors

4091
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,238
so it's like you have to you know you

4092
02:01:59,118 --> 02:02:03,359
can't

4093
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:04,638
yeah you can't turn your back on your

4094
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:08,000
past

4095
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:09,840
um let me ask about the 100 mile world

4096
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,319
record on the treadmill

4097
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:14,800
so for most people running a treadmill

4098
02:02:12,319 --> 02:02:16,559
is really boring

4099
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:17,599
so that's kind of their experience of it

4100
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:18,000
that's probably the first thing that

4101
02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:19,520
would say

4102
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,359
that seems like really boring to run a

4103
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:24,080
hundred miles on a treadmill

4104
02:02:21,359 --> 02:02:25,039
would you say it's boring like what were

4105
02:02:24,079 --> 02:02:27,039
some

4106
02:02:25,039 --> 02:02:29,359
places your mind went to make that

4107
02:02:27,039 --> 02:02:30,800
happen so this one is interesting to me

4108
02:02:29,359 --> 02:02:33,279
because

4109
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,039
i definitely recognized the boredom and

4110
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:36,880
the the difference

4111
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:38,479
the thing that the question i can't

4112
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:39,520
quite answer i think with it is like

4113
02:02:38,479 --> 02:02:41,439
could i have

4114
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:43,599
remedied that with better preparation

4115
02:02:41,439 --> 02:02:45,598
because the scenario that put me on a

4116
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:48,319
treadmill for 100 miles was

4117
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:49,760
you know it was march 2020 basically the

4118
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:52,719
cascade of every race

4119
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:54,400
on the planet got cancelled and i was in

4120
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:56,480
a position where i was going to be doing

4121
02:02:54,399 --> 02:03:00,559
a runnable 100 miler

4122
02:02:56,479 --> 02:03:01,919
uh on a track in mid to late april so i

4123
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:03,360
had like the majority of my training

4124
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:05,359
under my belt so i was like kind of

4125
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:07,359
putting the finishing touches on that

4126
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:09,439
and i was like oh great here we are like

4127
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:10,479
you know what do i do with this fitness

4128
02:03:09,439 --> 02:03:12,879
do i just

4129
02:03:10,479 --> 02:03:14,158
scale back and hope the events come back

4130
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:16,159
and fall and then peak again

4131
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:17,279
or do i find something to use this

4132
02:03:16,158 --> 02:03:19,039
fitness for

4133
02:03:17,279 --> 02:03:20,639
and the treadmill was the closest thing

4134
02:03:19,039 --> 02:03:22,079
to what i had been training for in terms

4135
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:23,279
of just like a mechanical like flat

4136
02:03:22,079 --> 02:03:26,399
running essentially

4137
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:29,599
that i could that i could think of and

4138
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:31,759
uh my thought was okay well i'll

4139
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:33,119
just live stream myself on a treadmill

4140
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:33,679
and see what happens it ended up turning

4141
02:03:33,118 --> 02:03:35,679
into like a

4142
02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:37,359
quite a big event but so you don't

4143
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:38,399
usually incorporate treadmill running

4144
02:03:37,359 --> 02:03:40,319
into your running

4145
02:03:38,399 --> 02:03:42,000
into your training i don't not

4146
02:03:40,319 --> 02:03:43,439
incorporate it i just don't incorporate

4147
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,118
it in the way that would be necessarily

4148
02:03:43,439 --> 02:03:47,359
conducive to

4149
02:03:45,118 --> 02:03:49,279
uh you know dealing with the mental

4150
02:03:47,359 --> 02:03:49,839
aspects of being on a treadmill for 100

4151
02:03:49,279 --> 02:03:51,439
miles

4152
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:53,119
was it that different than running on a

4153
02:03:51,439 --> 02:03:54,399
track it was

4154
02:03:53,118 --> 02:03:55,759
from the sense that here's the way i

4155
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:56,960
describe it is when i'm on a track it's

4156
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:59,440
a controlled environment

4157
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:00,960
and everything can be very uniform but

4158
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:04,399
there are tiny

4159
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:06,719
little micro adjustments in pace that

4160
02:04:04,399 --> 02:04:08,000
that i'm doing subconsciously that give

4161
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:09,760
me the sense of control

4162
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,279
right no i might run the exact same

4163
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:13,599
split but there's like a

4164
02:04:11,279 --> 02:04:14,880
fraction of a second or you know a

4165
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:16,319
fraction second faster than a fraction

4166
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:16,960
of a second slower that equals the same

4167
02:04:16,319 --> 02:04:18,158
outcome

4168
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:20,239
it gives you that sense of control

4169
02:04:18,158 --> 02:04:22,559
you're determining how fast you're going

4170
02:04:20,238 --> 02:04:23,279
on a treadmill you're responding to the

4171
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:24,639
belt so

4172
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:26,719
the advantage is you can set a pace and

4173
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:27,520
know you're hitting it the disadvantage

4174
02:04:26,719 --> 02:04:29,198
is

4175
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:31,440
you're being told what to do by that

4176
02:04:29,198 --> 02:04:33,759
machine and that gets very frustrating

4177
02:04:31,439 --> 02:04:34,719
um i felt like i wanted to step off like

4178
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,960
you get to like

4179
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:38,639
certain points where you're just like

4180
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:40,239
like even stepping off what i noticed

4181
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:41,359
i learned this on the day of actually i

4182
02:04:40,238 --> 02:04:42,879
noticed there's something where it

4183
02:04:41,359 --> 02:04:44,479
didn't really matter how long i get off

4184
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:45,920
like i'd get off to use the bathroom and

4185
02:04:44,479 --> 02:04:49,678
that was a little bit of a longer break

4186
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:51,760
then i at some i had i had like a hiccup

4187
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:53,520
during my event where we ran so much

4188
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:55,360
power through one end of the house that

4189
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:56,719
the screen on the treadmill was blacking

4190
02:04:55,359 --> 02:04:58,719
out yeah so

4191
02:04:56,719 --> 02:05:00,158
uh we ended up so i ended up jumping

4192
02:04:58,719 --> 02:05:00,960
back and forth on treadmills for quite a

4193
02:05:00,158 --> 02:05:03,198
bit in the beginning

4194
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:04,399
and i noticed even turning it off

4195
02:05:03,198 --> 02:05:04,719
stepping over and starting the other one

4196
02:05:04,399 --> 02:05:06,078
up

4197
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:08,639
gave me like you know a handful of

4198
02:05:06,078 --> 02:05:10,399
seconds between was enough of a mental

4199
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:11,359
break of just like that release of being

4200
02:05:10,399 --> 02:05:13,679
told what to do

4201
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:14,639
yeah to reset so maybe if you were in

4202
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:16,719
the future you would

4203
02:05:14,639 --> 02:05:18,560
figure out what exactly how much she's

4204
02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:19,679
needed to have them at the bank i never

4205
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:22,000
actually thought about that

4206
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:24,480
that i mean obviously for you but also

4207
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:26,000
for people like me like amateur runners

4208
02:05:24,479 --> 02:05:27,439
that that's the source of frustration

4209
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,560
with the treadmill that there's

4210
02:05:27,439 --> 02:05:31,279
sometimes

4211
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:32,480
a small adjustments in pace that we do

4212
02:05:31,279 --> 02:05:34,880
running

4213
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:36,158
not on the treadmill on the ground that

4214
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:38,400
feel like essential

4215
02:05:36,158 --> 02:05:40,479
yeah for that feeling just like you said

4216
02:05:38,399 --> 02:05:42,559
that experience of control

4217
02:05:40,479 --> 02:05:44,799
like uh feeling like you're in control

4218
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,159
somehow that's really

4219
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:47,840
i don't know that's somehow liberating

4220
02:05:46,158 --> 02:05:50,158
in the way that a treadmill can be just

4221
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:51,599
the source of frustration

4222
02:05:50,158 --> 02:05:53,598
the funny the funny thing though about

4223
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:56,000
the treadmill is i actually like to do

4224
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:57,920
faster workouts on the treadmill like

4225
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,639
long intervals or something like that

4226
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:02,158
or tempo runs because for that for that

4227
02:06:00,639 --> 02:06:04,239
type of stuff sometimes for those

4228
02:06:02,158 --> 02:06:06,000
i want to release the brain power

4229
02:06:04,238 --> 02:06:07,198
required to hit that pace and say you

4230
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,800
take care of that yeah

4231
02:06:07,198 --> 02:06:10,158
and for that it's fun but those are over

4232
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:10,800
quick so you don't really run into the

4233
02:06:10,158 --> 02:06:12,879
times

4234
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:13,920
yeah that's fascinating for like precise

4235
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:16,719
control

4236
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:18,319
of pace you've uh you've also during

4237
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:20,000
that stream got to interact one of the

4238
02:06:18,319 --> 02:06:20,960
greatest athletes of all time burke

4239
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,960
pressure

4240
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:24,078
what's your he's actually doing i don't

4241
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:25,599
know if you're paying attention to this

4242
02:06:24,078 --> 02:06:27,118
but i guess he has a goal of running

4243
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:30,639
2000 miles this year

4244
02:06:27,118 --> 02:06:31,198
yeah i've got a chance to talk to joe

4245
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:33,760
rogan

4246
02:06:31,198 --> 02:06:35,439
uh yesterday about this which is uh

4247
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:37,760
fascinating he i think he's a little bit

4248
02:06:35,439 --> 02:06:40,158
doubtful of

4249
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:41,840
bert's ability to be the ultra performer

4250
02:06:40,158 --> 02:06:44,960
that he so naturally is

4251
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:46,880
yeah um what's your thoughts about bert

4252
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:49,279
as a runner what's your advice to him

4253
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:50,560
and what was your interaction like on as

4254
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:51,198
part of this treadmill challenge with

4255
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:54,400
him

4256
02:06:51,198 --> 02:06:57,039
i love bert because he's such a nice

4257
02:06:54,399 --> 02:06:59,198
person i mean as a guy who's just

4258
02:06:57,039 --> 02:07:00,560
accelerated in popularity over the last

4259
02:06:59,198 --> 02:07:02,960
few years like

4260
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:04,560
he is like super kind so for folks who

4261
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:06,960
are curious like

4262
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,679
i've met bert a couple years earlier and

4263
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:09,279
i just

4264
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:11,118
randomly asked him like hey i'm doing

4265
02:07:09,279 --> 02:07:12,399
this live stream thing we're doing it

4266
02:07:11,118 --> 02:07:13,759
for fight for the forgotten we're trying

4267
02:07:12,399 --> 02:07:15,519
to raise some funds for them

4268
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:17,119
would you want to come on the live

4269
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:17,599
stream for a bit and i thought maybe

4270
02:07:17,118 --> 02:07:18,960
he'd

4271
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:20,078
come on for like five or ten minutes and

4272
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,359
i thought that would be amazing if he

4273
02:07:20,078 --> 02:07:23,118
did that he ended up coming on for like

4274
02:07:21,359 --> 02:07:23,759
over an hour he said he went past his

4275
02:07:23,118 --> 02:07:25,198
slot

4276
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,599
sat in the next slot and just started

4277
02:07:25,198 --> 02:07:29,919
talking with some of the other guests

4278
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:32,880
it's he's just uh bert is definitely

4279
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:35,359
like i feel like he's as unchanged from

4280
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:36,400
like his popularity as one can get away

4281
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:39,198
with

4282
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:40,719
and it's just like his his lifestyle i

4283
02:07:39,198 --> 02:07:44,319
think is very

4284
02:07:40,719 --> 02:07:47,118
un unpredictable in the sense that like

4285
02:07:44,319 --> 02:07:48,399
if he wants to run like x time for a

4286
02:07:47,118 --> 02:07:49,920
specific race

4287
02:07:48,399 --> 02:07:52,719
that's going to pull away from his

4288
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:54,239
lifestyle so much to focus on that

4289
02:07:52,719 --> 02:07:56,399
luckily for him he's actually a great

4290
02:07:54,238 --> 02:07:57,359
athlete like you it's it's under that

4291
02:07:56,399 --> 02:07:59,118
layer of uh

4292
02:07:57,359 --> 02:08:01,039
fat yeah so for people who are not

4293
02:07:59,118 --> 02:08:05,279
familiar burke crash is a comedian

4294
02:08:01,039 --> 02:08:07,679
who takes off his shirt often has a uh

4295
02:08:05,279 --> 02:08:09,439
elegant layer of fat around him he's

4296
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:11,840
also a party animal

4297
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:13,359
so he's a weird balance of like healthy

4298
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:17,199
and unhealthy

4299
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:18,559
yeah so he drinks a lot during

4300
02:08:17,198 --> 02:08:20,479
i think there's some debate about that

4301
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:22,400
but certainly after

4302
02:08:20,479 --> 02:08:23,598
his uh his performances but at the same

4303
02:08:22,399 --> 02:08:26,078
time he's into

4304
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:28,319
kind of the running thing and he does

4305
02:08:26,078 --> 02:08:30,559
quite a bit of treadmill running i think

4306
02:08:28,319 --> 02:08:32,479
so and like i said has his challenge of

4307
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:34,639
running 2000 miles this year

4308
02:08:32,479 --> 02:08:36,638
so it's fascinating to have somebody who

4309
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:38,480
so fully embraces

4310
02:08:36,639 --> 02:08:40,319
life and the full joys of life as

4311
02:08:38,479 --> 02:08:42,158
represented by the

4312
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:44,479
huge amounts of drinking and partying

4313
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:47,598
and just being a wild man

4314
02:08:44,479 --> 02:08:48,000
but also at the same time like being at

4315
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:50,319
least

4316
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,599
curious about this challenging yourself

4317
02:08:50,319 --> 02:08:53,198
in the physical realm

4318
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:54,719
it's kind of fascinating it reminds me

4319
02:08:53,198 --> 02:08:56,319
of um

4320
02:08:54,719 --> 02:08:57,840
one of my favorite comedians like eddie

4321
02:08:56,319 --> 02:08:59,439
izzard who

4322
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:02,239
has been doing those challenges

4323
02:08:59,439 --> 02:09:04,158
basically off the couch just running

4324
02:09:02,238 --> 02:09:05,678
a marathon a day kind of thing it's

4325
02:09:04,158 --> 02:09:09,118
fascinating

4326
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:11,359
to see the purity of those challenges

4327
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:12,559
when like exercise hasn't necessarily

4328
02:09:11,359 --> 02:09:14,799
been

4329
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:16,400
deeply great ingrained in your life and

4330
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:17,199
you kind of just embrace the challenge

4331
02:09:16,399 --> 02:09:19,679
anyway

4332
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:20,879
and take it on and that's another way of

4333
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:22,719
looking at it because we've been talking

4334
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:25,359
about running as a

4335
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:25,760
a performance like optimization thing

4336
02:09:25,359 --> 02:09:28,479
where

4337
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:29,920
training is such a huge part of this

4338
02:09:28,479 --> 02:09:31,359
process like grace day is just the

4339
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:32,960
cherry on top

4340
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:34,399
but there's for some people where the

4341
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:36,480
race is the cake

4342
02:09:34,399 --> 02:09:38,319
yeah it's like they just take it on as a

4343
02:09:36,479 --> 02:09:40,319
pure challenge as the

4344
02:09:38,319 --> 02:09:42,238
as the as the thing you haven't really

4345
02:09:40,319 --> 02:09:43,840
trained for is the thing you haven't

4346
02:09:42,238 --> 02:09:45,598
you don't understand the intricacies of

4347
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:47,119
but you take it on anyway and that

4348
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:48,960
that reveals something about the human

4349
02:09:47,118 --> 02:09:51,198
spirit as well yeah and there's

4350
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:51,520
definitely like a switch that flips when

4351
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:53,359
you

4352
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:54,719
in your mind decide i'm gonna do this

4353
02:09:53,359 --> 02:09:55,198
where then all of a sudden it goes from

4354
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:56,880
like

4355
02:09:55,198 --> 02:09:58,078
you stop thinking about oh that's not

4356
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:59,118
possible it's like well i'm just gonna

4357
02:09:58,078 --> 02:10:00,880
do it and i think

4358
02:09:59,118 --> 02:10:02,238
bert highlights that perfectly in a lot

4359
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:04,480
of cases where like

4360
02:10:02,238 --> 02:10:05,919
he's he's maybe not even thinking it

4361
02:10:04,479 --> 02:10:07,359
through enough to get to the point where

4362
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:08,639
it's like he gets the point where he

4363
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:09,839
thinks this is not possible

4364
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:11,199
where most people would look at it and

4365
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,000
think huh i don't know if i can actually

4366
02:10:11,198 --> 02:10:14,319
physically

4367
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:15,359
accomplish that task burt's just like oh

4368
02:10:14,319 --> 02:10:17,599
yeah i'm gonna do it

4369
02:10:15,359 --> 02:10:18,479
and my my thought with bert was the two

4370
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:19,760
thousand mile thing is

4371
02:10:18,479 --> 02:10:22,158
where are we gonna find him at the end

4372
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:23,119
of the year with like 36 hours to go on

4373
02:10:22,158 --> 02:10:23,759
a hundred miles and he's gonna say

4374
02:10:23,118 --> 02:10:27,279
that's right

4375
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:29,679
that's right that's what's gonna happen

4376
02:10:27,279 --> 02:10:31,679
and it's going to be hilarious uh so

4377
02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:34,399
speaking of things that are insane

4378
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:35,440
and like taking on challenges that don't

4379
02:10:34,399 --> 02:10:40,000
seem

4380
02:10:35,439 --> 02:10:40,000
like you didn't you didn't think through

4381
02:10:40,479 --> 02:10:43,839
you're thinking about running across the

4382
02:10:42,078 --> 02:10:45,198
country in

4383
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,880
in a challenge you call the

4384
02:10:45,198 --> 02:10:48,559
transcontinental run

4385
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:50,319
can you describe this challenge and what

4386
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:53,280
the heck you're thinking yeah

4387
02:10:50,319 --> 02:10:55,039
yeah so this is uh you know one thing

4388
02:10:53,279 --> 02:10:56,639
that is exciting about ultra marathons i

4389
02:10:55,039 --> 02:10:58,319
think in a lot of places especially

4390
02:10:56,639 --> 02:11:00,159
early in someone's ultra marathon

4391
02:10:58,319 --> 02:11:02,639
adventure if they decide to do that

4392
02:11:00,158 --> 02:11:04,078
as a you know part of their life is you

4393
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:05,520
have like these early years where you're

4394
02:11:04,078 --> 02:11:08,238
doing things for the first time

4395
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:09,440
and it's like so cool and scary at the

4396
02:11:08,238 --> 02:11:11,118
same time to think

4397
02:11:09,439 --> 02:11:12,719
today i'm gonna run a hundred miles and

4398
02:11:11,118 --> 02:11:14,639
the first i've ever run before is 50

4399
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:15,599
or something like that and you just know

4400
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:16,560
you're gonna do something that you've

4401
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:17,679
never done before you're gonna

4402
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:19,199
experience things you would have never

4403
02:11:17,679 --> 02:11:22,319
been able to predict

4404
02:11:19,198 --> 02:11:22,960
uh and it's like this really interesting

4405
02:11:22,319 --> 02:11:25,920
unique

4406
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:27,920
like human experience i think so for me

4407
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:30,000
i spent most of my career at this point

4408
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:31,359
like doing i got through that phase in a

4409
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,158
lot of the events i'm really interested

4410
02:11:31,359 --> 02:11:33,920
in

4411
02:11:32,158 --> 02:11:35,198
and then it was like now let's repeat it

4412
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:36,560
and see if we can do it better and you

4413
02:11:35,198 --> 02:11:36,879
get into that mindset for a while which

4414
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:39,440
is

4415
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:40,880
also a fun mindset but there is that

4416
02:11:39,439 --> 02:11:42,960
kind of like uh

4417
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:44,480
um desire to kind of have that human

4418
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:46,078
experience again of like

4419
02:11:44,479 --> 02:11:48,238
you know not knowing what could happen

4420
02:11:46,078 --> 02:11:49,840
or is this doable type of a thing but

4421
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:51,519
still doing it and figuring it out along

4422
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:52,000
the way so i would describe the trans

4423
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:53,760
continental

4424
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,279
project as something like that it's not

4425
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:56,400
anything unique to me or anything new

4426
02:11:55,279 --> 02:11:57,439
there's been a lot of people who've done

4427
02:11:56,399 --> 02:11:59,198
it before

4428
02:11:57,439 --> 02:12:00,479
but essentially it's a route there's

4429
02:11:59,198 --> 02:12:01,919
different routes there's one kind of

4430
02:12:00,479 --> 02:12:03,919
main one that's done for like

4431
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:05,520
the that is used as the record route

4432
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:07,440
more or less that you go from

4433
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,520
san francisco to new york and

4434
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:11,118
essentially you live out of an rv

4435
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:12,639
uh while you're running so you run as

4436
02:12:11,118 --> 02:12:14,319
much as you can during the day then you

4437
02:12:12,639 --> 02:12:15,520
go to bed at night and then you get up

4438
02:12:14,319 --> 02:12:17,279
and do it again

4439
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:19,040
and you're you're handling all the

4440
02:12:17,279 --> 02:12:21,439
logistics and the

4441
02:12:19,039 --> 02:12:22,880
process of trying to make sure you can

4442
02:12:21,439 --> 02:12:24,078
get up the next day and do again what

4443
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:25,520
you did the day before which is going to

4444
02:12:24,078 --> 02:12:27,519
be the biggest difference so

4445
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:28,800
for me i've done all single day ultra

4446
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:31,599
marathons where

4447
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:33,520
you're going to wring yourself dry at

4448
02:12:31,599 --> 02:12:34,800
knowing the next day or week or however

4449
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:36,000
long you need you're going to be able to

4450
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:37,360
just kind of like shut everything down

4451
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,560
and let everything catch back up whereas

4452
02:12:37,359 --> 02:12:40,158
with this

4453
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:42,079
like you know you're doing it again and

4454
02:12:40,158 --> 02:12:43,519
again again yeah and you know the record

4455
02:12:42,078 --> 02:12:45,359
is by a guy named pete costner who

4456
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:47,280
averaged just over 72 miles a day

4457
02:12:45,359 --> 02:12:50,719
finished in 42 days six hours and 30

4458
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:52,479
minutes and i mean just like 72 miles 73

4459
02:12:50,719 --> 02:12:54,319
miles and then like

4460
02:12:52,479 --> 02:12:55,598
next day again next day again just

4461
02:12:54,319 --> 02:12:57,198
knowing every day when you finish you

4462
02:12:55,599 --> 02:12:58,159
spend a whole day running and then okay

4463
02:12:57,198 --> 02:12:59,118
i'm gonna go to bed i'm gonna wake up in

4464
02:12:58,158 --> 02:13:00,399
the morning i'm gonna have to do this

4465
02:12:59,118 --> 02:13:02,158
again

4466
02:13:00,399 --> 02:13:03,439
and then you know have that happen for

4467
02:13:02,158 --> 02:13:04,000
six weeks and that's if it goes very

4468
02:13:03,439 --> 02:13:06,719
well

4469
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,000
so luck i assume is a big part of this

4470
02:13:06,719 --> 02:13:09,840
yeah for sure i mean there's just so

4471
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,198
many variables that are uncontrollable

4472
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:12,719
on this type of an experience just

4473
02:13:11,198 --> 02:13:13,919
because i mean you go over the sierras

4474
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:15,520
maybe you hit a storm

4475
02:13:13,920 --> 02:13:18,319
you know you try to time it most people

4476
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:20,719
do it in start in september so you

4477
02:13:18,319 --> 02:13:22,559
can get over the mountain passes without

4478
02:13:20,719 --> 02:13:24,319
a big storm coming through

4479
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:26,159
uh but then also get to the east coast

4480
02:13:24,319 --> 02:13:28,238
before it's like the middle of winter

4481
02:13:26,158 --> 02:13:29,439
so like september early september start

4482
02:13:28,238 --> 02:13:31,039
is kind of ideal

4483
02:13:29,439 --> 02:13:33,039
but you can you know i mean pete was

4484
02:13:31,039 --> 02:13:34,719
very fortunate from a weather standpoint

4485
02:13:33,039 --> 02:13:35,679
i think he made one big mistake we got a

4486
02:13:34,719 --> 02:13:37,039
little too aggressive in the beginning

4487
02:13:35,679 --> 02:13:38,639
had to take a full day off so he

4488
02:13:37,039 --> 02:13:41,439
actually averaged from a moving day

4489
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:43,440
standpoint closer to 75 miles per day

4490
02:13:41,439 --> 02:13:44,638
um but yeah i mean there's going to be

4491
02:13:43,439 --> 02:13:46,319
things that i can't

4492
02:13:44,639 --> 02:13:48,319
prepare for won't know it's going to

4493
02:13:46,319 --> 02:13:48,880
happen and you know a lot of that will

4494
02:13:48,319 --> 02:13:50,238
get

4495
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:52,078
a lot of the logistical stuff will get

4496
02:13:50,238 --> 02:13:53,359
leaned on with the crew so

4497
02:13:52,078 --> 02:13:55,519
that's i mean that's the hardest part

4498
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:57,039
right now is just like getting all that

4499
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:58,880
put together where it's like

4500
02:13:57,039 --> 02:14:00,158
okay i need to have the rv ready i need

4501
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:00,480
to have all the stuff right we need to

4502
02:14:00,158 --> 02:14:01,759
have

4503
02:14:00,479 --> 02:14:03,839
the places figured out where we're going

4504
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:06,159
to stop and and the people that

4505
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:07,840
can you know dedicate that much time to

4506
02:14:06,158 --> 02:14:09,198
an activity like that

4507
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:10,639
you know there's a lot of moving parts

4508
02:14:09,198 --> 02:14:11,118
even before you start the adventure

4509
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:12,719
itself

4510
02:14:11,118 --> 02:14:14,719
when are you so you're you're taking the

4511
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:17,118
san francisco to new york right yeah

4512
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:19,118
and when are you doing the run september

4513
02:14:17,118 --> 02:14:20,880
1st is when uh you know barring anything

4514
02:14:19,118 --> 02:14:22,559
like catastrophic between now and then

4515
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:23,679
it's really exciting but i mean it's

4516
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:24,960
incredible so you

4517
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:26,639
you'll probably have a bunch of people

4518
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:28,399
just randomly running with you are

4519
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:29,279
people going to be tracking where you're

4520
02:14:28,399 --> 02:14:30,879
located

4521
02:14:29,279 --> 02:14:32,719
yeah so i'll be documenting everything

4522
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:34,239
because i mean my hope is that i'm doing

4523
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:35,599
it primarily to raise awareness for

4524
02:14:34,238 --> 02:14:36,559
fight for the forgotten justin ren's

4525
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:39,199
charity

4526
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:40,000
uh but with that said i think i am

4527
02:14:39,198 --> 02:14:42,719
capable of

4528
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,039
uh if i have a good experience uh you

4529
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:44,399
know

4530
02:14:43,039 --> 02:14:46,800
chasing the record or going after the

4531
02:14:44,399 --> 02:14:48,960
record or at least getting close to it

4532
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:49,679
so oh so you're gonna try to beat

4533
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:51,679
this record

4534
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:52,800
yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna go out with the

4535
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:54,960
i'm gonna structure

4536
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:56,560
the process in a way that leaves that

4537
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:58,399
door open is the way i would describe it

4538
02:14:56,560 --> 02:15:01,039
i'm going to try not to do anything

4539
02:14:58,399 --> 02:15:02,238
that would potentially put it in a

4540
02:15:01,039 --> 02:15:03,840
situation where

4541
02:15:02,238 --> 02:15:05,279
that becomes the primary goal just

4542
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:07,119
because i want to make sure that

4543
02:15:05,279 --> 02:15:08,639
the reason i decided in the first place

4544
02:15:07,118 --> 02:15:10,158
was for fight for the forgotten so i

4545
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:12,078
want to make sure that i don't end up

4546
02:15:10,158 --> 02:15:13,920
two-thirds way across the country with a

4547
02:15:12,078 --> 02:15:16,238
broken leg and i'm like

4548
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:18,399
hey guys uh i guess the donation

4549
02:15:16,238 --> 02:15:20,879
button's turned off

4550
02:15:18,399 --> 02:15:21,439
so focus on like don't sacrifice that

4551
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:23,520
right

4552
02:15:21,439 --> 02:15:24,879
that goal but also there's a community

4553
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:28,000
aspect to it

4554
02:15:24,880 --> 02:15:29,679
that i feel like are you going to

4555
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,198
i mean so you're going to document and

4556
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:34,078
post yeah

4557
02:15:31,198 --> 02:15:35,519
but are you going to also is there a

4558
02:15:34,078 --> 02:15:36,719
safety perspective here it's like the

4559
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:39,040
forest gump thing

4560
02:15:36,719 --> 02:15:41,198
you might have large numbers of crowds

4561
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:43,198
that run along with you for a while

4562
02:15:41,198 --> 02:15:44,638
yeah worried about that kind of thing i

4563
02:15:43,198 --> 02:15:45,519
wouldn't say i'm worried about i mean i

4564
02:15:44,639 --> 02:15:47,199
think there's probably

4565
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:48,880
there's remote enough spots along the

4566
02:15:47,198 --> 02:15:49,279
way where you'll get some alone time

4567
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:51,440
more

4568
02:15:49,279 --> 02:15:52,880
more likely i don't necessarily mind if

4569
02:15:51,439 --> 02:15:54,559
people want to jump in there

4570
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:55,920
there'll be some people that will

4571
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:57,679
definitely want to do that and

4572
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:58,960
and they can come in and but the reality

4573
02:15:57,679 --> 02:16:00,158
is like it's

4574
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:02,399
probably not going to be a scenario

4575
02:16:00,158 --> 02:16:04,479
where there's like you know 40 people

4576
02:16:02,399 --> 02:16:06,559
following me at all times

4577
02:16:04,479 --> 02:16:08,078
you say that now yeah you never know

4578
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:10,159
just wait for this podcast

4579
02:16:08,078 --> 02:16:12,319
yeah and then if joe finds out you're

4580
02:16:10,158 --> 02:16:14,719
doing this then we're really in trouble

4581
02:16:12,319 --> 02:16:16,000
all right so um i mean what are the

4582
02:16:14,719 --> 02:16:17,118
things that you think will be the

4583
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,118
hardest

4584
02:16:17,118 --> 02:16:21,598
for you and also like how do you train

4585
02:16:19,118 --> 02:16:24,238
for this kind of thing

4586
02:16:21,599 --> 02:16:25,599
um and what yeah what are the hardest

4587
02:16:24,238 --> 02:16:26,399
things you anticipate how do you train

4588
02:16:25,599 --> 02:16:28,000
for them

4589
02:16:26,399 --> 02:16:30,319
yeah so the way i'm looking at this is

4590
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,599
it's much less about performance from

4591
02:16:30,319 --> 02:16:34,959
the traditional sense

4592
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:37,760
where i need to be able to be x fit

4593
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:39,598
i think i need to be injury proof that's

4594
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:41,599
what's going to be a

4595
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:42,880
detriment if you think about it like if

4596
02:16:41,599 --> 02:16:46,239
i manage to average

4597
02:16:42,879 --> 02:16:48,959
nine minute mile pace for a day

4598
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:49,439
that would be 80 miles in a 12 hour time

4599
02:16:48,959 --> 02:16:52,000
frame

4600
02:16:49,439 --> 02:16:53,280
so i'll easily have 12 hours of moving

4601
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,519
time per day

4602
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:57,040
um nine minute pace i think is slow

4603
02:16:55,519 --> 02:16:57,840
enough that it's not an unreasonable

4604
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:00,000
clip

4605
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:02,079
so like when you i mean obviously

4606
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:03,840
there's things that slow you down or

4607
02:17:02,079 --> 02:17:05,359
i'll probably take walking breaks you

4608
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,719
know stopping breaks you got to

4609
02:17:05,359 --> 02:17:08,239
stay on top of nutrition that's the

4610
02:17:06,718 --> 02:17:10,000
other big thing too i'm probably eating

4611
02:17:08,239 --> 02:17:11,599
like anywhere between 10 to 15 000

4612
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,558
calories a day which is

4613
02:17:11,599 --> 02:17:14,000
you know i could probably count on my

4614
02:17:12,558 --> 02:17:14,638
hand a couple of occasions where i've

4615
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,478
eaten that much

4616
02:17:14,638 --> 02:17:18,000
in my life so now i got to do that for

4617
02:17:16,478 --> 02:17:19,599
six plus weeks in a row

4618
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,558
and you don't want any have any stomach

4619
02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:21,200
problems my friends are trying to

4620
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:22,879
minimize

4621
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:26,000
the amount of stomach problems would you

4622
02:17:22,879 --> 02:17:27,119
estimate about 12 to 13 to 14 hours of

4623
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:29,040
running every day

4624
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:30,719
yeah that's probably like from from the

4625
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:32,160
first step to the last step it'll

4626
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:34,478
probably be somewhere around

4627
02:17:32,159 --> 02:17:35,359
like say 14 hours 13 hours or something

4628
02:17:34,478 --> 02:17:37,279
like that would be

4629
02:17:35,359 --> 02:17:39,519
a pretty good estimate and then getting

4630
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:40,960
rest and so and then minimizing

4631
02:17:39,519 --> 02:17:43,439
the risk of injury which could be as

4632
02:17:40,959 --> 02:17:44,079
small as like like literally uneven

4633
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:46,639
surfaces

4634
02:17:44,079 --> 02:17:48,638
resulting to like stepping the wrong way

4635
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:50,799
i mean that's going to be a lot of steps

4636
02:17:48,638 --> 02:17:52,079
yeah yeah uh-huh so the probability of

4637
02:17:50,799 --> 02:17:52,799
injury are you worried about that kind

4638
02:17:52,079 --> 02:17:54,959
of stuff

4639
02:17:52,799 --> 02:17:56,959
is it can you strengthen the ankles or

4640
02:17:54,959 --> 02:17:58,478
those kinds of things that prevent

4641
02:17:56,959 --> 02:17:59,598
yeah possibility of injury and that's

4642
02:17:58,478 --> 02:18:00,318
that's where i'm putting a lot of my

4643
02:17:59,599 --> 02:18:03,519
focus in

4644
02:18:00,318 --> 02:18:05,679
is uh i think like just being running

4645
02:18:03,519 --> 02:18:07,120
fit is gonna be like generally speaking

4646
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:10,000
is gonna be

4647
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:11,599
important i'm gonna i think just from a

4648
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,478
lifetime of running is gonna be a huge

4649
02:18:11,599 --> 02:18:14,318
advantage

4650
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:16,398
uh a lot of these like kind of like

4651
02:18:14,318 --> 02:18:18,079
mechanical movements are gonna be very

4652
02:18:16,398 --> 02:18:20,478
established it's just gonna be about can

4653
02:18:18,079 --> 02:18:22,079
i tolerate that volume of it

4654
02:18:20,478 --> 02:18:23,358
there i think i'm doing more strength

4655
02:18:22,079 --> 02:18:24,079
work i think this is something where

4656
02:18:23,359 --> 02:18:25,599
it's like

4657
02:18:24,079 --> 02:18:27,439
you know maybe adding five pounds of

4658
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:28,960
lower body muscle is going to be an

4659
02:18:27,439 --> 02:18:30,159
advantage versus a disadvantage when

4660
02:18:28,959 --> 02:18:31,919
you're looking at power weight ratio

4661
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:34,478
because i just don't really don't i

4662
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:35,920
never need to be running a 648 mile for

4663
02:18:34,478 --> 02:18:39,039
this adventure

4664
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:40,960
um and i so i'm looking at i'm doing a

4665
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:43,040
lot more of that stuff focusing on that

4666
02:18:40,959 --> 02:18:44,000
the training is changing a fair bit

4667
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:45,840
where

4668
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:47,519
it's more polarizing versus kind of

4669
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:49,359
being i mean i've always had some

4670
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:51,040
polarization in my training but this is

4671
02:18:49,359 --> 02:18:52,880
even to an extreme where like i'm gonna

4672
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:55,280
do some simulations where

4673
02:18:52,879 --> 02:18:56,718
uh you know i go out and do two or three

4674
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:58,319
days where i target

4675
02:18:56,718 --> 02:19:00,398
the exact thing i will be doing on the

4676
02:18:58,318 --> 02:19:02,000
transcon you were on instagram posting

4677
02:19:00,398 --> 02:19:04,799
about these simulated runs so you

4678
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,799
legitimately like trying to perfectly

4679
02:19:04,799 --> 02:19:07,679
copy what would happen one two or three

4680
02:19:06,799 --> 02:19:09,920
day segment

4681
02:19:07,679 --> 02:19:11,040
on that right yeah just to kind of start

4682
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:12,960
to weed out

4683
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:14,559
where are the potential problems so

4684
02:19:12,959 --> 02:19:16,558
let's say i do a

4685
02:19:14,558 --> 02:19:18,318
two or three day simulation where i'm

4686
02:19:16,558 --> 02:19:20,159
averaging 70 miles a day

4687
02:19:18,318 --> 02:19:22,159
and i find out at the end of three days

4688
02:19:20,159 --> 02:19:23,840
there's a really weak spot here

4689
02:19:22,159 --> 02:19:25,679
um i need to address that or i need to

4690
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:27,599
find a way to make that not a weak spot

4691
02:19:25,679 --> 02:19:29,439
i think that's the only way to really

4692
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:29,840
get as close as you can to avoiding

4693
02:19:29,439 --> 02:19:31,280
injury

4694
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:33,359
have you done that yet have you done a

4695
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:35,519
two-day sony amount like even that's

4696
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:36,559
incredibly difficult i haven't yet i'm

4697
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:37,599
going to build up to it because that's

4698
02:19:36,558 --> 02:19:38,478
the other thing too is like

4699
02:19:37,599 --> 02:19:40,719
i don't think you want to be so

4700
02:19:38,478 --> 02:19:41,199
aggressive with that where you get

4701
02:19:40,718 --> 02:19:42,638
injured

4702
02:19:41,200 --> 02:19:44,960
trying to figure out how not to get

4703
02:19:42,638 --> 02:19:46,558
injured uh so i'll all

4704
02:19:44,959 --> 02:19:48,398
what i'm going to start what i just

4705
02:19:46,558 --> 02:19:50,639
started last week is i've

4706
02:19:48,398 --> 02:19:51,920
uh it looks really weird on my training

4707
02:19:50,639 --> 02:19:54,159
schedule because like last week i ran

4708
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:55,040
almost 150 miles but i took two days off

4709
02:19:54,159 --> 02:19:56,719
so it's like

4710
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,319
usually for me to get 150 miles that's a

4711
02:19:56,719 --> 02:19:59,760
seven day training week

4712
02:19:58,318 --> 02:20:02,639
uh so that's the way i'm doing it like i

4713
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:06,000
did i did a day where i did uh you know

4714
02:20:02,639 --> 02:20:07,840
two like just over 20 milers separated

4715
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,359
with by just a couple hours and within

4716
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:11,280
that couple hours i did like a three

4717
02:20:09,359 --> 02:20:13,200
three mile walk the following morning i

4718
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:15,359
woke up and ran i think it was like just

4719
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:16,880
over 36 miles first thing in the morning

4720
02:20:15,359 --> 02:20:18,399
just to get an idea of just like kind of

4721
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:19,920
like what is it like to be

4722
02:20:18,398 --> 02:20:21,840
i mean this was in phoenix too so it was

4723
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:24,879
100 degrees for the majority of that

4724
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:26,799
to suffer then rest yeah suffer again

4725
02:20:24,879 --> 02:20:28,799
how that feels there's enough precedent

4726
02:20:26,799 --> 02:20:31,039
with this sort of an activity where

4727
02:20:28,799 --> 02:20:33,039
like everyone i've talked to so far has

4728
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:34,880
told me like there's gonna be like this

4729
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:36,240
kind of like gradual decline in the

4730
02:20:34,879 --> 02:20:37,199
early stages where you're just like okay

4731
02:20:36,239 --> 02:20:38,079
it's getting worse it's getting worse

4732
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:39,520
it's getting worse

4733
02:20:38,079 --> 02:20:42,398
and you hit a point where you're just

4734
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:44,079
like it hits kind of rock bottom

4735
02:20:42,398 --> 02:20:45,439
and then like it starts to kind of

4736
02:20:44,079 --> 02:20:47,680
gradually improve

4737
02:20:45,439 --> 02:20:50,079
so you kind of have to let yourself get

4738
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:51,840
it's weird i think i can maybe

4739
02:20:50,079 --> 02:20:53,520
eliminate i'm trying to find a way to

4740
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:56,079
eliminate some of that by

4741
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:57,439
doing the simulations whereas i from

4742
02:20:56,079 --> 02:20:59,120
what i've seen i haven't seen a lot of

4743
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:00,398
people do the simulation route yet

4744
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:03,040
i've seen people just do like a lot of

4745
02:21:00,398 --> 02:21:04,639
training and then say like okay i'll

4746
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:06,000
spend the first seven to ten days

4747
02:21:04,639 --> 02:21:07,358
adapting to this and then i'll get

4748
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:09,680
comfortable

4749
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:11,120
within this environment and be fine

4750
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:12,239
whereas i'm gonna try to get to a point

4751
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:13,920
where like

4752
02:21:12,239 --> 02:21:15,760
some of that is already kind of cleared

4753
02:21:13,920 --> 02:21:17,359
up before i start but not so much that

4754
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:18,719
i'm like adding like an extra essential

4755
02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:20,800
week to the trip

4756
02:21:18,719 --> 02:21:23,039
worth of running what what what do you

4757
02:21:20,799 --> 02:21:25,119
think would be the hardest simulator run

4758
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:26,640
leading up to like will you do three

4759
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:28,479
days yeah i think i'll probably try to

4760
02:21:26,639 --> 02:21:30,239
do three days

4761
02:21:28,478 --> 02:21:31,760
somewhere between 70 and 80 miles each

4762
02:21:30,239 --> 02:21:33,520
will be kind of like the goal

4763
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:35,680
uh that'd be in august do you think how

4764
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:37,280
close to yeah i would like it to be in

4765
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:38,800
august like early august would be ideal

4766
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:39,920
i think like maybe the first week in

4767
02:21:38,799 --> 02:21:41,279
august because that gives me kind of

4768
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:42,559
three weeks to let things kind of settle

4769
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:45,520
down from that but that's

4770
02:21:42,559 --> 02:21:46,719
crazy this is incredible it's it's

4771
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:48,399
actually interesting because like if i

4772
02:21:46,719 --> 02:21:50,959
did let's say i did the simulation

4773
02:21:48,398 --> 02:21:52,159
now um the problem with that is like the

4774
02:21:50,959 --> 02:21:53,839
adaptations

4775
02:21:52,159 --> 02:21:55,200
from just like the breakdown and the

4776
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:56,880
strengthening would likely be gone

4777
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:59,760
unless i did it again

4778
02:21:56,879 --> 02:22:00,239
uh so i want to inch up to it so that

4779
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:02,079
like

4780
02:22:00,239 --> 02:22:04,079
and get close enough to the starting

4781
02:22:02,079 --> 02:22:06,398
date so that i'm still kind of like

4782
02:22:04,079 --> 02:22:07,359
you know holding on to that adaptation

4783
02:22:06,398 --> 02:22:08,639
when i start started

4784
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:10,960
so then those first few days maybe

4785
02:22:08,639 --> 02:22:14,000
aren't quite as miserable and you said

4786
02:22:10,959 --> 02:22:14,799
uh if everything goes amazing and you're

4787
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,200
challenging

4788
02:22:14,799 --> 02:22:18,559
the record it'll be like a 42 day run

4789
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,840
yeah so that's what the record is almost

4790
02:22:18,559 --> 02:22:22,318
exactly six weeks

4791
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:24,880
and that's at 72.5 miles per day so will

4792
02:22:22,318 --> 02:22:26,559
you be posting online and like

4793
02:22:24,879 --> 02:22:28,559
yeah instagram's gonna be a big one i

4794
02:22:26,559 --> 02:22:30,159
think i might do a few like youtube

4795
02:22:28,559 --> 02:22:33,119
stuff along the way too

4796
02:22:30,159 --> 02:22:35,200
um yeah i'm still iron out exactly how

4797
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:36,640
much i think at minimum i'll do

4798
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:38,079
i'll do some instagram stuff i think

4799
02:22:36,639 --> 02:22:39,599
i'll go live on instagram a few times

4800
02:22:38,079 --> 02:22:40,398
during the day when i take like walking

4801
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:42,720
breaks

4802
02:22:40,398 --> 02:22:44,239
uh partly just to kind of i think

4803
02:22:42,719 --> 02:22:44,959
keeping people in i mean it stays true

4804
02:22:44,239 --> 02:22:46,639
to the

4805
02:22:44,959 --> 02:22:49,119
the goal of raising awareness but it

4806
02:22:46,639 --> 02:22:51,519
also i find

4807
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:52,720
when you bring people in there is an

4808
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:55,439
added pressure to that

4809
02:22:52,719 --> 02:22:56,799
but there's also this sense that i've

4810
02:22:55,439 --> 02:22:58,159
learned from the treadmill experience

4811
02:22:56,799 --> 02:22:59,438
since we had like a pretty big

4812
02:22:58,159 --> 02:23:00,879
production for that

4813
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:02,479
in the sense that i mean as much as you

4814
02:23:00,879 --> 02:23:03,519
can turn on a camera in your own house

4815
02:23:02,478 --> 02:23:06,478
but like

4816
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:07,840
the i remember thinking we had like 30

4817
02:23:06,478 --> 02:23:08,879
people lined up to come in and guest

4818
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:11,280
speak during that

4819
02:23:08,879 --> 02:23:12,639
and there was points of that where i was

4820
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:13,840
like you know you get that voice you

4821
02:23:12,639 --> 02:23:14,478
talk about the beginning where it's like

4822
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:16,159
you know

4823
02:23:14,478 --> 02:23:17,679
maybe you could quit like do you really

4824
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:18,000
need to run 100 miles on a treadmill is

4825
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:19,840
this

4826
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,959
really going to be valuable for you yeah

4827
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:22,079
and then you think about oh you know

4828
02:23:20,959 --> 02:23:23,519
what there's uh

4829
02:23:22,079 --> 02:23:25,120
you know courtney dewalter one of the

4830
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:28,720
best female ultra owners to ever

4831
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:29,600
exist is taking an 30 minutes to an hour

4832
02:23:28,719 --> 02:23:33,039
out of her day

4833
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:36,079
to come on in two hours to you know help

4834
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:37,520
me you know amplify this event and do i

4835
02:23:36,079 --> 02:23:38,879
really want to be sending emails out to

4836
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:40,000
these people saying hey guys i know you

4837
02:23:38,879 --> 02:23:41,839
were gracious enough to

4838
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,040
block out time of your day you know i

4839
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:44,000
think there's a little bit of that to do

4840
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:45,760
where you're like you're

4841
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:47,280
you're jumping in with the community

4842
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:48,719
that is following along and saying

4843
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:49,840
here's how things are going

4844
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:52,000
show them the best the worst and

4845
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:53,200
everything between and then ultimately

4846
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,799
have that hold you accountable a little

4847
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:56,000
bit too it's like hard to get up in the

4848
02:23:54,799 --> 02:23:58,639
morning and not go back out

4849
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:00,318
i don't know how you are but i had to uh

4850
02:23:58,639 --> 02:24:01,119
whenever i did any kind of physical

4851
02:24:00,318 --> 02:24:03,760
stuff

4852
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:04,960
like the 48 hour challenge or just any

4853
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:08,079
kind of running

4854
02:24:04,959 --> 02:24:10,239
i hated turning on the camera i

4855
02:24:08,079 --> 02:24:12,398
hated it like because you have to like

4856
02:24:10,239 --> 02:24:13,920
smile and be friendly and stuff

4857
02:24:12,398 --> 02:24:15,599
oh i'm just gonna be super miserable if

4858
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:18,398
i'm miserable

4859
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:20,640
well that's it so like exactly in some

4860
02:24:18,398 --> 02:24:21,920
sense that's what people

4861
02:24:20,639 --> 02:24:23,680
you know we're going to get a happy zac

4862
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:24,799
or an angry exactly it's like you're

4863
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:28,000
making bets

4864
02:24:24,799 --> 02:24:31,119
and i'm sure there'll be some days maybe

4865
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:33,200
not many maybe very few where you're

4866
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:36,160
truly happy with yourself

4867
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:36,560
like for some weird ecstatic reason

4868
02:24:36,159 --> 02:24:38,239
maybe

4869
02:24:36,559 --> 02:24:40,639
if you get over the hump whatever that

4870
02:24:38,239 --> 02:24:42,478
you mentioned that this dip

4871
02:24:40,639 --> 02:24:44,639
i mean it's it's fascinating how many

4872
02:24:42,478 --> 02:24:46,719
how much suffering this actually entails

4873
02:24:44,639 --> 02:24:47,680
i wonder well and one thing i'm gonna

4874
02:24:46,719 --> 02:24:49,840
definitely

4875
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:51,760
try to leverage to my advantage and one

4876
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:53,359
of the reasons why i think

4877
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:54,880
fight for the forgotten was the charity

4878
02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:57,200
that really triggered me to

4879
02:24:54,879 --> 02:24:58,318
decide to do this the transcontinental

4880
02:24:57,200 --> 02:24:59,920
route was something i

4881
02:24:58,318 --> 02:25:01,519
learned about early in my ultra running

4882
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:02,799
career and i thought to myself i want to

4883
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:03,520
do that someday but it was one of those

4884
02:25:02,799 --> 02:25:04,959
kind of

4885
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:06,399
far off distance things that it never

4886
02:25:04,959 --> 02:25:08,079
really like actualized in your mind

4887
02:25:06,398 --> 02:25:09,439
until you put a date down or

4888
02:25:08,079 --> 02:25:11,200
you know mention it on the joe rogan

4889
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:12,559
experience or something like that

4890
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:15,120
but then then it's like people want to

4891
02:25:12,559 --> 02:25:18,559
know when is this happening and uh

4892
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:21,040
um you know what i try to think about is

4893
02:25:18,559 --> 02:25:22,478
you know the reason justin identified

4894
02:25:21,040 --> 02:25:24,800
the pygmy tribe

4895
02:25:22,478 --> 02:25:25,679
was because they were super forgotten

4896
02:25:24,799 --> 02:25:27,279
where you know

4897
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:29,200
we think about just like some of these

4898
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:32,159
third world countries where

4899
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:32,880
it's a scenario of like some people it's

4900
02:25:32,159 --> 02:25:34,639
easy for us

4901
02:25:32,879 --> 02:25:36,239
here in the us to think to ourselves

4902
02:25:34,639 --> 02:25:38,159
well why don't they just industrialize

4903
02:25:36,239 --> 02:25:40,000
why don't they just like you know

4904
02:25:38,159 --> 02:25:42,000
start to innovate a bit why are they so

4905
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:45,120
primitive what's wrong with them

4906
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,478
in reality like when you take uh when

4907
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:47,520
you scale things down to the degree

4908
02:25:46,478 --> 02:25:50,239
where

4909
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:51,439
you need the entire day because of the

4910
02:25:50,239 --> 02:25:53,359
situation you're in

4911
02:25:51,439 --> 02:25:54,639
just to take care of your basic needs of

4912
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:56,800
water and food

4913
02:25:54,639 --> 02:25:57,840
you never get the opportunity to even

4914
02:25:56,799 --> 02:26:00,879
build a real

4915
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:01,520
like establishment or you know build on

4916
02:26:00,879 --> 02:26:03,199
that

4917
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:05,040
like you need you need the free time or

4918
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:06,640
you need a portion of your population

4919
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:09,040
to have the free time available to

4920
02:26:06,639 --> 02:26:10,398
innovate and the pygmy tribe just hadn't

4921
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:12,000
had that historically in fact they

4922
02:26:10,398 --> 02:26:13,840
weren't even considered humans by like

4923
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,239
the local government for quite some time

4924
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:15,680
and

4925
02:26:14,239 --> 02:26:17,359
you know the people that really pay the

4926
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:18,720
price in some of these situations are

4927
02:26:17,359 --> 02:26:20,399
the women because they're the ones that

4928
02:26:18,719 --> 02:26:22,639
get saddled with like the water

4929
02:26:20,398 --> 02:26:24,318
gathering and things like that so the

4930
02:26:22,639 --> 02:26:25,519
reason that justin picked wells

4931
02:26:24,318 --> 02:26:27,600
to build was because he thought to

4932
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:29,439
himself if we can get them wells

4933
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:31,680
then now these women don't to spend all

4934
02:26:29,439 --> 02:26:33,520
day walking and carrying water

4935
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:35,439
now they can just get that water and now

4936
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:36,800
we have half the population freed up for

4937
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:37,359
other things now maybe they can start

4938
02:26:36,799 --> 02:26:39,119
farms

4939
02:26:37,359 --> 02:26:40,399
they can build some housing and stuff

4940
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:42,560
like that and it just

4941
02:26:40,398 --> 02:26:43,439
it exponentially improves once you take

4942
02:26:42,559 --> 02:26:46,559
care of some of those

4943
02:26:43,439 --> 02:26:47,760
big key early things so when i'm

4944
02:26:46,559 --> 02:26:49,279
thinking about like

4945
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:51,040
you know do i really need to go out here

4946
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:52,640
and travel another 12 hours a day my

4947
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:54,479
mind's going to hopefully go to

4948
02:26:52,639 --> 02:26:56,000
well if one of those women woke up in

4949
02:26:54,478 --> 02:26:57,358
the pygmy tribe one morning decided you

4950
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,159
know what do i really need to go get

4951
02:26:57,359 --> 02:27:00,640
water today

4952
02:26:58,159 --> 02:27:02,318
well yeah you do you really do have to

4953
02:27:00,639 --> 02:27:04,000
yeah you're running for that uh-huh

4954
02:27:02,318 --> 02:27:06,079
yeah and that that will give you fuel

4955
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,920
hopefully but

4956
02:27:06,079 --> 02:27:09,920
yeah yeah i mean the reality is always

4957
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:10,478
there where i don't have to do it like

4958
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:13,120
they do

4959
02:27:10,478 --> 02:27:15,119
have to do it so you know but i think

4960
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:18,160
just keeping that perspective

4961
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:19,120
it it puts us back to the beginning

4962
02:27:18,159 --> 02:27:20,799
where

4963
02:27:19,120 --> 02:27:22,319
it's this is one of those situations

4964
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:25,039
where i think it's like

4965
02:27:22,318 --> 02:27:26,959
uh a no-quit situation you have to put

4966
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:27,760
yourself in a no-quit situation here

4967
02:27:26,959 --> 02:27:30,559
because it's

4968
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:32,800
uh you know it's just bigger than you i

4969
02:27:30,559 --> 02:27:33,519
can't wait to see like the dark places

4970
02:27:32,799 --> 02:27:35,599
you go

4971
02:27:33,520 --> 02:27:37,040
i mean there's some yeah the the quit

4972
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:39,120
situations

4973
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:40,240
and hopefully we get to have a glimpse

4974
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:41,359
of those because i think those are

4975
02:27:40,239 --> 02:27:44,639
really inspiring

4976
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:45,040
when somebody is uh both gets broken by

4977
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:47,039
them

4978
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:49,520
because you know how tough you are but

4979
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:51,200
also it's almost broken and overcomes it

4980
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:52,159
i mean that's just fascinating stories i

4981
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:54,000
can't wait

4982
02:27:52,159 --> 02:27:56,239
i i know does joe know you're doing this

4983
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,680
by the way yeah i sent him

4984
02:27:56,239 --> 02:27:59,439
i sent him a note a while back because

4985
02:27:57,680 --> 02:28:01,120
he was the first spot i mentioned it on

4986
02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:02,398
so i think he he knows i'm not sure if

4987
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:03,840
he's followed along about the exact

4988
02:28:02,398 --> 02:28:06,239
starting date or well he will no

4989
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:07,359
this is great you'll probably think

4990
02:28:06,239 --> 02:28:10,799
you're a

4991
02:28:07,359 --> 02:28:13,359
crazy uh mfr for doing this but

4992
02:28:10,799 --> 02:28:14,799
uh i think you'll love it and i think i

4993
02:28:13,359 --> 02:28:15,359
love it and i think the world will love

4994
02:28:14,799 --> 02:28:17,358
it

4995
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:19,280
ridiculous question who's the greatest

4996
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:22,239
endurance runner

4997
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:23,520
or endurance athlete of all time oh

4998
02:28:22,239 --> 02:28:27,039
that's a good question

4999
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:31,200
um i think i'd probably go

5000
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:35,200
maybe two directions here uh

5001
02:28:31,200 --> 02:28:40,079
i think uh helly gabor lassie is

5002
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:43,200
one of the best in my opinion because

5003
02:28:40,079 --> 02:28:45,680
just i mean 27 world records

5004
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:46,399
like like not all the different distance

5005
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:48,000
but like

5006
02:28:46,398 --> 02:28:49,599
breaking and rebraking and that sort of

5007
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:53,439
stuff um

5008
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:56,479
i mean he ran two what was it 203

5009
02:28:53,439 --> 02:28:58,318
59 before the shoot technology came in

5010
02:28:56,478 --> 02:28:59,679
that is estimated at anywhere between a

5011
02:28:58,318 --> 02:29:00,799
two to eight percent performance

5012
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:01,600
advantage talking about a two hour

5013
02:29:00,799 --> 02:29:04,318
marathon two

5014
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:05,600
zero three yep two hour three minutes

5015
02:29:04,318 --> 02:29:06,799
yeah so he did that with the old shoe

5016
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:08,880
technology

5017
02:29:06,799 --> 02:29:10,159
which uh essentially dates back to

5018
02:29:08,879 --> 02:29:12,159
anything if

5019
02:29:10,159 --> 02:29:14,239
if you were a nike athlete it could date

5020
02:29:12,159 --> 02:29:16,318
back to as early as

5021
02:29:14,239 --> 02:29:17,920
i think early 2016 is when the first

5022
02:29:16,318 --> 02:29:20,000
prototype started showing up

5023
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:21,600
uh so if you're before that in your

5024
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:23,600
career you are using you're guaranteed

5025
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:26,640
to be using the old shoe technology

5026
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:29,439
um and i mean just the range of it too

5027
02:29:26,639 --> 02:29:30,000
and uh yeah it's it's hard i mean

5028
02:29:29,439 --> 02:29:32,398
there's there

5029
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:33,760
it's uh is he a marathon runner purely

5030
02:29:32,398 --> 02:29:34,719
no he did everything that's why i pick

5031
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:36,398
him i think because he

5032
02:29:34,719 --> 02:29:37,840
he he went everywhere everything from

5033
02:29:36,398 --> 02:29:40,239
the 800 and his like

5034
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:41,680
at a national 800 yeah at a national

5035
02:29:40,239 --> 02:29:43,600
level i don't he wasn't competing

5036
02:29:41,680 --> 02:29:44,880
at like olympics or anything in the 800

5037
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:48,239
but he was he was

5038
02:29:44,879 --> 02:29:50,719
mostly like 5k to marathon um

5039
02:29:48,239 --> 02:29:52,239
yeah yeah so just incredible i mean i i

5040
02:29:50,719 --> 02:29:53,840
could go a totally different direction

5041
02:29:52,239 --> 02:29:54,478
too i think like steve prefontaine

5042
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:56,559
stands out

5043
02:29:54,478 --> 02:29:58,159
in as an american runner just because if

5044
02:29:56,559 --> 02:29:59,519
you look at it outside of just like

5045
02:29:58,159 --> 02:30:02,840
performances

5046
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:06,079
and stuff like that i think um

5047
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:09,920
he basic like you can't find

5048
02:30:06,079 --> 02:30:12,639
an american male runner who

5049
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:14,159
probably didn't get some motivation or

5050
02:30:12,639 --> 02:30:14,639
some catalyst into their running journey

5051
02:30:14,159 --> 02:30:16,478
from

5052
02:30:14,639 --> 02:30:18,398
a prefontaine story or what would you

5053
02:30:16,478 --> 02:30:20,159
say is inspiring about prefontaine

5054
02:30:18,398 --> 02:30:22,478
uh like from the philosophy from the

5055
02:30:20,159 --> 02:30:24,559
technique from his story

5056
02:30:22,478 --> 02:30:25,760
uh i think there's a few things i mean

5057
02:30:24,559 --> 02:30:27,279
there's a lot of things which is why he

5058
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:29,439
is who he is it's uh

5059
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:31,280
one was just his attitude about it where

5060
02:30:29,439 --> 02:30:33,600
um he wasn't like this

5061
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:34,880
picture ask runner i mean he was

5062
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:36,800
obviously talented

5063
02:30:34,879 --> 02:30:38,079
but you know you have the perfect story

5064
02:30:36,799 --> 02:30:38,879
of like he wanted to be good at

5065
02:30:38,079 --> 02:30:41,840
something

5066
02:30:38,879 --> 02:30:43,039
like most american kids tried football

5067
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:44,000
no hard work was going to get

5068
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:46,399
pre-fontaine

5069
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,040
starting in varsity for football starts

5070
02:30:46,398 --> 02:30:49,760
running

5071
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:51,359
he fell in love with a mile uh his

5072
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:52,478
college coach told him no you're not

5073
02:30:51,359 --> 02:30:52,960
going to be a miler you're going to be a

5074
02:30:52,478 --> 02:30:55,279
5k

5075
02:30:52,959 --> 02:30:56,879
guy and he popularized the 5k in the

5076
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,920
united states or three mile in some

5077
02:30:56,879 --> 02:31:00,398
cases

5078
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:01,439
and i mean he would the way he would

5079
02:31:00,398 --> 02:31:03,760
race i think is what

5080
02:31:01,439 --> 02:31:04,800
really made him interesting for po folks

5081
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:06,559
where he would

5082
02:31:04,799 --> 02:31:08,239
he was just like all guts runner where

5083
02:31:06,559 --> 02:31:09,600
he's like he's like i mean one of his

5084
02:31:08,239 --> 02:31:11,520
famous quotes was like

5085
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:12,800
if you if you beat me you're gonna have

5086
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:14,079
to bleed to do it because he's gonna be

5087
02:31:12,799 --> 02:31:16,000
in old guts race in

5088
02:31:14,079 --> 02:31:17,840
in a sport where it gets very tactical

5089
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,359
at times especially at the like

5090
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:21,760
national or i shouldn't say national but

5091
02:31:19,359 --> 02:31:23,520
at the like competition level

5092
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:25,280
the championship level where it's like

5093
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:26,560
kind of more of a sit and kick

5094
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:27,680
approach a lot of times where everyone's

5095
02:31:26,559 --> 02:31:29,600
kind of waiting for someone to make a

5096
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:31,359
move like priy was going to make a move

5097
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:33,200
really early yes so this idea of leading

5098
02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:34,239
from the front which i guess is

5099
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:37,280
tactically

5100
02:31:34,239 --> 02:31:39,840
really a bad idea well from a

5101
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:41,120
from a running a pr standpoint it's a

5102
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:44,559
bad idea

5103
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:47,040
in most cases but so race i guess is not

5104
02:31:44,559 --> 02:31:47,760
just about the pr mm-hmm so race it's

5105
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:49,120
about winning

5106
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:50,239
in a lot of cases and that's what he

5107
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:51,280
thought was going to put him in the best

5108
02:31:50,239 --> 02:31:52,719
advantage to win i think

5109
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:54,000
it's just the run from the front i mean

5110
02:31:52,719 --> 02:31:54,398
what what do you cause you mentioned

5111
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,799
this

5112
02:31:54,398 --> 02:31:57,920
uh the 100 mile you ran you were in

5113
02:31:56,799 --> 02:32:01,279
second place in the

5114
02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:04,079
in 90s you were able to get to the

5115
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:06,159
first place how hard is it to run when

5116
02:32:04,079 --> 02:32:07,680
you're in first place

5117
02:32:06,159 --> 02:32:09,439
you know i think this is really

5118
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:10,639
different some people thrive under it

5119
02:32:09,439 --> 02:32:11,920
where it's like for them

5120
02:32:10,639 --> 02:32:13,439
i mean like i talked about jim walsh

5121
02:32:11,920 --> 02:32:13,840
before i think he loves being in the

5122
02:32:13,439 --> 02:32:15,520
front

5123
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:17,040
if he's in the front he loves it that's

5124
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:17,840
where he's excited that's where he knows

5125
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:19,520
he's

5126
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:21,680
he's doing what he's doing where he's

5127
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:23,760
pushing his limits and things like that

5128
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:25,359
uh pree was probably the same way and i

5129
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:26,880
think there's other folks who are

5130
02:32:25,359 --> 02:32:28,239
much more comfortable kind of saying

5131
02:32:26,879 --> 02:32:29,039
let's let things settle down here a

5132
02:32:28,239 --> 02:32:31,039
little bit

5133
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:32,240
and uh then i'll make my move when it's

5134
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:34,800
time to make my move

5135
02:32:32,239 --> 02:32:36,398
or they think of it as and this is a

5136
02:32:34,799 --> 02:32:37,840
very important i think lesson for

5137
02:32:36,398 --> 02:32:40,879
for the average ultra runner is just

5138
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:42,318
like knowing what you're capable of

5139
02:32:40,879 --> 02:32:44,639
is going to be an important piece to the

5140
02:32:42,318 --> 02:32:48,000
puzzle because you can like

5141
02:32:44,639 --> 02:32:50,079
you you you can try to say i want to run

5142
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:52,159
faster than i'm capable of

5143
02:32:50,079 --> 02:32:53,840
in an early part of a 100 miler but then

5144
02:32:52,159 --> 02:32:55,680
you're going to pay for it at the end

5145
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:57,040
so really unless you're trying to go for

5146
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:58,800
the win and that's a tactic that you

5147
02:32:57,040 --> 02:33:00,479
think is going to produce a win versus

5148
02:32:58,799 --> 02:33:01,599
trying to run your fastest time you got

5149
02:33:00,478 --> 02:33:03,840
to run within yourself

5150
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:04,720
within your parameters obviously there's

5151
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:05,920
a big question about

5152
02:33:04,719 --> 02:33:07,840
where those parameters are in a lot of

5153
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:09,200
cases which makes ultramarathon even

5154
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:10,639
more interesting because it's like

5155
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:12,399
there's so much unknown about it it's

5156
02:33:10,639 --> 02:33:13,439
like well maybe you can go faster and we

5157
02:33:12,398 --> 02:33:15,119
just don't know yet

5158
02:33:13,439 --> 02:33:16,800
so there's in the face of that

5159
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:19,040
uncertainty there's something admirable

5160
02:33:16,799 --> 02:33:21,358
like it was with prefontaine

5161
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:22,560
where you take the risk and run faster

5162
02:33:21,359 --> 02:33:24,880
than

5163
02:33:22,559 --> 02:33:26,398
you know you you think you might be able

5164
02:33:24,879 --> 02:33:29,599
to run

5165
02:33:26,398 --> 02:33:31,358
in terms of pace that you can hold so

5166
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:32,399
push the pace that's possible yeah

5167
02:33:31,359 --> 02:33:33,920
explore the unknown

5168
02:33:32,398 --> 02:33:35,599
experience i think it's like a pioneer

5169
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:38,159
spirit right yeah you know the

5170
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:40,159
next frontier kind of a thing but i mean

5171
02:33:38,159 --> 02:33:41,520
prefontaine also there's other angles

5172
02:33:40,159 --> 02:33:42,799
with him too where he was like in the

5173
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:44,800
amateur era where

5174
02:33:42,799 --> 02:33:46,559
to be an olympian you couldn't be pro so

5175
02:33:44,799 --> 02:33:48,239
he's turning down i mean the guy was on

5176
02:33:46,559 --> 02:33:50,159
food stamps and living in a trailer

5177
02:33:48,239 --> 02:33:50,559
because he wanted to run at the olympics

5178
02:33:50,159 --> 02:33:52,559
and

5179
02:33:50,559 --> 02:33:54,559
there was a lot of like politics

5180
02:33:52,559 --> 02:33:55,840
involved with not being able to take

5181
02:33:54,559 --> 02:33:57,760
take sponsorship money and things like

5182
02:33:55,840 --> 02:34:00,719
that which has changed since then but

5183
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:02,639
uh so he was huge in the movement for

5184
02:34:00,719 --> 02:34:05,519
that to kind of like

5185
02:34:02,639 --> 02:34:06,559
you know have a situation where now as

5186
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:09,040
an athlete you can

5187
02:34:06,559 --> 02:34:10,799
finish in most cases finish college sign

5188
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:11,920
a big contract with uh you know a

5189
02:34:10,799 --> 02:34:13,438
sponsor and then

5190
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:14,799
also still compete in the olympic games

5191
02:34:13,439 --> 02:34:15,920
and go to the events that are actually

5192
02:34:14,799 --> 02:34:17,599
ones that are going to

5193
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:19,920
likely catapult your career in most of

5194
02:34:17,600 --> 02:34:21,439
the olympic distance endurance events so

5195
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:22,960
so he just revolutionized the sport and

5196
02:34:21,439 --> 02:34:24,000
then to add even more flavor to the

5197
02:34:22,959 --> 02:34:26,000
whole thing i mean

5198
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:27,600
he died of very premature death he got

5199
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:30,239
in a car accident and

5200
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:31,760
died before he would have likely

5201
02:34:30,239 --> 02:34:34,000
probably meddled at the olympics

5202
02:34:31,760 --> 02:34:36,478
so he and there was a tragedy the fact

5203
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:37,840
that he didn't

5204
02:34:36,478 --> 02:34:39,760
yeah well he was fourth place at the

5205
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:41,280
olympics the prior

5206
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:42,478
his first go of it and it was kind of

5207
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:43,760
one of those things where it's like

5208
02:34:42,478 --> 02:34:44,000
fourth place at the olympics is the

5209
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:45,200
first

5210
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,200
man looking out or the first woman

5211
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:48,640
looking out and for a guy that had as

5212
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:50,159
much hype as him i think like

5213
02:34:48,639 --> 02:34:51,920
a medal was something he really wanted

5214
02:34:50,159 --> 02:34:54,398
to take home with him there and

5215
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:55,680
especially how that race went i mean

5216
02:34:54,398 --> 02:34:57,519
yeah i don't know it's

5217
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:58,800
it's it's tragic the whole thing but

5218
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:00,880
that's one of the things that makes

5219
02:34:58,799 --> 02:35:01,358
olympics amazing is the tragedy of it

5220
02:35:00,879 --> 02:35:04,639
like

5221
02:35:01,359 --> 02:35:07,439
one race decides the story of a lifetime

5222
02:35:04,639 --> 02:35:08,719
which is like yeah that's why it's

5223
02:35:07,439 --> 02:35:10,800
that's why it's amazing

5224
02:35:08,719 --> 02:35:12,719
even if a lot of people get hurt because

5225
02:35:10,799 --> 02:35:16,398
of it

5226
02:35:12,719 --> 02:35:18,799
tragedy makes the the triumph special

5227
02:35:16,398 --> 02:35:19,760
right yeah and well it makes i mean it

5228
02:35:18,799 --> 02:35:22,159
makes life

5229
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:22,880
like a movie almost where exactly if

5230
02:35:22,159 --> 02:35:24,398
everything's all

5231
02:35:22,879 --> 02:35:25,920
sunshine and rainbows then it's not as

5232
02:35:24,398 --> 02:35:27,039
entertaining to watch yeah there's no

5233
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:30,159
adversity to overcome

5234
02:35:27,040 --> 02:35:32,319
you mentioned shoe technology how much

5235
02:35:30,159 --> 02:35:33,680
has shoe technology advanced through the

5236
02:35:32,318 --> 02:35:35,439
past few decades

5237
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:36,800
how much has it changed running

5238
02:35:35,439 --> 02:35:39,439
generally but also

5239
02:35:36,799 --> 02:35:40,079
running like ultra marathon running i

5240
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:43,120
would say in

5241
02:35:40,079 --> 02:35:45,600
ultra running it's had much of a less

5242
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:46,640
of an impact because ultra running is

5243
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:49,680
still

5244
02:35:46,639 --> 02:35:50,639
heavily skewed towards the trails so the

5245
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:51,920
technology

5246
02:35:50,639 --> 02:35:53,279
at least from what we know isn't

5247
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:55,280
necessarily translating over to these

5248
02:35:53,280 --> 02:35:56,640
like massive varied terrains certainly

5249
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:57,280
not the technical terrain and things

5250
02:35:56,639 --> 02:35:59,279
like that

5251
02:35:57,280 --> 02:36:01,280
now on road races flat stuff like the

5252
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:03,840
track stuff the roads the

5253
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:04,960
run i guess you a runnable trail um

5254
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:06,478
where it's just like basically crushed

5255
02:36:04,959 --> 02:36:08,318
limestone more or less

5256
02:36:06,478 --> 02:36:10,398
uh you definitely get an advantage from

5257
02:36:08,318 --> 02:36:13,439
it it's uh and essentially what

5258
02:36:10,398 --> 02:36:14,959
what happened um is in

5259
02:36:13,439 --> 02:36:16,880
it this probably dated back actually

5260
02:36:14,959 --> 02:36:19,599
before 2015

5261
02:36:16,879 --> 02:36:20,478
uh you know nike decided well their

5262
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:23,520
their their

5263
02:36:20,478 --> 02:36:24,000
their development team uh was ahead of

5264
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:25,840
the curve

5265
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:27,280
they've developed this new foam they

5266
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:30,079
call it like a peabod foam

5267
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:31,520
uh and they they realized that like when

5268
02:36:30,079 --> 02:36:34,318
you step down into a shoe

5269
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:35,359
the reason like uh racers a lot of times

5270
02:36:34,318 --> 02:36:36,959
would wear these flats

5271
02:36:35,359 --> 02:36:39,120
because they're trying to take out any

5272
02:36:36,959 --> 02:36:40,000
of that lost energy into the foam in the

5273
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:42,399
shoe

5274
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:45,040
well this foam that nike came out with

5275
02:36:42,398 --> 02:36:46,719
is so good that it actually returns

5276
02:36:45,040 --> 02:36:48,399
way more energy than the average foam

5277
02:36:46,719 --> 02:36:49,760
did to the point where

5278
02:36:48,398 --> 02:36:51,119
like when they test these things on like

5279
02:36:49,760 --> 02:36:51,920
force plate treadmills and things like

5280
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:53,920
that it's like a

5281
02:36:51,920 --> 02:36:55,120
depending on the person's gait and

5282
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:55,680
sometimes it's like a two to eight

5283
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:57,520
percent

5284
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:59,200
improvement in performance i mean we've

5285
02:36:57,520 --> 02:37:00,880
seen records just

5286
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:02,640
across the board get broken since this

5287
02:37:00,879 --> 02:37:05,519
came out all distances

5288
02:37:02,639 --> 02:37:06,719
basically yeah yeah i think from at

5289
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:08,880
least from the

5290
02:37:06,719 --> 02:37:09,920
5k up through the marathon and i mean

5291
02:37:08,879 --> 02:37:12,000
we've seen some

5292
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:14,239
insane improvements in the marathon i

5293
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,959
think like uh the women's marathon went

5294
02:37:14,239 --> 02:37:16,318
from

5295
02:37:14,959 --> 02:37:20,239
what was considered relatively

5296
02:37:16,318 --> 02:37:23,439
untouchable like 216 to a 214

5297
02:37:20,239 --> 02:37:25,600
and i mean like it was like 218 was like

5298
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:27,520
just world class like if you could run a

5299
02:37:25,600 --> 02:37:29,040
218 marathon as a woman that was like

5300
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:31,680
i mean it still is to a degree but then

5301
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:33,439
you know now you have someone run a 214

5302
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:34,880
like that's and you attribute a lot of

5303
02:37:33,439 --> 02:37:37,280
that to the the shoe

5304
02:37:34,879 --> 02:37:38,478
yeah yeah i think there's probably other

5305
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:40,079
things that come in mind too like now

5306
02:37:38,478 --> 02:37:42,079
that people know there's a performance

5307
02:37:40,079 --> 02:37:43,520
advantage from a mechanical standpoint

5308
02:37:42,079 --> 02:37:45,359
it's also a confidence thing where it's

5309
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:46,960
like oh no i can probably

5310
02:37:45,359 --> 02:37:48,318
try going five seconds per mile faster

5311
02:37:46,959 --> 02:37:49,839
and maybe they could have anyway and

5312
02:37:48,318 --> 02:37:51,119
they just now they think they can so

5313
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:53,439
they are so there's probably a little

5314
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:54,720
bit of that that's just adding to it

5315
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:56,479
do you think there's a lot of extra

5316
02:37:54,719 --> 02:37:56,959
innovation that's still possible like

5317
02:37:56,478 --> 02:38:00,000
what

5318
02:37:56,959 --> 02:38:01,679
if you could do this kind of big leap

5319
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:03,200
with a little innovation of foam is

5320
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:05,200
there other stuff that you can do or

5321
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:07,200
further innovation materials that make

5322
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:07,840
up the foam yeah so they can definitely

5323
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:10,079
go much

5324
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:11,280
more advantage they put a cap on it

5325
02:38:10,079 --> 02:38:13,439
essentially so

5326
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:14,800
there was a there's also a carbon plate

5327
02:38:13,439 --> 02:38:16,479
element to this too where they put like

5328
02:38:14,799 --> 02:38:17,519
this carbon plate in there in between

5329
02:38:16,478 --> 02:38:20,559
the foam

5330
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:22,800
so like i believe when when kipchaki

5331
02:38:20,559 --> 02:38:23,600
broke well when they did that that kind

5332
02:38:22,799 --> 02:38:26,719
of uh

5333
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:29,280
uh the sub two hour project he actually

5334
02:38:26,719 --> 02:38:30,879
had on a shoe if i'm not mistaken that

5335
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:33,200
never got to market because they put

5336
02:38:30,879 --> 02:38:35,199
down some parameters on it after

5337
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:36,720
uh before it that one came to market

5338
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:38,800
where it was actually like

5339
02:38:36,719 --> 02:38:40,318
stacked up to i can't remember how many

5340
02:38:38,799 --> 02:38:41,840
millimeters was an insane amount and

5341
02:38:40,318 --> 02:38:42,959
they had like i think maybe even three

5342
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:44,478
layer plates in there

5343
02:38:42,959 --> 02:38:46,879
and that was a nike shoe he was wearing

5344
02:38:44,478 --> 02:38:50,079
yeah yeah so what makes it kind of

5345
02:38:46,879 --> 02:38:52,000
controversial or difficult is nike came

5346
02:38:50,079 --> 02:38:53,359
out with these prototypes so prototype

5347
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,799
for people don't understand shoes like

5348
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:56,239
these these companies they'll develop a

5349
02:38:54,799 --> 02:38:57,438
shoe and it usually takes like

5350
02:38:56,239 --> 02:39:00,639
somewhere in the neighborhood of like

5351
02:38:57,439 --> 02:39:03,359
probably 18 months to hit the market

5352
02:39:00,639 --> 02:39:04,398
so if you're like a sponsored athlete or

5353
02:39:03,359 --> 02:39:05,840
work for the company

5354
02:39:04,398 --> 02:39:07,760
you can get your hands on these shoes

5355
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:10,000
before they actually come to market

5356
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:11,359
so we had an issue i think this wasn't

5357
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,719
necessarily as big of an issue in the

5358
02:39:11,359 --> 02:39:14,960
ultra running community but

5359
02:39:12,719 --> 02:39:17,039
uh in the track and field olympic

5360
02:39:14,959 --> 02:39:19,358
distance stuff was a big issue because

5361
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:21,120
you had nike athletes having these

5362
02:39:19,359 --> 02:39:21,520
prototype shoes before anyone could get

5363
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:22,880
them

5364
02:39:21,520 --> 02:39:24,640
and then you had athletes were sponsored

5365
02:39:22,879 --> 02:39:26,318
by these other brands who couldn't wear

5366
02:39:24,639 --> 02:39:27,760
them even if

5367
02:39:26,318 --> 02:39:29,760
even when they did come to market so

5368
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:30,639
then we had this like chase to catch up

5369
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:32,318
where

5370
02:39:30,639 --> 02:39:33,760
uh other companies are starting to make

5371
02:39:32,318 --> 02:39:34,879
their own version of it and now we're

5372
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:37,200
getting to a point

5373
02:39:34,879 --> 02:39:38,398
where most companies have a version of

5374
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:41,680
that shoe

5375
02:39:38,398 --> 02:39:44,799
um but we had a huge transition phase

5376
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:46,318
that impacted the olympics big time

5377
02:39:44,799 --> 02:39:48,398
i mean think of here's a here's an

5378
02:39:46,318 --> 02:39:51,199
example of it uh there's a

5379
02:39:48,398 --> 02:39:52,000
there was a an athlete kara goucher um

5380
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:54,960
she

5381
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:57,040
was not she was a nike athlete wasn't uh

5382
02:39:54,959 --> 02:40:00,398
when they came out with this shoe

5383
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:02,080
and she ran the olympic trial marathon

5384
02:40:00,398 --> 02:40:04,159
and got fourth place the first person

5385
02:40:02,079 --> 02:40:05,359
out and two of the people had ever had

5386
02:40:04,159 --> 02:40:07,760
that shoe on

5387
02:40:05,359 --> 02:40:08,800
and she was maybe a minute or two like

5388
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:09,920
i'd have to look to see exactly but it

5389
02:40:08,799 --> 02:40:12,239
was within the

5390
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:14,000
the performance advantage range and so

5391
02:40:12,239 --> 02:40:16,799
you could argue that she was the first

5392
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:18,719
person in modern running to lose an

5393
02:40:16,799 --> 02:40:19,679
olympic spot due to a technological

5394
02:40:18,719 --> 02:40:22,478
disadvantage

5395
02:40:19,680 --> 02:40:23,279
wow and and it's like i mean it's one of

5396
02:40:22,478 --> 02:40:24,639
those

5397
02:40:23,279 --> 02:40:27,359
yeah i mean it's one of those things

5398
02:40:24,639 --> 02:40:29,358
where like um

5399
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:31,040
it's it's a transition right so there's

5400
02:40:29,359 --> 02:40:32,079
gonna be bumpy road and there's gonna be

5401
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:34,399
people that get caught in that

5402
02:40:32,079 --> 02:40:37,439
transition that it's unfortunate for

5403
02:40:34,398 --> 02:40:39,680
but it's also like uh you know once

5404
02:40:37,439 --> 02:40:41,439
everything does catch up and every shoe

5405
02:40:39,680 --> 02:40:42,880
company has a version of this there's

5406
02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:44,079
still problems i mean these are

5407
02:40:42,879 --> 02:40:44,879
incredibly expensive shoes it's like a

5408
02:40:44,079 --> 02:40:46,559
250

5409
02:40:44,879 --> 02:40:49,039
shoe so it's like at what point do you

5410
02:40:46,559 --> 02:40:49,840
tell like a wealthy family with a high

5411
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:52,240
school

5412
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:53,920
kid that you know you can get that 250

5413
02:40:52,239 --> 02:40:55,359
shoot and then you go and this kid's

5414
02:40:53,920 --> 02:40:56,960
family can barely afford a pair of shoes

5415
02:40:55,359 --> 02:40:58,399
for that much less a 250

5416
02:40:56,959 --> 02:41:00,839
pair of shoes like where do we draw that

5417
02:40:58,398 --> 02:41:03,760
line and that sort of stuff

5418
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:04,079
um also just here's the other big one

5419
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:05,920
like

5420
02:41:04,079 --> 02:41:07,520
let's i mean two to eight percent is a

5421
02:41:05,920 --> 02:41:08,879
massive range what if you're on the two

5422
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:09,600
percent versus someone's on the eight

5423
02:41:08,879 --> 02:41:11,759
percent

5424
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:13,359
you know chances are if you're you know

5425
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:15,439
blowing a record out of the water you're

5426
02:41:13,359 --> 02:41:17,279
probably closer to that high-end

5427
02:41:15,439 --> 02:41:18,398
percentage versus someone who's maybe

5428
02:41:17,279 --> 02:41:19,920
getting incremental gains or probably

5429
02:41:18,398 --> 02:41:22,000
closer to that lower end

5430
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:23,760
so is it fair to have a piece of

5431
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:25,120
equipment that has that big of a range

5432
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:26,559
when we're talking about

5433
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:28,640
less than a percent determining these

5434
02:41:26,559 --> 02:41:30,318
races when all is held constant

5435
02:41:28,639 --> 02:41:31,840
those are fascinating like philosophical

5436
02:41:30,318 --> 02:41:33,760
questions that i think

5437
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:35,840
it's nice to solve that for the shoe or

5438
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:37,760
to raise those questions for a shoe

5439
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:39,359
because the more complicated place where

5440
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:40,159
they will be raised is probably like

5441
02:41:39,359 --> 02:41:41,760
genetics

5442
02:41:40,159 --> 02:41:43,840
genetic engineering all those kinds of

5443
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:45,279
things yeah you'll get a lot more

5444
02:41:43,840 --> 02:41:46,478
complicated

5445
02:41:45,279 --> 02:41:48,000
so it's nice when you have like a

5446
02:41:46,478 --> 02:41:49,760
particular piece of technology that's

5447
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:51,760
just like right there it's a shoe

5448
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:54,478
we can understand and we can study it

5449
02:41:51,760 --> 02:41:55,120
right we may be coming on the precipice

5450
02:41:54,478 --> 02:41:57,519
of like

5451
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:59,279
human powered sport performance is no

5452
02:41:57,520 --> 02:41:59,520
longer being something that we like look

5453
02:41:59,279 --> 02:42:02,560
at

5454
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:03,120
as this like pinnacle of uh like i don't

5455
02:42:02,559 --> 02:42:05,199
maybe

5456
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:07,120
entertainment's the wrong word but like

5457
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:08,800
is that a pursuit

5458
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:10,240
you know do we end up just going a

5459
02:42:08,799 --> 02:42:11,679
different direction i mean i think it's

5460
02:42:10,239 --> 02:42:12,000
like it's so hard for us to think about

5461
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:13,520
that

5462
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:15,120
right now because it's so part of like

5463
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:16,159
the culture and the lifestyle of the

5464
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:18,800
average

5465
02:42:16,159 --> 02:42:20,879
person where like sport is a hobby of

5466
02:42:18,799 --> 02:42:24,000
theirs as well as a passion to follow

5467
02:42:20,879 --> 02:42:25,519
and it's like how complicated does it

5468
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,239
need to get before people lose that

5469
02:42:25,520 --> 02:42:28,239
interest

5470
02:42:26,239 --> 02:42:30,239
and and there could be a future where

5471
02:42:28,239 --> 02:42:31,199
most of the olympics is esports somebody

5472
02:42:30,239 --> 02:42:32,959
told me

5473
02:42:31,200 --> 02:42:34,479
that esports is in the olympics i've

5474
02:42:32,959 --> 02:42:37,199
been meaning to look this up oh

5475
02:42:34,478 --> 02:42:38,639
huh which is you know like what video so

5476
02:42:37,200 --> 02:42:40,880
video games are in the olympics

5477
02:42:38,639 --> 02:42:41,760
yeah yeah it could be as like a trial

5478
02:42:40,879 --> 02:42:44,879
that they're doing

5479
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:47,520
mm-hmm um yeah

5480
02:42:44,879 --> 02:42:48,799
if this is true i'm trying in real time

5481
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:51,920
look it up but if this is if this

5482
02:42:48,799 --> 02:42:55,679
esports joining olympics in 2024

5483
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:57,359
wow so that could be just a

5484
02:42:55,680 --> 02:42:59,359
that could be a fun side thing but it

5485
02:42:57,359 --> 02:43:01,439
could be a first step into

5486
02:42:59,359 --> 02:43:03,040
a complete transformation what sports

5487
02:43:01,439 --> 02:43:05,520
mean yeah because you can control video

5488
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:08,319
games better than you control

5489
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:09,920
for genetics and humans well in reality

5490
02:43:08,318 --> 02:43:10,639
we've been dealing with this problem in

5491
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:12,398
other areas

5492
02:43:10,639 --> 02:43:14,000
just with the performance enhancing side

5493
02:43:12,398 --> 02:43:15,199
of things with drugs and all that stuff

5494
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:17,120
too and anyway that

5495
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:18,399
that conversations flared back up with

5496
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:19,520
track and field too where

5497
02:43:18,398 --> 02:43:21,039
we are seeing a lot of records get

5498
02:43:19,520 --> 02:43:22,239
broken a lot of it probably is to shoot

5499
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:24,640
technology but

5500
02:43:22,239 --> 02:43:25,760
you know in 2020 with the covid stuff

5501
02:43:24,639 --> 02:43:28,079
you you have all these out of

5502
02:43:25,760 --> 02:43:29,760
competition testing protocols that a lot

5503
02:43:28,079 --> 02:43:30,639
of these top tier olympic athletes are

5504
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:33,439
getting

5505
02:43:30,639 --> 02:43:35,599
uh to try to eliminate like is it like

5506
02:43:33,439 --> 02:43:37,760
if you just do inter competition testing

5507
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:39,120
like there's potential for people to do

5508
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:40,559
things that are

5509
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:41,920
uh going to give them a performance

5510
02:43:40,559 --> 02:43:42,639
advantage but not going to show up on

5511
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:44,960
that

5512
02:43:42,639 --> 02:43:46,478
test on the day of or after the race

5513
02:43:44,959 --> 02:43:48,398
where now you have these like

5514
02:43:46,478 --> 02:43:49,119
limitations of being able to test so do

5515
02:43:48,398 --> 02:43:51,680
we have a

5516
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:53,520
like a group of athletes now who decided

5517
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:54,960
oh i'm not going to get tested in 2020

5518
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:56,159
do the covert restrictions is the time

5519
02:43:54,959 --> 02:43:57,599
to dope up and then

5520
02:43:56,159 --> 02:43:59,279
you know hit some stride and some

5521
02:43:57,600 --> 02:44:00,800
records and then taper back off when

5522
02:43:59,279 --> 02:44:01,439
they get this thing fired back up again

5523
02:44:00,799 --> 02:44:02,879
and

5524
02:44:01,439 --> 02:44:04,318
so there may be some of that as well and

5525
02:44:02,879 --> 02:44:05,119
i mean that's always been an ongoing

5526
02:44:04,318 --> 02:44:06,318
problem and

5527
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:07,920
yeah but the boost you get from

5528
02:44:06,318 --> 02:44:09,439
performance-enhancing drugs could be

5529
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:10,079
tiny relative to the stuff we have in

5530
02:44:09,439 --> 02:44:11,680
the future

5531
02:44:10,079 --> 02:44:13,920
right yeah you might be the last

5532
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:17,279
generation of like

5533
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:19,200
natural unmodified humans that

5534
02:44:17,279 --> 02:44:21,120
we're running and who knows maybe that's

5535
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:24,560
already over who knows who's

5536
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:25,760
who's modified that that's that's true

5537
02:44:24,559 --> 02:44:27,920
you might we might be living through

5538
02:44:25,760 --> 02:44:31,200
that transition to the new nike shoe

5539
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:33,439
but broadly defined yeah

5540
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:34,479
so you'll be uh in some sense in in the

5541
02:44:33,439 --> 02:44:37,680
history books as

5542
02:44:34,478 --> 02:44:39,599
uh humans used to run without any

5543
02:44:37,680 --> 02:44:41,520
modifications they used to destroy their

5544
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:42,000
body and let it recover and then do it

5545
02:44:41,520 --> 02:44:44,720
again

5546
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:46,879
and they used to be impressed with the

5547
02:44:44,719 --> 02:44:50,079
with an 11 hour

5548
02:44:46,879 --> 02:44:53,519
100 mile time when we could do it in

5549
02:44:50,079 --> 02:44:56,719
under an hour now yeah yeah so uh but

5550
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:58,319
nevertheless it is incred the four mile

5551
02:44:56,719 --> 02:45:00,159
the four minute mile was incredibly

5552
02:44:58,318 --> 02:45:03,199
impressive uh

5553
02:45:00,159 --> 02:45:04,478
the i really love the 11 hour mark for

5554
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:08,399
the 100

5555
02:45:04,478 --> 02:45:10,318
and the two hour marathon by most people

5556
02:45:08,398 --> 02:45:11,519
um for the longest time was thought to

5557
02:45:10,318 --> 02:45:13,039
be impossible

5558
02:45:11,520 --> 02:45:14,960
you know there's still people that think

5559
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:15,840
it's impossible with under certain

5560
02:45:14,959 --> 02:45:19,438
constraints

5561
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:22,719
so um uh elliot kipchoge

5562
02:45:19,439 --> 02:45:23,920
of kenya as you mentioned ran a one-hour

5563
02:45:22,719 --> 02:45:27,599
59-minute

5564
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:30,398
40-second marathon but he had

5565
02:45:27,600 --> 02:45:31,600
like he said the prototype shoes and he

5566
02:45:30,398 --> 02:45:34,079
had the

5567
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:35,279
the pace setters yeah i don't know how

5568
02:45:34,079 --> 02:45:37,279
essential that is

5569
02:45:35,279 --> 02:45:38,560
but it seems quite essential do you

5570
02:45:37,279 --> 02:45:39,680
think it's possible

5571
02:45:38,559 --> 02:45:41,760
first of all what do you think about

5572
02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:43,680
that accomplishment uh

5573
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:46,318
and he is one of the greatest if not the

5574
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:47,120
greatest marathon runners of all time

5575
02:45:46,318 --> 02:45:48,398
what do you think about that

5576
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:50,399
accomplishment and do you think it's

5577
02:45:48,398 --> 02:45:53,199
possible to run a two-hour marathon

5578
02:45:50,398 --> 02:45:54,799
without any assistance yeah i mean i

5579
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:56,079
think yeah there's no question about it

5580
02:45:54,799 --> 02:45:59,278
regardless of technology

5581
02:45:56,079 --> 02:46:02,959
he's world class if not the best

5582
02:45:59,279 --> 02:46:05,279
the i think he

5583
02:46:02,959 --> 02:46:06,079
i think he could go under two or someone

5584
02:46:05,279 --> 02:46:09,439
equivalent

5585
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:12,559
to him could go under two hours with

5586
02:46:09,439 --> 02:46:15,279
with the shoe technology probably what

5587
02:46:12,559 --> 02:46:18,239
it'll take is it'll take a fast course

5588
02:46:15,279 --> 02:46:18,960
a course that has like very few tangents

5589
02:46:18,239 --> 02:46:20,398
because like

5590
02:46:18,959 --> 02:46:22,799
you know turning on a course they

5591
02:46:20,398 --> 02:46:25,039
estimate adds about a percent to the

5592
02:46:22,799 --> 02:46:26,239
to the distance so you know when we're

5593
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:27,760
talking about a marathon

5594
02:46:26,239 --> 02:46:29,520
you're getting up to like a quarter mile

5595
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:30,880
extra running you know that alone could

5596
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:32,800
potentially put you down near

5597
02:46:30,879 --> 02:46:34,398
near too flat based on what you know

5598
02:46:32,799 --> 02:46:38,719
we're seeing because

5599
02:46:34,398 --> 02:46:40,719
i mean kitchen keys got a was it 201

5600
02:46:38,719 --> 02:46:42,000
i believe is his actual world record

5601
02:46:40,719 --> 02:46:42,799
where it's actually like you know

5602
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:43,920
certified

5603
02:46:42,799 --> 02:46:46,000
so i mean he's right on the door

5604
02:46:43,920 --> 02:46:49,279
knocking knocking on the door there

5605
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:50,719
um yeah the prototype he had since then

5606
02:46:49,279 --> 02:46:52,800
they put in a regulation where you can't

5607
02:46:50,719 --> 02:46:53,519
stack a shoe for the roads more than 40

5608
02:46:52,799 --> 02:46:54,959
millimeters

5609
02:46:53,520 --> 02:46:56,880
so you can only have so much of that

5610
02:46:54,959 --> 02:46:57,438
energy returning foam and you can only

5611
02:46:56,879 --> 02:47:00,478
have i think

5612
02:46:57,439 --> 02:47:02,559
one carbon plate in there now uh

5613
02:47:00,478 --> 02:47:04,559
so that puts a little bit of a ceiling

5614
02:47:02,559 --> 02:47:06,719
on that technological thing

5615
02:47:04,559 --> 02:47:08,239
uh but but who knows what else will come

5616
02:47:06,719 --> 02:47:10,000
out and that and and

5617
02:47:08,239 --> 02:47:12,318
and to be honest who comes out with it

5618
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:14,159
because the fact that nike came out with

5619
02:47:12,318 --> 02:47:16,318
this technology is the reason why

5620
02:47:14,159 --> 02:47:17,200
it's being allowed to be be used if that

5621
02:47:16,318 --> 02:47:18,879
would have been like

5622
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:20,560
you know another running company that

5623
02:47:18,879 --> 02:47:22,239
that came out with it i'm sure the

5624
02:47:20,559 --> 02:47:23,600
the the regulations would have been

5625
02:47:22,239 --> 02:47:24,799
slapped down on it immediately and they

5626
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:25,680
would have probably just thrown it out

5627
02:47:24,799 --> 02:47:28,079
all together would have been

5628
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:29,040
this politics yeah oh yeah well and i

5629
02:47:28,079 --> 02:47:32,239
mean it's it

5630
02:47:29,040 --> 02:47:34,319
you can go you can go super like

5631
02:47:32,239 --> 02:47:35,840
you know negative with that and say like

5632
02:47:34,318 --> 02:47:37,680
hey like this is

5633
02:47:35,840 --> 02:47:39,359
like this is terrible or this is like

5634
02:47:37,680 --> 02:47:40,000
super nefarious when in reality it's

5635
02:47:39,359 --> 02:47:42,239
like

5636
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:44,079
you know you have a company that has you

5637
02:47:42,239 --> 02:47:45,920
know billions of dollars

5638
02:47:44,079 --> 02:47:47,760
and is interested enough in the sport

5639
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:48,799
that otherwise doesn't generate a ton of

5640
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:52,000
revenue

5641
02:47:48,799 --> 02:47:53,840
to you know pick up a big tab and

5642
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:55,040
support like uh you know track and field

5643
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:58,000
and things like that but

5644
02:47:55,040 --> 02:47:59,760
you know with that you know you you want

5645
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:01,040
to be the guy who says

5646
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:03,520
yeah thanks for the millions and

5647
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:05,520
millions of dollars but we're gonna

5648
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:07,359
st all those years and money you spent

5649
02:48:05,520 --> 02:48:08,800
on that foam yeah you wasted it we're

5650
02:48:07,359 --> 02:48:10,239
not gonna let you use it

5651
02:48:08,799 --> 02:48:12,639
but you know if you're another company

5652
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:14,639
who uh you know revolutionizes the sport

5653
02:48:12,639 --> 02:48:17,278
in potentially a negative way

5654
02:48:14,639 --> 02:48:17,680
uh you know maybe maybe you say no to

5655
02:48:17,279 --> 02:48:19,520
them

5656
02:48:17,680 --> 02:48:21,120
so it gets interesting that's the way

5657
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:21,760
that's how it always happens yeah yeah

5658
02:48:21,120 --> 02:48:22,880
yeah

5659
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:25,040
there's really no way around i think

5660
02:48:22,879 --> 02:48:27,199
phil methatone i think it's him that he

5661
02:48:25,040 --> 02:48:28,640
wrote a book about a two-hour marathon

5662
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:30,399
what are the limits how fast could we

5663
02:48:28,639 --> 02:48:32,239
run and i think he puts it like an hour

5664
02:48:30,398 --> 02:48:33,439
and 42 minutes something like that or 40

5665
02:48:32,239 --> 02:48:35,359
something minutes

5666
02:48:33,439 --> 02:48:37,520
it's kind of an interesting question uh

5667
02:48:35,359 --> 02:48:39,840
of what are the limits

5668
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:41,600
uh do you think do you think we'll just

5669
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:42,799
keep pushing the limits of what humans

5670
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:45,279
are capable of

5671
02:48:42,799 --> 02:48:46,239
in the ultras in the marathon is this

5672
02:48:45,279 --> 02:48:49,279
just like the way

5673
02:48:46,239 --> 02:48:52,159
yeah the uh the way of sport and i think

5674
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:53,040
ultra for sure because that is a fastly

5675
02:48:52,159 --> 02:48:56,398
growing

5676
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:58,240
sport and it's there's

5677
02:48:56,398 --> 02:48:59,760
there's a lot of potential for a much

5678
02:48:58,239 --> 02:49:01,840
bigger pop or a much

5679
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:02,800
pool bigger pool of like talent to pull

5680
02:49:01,840 --> 02:49:04,880
from

5681
02:49:02,799 --> 02:49:06,639
uh that could really push the needle

5682
02:49:04,879 --> 02:49:07,839
down on some of these performances and

5683
02:49:06,639 --> 02:49:09,840
things like that

5684
02:49:07,840 --> 02:49:12,318
uh especially as it becomes more popular

5685
02:49:09,840 --> 02:49:13,760
if people start realizing or

5686
02:49:12,318 --> 02:49:15,680
i shouldn't say realizing but if a

5687
02:49:13,760 --> 02:49:17,200
scenario happens where like oh

5688
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:18,559
i'm one of the best endurance athletes

5689
02:49:17,200 --> 02:49:20,159
in the world i make more money running

5690
02:49:18,559 --> 02:49:21,600
ultra marathons than i do running the

5691
02:49:20,159 --> 02:49:22,959
marathon then you know

5692
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:25,120
all of a sudden we see every record get

5693
02:49:22,959 --> 02:49:28,398
broken in a matter of a couple of years

5694
02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:31,359
uh but the the

5695
02:49:28,398 --> 02:49:32,318
for the marathon i mean it's gonna get

5696
02:49:31,359 --> 02:49:34,559
faster i think

5697
02:49:32,318 --> 02:49:36,639
but like to what degree is so hard to

5698
02:49:34,559 --> 02:49:38,239
know it's very hard to know and that's

5699
02:49:36,639 --> 02:49:39,278
the one hour and 40 minutes seems like

5700
02:49:38,239 --> 02:49:41,760
that's pretty fast

5701
02:49:39,279 --> 02:49:43,279
yes that's very fast for folks for some

5702
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:44,079
perspective there the current world

5703
02:49:43,279 --> 02:49:48,079
record

5704
02:49:44,079 --> 02:49:49,680
is like in the 440s per mile a mile like

5705
02:49:48,079 --> 02:49:51,439
just to add a little flavor to that

5706
02:49:49,680 --> 02:49:53,120
you're basically sprinting yeah i mean

5707
02:49:51,439 --> 02:49:56,559
go out to a track

5708
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:58,640
and run one lap as fast as you can

5709
02:49:56,559 --> 02:50:00,398
and then reflect on what time you get

5710
02:49:58,639 --> 02:50:01,358
and realize like the world record for

5711
02:50:00,398 --> 02:50:04,398
the marathon

5712
02:50:01,359 --> 02:50:07,680
is that is that lap

5713
02:50:04,398 --> 02:50:08,000
at just over 70 seconds per lap so

5714
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:10,159
minute

5715
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:12,079
and ten just over that but you're doing

5716
02:50:10,159 --> 02:50:14,799
it 26.2 miles

5717
02:50:12,079 --> 02:50:16,719
yeah so so over a hundred times it's

5718
02:50:14,799 --> 02:50:18,719
mind boggling but watching elliot

5719
02:50:16,719 --> 02:50:20,079
kipchoge just first of all he was like

5720
02:50:18,719 --> 02:50:22,159
smiling at the end of it

5721
02:50:20,079 --> 02:50:23,760
so the there's an extreme efficiency

5722
02:50:22,159 --> 02:50:27,359
here too so he's not

5723
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:30,398
he's able to just find the right way to

5724
02:50:27,359 --> 02:50:32,318
maximize yeah maximize efficiency

5725
02:50:30,398 --> 02:50:34,559
it makes it look easy i mean that that's

5726
02:50:32,318 --> 02:50:36,000
true for basically every olympic athlete

5727
02:50:34,559 --> 02:50:37,760
when you watch gymnasts they kind of

5728
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:40,799
make it look easy

5729
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:42,318
yes but there's like tens if not

5730
02:50:40,799 --> 02:50:44,398
hundreds of thousands of hours

5731
02:50:42,318 --> 02:50:45,760
behind that training yeah just to be

5732
02:50:44,398 --> 02:50:47,519
comfortable enough to even attempt some

5733
02:50:45,760 --> 02:50:48,159
of the moves they do in gymnastics is

5734
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:51,200
mind-boggling

5735
02:50:48,159 --> 02:50:52,318
that one is super awesome because uh how

5736
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:55,040
tragic it is like

5737
02:50:52,318 --> 02:50:55,920
one little slip up four years of work

5738
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:58,160
and your room

5739
02:50:55,920 --> 02:50:59,680
it's all gone not just four years of

5740
02:50:58,159 --> 02:51:01,600
work for many of them

5741
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:03,680
like a lifetime of work and they're

5742
02:51:01,600 --> 02:51:06,318
teenagers and they're teenagers

5743
02:51:03,680 --> 02:51:07,120
and they get dedicated everything yeah

5744
02:51:06,318 --> 02:51:09,439
to it

5745
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:11,120
that's that's what makes the pursuits of

5746
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:12,479
humans so fascinating

5747
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:14,160
we kind of talked about this a little

5748
02:51:12,478 --> 02:51:15,438
bit already but

5749
02:51:14,159 --> 02:51:17,520
is there something that stands out to

5750
02:51:15,439 --> 02:51:19,120
you as one of the hardest things you've

5751
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:21,359
had to overcome

5752
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:22,880
in all the either training or the

5753
02:51:21,359 --> 02:51:24,159
competing that you've done

5754
02:51:22,879 --> 02:51:26,478
has there been moments that kind of

5755
02:51:24,159 --> 02:51:27,840
stand out where you're proud of yourself

5756
02:51:26,478 --> 02:51:29,760
that

5757
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:32,799
that you were truly tested and you

5758
02:51:29,760 --> 02:51:34,719
overcame it i think i'd be more inclined

5759
02:51:32,799 --> 02:51:37,840
just because it stands out to me

5760
02:51:34,719 --> 02:51:38,799
much bigger than any one like hard

5761
02:51:37,840 --> 02:51:42,079
decision or

5762
02:51:38,799 --> 02:51:44,079
outcome i had from a particular race is

5763
02:51:42,079 --> 02:51:46,000
just like the trajectory of like you

5764
02:51:44,079 --> 02:51:48,159
know doing what i'm doing now

5765
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:49,840
is so much different from what i would

5766
02:51:48,159 --> 02:51:52,478
have ever expected

5767
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:53,680
uh you know i mean i was a talented

5768
02:51:52,478 --> 02:51:55,278
enough runner where i could make the

5769
02:51:53,680 --> 02:51:56,318
state meet by my senior year at a small

5770
02:51:55,279 --> 02:51:58,720
division iii school

5771
02:51:56,318 --> 02:52:00,398
and you know compete at a division three

5772
02:51:58,719 --> 02:52:03,519
college and be pretty

5773
02:52:00,398 --> 02:52:05,680
modest talent comparative to my to my

5774
02:52:03,520 --> 02:52:07,920
peers at the top level of division three

5775
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:09,439
um to think that like i'd be doing

5776
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:10,079
anything that was revolved around

5777
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:13,680
running as

5778
02:52:10,079 --> 02:52:14,799
as an occupation as is uh i still

5779
02:52:13,680 --> 02:52:16,559
second guess that that's actually

5780
02:52:14,799 --> 02:52:18,719
occurring makes me wonder about the

5781
02:52:16,559 --> 02:52:21,039
whole simulation theory thing

5782
02:52:18,719 --> 02:52:23,039
it's like who's got my joystick exactly

5783
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:25,359
with it

5784
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:26,560
they've got cheat codes yeah exactly

5785
02:52:25,359 --> 02:52:27,760
because i mean i went to school to be a

5786
02:52:26,559 --> 02:52:29,439
teacher and i really loved that

5787
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:29,680
profession i taught for about five years

5788
02:52:29,439 --> 02:52:32,000
and

5789
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:33,200
i got to a point where you know some of

5790
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:33,600
it's just perfect timing too like a

5791
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:34,800
sport

5792
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:36,479
gain enough popularity where there's

5793
02:52:34,799 --> 02:52:37,920
enough money in it where like i could

5794
02:52:36,478 --> 02:52:40,000
start a coaching business i could get

5795
02:52:37,920 --> 02:52:41,439
sponsorships and things like that

5796
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,959
and actually look at it and say

5797
02:52:41,439 --> 02:52:44,639
financially i can make a go of this or

5798
02:52:42,959 --> 02:52:47,519
at least risk it but

5799
02:52:44,639 --> 02:52:49,358
there's such a fine line between like

5800
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:51,920
deciding to do that or

5801
02:52:49,359 --> 02:52:53,439
kind of staying comfortable because uh i

5802
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:54,398
mean i was at the perfect teaching spot

5803
02:52:53,439 --> 02:52:56,479
for me i was at this

5804
02:52:54,398 --> 02:52:58,318
uh like project-based learning school

5805
02:52:56,478 --> 02:53:00,398
and just outside of madison wisconsin

5806
02:52:58,318 --> 02:53:01,680
loved it um one of the hardest decisions

5807
02:53:00,398 --> 02:53:03,119
my life to make was to step away from

5808
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:06,239
that to pursue running

5809
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:08,640
more holistically and i mean i almost

5810
02:53:06,239 --> 02:53:10,159
didn't i had a co-teacher who was

5811
02:53:08,639 --> 02:53:11,199
i was thinking myself i knew that was

5812
02:53:10,159 --> 02:53:12,639
like a decision i was gonna have to make

5813
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:14,479
the next few years but it was such an

5814
02:53:12,639 --> 02:53:15,920
easy decision to say well

5815
02:53:14,478 --> 02:53:17,278
wait wait one more year and he was just

5816
02:53:15,920 --> 02:53:18,639
like he was a little more of a free

5817
02:53:17,279 --> 02:53:19,040
spirit than i was certainly at the time

5818
02:53:18,639 --> 02:53:21,278
he's like

5819
02:53:19,040 --> 02:53:22,399
dude what are you waiting for just go

5820
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:24,319
why why are you here

5821
02:53:22,398 --> 02:53:25,519
like like after i told him that he like

5822
02:53:24,318 --> 02:53:27,039
every time we'd

5823
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:27,920
i'd come into i'd come into school the

5824
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:29,680
next day and he'd be like why are you

5825
02:53:27,920 --> 02:53:31,279
still here

5826
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:32,720
but i mean that was there's a

5827
02:53:31,279 --> 02:53:34,000
tongue-in-cheek for sure but uh

5828
02:53:32,719 --> 02:53:36,239
but it's hard to know that you're gonna

5829
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:39,520
be successful right in that kind of leap

5830
02:53:36,239 --> 02:53:41,119
given your like you know

5831
02:53:39,520 --> 02:53:43,439
because it's easier when you're like an

5832
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:45,040
ultra performer early on

5833
02:53:43,439 --> 02:53:47,359
but to have the faith that you can

5834
02:53:45,040 --> 02:53:48,319
accomplish something in some regards

5835
02:53:47,359 --> 02:53:50,880
it's

5836
02:53:48,318 --> 02:53:53,359
a blessing in the sense that like uh you

5837
02:53:50,879 --> 02:53:56,239
know failing would have been

5838
02:53:53,359 --> 02:53:57,600
fairly predictable right whereas if like

5839
02:53:56,239 --> 02:53:59,359
you know i always wonder

5840
02:53:57,600 --> 02:54:00,880
i mean i think of these like especially

5841
02:53:59,359 --> 02:54:03,279
the big sports like baseball

5842
02:54:00,879 --> 02:54:04,079
football and basketball and you get you

5843
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:06,319
know

5844
02:54:04,079 --> 02:54:07,600
guys who guys and girls who are like

5845
02:54:06,318 --> 02:54:09,920
identified

5846
02:54:07,600 --> 02:54:10,880
in like early high school as being the

5847
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:13,040
next

5848
02:54:10,879 --> 02:54:14,559
and it's like what kind of pressure is

5849
02:54:13,040 --> 02:54:16,880
that to think like well

5850
02:54:14,559 --> 02:54:18,879
if i'm not like literally one of the

5851
02:54:16,879 --> 02:54:19,519
best players in the nba in 10 years i

5852
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:21,438
failed

5853
02:54:19,520 --> 02:54:23,200
yeah it's just mind-boggling i think if

5854
02:54:21,439 --> 02:54:25,520
i'm not one of the best at one of the

5855
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:27,680
most competitive sports on the planet

5856
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:29,680
in what is an athletic i think an

5857
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:30,800
athletic state of an nba basketball

5858
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:33,439
player is probably one of the most

5859
02:54:30,799 --> 02:54:36,000
athletic human beings on the planet

5860
02:54:33,439 --> 02:54:36,479
and to know like in a teenage year that

5861
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:39,120
your

5862
02:54:36,478 --> 02:54:40,478
your your your success bar is being the

5863
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:42,240
best one of the best

5864
02:54:40,478 --> 02:54:43,760
in the league or the best ever and that

5865
02:54:42,239 --> 02:54:45,279
conversation is floating around

5866
02:54:43,760 --> 02:54:47,359
everywhere you look and see

5867
02:54:45,279 --> 02:54:48,960
versus being able to kind of quietly

5868
02:54:47,359 --> 02:54:51,040
fail and go back to teaching

5869
02:54:48,959 --> 02:54:52,079
it makes it a little more digestible i

5870
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:53,760
think you have a little bit

5871
02:54:52,079 --> 02:54:56,318
more freedom to be great because

5872
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:58,800
nobody's expecting you to be right

5873
02:54:56,318 --> 02:54:59,680
uh is there from that is there advice

5874
02:54:58,799 --> 02:55:02,239
you can give to

5875
02:54:59,680 --> 02:55:03,680
young people today high schoolers

5876
02:55:02,239 --> 02:55:05,600
college students

5877
02:55:03,680 --> 02:55:08,398
taking on trying to figure out their

5878
02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:11,279
career trying to figure out their life

5879
02:55:08,398 --> 02:55:11,760
advice on how to succeed in either yeah

5880
02:55:11,279 --> 02:55:13,439
i think

5881
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:14,719
you know one thing i was always

5882
02:55:13,439 --> 02:55:15,439
interested when i was teaching was like

5883
02:55:14,719 --> 02:55:17,920
you'd have these

5884
02:55:15,439 --> 02:55:18,559
you'd have students who had like

5885
02:55:17,920 --> 02:55:19,760
interests

5886
02:55:18,559 --> 02:55:21,680
they had what they were good at and

5887
02:55:19,760 --> 02:55:23,120
sometimes those ran in

5888
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:25,439
in unison with one another times they

5889
02:55:23,120 --> 02:55:27,040
didn't and it was always interesting to

5890
02:55:25,439 --> 02:55:30,079
me when you'd have a student who's like

5891
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:31,439
i'm really into like you know guitar

5892
02:55:30,079 --> 02:55:33,600
or i'm really into skateboarding or

5893
02:55:31,439 --> 02:55:35,760
something like that where it's like

5894
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:37,840
pretty small like success rate on that

5895
02:55:35,760 --> 02:55:39,200
avenue versus what you can maybe

5896
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:40,318
accomplish by focusing on

5897
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:42,720
just something like a little more

5898
02:55:40,318 --> 02:55:46,079
standard and i think like

5899
02:55:42,719 --> 02:55:47,679
really like besides the likelihood of it

5900
02:55:46,079 --> 02:55:48,719
becoming

5901
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:50,318
something you can turn into a

5902
02:55:48,719 --> 02:55:51,199
professional or not you should just ask

5903
02:55:50,318 --> 02:55:53,920
yourself like

5904
02:55:51,200 --> 02:55:55,600
is this something that i want to spend

5905
02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:58,159
my free time doing

5906
02:55:55,600 --> 02:55:59,359
uh and because if it is then you want to

5907
02:55:58,159 --> 02:56:01,039
keep that in your life because that's

5908
02:55:59,359 --> 02:56:02,640
something that's rewarding motivating it

5909
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:04,240
might be the catalyst that gets you out

5910
02:56:02,639 --> 02:56:06,079
of bed in the morning and you know go to

5911
02:56:04,239 --> 02:56:07,840
another job in order to go do that thing

5912
02:56:06,079 --> 02:56:10,318
afterwards i think

5913
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:11,439
nowadays we're getting to a point where

5914
02:56:10,318 --> 02:56:15,119
like

5915
02:56:11,439 --> 02:56:16,398
the your reachability from even a really

5916
02:56:15,120 --> 02:56:20,000
small

5917
02:56:16,398 --> 02:56:22,719
like unmonetized thing previously

5918
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:24,079
is now an option where if like you live

5919
02:56:22,719 --> 02:56:25,679
in a city where there's only two other

5920
02:56:24,079 --> 02:56:27,120
people interested in your topic of area

5921
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:27,760
so you're not going to turn into a job

5922
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:29,520
now

5923
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:30,880
with the internet you have the world at

5924
02:56:29,520 --> 02:56:32,239
your disposal so

5925
02:56:30,879 --> 02:56:34,478
that two to three people in every town

5926
02:56:32,239 --> 02:56:35,680
can turn into thousands tens of

5927
02:56:34,478 --> 02:56:36,799
thousands hundreds and millions of

5928
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:38,318
people and if you

5929
02:56:36,799 --> 02:56:40,318
really focus your time and energy into

5930
02:56:38,318 --> 02:56:41,760
that thing then you know who knows where

5931
02:56:40,318 --> 02:56:43,119
you can go and how much more enjoyable

5932
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:45,520
your life can be if you're able to turn

5933
02:56:43,120 --> 02:56:48,160
your career into a passion of yours so

5934
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:48,800
i think like that is something i would

5935
02:56:48,159 --> 02:56:51,279
tell

5936
02:56:48,799 --> 02:56:51,920
tell people um folks on that see the

5937
02:56:51,279 --> 02:56:54,560
thing you're

5938
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:55,920
good at and you kind of sparks that

5939
02:56:54,559 --> 02:56:58,000
flame

5940
02:56:55,920 --> 02:57:00,000
and uh go with that even if society

5941
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:03,120
doesn't really want you to

5942
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:04,719
like it's non-traditional uh

5943
02:57:03,120 --> 02:57:06,800
and the odds are low of like

5944
02:57:04,719 --> 02:57:08,879
traditionally defined success

5945
02:57:06,799 --> 02:57:11,039
just do that thing i've struggled with

5946
02:57:08,879 --> 02:57:12,959
that it's like it was always clear

5947
02:57:11,040 --> 02:57:14,319
especially like in school there's stuff

5948
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:16,079
i'm actually good at

5949
02:57:14,318 --> 02:57:17,920
and stuff that the world wants me to do

5950
02:57:16,079 --> 02:57:19,279
right yeah and i kept the world wanted

5951
02:57:17,920 --> 02:57:21,760
me to be a plumber when i took that test

5952
02:57:19,279 --> 02:57:23,840
my sophomore year

5953
02:57:21,760 --> 02:57:25,840
but even like like academically just

5954
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:29,600
going to university and

5955
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:32,159
academia there are certain ways even in

5956
02:57:29,600 --> 02:57:33,040
i would say even in the thing you want

5957
02:57:32,159 --> 02:57:35,279
to do

5958
02:57:33,040 --> 02:57:37,120
the way you do that thing the world will

5959
02:57:35,279 --> 02:57:39,920
want you to do it a certain way

5960
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:41,279
and even just like finding your way of

5961
02:57:39,920 --> 02:57:44,079
doing that thing

5962
02:57:41,279 --> 02:57:45,520
is really powerful like for me the way i

5963
02:57:44,079 --> 02:57:48,799
do research

5964
02:57:45,520 --> 02:57:52,079
the way i learn is is different than

5965
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:54,000
colleagues of mine and i realized that

5966
02:57:52,079 --> 02:57:55,680
that i really like to follow things i'm

5967
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:57,359
passionate about versus sort of the

5968
02:57:55,680 --> 02:57:58,880
rigor of studying ever

5969
02:57:57,359 --> 02:58:01,359
like the fundamentals all across the

5970
02:57:58,879 --> 02:58:03,839
board and building up and castle

5971
02:58:01,359 --> 02:58:05,760
um on the fundamentals like layer upon

5972
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:06,559
layer just there's a bunch of details in

5973
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:09,040
the way i

5974
02:58:06,559 --> 02:58:10,639
pursue the very thing that i currently

5975
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:12,240
do that's different than others

5976
02:58:10,639 --> 02:58:14,159
and it took me quite a long time to

5977
02:58:12,239 --> 02:58:14,559
accept like you don't need to do it the

5978
02:58:14,159 --> 02:58:16,478
way

5979
02:58:14,559 --> 02:58:18,000
everyone else is doing it doesn't not

5980
02:58:16,478 --> 02:58:19,119
everyone else but majority people are

5981
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,879
telling you to do it

5982
02:58:19,120 --> 02:58:22,160
because one it's beneficial to do it

5983
02:58:20,879 --> 02:58:24,959
different because then you'll

5984
02:58:22,159 --> 02:58:26,559
more likely stand out and two like why

5985
02:58:24,959 --> 02:58:28,879
the hell are you doing it the way it's

5986
02:58:26,559 --> 02:58:31,439
not working for you

5987
02:58:28,879 --> 02:58:32,559
yeah you know i saw that all the time

5988
02:58:31,439 --> 02:58:34,720
when i was teaching i was

5989
02:58:32,559 --> 02:58:35,840
dual certified i was my my

5990
02:58:34,719 --> 02:58:37,438
certifications were in

5991
02:58:35,840 --> 02:58:38,960
history and broad field social studies

5992
02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:42,639
so like econ

5993
02:58:38,959 --> 02:58:44,079
uh psychology history all that stuff

5994
02:58:42,639 --> 02:58:46,079
and then i also had a certification of

5995
02:58:44,079 --> 02:58:47,039
special education which was

5996
02:58:46,079 --> 02:58:49,279
you know people think of special

5997
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:50,960
education a lot of times as like oh it's

5998
02:58:49,279 --> 02:58:52,319
the you know the kid who is not smart

5999
02:58:50,959 --> 02:58:53,839
enough to do the regular thing when

6000
02:58:52,318 --> 02:58:55,680
reality it's like

6001
02:58:53,840 --> 02:58:56,880
i mean there is some you know there's

6002
02:58:55,680 --> 02:58:58,720
obviously like

6003
02:58:56,879 --> 02:59:00,318
you know like certain things like down

6004
02:58:58,719 --> 02:59:02,398
syndrome and stuff like that but like

6005
02:59:00,318 --> 02:59:03,119
there's also like a huge population of

6006
02:59:02,398 --> 02:59:05,199
groups of

6007
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:06,399
both like gifted and talented on one end

6008
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:08,560
of the spectrum where

6009
02:59:06,398 --> 02:59:09,920
they're incredibly smart and they're

6010
02:59:08,559 --> 02:59:12,000
like the geniuses

6011
02:59:09,920 --> 02:59:13,520
but for whatever reason the standard

6012
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:15,279
method of learning does not click with

6013
02:59:13,520 --> 02:59:17,439
them does not work with them and then

6014
02:59:15,279 --> 02:59:19,040
they just need a slightly different path

6015
02:59:17,439 --> 02:59:19,680
or maybe a drastically different path

6016
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:22,240
and they're going to

6017
02:59:19,680 --> 02:59:23,680
just flourish and you have kids that end

6018
02:59:22,239 --> 02:59:26,398
up falling on the other end where

6019
02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:26,960
you know maybe it's really difficult for

6020
02:59:26,398 --> 02:59:29,358
them

6021
02:59:26,959 --> 02:59:31,358
to be able to read at the speed of other

6022
02:59:29,359 --> 02:59:33,760
students but if you give them this

6023
02:59:31,359 --> 02:59:35,680
specific direction they can just thrive

6024
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:38,719
in a certain area and just

6025
02:59:35,680 --> 02:59:39,200
seeing that like the you know like that

6026
02:59:38,719 --> 02:59:40,719
there's

6027
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:43,200
multiple ways to do stuff and there's

6028
02:59:40,719 --> 02:59:45,199
not necessarily one path to the end

6029
02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:46,319
is i think such an eye-opening thing to

6030
02:59:45,200 --> 02:59:47,840
learn especially if you learn maybe

6031
02:59:46,318 --> 02:59:49,760
that's what i should answer the question

6032
02:59:47,840 --> 02:59:51,439
that you asked me with is you know keep

6033
02:59:49,760 --> 02:59:52,639
an open mind as to what paths there are

6034
02:59:51,439 --> 02:59:55,120
forward and

6035
02:59:52,639 --> 02:59:56,719
know that you know maybe just because

6036
02:59:55,120 --> 02:59:58,000
even if you look to your left you look

6037
02:59:56,719 --> 02:59:59,278
to the right and all your classmates are

6038
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,239
successful doing it one way it doesn't

6039
02:59:59,279 --> 03:00:01,279
necessarily mean that's going to be the

6040
03:00:00,239 --> 03:00:03,600
way for you

6041
03:00:01,279 --> 03:00:05,200
yeah so that could land you in eating a

6042
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:07,279
meat based diet running across the

6043
03:00:05,200 --> 03:00:10,000
country

6044
03:00:07,279 --> 03:00:12,079

a bunch lex it's been a

6059
03:00:32,398 --> 03:00:35,599
an honor to come on your podcast i've

6060
03:00:33,920 --> 03:00:37,920
been a fan of it for uh

6061
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:39,840
for quite some time and i thought about

6062
03:00:37,920 --> 03:00:41,200
wearing a white suit but

6063
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:41,960
michael malus already took care of that

6064
03:00:41,200 --> 03:00:43,600
one

6065
03:00:41,959 --> 03:00:45,438
[Laughter]

6066
03:00:43,600 --> 03:00:46,720
well and uh i think it would be really

6067
03:00:45,439 --> 03:00:48,479
good for the ratings of this

6068
03:00:46,719 --> 03:00:49,920
conversation if you end up dying during

6069
03:00:48,478 --> 03:00:51,920
that run so yeah

6070
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:53,840
i'll do my best so the everything that

6071
03:00:51,920 --> 03:00:55,200
could happen will be positive for uh for

6072
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:56,318
the world

6073
03:00:55,200 --> 03:00:58,399
so you're saying i should try to average

6074
03:00:56,318 --> 03:00:59,680
100 miles a day 100

6075
03:00:58,398 --> 03:01:02,079
well i think you're going to push

6076
03:00:59,680 --> 03:01:03,600
yourself to again it's not the main

6077
03:01:02,079 --> 03:01:05,840
priority but

6078
03:01:03,600 --> 03:01:07,040
it's trying to beat that record that's

6079
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:08,719
probably going to take everything you

6080
03:01:07,040 --> 03:01:10,399
have and that that

6081
03:01:08,719 --> 03:01:13,199
