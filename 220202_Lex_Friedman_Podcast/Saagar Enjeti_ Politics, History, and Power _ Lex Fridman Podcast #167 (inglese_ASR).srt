00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,839
sagar anjeri

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,318
he is a dc based political correspondent

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,880
host

5
00:00:06,318 --> 00:00:09,439

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,719

7
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:15,678
realignment podcast with marshall kozlov

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,480
he has interviewed donald trump four

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,399
times

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,760
and has interviewed a lot of major

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:23,038
political figures

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,080
and human beings who wield power

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,920
he loves policy and loves history which

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,959
makes him a great person to sail

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,480
through the sometimes stormy waters of

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,239
political discourse

17
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,119
he showed up to this conversation with a

18
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:40,000
gift of the second volume of ian

a two-volume set that is widely

21
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,000
acknowledged as one of the greatest

22
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,718
if not the greatest most definitive

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,079
studies

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,280
of hitler nothing wins my heart faster

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,120

grade book about the darkest aspects of

27
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,159
human nature

28
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,198
in human history i think i started

29
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,479
saying that as a joke

30
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,558
but actually there's probably a lot of

31
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,319
truth to it i love it when we skip the

32
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,640
small talk and go straight to the

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,879
in-depth conversation about the best and

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,118
worst of human nature

35
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,399

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,400
as a side note let me say that for

44
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,000
better for worse

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,240
i would like to avoid the trap of

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,640
surface political bickering of the day

47
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,959
i do find politics fascinating but not

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,359
the talking points produced by the

49
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,798
industrial engagement complex of red

50
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,118
versus blue division

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,399
instead i'm fascinated by human beings

52
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,359
who seek power

53
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,879
and how power changes them i don't have

54
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,118
a political affiliation

55
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,959
and my ideas at least i hope so are

56
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,280
defined more by curiosity

57
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,559
and learning in the face of uncertainty

58
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,718
and less by the

59
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
echo chambers who tell me what i'm

60
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,879
supposed to think

61
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,039
i'm constantly evolving learning and

62
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:05,118
doing my best to do so without ego

63
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,880
and with empathy please be patient with

64
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:09,280
me as far as i'm aware

65
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,120
i do not have any derangement syndromes

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
nor do i get a medical prescription of

67
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,878
blue

68
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,439
red white or black pills if i say

69
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,159
something

70
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,199
i say it because i'm genuinely thinking

71
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,400
and struggling

72
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,878
with the ideas i have no agenda

73
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,480
just a bit of a hope to add more love to

74
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,239

than a book about hitler so thank you so

85
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:49,120
much

86
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,640
i i've gotten a gift when i was what

87
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
were you talking about yes blind right

88
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,839
the watch from joe rogan

89
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,080
and this almost beats it so uh

90
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,840
so tell me what uh this particular book

91
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,480
on hitler is so this is volume two

92
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,039
yes so this is ian kershaw he wrote the

93
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,759
famous

94
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,079
two volume on hitler i'm a big book nerd

95
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,199
and

96
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,000
i spend a lot of time reading

97
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,318
biographies in particular so this one

98
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,439
um if you need a one volume rise and

99
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,719
fall the third reich

100
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,479
right i think you talked about that

101
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,199
william shire because that's like

102
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,518
hitler's rise nazi germany the war etc

103
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,958
but

104
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,640
i like bios because it's the

105
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,158
good biography is story of the times

106
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,238
right and so this one

107
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,079
the first volume it does exactly that

108
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,080
which is that it doesn't just tell the

109
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,159
story of hitler it's the context of

110
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
poor you know this kid in austria and

111
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,679
he's got all these dreams but then

112
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,679
actually pretty courageous in terms of

113
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,360
world war one right gets pinned to metal

114
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,760
on by the kaiser and then

115
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,519
what it's like to have to lose world war

116
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,639
one and actually like lose

117
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,319
this the stain and then the rise within

118
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,559
everybody knows that story the beer hall

119
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,000
push and all that this one i like

120
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,759
and the reason i like kirchhoff is

121
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
obviously number one it's english which

122
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,359
is

123
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,199
actually hard right like in order to

124
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,959
write that story who can do

125
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,119
both the primary source material and

126
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,319
then translate it for people like us but

127
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,599
he tells

128
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:09,598
the dynamic story of hitler so well

129
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,199
um in the second volume just like the

130
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,560
the level of detail and you've you've

131
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,280
talked about this lex like

132
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,079
what was it like inside that room inside

133
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,639
with chamberlain

134
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,560
like what was it like in terms of who

135
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,199
was this like magnetic

136
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,199
madman who did convince the smartest

137
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,240
people in the world at the time and

138
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
you know up until like 1940 the soviet

139
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,680
gamble

140
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,400
like was a trump he took tremendous

141
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
risks

142
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,560
but like highly calculated thinking no

143
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,759
no i'm not gonna pay for this one i'm

144
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
not gonna pay for this one

145
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,439
and it put himself he had a remarkable

146
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
ability not just to put himself in the

147
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,399
minds of the german people

148
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,478
but in terms of his adversaries like

149
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,079
with when he was across from mussolini

150
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,680
cow kill he's like how exactly did

151
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,399
mussolini the guy who created fascism

152
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,720
becomes like

153
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,599
second fiddle to hitler i think it's an

154
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,040
amazing bio

155
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,800
and yeah like ian kershaw along with

156
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,319
richard evans two of my favorite authors

157
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,759
on the third reich no question

158
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,599
do you think he was born this way that

159
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,879
charisma whatever that is or

160
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,639
was it something he developed

161
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,240
strategically that's like the question

162
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,680
you applied to some of the great

163
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,000
leaders was he just a madman

164
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,199
who had the instinct to be able to

165
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,720
control people when

166
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,240
in the room together with them or is

167
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,600
this like he worked at it i think he

168
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,680
worked at it and but but

169
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,879
also there is an innate quality i'm

170
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,840
forgetting his name

171
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,719
his lifelong rudolph the one who flew to

172
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,959
berlin in like 1940

173
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,160
anyway so he he helped hitler write

174
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,439
minecon and he was like

175
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,560
slavishly devoted to him in prison

176
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,759
this is 1925 or something like that

177
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,918
and so you read that and you're like

178
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,000
well how does he get this like

179
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,120
crank wacko to basically believe he's

180
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
like the second coming

181
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,639
help him write this book i mean

182
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,079
literally they lived together in the

183
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,680
prison cell and they would wake up every

184
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,519
day and as he was composing

185
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,439
mineconf and because of the beer hall

186
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,478
putch and all that had this like

187
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,879
absolute ability to gather people around

188
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:00,959
him

189
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,478
i think his greatest skill was is he was

190
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,959
just a very good politician

191
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,079
truly i mean if you look at his ability

192
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,318
in order to read

193
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,240
coalitional politics and then convince

194
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,400
exactly the right people

195
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,000
in order to follow him i think i heard

196
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:15,038
you ask this once and i've thought about

197
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,959
it a lot which is like

198
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,079
who could have stopped hitler in germany

199
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,599
right like it's always like the

200
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,519
ever-present question of course like the

201
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,439
whole baby kittler thing really the

202
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,079
answer is hindenburg like hindenburg was

203
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,439
the person

204
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,279
who could have stopped and had the

205
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,839
immense standing within the german

206
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,799
public

207
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,119
the only you know real like war hero

208
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,560
definitely was personally skeptical of

209
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,199
fascism and nazism

210
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,879
and then and didn't like him and he knew

211
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,560
he was full of [ __ ] he was like yeah i

212
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,120
think the sky is dangerous i think this

213
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,519
guy

214
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
could do a lot of damage to the republic

215
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,799
but he

216
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,319
acceded basically to hitler at the time

217
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,520
and i think that he was one of the main

218
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,000
people who could have done something

219
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,560
about it

220
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,720
and also he was able to uh convince the

221
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,199
generals the military i mean that was

222
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,360
that was very interesting and to

223
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,360
convince chamberlain and

224
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,560
the other political leaders there's

225
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,560
that's something i

226
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,560
often think about because we're just

227
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
reading books about these people

228
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,839
i think about what like jeffrey epstein

229
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,800
for example oh yeah

230
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,000
like evil people not evil but people

231
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,639
have done evil things

232
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,639
let's not go to the dan carl and they go

233
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,759
people that do evil things i wonder what

234
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,560
they are like in a room because i know

235
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,479
quite a lot of

236
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,478
intelligent people that were

237
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,519
did not see uh did not see the evil in

238
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,319
jeffrey epstein

239
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,879
and spend time with him and not were not

240
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,960
bothered by in the same sense

241
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:45,680
hitler it seems like he was able to get

242
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,359
just even on before he would have power

243
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,319
because people get intoxicated by power

244
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,000
and so on

245
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,520
they want to be close to power but even

246
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,519
before he had power he was able to

247
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,639
convince people

248
00:07:53,519 --> 00:08:00,159
and it's unclear like is there something

249
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,800
that's more than words it's like the way

250
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,479
you i mean that people talk tell stories

251
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,560
about like this piercing

252
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,639
look or whatever all that kind of stuff

253
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,560
i i wonder if that

254
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,478
if that's somehow a part of it like that

255
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
has to be the base floor

256
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,519
of any of these charismatic leaders you

257
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,879
have to be able to

258
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:21,120
in a room alone be able to convince

259
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,680
anybody of anything so i can tell you

260
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,399
from my personal experience one of the

261
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,918
best

262
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:30,719
educated lessons i got was when i got

263
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,680
to meet trump so i interviewed trump

264
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,759
four different times

265
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,799
as a journalist spent like two and a

266
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,918
half hours with him

267
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,199
in the oval office not alone but like me

268
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,958
and one person and like the press

269
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,399
secretary and that was it so i actually

270
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,639
got to observe him

271
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,240
and as a guy who reads these types of

272
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,958
books right and you know you think of

273
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,879
trump

274
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,518
obviously most people what they see on

275
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,120
television you know in articles and more

276
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,278
but being able to observe it like

277
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,240
one-on-one i was closer to him than you

278
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,278
know than i am

279
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,039
right now from you that was

280
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,958
one of the most educational experiences

281
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,159
i got because it's like you just said

282
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:10,639
the look the the leaning forward the way

283
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:12,480
he talks he the way he is a master at

284
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,159
taking the question and answering

285
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,600
exactly which party wants and then if

286
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,159
you try and follow up he's like excuse

287
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,040
me

288
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,319
you know like he knows and then whenever

289
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,639
you're talk it's not that he's

290
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
annoyed about getting interrupted if he

291
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,000
realizes he's been miranda

292
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,639
and then you interrupt him all good but

293
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,080
if he's driving home a point which he

294
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,080
has to make sure appears in your

295
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,720
transcript or whatever

296
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,440
it's it's like it really was fascinating

297
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
for me

298
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,959
to look at and what was also crazy with

299
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,199
trump

300
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,119
is i realized how much he was living in

301
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,720
the moment so like

302
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,159

303
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,278

312
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,919

313
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,439
dad's label maker when i was like seven

314
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,360
and i wrote like the oval office on my

315
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,760
bedroom so i was like you know a huge

316
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,480
nerd like obviously you go maniacal even

317
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,399
from seven

318
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,320
but so like for this i mean it was huge

319
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,078
right i'm like this 25 year old kid and

320
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,240
like i walk in there

321
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,599
and like i see the couch right and i'm

322
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,440
like oh man like that's

323
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,200
kissinger like you know i'm like that's

324
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,079
where like kissinger and nixon got on

325
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,519
their knees

326
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,039
and you see over by the door and you're

327
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,078
like are the scuff marks still there

328
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,519
from when eisenhower

329
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,879
used to play it you know this is all

330
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,320
running through my mind yeah trump none

331
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,639
of it was there yeah none of it right so

332
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,399
like

333
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,480
in the moment even the desk i put my

334
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,120
phone on the desk to record yeah and i'm

335
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,879
like this is the [ __ ] resolution

336
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,919
like i shouldn't put my phone on this

337
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,958
thing yeah and and i'm like hms resolute

338
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:51,039
you know all the international

339
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,639
and even for him he doesn't think about

340
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,240
any of it it was like

341
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,240
amazing to me like he had this portrait

342
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,159
of andrew jackson right next to his

343
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,079
to the uh i think from on the fireplace

344
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,679
like right here on the right and

345
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,439
the most revealing question was when i

346
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,879
was like mr president what are people

347
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,360
gonna remember you for in a hundred

348
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,360
years

349
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,959
and he was like he had he was like i

350
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,278
don't know like veteran's choice

351
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,078
he like has a list in front of him of

352
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,320
like his

353
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,199
accomplishments which is station by the

354
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,278
way yeah well i

355
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,879
i mean that's what i wanted to know and

356
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,320
he's like veteran's choice and i

357
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,078
remember looking at him being like

358
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,079
it's not going to be better you feel

359
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:24,559
like i'd be like i'm like i'm looking at

360
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:26,958
you

361
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,479
donald trump the harbinger of something

362
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,679
new yeah we still don't know what the

363
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,399
hell it is

364
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,838
and so i realized with these guys and

365
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,120
their charisma and more

366
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,800
is that they don't think about

367
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
themselves the way that we think about

368
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,439
them and that was actually important to

369
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,959
understand because

370
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
a lot of people like trump is playing

371
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,039
all this chess i'm like i assure you

372
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,680
he's not

373
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,879
like he's truly living one time i was

374
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,319
interviewing him and he had like a

375
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,600
certificate that he had to sign or

376
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
something on his desk

377
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,200
he's like it was like child almost like

378
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,639
he got distracted by he's like oh what's

379
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,639
this you know he's just like picking up

380
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,879
and i was like wow like this

381
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,759
this is the guy like this is what he is

382
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,399
well i wonder

383
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,240
if there was a different person because

384
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,000
you were recording

385
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,159
then it's like offline and i can tell

386
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,839
you well here's the thing though because

387
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,319
that's another part of it because that

388
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,360
two hours i would say like half that was

389
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,519
not on the record

390
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,399
so like whenever he's off the record he

391
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,959
changes

392
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,639
completely right i i don't want to like

393
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,439
go into too much of it or whatever but

394
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,839
like

395
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,079
he uh i mean he is so mindful

396
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,959
of when that camera is on and when the

397
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:30,638
mic is hot

398
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,000
in terms of the language that he uses

399
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,919
what he's willing to admit

400
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,839
what he's willing to talk about how he's

401
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,879
willing to even appear in front of his

402
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,040
staff

403
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,078
um i think the most revealing thing

404
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,919
trump ever did

405
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,439
was there was this press conference like

406
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:44,879
right after he lost you the

407
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,360
right after the midterm elections in

408
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,240
2018 and one of the journalists was like

409
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,680
mr president

410
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,039
thank you for doing this press

411
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,519
conference and he looks at him and he

412
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,278
goes

413
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,600
it's called earned media it's worth

414
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,519
billions he just he just

415
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
like had so much disdain for him because

416
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,200
he's like i'm not doing this for you

417
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,879
he's like i'm doing this for me so he's

418
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,639
really aware of the narrative

419
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,320
story i mean that the people have talked

420
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,440
about that all comes from the tabloid

421
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,760
media of

422
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,639
the from new york and so on he's a

423
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,120
master of that

424
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,079
but i've also heard stories of just in

425
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,959
private

426
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:19,278
he's a really i don't want to overuse

427
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:22,319
the word charismatic but just like

428
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:25,759
he is a really interesting almost

429
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,079
like um friendly like a good person

430
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,600
like like that's what i heard uh i've

431
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,199
heard actually surprising the same thing

432
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,879
about hillary clinton

433
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,040
uh and like

434
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,919
but like the the way they present

435
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,559
themselves is

436
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,159
perhaps very different than they are as

437
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,958
human beings one-on-one that

438
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,559
that's something uh maybe that's just

439
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,518
like a skill thing

440
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,359
maybe maybe the way they present

441
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,278
themselves in public is actually their

442
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,560
their uh i mean almost their real self

443
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,360
and they're just

444
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,799
really good in private one-on-one to go

445
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,959
into this mode

446
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,639
of just being really intimate in some

447
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,159
kind of human way i think that's part of

448
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,198
it because i i would notice that with

449
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,039
trump you know he's like

450
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,039
it's almost like a tour guide it was

451
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,319
very like it's it's very crazy right

452
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,679
because you're like you're in the oval i

453
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,120
mean it's his office

454
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,719
and he's like he's like do you guys want

455
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,480
anything he's like he want a diet coke

456
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,959
because he drinks like all this diet

457
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,879
coke

458
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,078
that's like you know what he's great

459
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:23,519
apologize yeah he's just like

460
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,120
he's like you guys want a diet coke

461
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,919
right and you're sitting there and

462
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,959
you're like

463
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,360
the way he he's able to like like

464
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,799
the last time i interviewed him he he

465
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,120
wanted to do it outside

466
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,198
um because he like he's studied himself

467
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,679
from all angles and he knows exactly how

468
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:39,679
he looks

469
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,278
on a camera and with the witch lighting

470
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,039
and so we were supposed to interview him

471
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,879
on camera in the oval office which is

472
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,519
actually rare like you don't usually get

473
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,120
that

474
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,120
and they ended up moving it outside at

475
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,399
the last minute and he came out and he's

476
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,278
like i picked this spot for you he's

477
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,078
like great lighting

478
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,120
yeah i was like you are your own like

479
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,000
lightning director

480
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,799
yeah the president is great it's so

481
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,600
funny

482
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,559
but it's like you said he's he's very

483
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,600
charismatic

484
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,159
and if friendly i mean you wouldn't i

485
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,320
mean look

486
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,439
this is what i mean in terms of dynamism

487
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,920
of these people

488
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,040
that gets lost and i think even he knows

489
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,000
that like i don't think he would want

490
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,000
that side of him

491
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,839
that i see you know they've seen those

492
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,839
off the record moments and more

493
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,959
in order to come out because he's very

494
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,279
keen about

495
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,719
how exactly he presents to the public

496
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:25,278
it's like you know even his presidential

497
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
portrait

498
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,639
everybody usually smiles and he refused

499
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,839
to smile he was like i want to look like

500
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,360
winston churchill

501
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,440
you know like even he knew that do you

502
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,120
think he believes that he

503
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,680
um what what he kind of implies

504
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,959
that he is one of if not the greatest

505
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,719
presidents in

506
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,638
american history like people kind of

507
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,759
laugh at this but there's quite

508
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,278
i mean there's quite a lot of people

509
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,480
first of all that make the argument that

510
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,879
he's the greatest

511
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,440
president in history like i've heard

512
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,198
this argument being made

513
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,199
and i mean i don't know what the first

514
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:00,559
of all i don't care

515
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:02,559
like you can't make an

516
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,399
argument that anyone is the greatest

517
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,159
that's just that just uh i

518
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,240
i come from a school of like being

519
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,319
humble and modest and so on

520
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,759
it's like even michael you can't have a

521
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,959
conversation

522
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,199
okay uh so i like that he's humble

523
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,078
enough to say like uh abraham lincoln

524
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,078
and whatever like

525
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:23,198
i don't know he says maybe lincoln maybe

526
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,719
remember that

527
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,359
do you think he actually believes that

528
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,800
or is that something he understands

529
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,519
will uh create news and also

530
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,519
perhaps more importantly piss off a

531
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,360
large number of people

532
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,720
is is he almost like a musician

533
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,360
masterfully playing

534
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:46,639
the emotions of the public or does he

535
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,639
or or and does he believe when he looks

536
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,198
in the mirror i'm one of the greatest

537
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,720
men in history combination of all three

538
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,240
um i do think he believes it

539
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,000
and for the reason why is i don't think

540
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,519
he knows that much about us history i

541
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,879
i really mean that like and that's what

542
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,078
i meant whenever i was in there and i

543
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,759
realized he was just

544
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,120
living in the moment i don't think he

545
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,720
knew all that much

546
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,640
about why i mean this is why i was

547
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,360
elected in many ways right so i'm not

548
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,280
i'm not saying

549
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,438
this is an orbit like i'm not making a

550
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,599
judgment on this i'm just saying

551
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,199
i do think in his mind he does think he

552
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,958
was one of the best

553
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,558
presidents in american history largely

554
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,078
because and i encountered this a lot of

555
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,599
people work for him which is that they

556
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,558
didn't really know all that much

557
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,438
kind of about what came before and all

558
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:26,959
that and

559
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,640
it's not necessarily to hold it against

560
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,320
them because for in many ways it's what

561
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,799
they were elected to do

562
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,399
or elected to be in many ways it's an

563
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,160
interesting question whether

564
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,480
knowing history being a student of

565
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,480
history is a

566
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,839
is productive or counterproductive i

567
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,480
tend to assume

568
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,038
i really respect people who are deeply

569
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,120
like

570
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,200
well read in history like presidents

571
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:52,719
that are almost

572
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,519
like nerd history nerds i admire that

573
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,759
uh but maybe that gets in the way well

574
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,839
it's

575
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,960
well governance i don't know it's not

576
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:00,558
it's not you know

577
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,880
i'm just sort of playing devil's

578
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,960
advocate to my own beliefs

579
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,240
but it's possible that focusing on the

580
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,160
moment and the issues

581
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,079
and letting history it's like first

582
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,279
principles thinking forget

583
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:15,519
the lessons of the past and just focus

584
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,720
on common sense reasoning through the

585
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,639
problems of today

586
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,720
yeah it's really hard question in terms

587
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,600
of the modern era i mean obama was a

588
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,000
student of history

589
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,918
like he used to have presidential

590
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,839
biographers and people over

591
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,960
and i mean famously like robert de caro

592
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,879
one of my favorite presidential

593
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,240
biographers he was invited to you know

594
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,240
have dinner with obama

595
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,759
and obama would like pepper some of his

596
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,440
every it was interesting because he'd

597
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,359
try and justify some of the things he

598
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,960
didn't do by being like well if you look

599
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,199
at what they had to do and what

600
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,880
i have to deal with mine's much harder

601
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,519
so in that way i was a little pissed off

602
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,760
because

603
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,599
i'd be like no that actually like you're

604
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,319
comparing apples to oranges

605
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,959
and all that but if you look at

606
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,519
roosevelt

607
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,000
teddy roosevelt in particular this was i

608
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,480
mean

609
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,679
a voracious reader not of just american

610
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,599
history all history he

611
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,280
wrote he's just such a badass jesus

612
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:05,359
incredible

613
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,960
the only the only president who willed

614
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,319
himself to greatness

615
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
that's like the amazing thing about him

616
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,079
he wasn't tested by a crisis

617
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,519
right like it wasn't not he didn't have

618
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:14,558
civil war he didn't have world war ii he

619
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,679
didn't have to found the country

620
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,519
literally or like

621
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,880
you know didn't have to stave off that

622
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,558
or he didn't buy

623
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,720
you know louisiana purchase like all

624
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:25,200
that he literally came into a

625
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,919
pretty you know static country and he

626
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,720
could have just

627
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,280
governed you know with i mean he was the

628
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,038
person

629
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,399
who came before him was assassinated

630
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,798
like he easily

631
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,640
could have coasted but he literally

632
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,879
willed the country into

633
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,640
something more and that is that's always

634
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,280
why i focused a lot on him too because

635
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,038
i'm like

636
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,879
that in many ways i wouldn't say it's

637
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,798
easy to be great during crisis i mean

638
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,720
like look at trump right but like but

639
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,038
there it can bring out the best within

640
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,519
you

641
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,038
yes but it's a whole other level to

642
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,798
bring out the best within yourself

643
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,000
just for the sake of doing it yeah

644
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,440
that's what i think is really

645
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,599
interesting the speeches were

646
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,798
amazing i'm also a sucker for great

647
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,678
speeches because

648
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,319
i i tend to uh see the role the

649
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,480
president

650
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:10,639
is in part like inspire in chief

651
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,000
sort of uh to be able to i mean that's

652
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,159
what great leaders do

653
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,038
like ceos of companies and so on

654
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,080
establish a vision a clear vision

655
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:23,359
and like like hit that hard but the way

656
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:26,960
you establish division isn't just like

657
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:29,918
not to dig at joe biden but like like

658
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,200
sleepy boring statements you have to

659
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,520
sell those statements

660
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,960
and you have to you know you have to do

661
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,879
it in a way where everybody's paying

662
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,440
attention everybody's excited yes

663
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,400
and uh that uh teddy roosevelt was

664
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,159
definitely one of them

665
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,600
obama was i think at least early on i

666
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,120
i don't know uh was incredible at that

667
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,639
it does feel that the modern political

668
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,399
landscape makes it more

669
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,080
difficult to be inspirational in the

670
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,159
sense because everything becomes

671
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,519
bickering in division i do want to ask

672
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,120
you please

673
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:04,319
about trump us you're now

674
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,439
a successful podcaster i've talked to

675
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,639
joe

676
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,200
about trump uh joe rogan and

677
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,200
joe's not interested in talking to trump

678
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
it's just fascinating i try to dig into

679
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,798
like

680
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,519
why yeah uh what

681
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,759
would you interview uh trump on like

682
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:24,639
realignment for example

683
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,119
and uh do you think it's possible to do

684
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,679
a two

685
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:30,079
three hour conversation with him where

686
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,280
you will get at something

687
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,879
like human or you get something like we

688
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,480
were talking about the facade

689
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,919
he puts forward do you think you could

690
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,720
get past that

691
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,400
no i don't i i look i was a white house

692
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,360
correspondent i observed

693
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,240
i observed this man very closely i

694
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,558
interviewed him

695
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,159
i think if that mic is hot he knows what

696
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,319
he's doing he just he's

697
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,840
he's done this too long lex he just

698
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,158
knows but do you think he's a different

699
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:59,519
human now after the election

700
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,280
do you think that not at all i don't

701
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,639
i think he's been the same person since

702
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,839
1976.

703
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,720
i i really do like basically 1976

704
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,879
i studied trump a lot and i think he's

705
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,759
basically been the core of who he is

706
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,080
and elements of that ever since he built

707
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,400
that

708
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,558
cent you know the ice rink in central

709
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,400
park and got that media attention

710
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,720
that was it yeah he's a fascinating

711
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,919
study i still i feel

712
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,200
uh there's a hope in me that there would

713
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,200
be a podcast like

714
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,440
uh like a joe rogan like a long form

715
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,880
pockets where something could be

716
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,640
you know and you're actually a really

717
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,679
good person to do that

718
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,120
where you can have a real conversation

719
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,798
that looks back at the election and

720
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,319
reveals something on us but

721
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,038
perhaps he's thinking about running

722
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,158
again and so maybe he'll never let down

723
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,158
that guard yes

724
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,600
but like you know i i just love it when

725
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,720
um

726
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:55,678
there's this switch in people where

727
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,079
you start start looking back at your

728
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,960
life

729
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,359
and wanting to tell stories like you

730
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,519
know

731
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,199
trying to extract wisdom and like

732
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,480
realizing you're in this new phase of

733
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,159
life where

734
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,640
like the battles have all been fought

735
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,880
now you're this old

736
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,400
like former warrior and now you can tell

737
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,559
the stories of that time

738
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,720
and it seems like trump is still at it

739
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,480
like the young warrior he is he's not

740
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,240
in the mode of telling stories you know

741
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,640
what i got from rogan he's the only

742
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,720
president who didn't age while in office

743
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,840
it's true right like because and this is

744
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,360
what i mean because he lives in the

745
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,959
moment like the job

746
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:33,199
actually aged obama i mean i mean bush

747
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,000
same thing even clinton clinton was like

748
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,279
fat yeah

749
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,200
he looked miserable by like 2000 hw

750
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,119
like i mean reagan famous actually yeah

751
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,159
pretty much everybody i think about

752
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,519
um yeah including john f kennedy who got

753
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,919
much sicker while in office

754
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,200
the job like weighs on you and makes you

755
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,600
physically ill

756
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,679
trump was he's the only person who just

757
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,079
knows he doesn't have to do it he almost

758
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,960
gotten stronger and he was one of the

759
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,359
most divisive

760
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,319
like the climate there's so many people

761
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,038
attacking him

762
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,319
so much hatred so much love and hatred

763
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,038
and it was just he's it was

764
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,359
i mean it was uh whatever it was it was

765
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:09,919
uh

766
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:10,719
quite masterful and and a fascinating

767
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,480
study i

768
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,440
if we um if we stick on uh hitler for

769
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,798
just a minute

770
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,240
uh what lessons

771
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,440
do you take from that time do you think

772
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,960
it's a unique moment in human history

773
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,200
that world war ii i mean both stalin and

774
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,798
hitler

775
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,798
you know is it something that's just

776
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,319
an outlier in all of humans history in

777
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:40,639
terms of the atrocities

778
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:43,839
or is there uh the lessons to be learned

779
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,360
you mentioned we mentioned offline that

780
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,879
you're not just a student of the

781
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,319
entirety of the history but you also are

782
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,039
fascinated by just different like

783
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,879
policies and stuff like what's the

784
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:53,679
immigration policy what's the policy on

785
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,520
science and

786
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,519
look third reich in power let me plug it

787
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,278
by richard uh richard evans i think

788
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,278
is what it was because that actually

789
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,440
will tell you like what was it like to

790
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,200
live under the nazi regime without the

791
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,120
war yeah um

792
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,720
yeah it's a hard question in terms of

793
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,158
the lessons that we can learn

794
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,159
because there's a lot and it's actually

795
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,320
been over it's been

796
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,480
over indexed almost everything comes

797
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:19,599
back to hitler in a conversation so

798
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,079
i kind of think of it within mao stalin

799
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,678
and

800
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:26,960
hitler as i don't want to say

801
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:30,640
payments for but like the

802
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,278
end point payment for the sins

803
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,919
and the problems of the monarchical

804
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,079
system

805
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,440
that evolved within europe basically

806
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:41,119
like 1400

807
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,360
and more i basically think that 1400

808
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,158
the wars between the state you know wars

809
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,839
between france

810
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,840
england the balance of power eventually

811
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,678
world war one and then

812
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:52,000
serfdom within russia the russian

813
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,400
revolution that birthed stalin

814
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,400
same thing the kaiser and imperial

815
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
germany and this like incredibly

816
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,600
crazy system of balance of power in

817
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,759
world war one

818
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,079
and then same thing within china in

819
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:06,480
terms of the warring states and then

820
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,918
the disintegration the european you know

821
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,319
how this is how they think of it you

822
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,240
know

823
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,839
which is like the center of humiliation

824
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,519
and they had to have

825
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,720
something like this i think of it i try

826
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,440
to think of it within the context of

827
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
that

828
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,960
i don't want to think of i don't want to

829
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,519
sound like an inevitabilist

830
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,720
but i think of it as i like to think

831
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:24,000
about systems

832
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,480
especially here in dc that's why i got

833
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,278
into politics which is that

834
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,519
you have to understand systems of power

835
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,759
and the incentives within systems

836
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,359
and the disincentives and the downside

837
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,919
risk of what you're pur

838
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,639
of what you're creating because it that

839
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,919
is what

840
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,000
leads and creates the behavior

841
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,679
within that system i was just talking to

842
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,919
my girlfriend about this yesterday

843
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,120
it's kind of funny like i read these i'm

844
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,520
obsessed with these books

845
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,119
um by robert carro the biographies of

846
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:55,440
lyndon johnson he's written like 5

847
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,558
000 pages so far and it's still not done

848
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,200
okay so like these are

849
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,319
these are like books i base my life on

850
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,960
and

851
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,359
look these are washington and the story

852
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,679
of the post new deal era and forward

853
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,798
not much has changed like the senate is

854
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,240
the still the senate

855
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,119
so many of the same problems with the

856
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,440
senate are still there um in some cases

857
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,558
no not not anymore but for a while some

858
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,240
of the people who were there with

859
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,599
johnson are actually still

860
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,519
um one of them is the president of the

861
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:24,798
united states just a joke

862
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,558
and you think about also same with the

863
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:27,839
media relationship right like there's

864
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,678
this media really

865
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,918
they may have come and gone like the the

866
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,559
people who were in the media and who

867
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,799
were

868
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,038
cozy with the administration officials i

869
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:39,278
mean they just recreated themselves

870
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,879
it's like this it's like an ecosystem

871
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:44,159
which doesn't change

872
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,278
and the that's why i'm like oh it's not

873
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,399
that was a specific time that's just dc

874
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:52,798
like that is dc because

875
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,158
of the way the system is architected

876
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,440
it's pretty much been that way since

877
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,679
like 1908

878
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,038
whenever like you know teddy roosevelt

879
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,399
was dining with these journalists and he

880
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:01,200
would yell at them and then he would go

881
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,000
over to

882
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,519
the society house and like in many ways

883
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
that's now instead of going to henry

884
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,879
adams's house

885
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,839
like the people are congregating in

886
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,278
calorama

887
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,599
um which is the richest neighborhood

888
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,480
here at somebody else's house like it's

889
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,759
the same

890
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,519
thing so you have to think about the

891
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:18,558
system and then the incentives within

892
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,918
that system

893
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:21,278
about what the outcomes that they're

894
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,679
producing if you actually want to think

895
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:23,599
about

896
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,960
how can i change this from the outside

897
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,519
that's also why it's very difficult to

898
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,000
change

899
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,038
because the system is designed in order

900
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,038
to produce

901
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,119
actually pretty specific outcomes that

902
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,558
can only be changed in extraordinary

903
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,278
times

904
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,240
yeah and sometimes hard to to predict

905
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:40,720
what kind of

906
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,558
outcomes will result from the incentive

907
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,240
uh the system that you create right

908
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,398
right in the case because especially

909
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,919
when it's novel kind of situations what

910
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,599
trump actually created a pretty novel

911
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,360
situation and

912
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,798
a lot of the uh things that we've seen

913
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,639
in the 20th century

914
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,000
were very novel systems where people

915
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,080
were very optimistic about

916
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,278
the the the outcomes right and then it

917
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,079
turned out to

918
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:04,720
not have the results that they predicted

919
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,398
i

920
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,399
in terms of like things being unchanged

921
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:12,719
for the past hundred years and so on

922
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:15,199
can you um like wikipedia style or maybe

923
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,839
like in in a musical form like i'm only

924
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,519
a bill

925
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,558
describe to me uh i i still sing that to

926
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,599
my head sometimes

927
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,599
i'm just a bill

928
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,640
uh i don't know what the rest of the

929
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,799
song is but let's let's uh let's

930
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,038
leave that to people's imagination uh

931
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,798
how how does this whole thing work how

932
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,519
does the us political system work

933
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,398
the three branches is how do you think

934
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,359
about

935
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,398
the system we have now if you were to

936
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,839
try to describe

937
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:47,599
if aliens showed up and asked you

938
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:48,879
like they didn't have time so this is an

939
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,398
elevator

940
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,679
thing should we destroy you yeah and be

941
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:57,599
as you plead to avoid destruction

942
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,440
how how would you uh describe how this

943
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,918
thing works i would say

944
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,480
we come together and we pick the people

945
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,679
who make

946
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,480
our laws then we pick the guy

947
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,278
who executes those laws and they

948
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,759
together

949
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:12,558
pick the people who determine whether

950
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,879
they

951
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,240
or the president is breaking the law at

952
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,000
the most basic level

953
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,679
that's how i would describe it so the

954
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,440
so that's the people who make the laws

955
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,559
are congress the executive

956
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,798
is is charged with executing

957
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,240
the laws as passed by congress the

958
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,558
system the branches of government

959
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,319
and the supreme court is picked by the

960
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,359
president confirmed by the senate

961
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:39,359
which then decides whether you or

962
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:40,798
other people are breaking the law in

963
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,759
terms of interpretation

964
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,240
of that law that's basically it oh and

965
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,079
they

966
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,359
they decide whether those laws are

967
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:54,720
in they fall within the

968
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:57,839
they fall within the restrictions

969
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,720
and the want of the founders as

970
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,639
expressed

971
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,079
by the constitution of the united states

972
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,278
which is a set of principles that we

973
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,960
came together

974
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,599
in 1787. i want to make sure i get this

975
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,960
right

976
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,519
um 1787 and decided that we were going

977
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,360
to live

978
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,278
the rest of our lives barring a

979
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,719
revolution and more and we've made it

980
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,359
200 and something years

981
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,038
in order on under that system so there's

982
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,278
a balance of power there's because we

983
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:23,278
have

984
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:24,798
multiple branches there's attention and

985
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,359
a balance to it

986
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,319
as designed by those original documents

987
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,398
uh

988
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,558
what which is the most dysfunctional the

989
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,239
branches which is your favorite

990
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,599
like uh in terms of talking about

991
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,519
systems and like

992
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,038
what's the greatest of concern and what

993
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,519
is the greatest

994
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,679
source of benefit in your view the

995
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,399
presidency obvious well the presidency

996
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,960
is my favorite to study obviously

997
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,278
because

998
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,440
it is the one where there's the most

999
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,359
subjective variable change

1000
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,600
in terms of the personality involved

1001
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:56,639
because of so much power imbued within

1002
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,959
the executive

1003
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,480
the senate is actually pretty much the

1004
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,798
same

1005
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,399
one of the things i love about reading

1006
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,480
about the senate and histories of the

1007
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:07,038
senate is you're like oh yeah there were

1008
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,960
always

1009
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,398
like [ __ ] in the senate who were

1010
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,120
doing their thing and

1011
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,319
and you know filibustering constantly

1012
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,158
based upon

1013
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,398
this or that and then the pers the

1014
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,760
personalities involved with the senate

1015
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:24,239
haven't mattered as much since

1016
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:26,558
like pre-civil war right like pre-civil

1017
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,319
war you had like henry clay and then

1018
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:31,599
daniel webster and john c calhoun who

1019
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,359
even in their own way they represented

1020
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:35,199
like larger constituencies and they

1021
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,199
crafted these like compromises

1022
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,720
up until the outbreak of the civil war

1023
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,558
et cetera but like post since

1024
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,640
then you don't think about like the

1025
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,240
titans within the senate

1026
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,679
most of that is because a lot of the

1027
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,720
stuff that they had power over has

1028
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,120
transferred over

1029
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,319
to the executive so i'm most interested

1030
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:52,558
in really in like

1031
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,240
power like where it lies it's actually

1032
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:54,798
pretty you know throughout american

1033
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,200
history

1034
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,558
much more used to lie with congress now

1035
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,558
it's obviously just so

1036
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,240
imbued within the executive that

1037
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:04,000
understanding executive power

1038
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,679
is i think the thing i'm probably most

1039
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,240
interested in here do you think at this

1040
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,159
point

1041
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,640
the amount of power the president has is

1042
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,360
corrupting to the

1043
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,840
to their ability to lead well is this is

1044
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,599
you know

1045
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,119
uh power corrupts absolute power

1046
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,158
corrupts absolutely

1047
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,359
are we uh is there too much power in the

1048
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,120
in the presidency

1049
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,278
there definitely is and part of the

1050
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:28,319
problem i one of the things i try

1051
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:30,880
to make come across to people is

1052
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,079
if you're the president unless you have

1053
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,720
a

1054
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,558
hyper intentional view of how something

1055
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,640
must be different in government

1056
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:40,480
your view doesn't matter so for example

1057
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,399
like if you were

1058
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,679
trump let's take trump even and even him

1059
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,038
with a pretty intentional view he was

1060
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,919
like i'm gonna end the war in

1061
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,398
afghanistan

1062
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,919
and iraq right and he came in and he

1063
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,239
gets these generals in he's like i want

1064
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,679
to end the war in afghanistan and iraq

1065
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,359
oh and i want to withdraw these troops

1066
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,880
from syria and they're like

1067
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,240
okay we'll give you give us like six

1068
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,440
months he's like okay and this is the

1069
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,480
thing about trump he doesn't realize

1070
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,399
that it's [ __ ]

1071
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,159
so they're like he's like six months

1072
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:04,798
seems fine right so then six months

1073
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,720
comes

1074
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:07,918
and he's like he's like so and then

1075
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,199
he'll announce it he'll be like and

1076
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,358
we're getting out of syria

1077
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,319
it's great and then the generals freak

1078
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:13,598
out they're like whoa

1079
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,879
whoa we don't have a plan for that he's

1080
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,760
like but you guys told me six months

1081
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:17,039
he's like i don't know now we need

1082
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,159
another six months in order to figure

1083
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,000
this thing out yeah

1084
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,119
and by that time now you're midterms so

1085
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
now what now you gotta run for

1086
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,559
re-election

1087
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,838
so more what i mean by that is if you

1088
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,358
don't have a hyper-intentional view

1089
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:28,559
about how to change foreign policy

1090
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:29,598
if you don't have a hyper-intentional

1091
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,119
view about how the department of

1092
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,599
commerce should do its job

1093
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,159
they are just gonna go on autopilot so

1094
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,919
there's

1095
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,519
this is part of the problem when you ask

1096
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,239
me about the presidency it's

1097
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,358
not the presidency itself like the

1098
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,598
president himself

1099
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:44,639
which has become too powerful it's that

1100
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,079
we have less

1101
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,399
democratic checks on the

1102
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,440
people and the systems that are on

1103
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:55,799
autopilot

1104
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,320
and i would say that basically since

1105
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,680
2008 we have voted

1106
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,838
every single time to disrupt that system

1107
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,879
except in the case of 2020 with joe

1108
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:05,679
biden and there are a lot of different

1109
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,838
reasons around

1110
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,118
why that happened and in every single

1111
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:11,838
one of those cases

1112
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,559
obama and trump they all failed in order

1113
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,039
to

1114
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:16,799
in order to radically disrupt that and

1115
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,199
that just shows you how titanic

1116
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,320
the task is and i'm using my language

1117
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,679
precisely because i don't want to be

1118
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,039
like deep state and all but like

1119
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,199
obviously there's a deep state deep

1120
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,199
state i guess has conspiratorial

1121
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,319
attention to it but so you're what

1122
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,078
you're saying is

1123
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,359
the true power currently lies with the

1124
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,000
autopilot

1125
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:35,519
aka deep state well but see it's not

1126
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,480
this is the thing too i want to make

1127
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,519
and clear because i think people think

1128
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,320
conspiratorially that they're all coming

1129
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,119
together to

1130
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,000
intentionally do something no no no no

1131
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,358
they are doing

1132
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,679
what they know believe they are right

1133
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,559
and don't have real democratic checks

1134
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,719
within that

1135
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,000
and so now they have entire generations

1136
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,959
of cultures within each of these

1137
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,358
bureaucracies

1138
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,079
where they say this is the way that we

1139
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:00,799
do things

1140
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,680
around here yeah and that's the problem

1141
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,720
which is that

1142
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:07,358
we have a culture of within

1143
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:09,039
many of these agencies and more i think

1144
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:12,159
the best example for this

1145
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:14,000
would be during the ukraine you know

1146
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:15,199
gate with trump and all that with the

1147
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,400
impeachment now

1148
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:18,239
i'm not talking about the politics here

1149
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,240
but the most revealing thing

1150
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,759
that happened was when the whistleblower

1151
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:24,159
guy alexander vinman

1152
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,320
was like here you have the president

1153
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:26,960
departing from the policy of the united

1154
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,920
states

1155
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,400
and i was like well um let me educate

1156
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,039
you

1157
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,480
lieutenant colonel um the president of

1158
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:36,400
the united states

1159
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,159
makes american foreign policy yeah but

1160
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,358
it was a very revealing comment

1161
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,879
because he and me all the people within

1162
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:45,039
national security bureaucracy

1163
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,880
do think that they're like this is the

1164
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,000
policy of the united states it's we we

1165
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,519
have to do this

1166
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,440
that's where things get screwy well

1167
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:51,920
listen for me personally yeah but also

1168
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,679
from an

1169
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,280
engineering perspective i just talked to

1170
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,358
jim keller it's just

1171
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,280
this is the kind of [ __ ] that we all

1172
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,519
hate in uh when you're trying

1173
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,440
to innovate and design new like products

1174
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,199
right so like that's the that's what

1175
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,838
first principles thinking

1176
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:08,960
requires is like we don't give a [ __ ]

1177
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:10,719
what was done before

1178
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,400
the point is what is the best way to do

1179
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:15,358
it and it seems like

1180
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,838
uh the current government government in

1181
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,559
general

1182
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,358
probably bureaucracies in general are

1183
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:21,519
just

1184
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,440
really good at being lazy about never

1185
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:26,320
having those conversations

1186
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,838
and just it becomes this momentum thing

1187
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,880
that nobody has the difficult

1188
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,199
conversations

1189
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,320
it's become a game within a certain set

1190
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,078
of constraints

1191
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,000
and they never kind of do revolutionary

1192
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,640
tasks but you did say that the

1193
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,760
presidency has power but you're saying

1194
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:43,199
that

1195
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,720
more power than the others and

1196
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,559
but that power has to be coupled with

1197
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,199
like focused intentionality like you

1198
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:49,599
have to keep

1199
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,960
hammering the thing if you want it done

1200
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,200
it has to be done

1201
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,720
i mean and you gotta you gotta this is

1202
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,719
the other part too which

1203
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,879
is that it's not just that you have to

1204
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:02,559
get it done you have to pick

1205
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,838
the 100 people who you can trust to pick

1206
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,639
10 people each to actually do what you

1207
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:08,960
want

1208
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:11,199
one of the most revealing quotes is from

1209
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,519
a guy named tommy corcoran he was the

1210
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,799
top aide to fdr this i'm getting from

1211
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,358
the cara books too

1212
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,400
and he said what is a government it's

1213
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:21,679
not just

1214
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,720
one guy or even 10 guys hell it's

1215
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:27,440
a thousand guys and what fdr

1216
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,078
did is he masterfully picked the right

1217
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,079
people

1218
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,640
to execute his will through the federal

1219
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,720
agencies johnson was the same way

1220
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:35,679
he played these people like a fiddle he

1221
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,879
knew exactly

1222
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:40,879
who to pick he knew the system and more

1223
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,240
part of the reason that outsiders who

1224
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,119
don't have a lot of experience in

1225
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,959
washington

1226
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,320
almost always fail is they don't know

1227
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,240
who to pick or

1228
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,760
they pick people who say one thing to

1229
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,439
their face and then

1230
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,440
when it comes time to carry out the

1231
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,079
president's policy in terms of the

1232
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,440
government

1233
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,359
they just don't do it and the

1234
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,679
president's too think about this i think

1235
00:38:57,358 --> 00:38:59,358
some

1236
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,598
rahm emanuel said this he was like by

1237
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,440
the time it gets to the president's desk

1238
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,160
nobody else can solve it it's not easy

1239
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,599
it's not like a yes or no question it's

1240
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,078
every single thing that hits the

1241
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,720
president's desk is incredibly hard

1242
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,079
to do and obama actually even said and

1243
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,559
this was a very revealing quote about

1244
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,560
how

1245
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,759
how he thinks about the presidency which

1246
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,159
is he's like look

1247
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,359
the presidency is like one of those

1248
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,078
super tankers

1249
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:25,920
you know he's like i can come in and i

1250
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,320
can make it two degrees left

1251
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,519
and two degrees right in a hundred years

1252
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,760
two degrees left

1253
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,199
that's a whole different trajectory yeah

1254
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,160
same thing on the right and he's like

1255
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,279
that

1256
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,039
ultimately is really all you can do i

1257
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,320
quibble and disagree with that in terms

1258
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:41,440
of how he could have changed things in

1259
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,880
2008

1260
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,400
but there's a lot of truth to that

1261
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,680
statement okay that's really fascinating

1262
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,800
you're making me realize that

1263
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,598
um actually both obama and trump are

1264
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,160
probably

1265
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,519
playing victim here to the system you're

1266
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,719
making me think that

1267
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:59,119
maybe you can correct me that

1268
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:59,759
because i'm thinking like elon musk

1269
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,160
whose

1270
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,280
major success despite everything is is

1271
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,199
hiring the right people

1272
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,800
exactly and like creating those

1273
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,439
thousands that

1274
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,119
structure of a thousand people so maybe

1275
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,639
a president has power in that

1276
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,240
if they were exceptionally good at

1277
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,118
hiring the right people personnel is

1278
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,799
policy man

1279
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,400
that's that's what it comes down to but

1280
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,480
wouldn't you be able to steer the ship

1281
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,760
way more than two degrees if you hire

1282
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,838
the right people so like

1283
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,760
it's almost like obama was not good at

1284
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,719
hiring the right people well he hired

1285
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
all the clinton people

1286
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:29,358
yeah that's what happened what happened

1287
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,760
with trump he hired all the bush people

1288
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:34,639
and then you sit back and say

1289
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,960
oh president can't but that means you're

1290
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,078
just

1291
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,519
sucking hiring correct yeah i mean look

1292
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,760
i know it's funny i'm giving you

1293
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,599
simultaneously the nationalist case

1294
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,440
against trump yeah and the progressive

1295
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,160
case against obama yes the progressive

1296
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,760
people were like

1297
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:49,598
why the [ __ ] are you hiring all these

1298
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,319
clinton people in order to run the

1299
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,240
government

1300
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:53,599
and just recreate like why are you

1301
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,439
hiring larry summers

1302
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,800
who was one of the people who worked at

1303
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,318
all these banks and didn't believe the

1304
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,920
bailouts were gonna be big enough

1305
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:01,920
and then to come in in the worst

1306
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,400
economic crisis in modern american

1307
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,800
history

1308
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,480
that was 2008 and summers actively

1309
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,480
lobbied against larger bailouts which

1310
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,639
had huge implications for

1311
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,318
working class people and pretty much

1312
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:14,480
hollowed out america since

1313
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:15,759
okay from trump same thing you're like

1314
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,318
i'm gonna drain the swamp

1315
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,280
and by doing that i'm gonna hire goldman

1316
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,400
sachs as

1317
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,760
gary cohn and steve mnuchin and

1318
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,559
all these other absolute bush clowns

1319
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,240
in order to run my white house well yeah

1320
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,960
no [ __ ] the only thing that you

1321
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,519
accomplished

1322
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,679
in your four years in office is passing

1323
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:38,159
a massive tax cut for the rich

1324
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,719
and for corporations i wonder how that

1325
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,279
happened

1326
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:41,759
what role does money play in all this is

1327
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,359
money

1328
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,319
huge influence in politics uh super pacs

1329
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:48,480
all that kind of stuff

1330
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:50,239
or is this is this more just kind of a

1331
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,838
narrative that we play with

1332
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,838
because from the outsider's perspective

1333
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,358
it seems to have

1334
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,199
that seems to be one of the fundamental

1335
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:58,400
problems with modern politics so i was

1336
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:59,919
just having this conversation

1337
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,838
marshall and i marshall castle of my

1338
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,519
co-host on the realignment and

1339
00:42:01,838 --> 00:42:05,759
it's funny because if you do enough

1340
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:09,119
research we actually live

1341
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:12,000
in the least corrupt age in american

1342
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,519
uh campaign finance as in it's never

1343
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,559
been more transparent

1344
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:18,880
it's never been more up to the f fec

1345
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:21,199
yeah and all of that if you go back and

1346
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,358
read not even 50 years ago we're talking

1347
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,679
about lyndon b johnson handing people

1348
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:26,480
like literally as he came up in his

1349
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:29,279
youth

1350
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,400
paying people for votes like the boss of

1351
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,720
the you know

1352
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,318
the person who like had all the mexican

1353
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,598
boats like the person who had and he was

1354
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,358
like giving out briefcases

1355
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,720
this is like within people's lifetimes

1356
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:42,159
who are alive in america

1357
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,318
so that doesn't happen anymore but i

1358
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:46,078
don't like to blame everything on money

1359
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:48,000
although i do think money is obviously

1360
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,160
a huge part of the problem i actually

1361
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,400
look at it in terms of

1362
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,920
distribution um which is that how is

1363
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,480
money distributed with an artist

1364
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,119
within our society because i firmly

1365
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,000
believe

1366
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,160
that politics this is going to get

1367
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,800
complicated but i think politics is

1368
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,358
mostly downstream from culture and

1369
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,880
culture

1370
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:08,239
obviously i'm using economics because

1371
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,800
there's obviously a huge interplay there

1372
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,199
but like

1373
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,800
in terms of the equitable or lack of

1374
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:13,598
equitable distribution of money within

1375
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,280
our politics

1376
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,519
what we're really pissed off about is

1377
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,000
we're like our politics only seems to

1378
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,159
work

1379
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,599
for the people who have money i think

1380
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,679
that's largely true

1381
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,440
um i think that the reason why things

1382
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,679
worked differently in the past

1383
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,720
is because our economy was structured in

1384
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:30,879
different ways

1385
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:32,719
and there's a reason that our politics

1386
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,280
today are very analogous

1387
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,719
to the last gilded age because we had

1388
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,680
very similar levels

1389
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,039
levels of economic distribution and

1390
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,078
cultural problems too at the same time i

1391
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:43,519
don't want to erase that because i

1392
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,200
actually think that's what's driving

1393
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:46,639
all of our politics right now so that's

1394
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,078
interesting so yeah

1395
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:49,598
that's one so in that sense

1396
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,280
representative government is doing a

1397
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,720
pretty good job of representing it is

1398
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,480
the state of culture and the people and

1399
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:57,519
so on yeah uh

1400
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,679
can i ask you uh in terms of um you know

1401
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:02,159
the deep state and conspiracy theories

1402
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,318
there's a lot of talk about so again

1403
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:06,399
from an outsider's perspective

1404
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,559
if i were just looking at twitter it

1405
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,760
seems that at least ninety percent of

1406
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:14,318
people in government are pedophiles

1407
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,040
90 to 95 i'm not sure what that number

1408
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,639
is

1409
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,639
if i were to just look at twitter

1410
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:20,799
honestly or youtube i would think

1411
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,000
most of the world is a pedophile i would

1412
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,000
almost feel like

1413
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,119
right and if you don't fully believe

1414
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,280
that you're a pedophile

1415
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,400
yeah yeah yeah i would start to wonder

1416
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,440
like wait am i like

1417
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,280
what am i a pedophile too i'm either a

1418
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,679
communist or a pedophile or both

1419
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,720
i guess uh yeah that's going to be

1420
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:41,519
clipped out thank you

1421
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:44,879
internet i look forward to your emails

1422
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:48,239
uh but is there any kind of

1423
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,760
shadow conspiracy theories that

1424
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,439
uh give you pause or um

1425
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,839
so the flip side the response to a lot

1426
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,838
of conspiracy theories it's like

1427
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,759
no the reason this happened is because

1428
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:02,960
it's a combination of

1429
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,680
just incompetence so where do you land

1430
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,400
on

1431
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:06,719
some of these uh conspiracy theories i

1432
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,599
think

1433
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,318
most conspiracy theories are wrong some

1434
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,599
are true

1435
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:15,838
and those are spectacularly true and

1436
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,640
if that makes sense yeah um i and we

1437
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,838
don't know which ones

1438
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,159
i don't know which one that's the

1439
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:21,440
problem i think oh well i mean look man

1440
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,639
i listened to your podcast

1441
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,440
i think i was a huge non-believer in

1442
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,440
ufos

1443
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,720
and now i've probably never believed

1444
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,200
more in uf like i

1445
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,719
i believe in ufos like i'm very

1446
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,318
comfortable being like

1447
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:35,838
not only do i believe in ufos like i

1448
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,960
think we're probably being visited by an

1449
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:38,799
alien civilization

1450
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,159
like and if you asked me that three

1451
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,280
years ago i would be like you're out of

1452
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:42,078
your [ __ ] mind like what are you

1453
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,160
talking about

1454
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,920
well listen to david fraber that's all i

1455
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,399
have to say that's it well i

1456
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,200
i have the sense that the government has

1457
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,440
information that

1458
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:53,519
hasn't revealed but it's not like

1459
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,679
they're i don't think they're holding

1460
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:56,960
there's like a green guy sitting there

1461
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:58,480
exactly they just

1462
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,400
they have seen things they don't know

1463
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,000
what to do with so it's like

1464
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,318
they're confused like they're afraid

1465
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
yeah of revealing that they don't know

1466
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:07,838
that's what i think it is right it's

1467
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,159
revealing the yeah exactly

1468
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,920
you don't know and then they're in the

1469
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:12,639
process there's a lot of fears tied up

1470
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,119
in that first

1471
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,559
looking incompetent in the public eye

1472
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,559
nobody wants to be

1473
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,239
uh looked that way and the other is like

1474
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,559
in revealing it

1475
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,078
even though they don't know maybe china

1476
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:25,759
will figure it out exactly

1477
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,599
so like we don't want china to figure it

1478
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,440
out first and so that

1479
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,119
all those kinds of things result in

1480
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,200
basically secrecy then

1481
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,358
that damages the trust in institutions

1482
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:38,399
on one of the most fascinating

1483
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,920
aspects like one of the most fascinating

1484
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,358
mysteries of humankind

1485
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,559
of is there life intelligent life out

1486
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:46,880
there in the universe

1487
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,159
so that's one of them but there there's

1488
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,838
other ones like uh

1489
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:51,759
for me when i first came across actually

1490
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:54,799
alex jones

1491
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,160
was 9 11. yeah i remember like because i

1492
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,720
was um

1493
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:01,279
i was in chicago i was thinking like oh

1494
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:02,480
[ __ ] are they gonna hit chicago too

1495
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,760
that's what everybody was thinking yeah

1496
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,679
everybody everybody was thinking like

1497
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,000
what does this mean let's get what scale

1498
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:07,759
what

1499
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,159
i mean trying to interpret it and i

1500
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,599
remember like looking for information

1501
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:14,318
that's been like what what happened

1502
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,960
what and i remember not being satisfied

1503
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:17,599
with

1504
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,159
the quality of reporting and figuring

1505
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,559
out like

1506
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,279
rigorous like here's exactly what

1507
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,519
happened

1508
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,760
and so people like alex jones stepped up

1509
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,159
and others that said like

1510
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,000
there's some shady [ __ ] going on and it

1511
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:30,799
sure as hell looked like there's shady

1512
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,239
[ __ ] going on

1513
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,240
yes uh so like and i still stand behind

1514
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:39,039
the fact that it seems like there's not

1515
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:39,039
i there's

1516
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,318
and then i mean that is that was a

1517
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,079
conspiracy theory not that long ago

1518
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:57,519
i think it's true i mean i think it's

1519
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,280
100 true yeah so

1520
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:00,880
those kinds of conspiracy theories are

1521
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,599
interesting i mean there's other ones

1522
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,119
for me personally that touched uh the

1523
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,400
institution that

1524
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,838
means a lot to me is mit and uh

1525
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,119
you know jeffrey epstein yeah i want to

1526
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:11,519
hear a lot more i want to hear about

1527
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,039
that

1528
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,880
i talk about epstein a lot so i'm like

1529
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:16,000
oh you do yeah and and he

1530
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,318
i was going to say in terms of

1531
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,519
conspiracy theory that one changed my

1532
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:22,318
outlook because i was like

1533
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,119
i was like whoa like you have this dude

1534
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:24,960
who

1535
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,480
convinced some of the most successful

1536
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,119
people on earth

1537
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,920
that he was like some money manager and

1538
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,160
it looks like

1539
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,680
it was totally fake like leon black i

1540
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,679
mean this is one of the richest men on

1541
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,639
wall street nine billion dollar

1542
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:41,039
net worth why has he given him over a

1543
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:42,078
hundred million dollars between 2015 and

1544
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:44,719
2019

1545
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,160
yeah what's going on here lex wexner

1546
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:46,558
same thing so yeah i want to hear

1547
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,719
because

1548
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,000
you know people who met him and the only

1549
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,439
person i know who met him was eric

1550
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,039
weinstein i've heard his

1551
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,280
right oh boy so i listen i'm still lynn

1552
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,759
and

1553
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,559
eric is fascinating and like eric is

1554
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,200
full-on

1555
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:03,200
saying that he was a mossad or

1556
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:09,039
uh something much much bigger um

1557
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,160
and there's uh whatever his name robert

1558
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:13,199
maxwell all the

1559
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,318
all those stories like you could dig

1560
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,078
deeper and deeper that

1561
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,440
jeffrey's just like the tip of the

1562
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,599
iceberg

1563
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,480
i just think he's an exceptionally

1564
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,000
charismatic

1565
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,000
listen this isn't speaking from

1566
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,079
confidence or like

1567
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,280
deep understanding the situation but for

1568
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,559
my

1569
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:34,000
speaking with people he just seems like

1570
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:37,280
at least from the side of his influence

1571
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,559
and interaction with researchers he just

1572
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,680
seems like somebody that was

1573
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:44,720
exceptionally charismatic

1574
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:48,159
and actually took interest

1575
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:49,598
he was unable to speak about interesting

1576
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:52,399
scientific things

1577
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:54,240
but he took interest in them so he knew

1578
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,160
how to stroke the egos of a lot of

1579
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:58,558
powerful people like well

1580
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,279
like in in different kinds of ways i

1581
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,760
suppose

1582
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,960
i don't know about this because i don't

1583
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,200
have

1584
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,960
like if a really okay this is this is

1585
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:10,480
weird to say but

1586
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,960
i have an ability okay i think

1587
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,599
women are beautiful i like women but

1588
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,800
like if if like a supermodel came to me

1589
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,680
or something like

1590
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,480
like i'm able to reason it seems like

1591
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:22,719
some people

1592
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,318
yes are not able to think clearly when

1593
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,118
there's like an attractive woman in the

1594
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:27,599
room

1595
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,160
and i think that was one of the tools he

1596
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,960
used

1597
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:31,358
to manipulate people interesting i don't

1598
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,800
know

1599
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:34,719
listen it's like the pedophile thing

1600
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,720
right i don't know how many people are

1601
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:37,919
complete sex addicts but like it seems

1602
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:39,759
like

1603
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,599
like looking out into the world like

1604
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,440
there's a with like the metoo movement

1605
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,559
have revealed that there's a lot of like

1606
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,519
weird

1607
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,160
like uh creepy people out there i don't

1608
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,000
know

1609
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:51,838
but i think it was just one of the many

1610
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
tools that he used

1611
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:58,239
uh to uh convince people and manipulate

1612
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
people but not in some

1613
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:05,358
like um evil way

1614
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,960
but more just really good at the art of

1615
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:10,799
conversation

1616
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:13,039
and just winning people over on the side

1617
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,720
and then by building through that

1618
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,000
process building a network of other

1619
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:19,039
really powerful people

1620
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,559
and not explicitly but

1621
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:25,920
implicitly having done shady [ __ ]

1622
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,359
with powerful people yeah like building

1623
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,440
up a kind of

1624
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:34,639
implied power of like

1625
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,200
like we did some shady [ __ ] together

1626
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:39,199
so we're not like you're going to help

1627
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,879
me out on this extra thing i need to

1628
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:41,759
know and that builds and builds and

1629
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,640
builds

1630
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,880
to where you're able to actually control

1631
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:49,039
like have quite a lot of power without

1632
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,000
explicitly having like a strategy

1633
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:53,679
meeting

1634
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,519
and i think a single person or

1635
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:58,000
yeah i think a single person can do that

1636
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:00,400
or can start that ball rolling

1637
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
and over time it becomes a group thing

1638
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,119
like i don't know if

1639
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,838
julian maxwell was involved or others

1640
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,760
and yeah over time that becomes almost

1641
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:12,558
like a really powerful organization

1642
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,520
that wasn't that's not a front for

1643
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,160
something

1644
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,838
much deeper and bigger but it's almost

1645
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,440
like maybe it's because i love cellular

1646
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:21,440
automata man

1647
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,119
a system that starts out as a simple

1648
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,280
thing with simple rules

1649
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,640
can create incredible complexity yes and

1650
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,519
so i just think that

1651
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,598
uh we're now looking in retrospect it

1652
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:32,800
looks like an incredibly complex system

1653
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,800
that's operating in

1654
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,920
but like that's just because it's you

1655
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,119
know there could be a lot of other

1656
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,599
jeffrey epstein's

1657
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,640
in in my perspective that this simple

1658
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,559
thing just

1659
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,239
uh was successful early on it builds and

1660
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:46,480
builds and builds and builds

1661
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:49,118
and then there's uh creepy [ __ ] that

1662
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,119
like a lot of aspects of the system

1663
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,240
helped it get bigger and bigger and more

1664
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,760
powerful and so on

1665
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:59,279
so the final result is i mean

1666
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:02,160
listen i have a pretty optimistic i have

1667
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,079
i tend to see the good in people and so

1668
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,519
it's been heartbreaking to me in general

1669
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,960
just to see

1670
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:11,039
you know people i look up to not have

1671
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,838
the level of integrity i thought they

1672
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,079
would

1673
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:15,279
or like the strength of character all

1674
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:18,640
those kinds of things

1675
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,040
and it seems like you should be able to

1676
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:22,719
to see the [ __ ] that is jeffrey

1677
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,639
epstein like when you meet him

1678
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,879
right uh we're not talking about like

1679
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,480
eric weinstein like one or two or three

1680
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,880
or five interactions

1681
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,519
but like there's people that had like

1682
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,838
like years of relationship with him yeah

1683
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:36,800
and i don't know i i'm not sure even

1684
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:40,239
after he was convicted

1685
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,920
after he was convicted yeah there's

1686
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:42,399
there's stories i mean i don't need to

1687
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:47,599
sort of

1688
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,599
uh i honestly believe

1689
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,800
okay here's the open question i have i

1690
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:55,679
don't

1691
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,960
know how many creepy sexual people that

1692
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,078
are out there

1693
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,318
like i don't know if there's like

1694
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,280
like the people i know the faculty and

1695
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:05,119
so on

1696
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,960
i don't know if they have like a kink

1697
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,318
that i'm just not aware of that was

1698
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,280
being leveraged because to me it seems

1699
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:13,199
like

1700
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,420
if if if people aren't if not

1701
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:16,159
everybody's a pedophile

1702
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:18,400
[Laughter]

1703
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:20,879
then it's just the art of conversation

1704
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,440
that is just like the art of just like

1705
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,079
manipulating people by making them feel

1706
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,358
good about

1707
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,440
like the exciting stuff they're doing

1708
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:28,400
listen man academics are people talk

1709
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,240
about money

1710
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,440
i don't think academics care about money

1711
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,799
as much as people think

1712
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:37,440
what they care about is like somebody

1713
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,119
they they want to be uh it's the same

1714
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,519
thing that instagram models

1715
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,480
post in their butt pictures is they want

1716
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:44,159
to be loved

1717
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,880
they want attention my parents are

1718
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:46,879
professors yeah

1719
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:53,358
they they and jeff epstein the money

1720
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:56,479
is another way to show attention right

1721
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:59,838
it's my work matters and and and he

1722
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,719
for some of he did that for some of the

1723
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,920
weirdest most brilliant people i don't

1724
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,239
want to sort of

1725
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,079
drop names but everybody knows them it's

1726
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,919
like people that are

1727
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,280
the most interesting academics is the

1728
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,519
one he cared about yeah

1729
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,720
like people are thinking about the most

1730
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,239
difficult questions

1731
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:18,480
of in all of science and all of

1732
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:21,039
engineering so those people

1733
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,559
are we're kind of outcasts in academia a

1734
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,318
little bit because they're doing the

1735
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,079
weird [ __ ] they were the weirdos

1736
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:27,759
and he cared about the weirdos and he

1737
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:31,359
gave them money and that

1738
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,880
uh you know i that's i don't know if

1739
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:33,440
there's something more nefarious than

1740
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,480
that

1741
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,159
i i i hope not but maybe i'm surprised

1742
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,719
and in fact the half the population of

1743
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:40,558
the world is

1744
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,318
pedophiles no i i think it's what you

1745
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,359
were talking about which is that

1746
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:47,599
it's the it's the implication

1747
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:48,960
after the initial right like you do some

1748
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,318
shady things together or you do

1749
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,318
something that you want out of the

1750
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:54,000
public eye and you're a public person

1751
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:55,440
and look we probably even experienced

1752
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,079
this to a limited extent right you're

1753
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,679
like

1754
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,599
you know like i don't wanna i don't

1755
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:00,879
almost lost my temper you know one time

1756
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,559
whenever a car hit me and i'm like i

1757
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,920
can't freak out in public anymore

1758
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,079
that you know like what if somebody

1759
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,079
takes a photo or something yeah and so

1760
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,359
i think that there's an extent to that

1761
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,720
times a billion

1762
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:12,798
literally when you have a billion

1763
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:14,798
dollars or more and you take that all

1764
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:16,639
together and you stack it up on itself

1765
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,798
i saw a story about like bill clinton

1766
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:21,759
like bill clinton was with epstein

1767
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:23,119
or with gelane maxwell in a private air

1768
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,000
terminal or something

1769
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,318
and she had one of their like sex you

1770
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,159
know

1771
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:30,000
one of those girls who was underage had

1772
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,039
her dressed up in a literal like pilot

1773
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,519
uniform

1774
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,798
and she was underage in order to you

1775
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:37,679
know and she was just

1776
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:38,639
being disguised for being older and she

1777
00:56:37,679 --> 00:56:40,318
was a masseuse

1778
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:41,838
right because that was one of the uh

1779
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:43,358
guyses which they got in order to

1780
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:44,558
sexually traffic these women

1781
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,759
and she was like bill was like

1782
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,960
complaining about his neck and she's

1783
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,559
like give bill clinton a

1784
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,240
massage right so now there's a photo of

1785
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,760
an underage girl giving a massage

1786
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:54,159
to the former president of the united

1787
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:57,359
states i don't think he knew

1788
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:58,879
right but like that looks bad and so

1789
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:00,880
this is kind of what we're getting at

1790
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,798
which is that you're setting it all up

1791
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,559
and creating those preconditions

1792
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:06,960
or like prince andrew do i think prince

1793
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:10,400
andrew knew that virginia gouffrey

1794
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,358
was underage i don't know probably knew

1795
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,960
she was pretty young

1796
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:14,480
which i think is you know skeevy enough

1797
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,760
where if you're a [ __ ] prince you

1798
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,920
should probably know better yeah

1799
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,680
but i don't think he knew she was

1800
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,318
underage or maybe he did and if he did

1801
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:21,919
and he's even

1802
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:24,239
more of a piece of [ __ ] than i thought

1803
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,440
but we when we when we look at these

1804
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:27,039
things

1805
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,400
the the stuff i'm more interested in is

1806
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,759
like what you were talking about i'm

1807
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,519
like bill gates

1808
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,880
how do you get the richest man in the

1809
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,199
world in your house

1810
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,798
yeah like under what got and gates is

1811
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:37,439
like he was talking about financing and

1812
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:39,358
all this i'm like

1813
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,559
you don't have access to money or

1814
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:42,719
bankers like

1815
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,160
you're the richest man in the world you

1816
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,719
can call goldman sachs

1817
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:47,519
anytime you want on a hotline like why

1818
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:49,439
do you need

1819
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,960
that's where that's where i start again

1820
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,599
to get more conspiratorial because i'm

1821
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,079
like

1822
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,880
bill dude you can you have the gold

1823
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,480
credit right

1824
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,280
like you don't need epstein to create

1825
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,639
some complicated financing structure

1826
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,519
or leon black like what is

1827
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:05,920
2015 2009 i mean this is very recent

1828
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:07,759
stuff

1829
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,519
or and this is the part that really got

1830
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,720
me as i read the depart

1831
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,400
i think it's called the department of

1832
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:13,519
financial services report around

1833
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,639
deutsche bank

1834
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:19,519
with epstein the news a criminal

1835
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:20,159
they solicited his business explicitly

1836
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,159
knew

1837
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,480
that his business meant access to other

1838
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:26,239
high net worth individuals

1839
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,400
consistently doled money out from his

1840
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:30,479
account for hush payments

1841
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,240
to women in europe and prostitution

1842
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,719
rings they knew all of this

1843
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:35,358
within the bank it was elevated multiple

1844
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,039
times

1845
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:39,119
here was the other one one of epson's

1846
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:41,119
associates was like hey how much money

1847
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,798
can we take out before we hit the

1848
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,720
you know automatic sensor before you

1849
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:47,280
have to tell the irs

1850
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:49,358
and that question by by their own

1851
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,519
standards is supposed to result

1852
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:53,279
in a notification to the feds and they

1853
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,798
never did it and he was withdrawing like

1854
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,599
two million dollars of cash

1855
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:58,559
in five years for tips yeah i'm like

1856
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,039
okay

1857
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,798
like something's going on here you see

1858
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:04,719
what i'm saying there's a lot of signs

1859
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:06,079
that make you think that there is a

1860
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:10,480
bigger thing at play

1861
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:12,798
than just a man that there is some

1862
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,838
it does look like a larger organization

1863
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:16,400
is using this

1864
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:18,159
front right it's again i don't know i i

1865
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,599
truly don't know and i'm not willing to

1866
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,358
use the certainty which i think a lot of

1867
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,240
people online are to say like it wants

1868
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:24,078
one hundred years

1869
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,838
the search is always the problem because

1870
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,400
that that's probably why

1871
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:30,558
i hesitate to touch conspiracy theories

1872
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,519
is because i'm allergic to certainty in

1873
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:33,519
all forms

1874
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:34,639
in politics any kind of discourse and

1875
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:37,679
people are so

1876
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:40,719
sure in both directions actually

1877
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:43,279
it's kind of hilarious uh either

1878
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:44,558
they're sure that the conspiracy theory

1879
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,680
particular whatever the conspiracy

1880
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:49,119
theories is false

1881
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:50,719
like they almost dismiss it like

1882
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,240
like they don't even want to talk about

1883
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:52,879
it's like the people like the way they

1884
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:54,959
dismiss

1885
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,240
that the earth is flat yes most

1886
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,679
scientists are like

1887
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:01,598
they don't even want to like hear

1888
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:03,039
what the what the flat earthers are

1889
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:06,640
saying they don't have

1890
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:09,199
like zero patience for it which is like

1891
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:11,039
maybe in that case yeah it's deserved

1892
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:14,719
but everything else

1893
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:17,440
you really like have empathy like

1894
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:20,000
consider the f you have okay this is

1895
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,639
weird to say but i feel like

1896
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,599
you have to consider that the earth

1897
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:27,039
might be flat

1898
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:29,200
for like one minute like you have to be

1899
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:30,400
empathetic you have to be open-minded

1900
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:32,239
i don't see a lot of that there are

1901
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,960
cultural taste makers and more and

1902
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:35,439
that's

1903
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,880
that really is what concerns me the most

1904
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,079
because it's just another manifestation

1905
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,160
of all of our problems

1906
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:43,519
it's that we have this completely

1907
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:46,078
bifurcating economy bifurcating culture

1908
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:47,358
literally in terms of we have the middle

1909
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,839
of the country and then we have the

1910
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:49,679
coast

1911
01:00:47,838 --> 01:00:51,199
and in terms of the population it's

1912
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,519
almost 50 50

1913
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:54,639
and with you know increasing mega cities

1914
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,519
and urban

1915
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:58,719
culture like urban monoculture of la new

1916
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:02,480
york and chicago

1917
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:04,558
and dc and boston and austin relative to

1918
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,838
how an entire other group of americans

1919
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,519
live their lives

1920
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:09,039
or even the people within them who

1921
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:10,639
aren't rich and upwardly mobile

1922
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:12,079
how they live their lives is just

1923
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:13,279
completely separating

1924
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,200
and all of our language and

1925
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,960
communication in

1926
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:18,558
mass media and more is to the top and

1927
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,079
then everybody else is forgotten

1928
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,400
do you think when you go when you dick

1929
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:25,359
to the core there is a big

1930
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,000
there's a big gap between left and right

1931
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:28,480
is there

1932
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,119
is that division that that's perceived

1933
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,480
currently

1934
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,280
real or are most people look center left

1935
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,440
and center right

1936
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,640
it's so interesting because that's such

1937
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,000
a loaded term

1938
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:42,000
center left what does that mean like

1939
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,440
so you i think the way you're thinking

1940
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,679
of it is i'm not

1941
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:50,880
like a well even this like i'm not a

1942
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:54,558
radical socialist but i'm uh

1943
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,960
i'm marginally left on cultural issues

1944
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,559
and economic issues this is how we've

1945
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,798
traditionally understood things

1946
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,160
um and then when when in popular

1947
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:03,759
discourse like center right like what

1948
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,558
does it mean to be center right like

1949
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,240
i am marginally right on socially on

1950
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,319
conservat on social issues

1951
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:11,919
and marginally right on economic issues

1952
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:14,318
yeah but that's just not

1953
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,159
politic like if you look at survey data

1954
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,639
for example like

1955
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:20,159
uh stimulus checks people who are

1956
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:20,558
against stimulus checks are conservative

1957
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,480
right

1958
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,400
well eighty percent of the population is

1959
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,960
first stimulus check so that means a

1960
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,798
sizable

1961
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,559
number of republicans are for stimulus

1962
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:31,119
checks same thing happens on

1963
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,079
like a wealth tax um the same thing

1964
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:35,119
happens on

1965
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:39,280
okay florida voted for trump

1966
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:42,400
3.1 more than barack obama 2008.

1967
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,599
on the same day passes a 15 minimum wage

1968
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,079
at 67

1969
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:47,599
yeah so what's going on so that's why

1970
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:50,640
what is going on

1971
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:51,440
well that's my entire career no but but

1972
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:53,519
it seems like

1973
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,519
uh so that's that's fascinating yeah

1974
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,920
conversation

1975
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:59,440
is different than the policies well it's

1976
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,798
different than reality that's what i

1977
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,559
would say which is that

1978
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:04,079
the way we have to understand american

1979
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,839
politics

1980
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,760
today it didn't always used to be this

1981
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:11,038
way is it's almost

1982
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,000
entirely long basic i would say the main

1983
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:13,680
divider

1984
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,039
is because even when you talk about

1985
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:16,399
class dismisses it in terms of

1986
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:19,760
socioeconomics

1987
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:21,680
it's around culture which is that

1988
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,160
it's basically if you went to a

1989
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:26,078
four-year degree granting institution

1990
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:27,759
you are part of one culture if you

1991
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:30,798
didn't you're part of another

1992
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,319
i don't want to erase the 20 or whatever

1993
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:34,719
people who do go to a college degree who

1994
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:37,038
are republicans or vice versa

1995
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:38,558
et cetera but i'm saying on average in

1996
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,319
terms of the median

1997
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,599
way that you feel we're basically

1998
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:43,679
bifurcating

1999
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,200
along those lines and because people get

2000
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:46,639
upset be like oh well

2001
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,558
you know there are rich people who vote

2002
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:50,400
for trump and i'm like yeah

2003
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,599
but you know you know who they are

2004
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,039
they're like plumbers

2005
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,880
or something like they're people who

2006
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,079
make a hundred thousand dollars a year

2007
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,318
but they didn't go to a four-year

2008
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:01,200
college degree and they might live

2009
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:02,400
who are in a place which is not an urban

2010
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:04,159
metro area

2011
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,519
and then at the same time you have like

2012
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:08,239
a vox rider

2013
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:08,798
who makes like 30 grand but they have a

2014
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:11,679
lot more

2015
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:12,079
cultural power than like the plumber so

2016
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:14,719
you have

2017
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:15,599
to think about where exactly that line

2018
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:16,959
is and i think

2019
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,119
in general that's the way that we're

2020
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,880
trending so

2021
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,720
that's why when i say like what's going

2022
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,119
on are we divided yeah like

2023
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:26,000
but it's not left and right i mean like

2024
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,240
and that's why i hate these

2025
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:30,000
labels so it's more it's more just red

2026
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,719
and blue like teams they're arbitrary

2027
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,280
teams

2028
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,798
yeah are they so how arbitrary are these

2029
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,599
teams i guess is another completely

2030
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:37,119
arbitrary

2031
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,880
so yeah well you kind of imply that

2032
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:42,480
there's i don't know if you're sort of

2033
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:45,119
in post analyzing the patterns because

2034
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,960
it seems like there's a network effects

2035
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,318
of like you just pick the team red or

2036
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,159
blue

2037
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:51,759
and it might have to do with college you

2038
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:52,318
might have to do all those things but

2039
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,520
like

2040
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:58,960
it it seems like it's more about

2041
01:04:55,519 --> 01:05:01,280
uh just the people around you correct

2042
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,039
so less than whether you went to college

2043
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,000
or not i mean it's almost like seems

2044
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,920
like

2045
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,599
it's it's almost like uh weird right

2046
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:09,920
like network effects that

2047
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,359
are hard there's certain strong patterns

2048
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,240
correct you're identifying

2049
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:15,119
but i don't know it's sad to think that

2050
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:17,118
it might be just

2051
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,640
teams that have nothing to do with what

2052
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:21,358
you actually believe

2053
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:22,000
well it is lex i look i mean i don't

2054
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:23,838
want to believe

2055
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,679
that but the data points me to this

2056
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:28,078
which especially 2020.

2057
01:05:25,679 --> 01:05:29,279
i'm one of the people chief among them i

2058
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,519
will own up to it here

2059
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,039
i was totally wrong about why trump was

2060
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:35,759
elected in 2016.

2061
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,440
i believed and based a lot of my public

2062
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,839
commentary beliefs on this

2063
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,280
trump was elected because of a rejection

2064
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:43,599
of hillary clinton

2065
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,960
neo-liberalism on the back of a

2066
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:48,400
pro-worker

2067
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:50,559
message which was anti-immigration

2068
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,760
it was its pillar but alongside of it

2069
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,039
was a rejection

2070
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:57,599
of free trade with china and

2071
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,720
generally of the political correctness

2072
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,359
and globalism

2073
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:02,480
which has been come in through the

2074
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:04,159
uniparty and

2075
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,639
same thing here with the military

2076
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,879
industrial complex and endless war

2077
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,239
he rejected all of that wait what's

2078
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,079
wrong with that prediction

2079
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:13,358
it's wrong man and the reason i know

2080
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,359
this is that

2081
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:16,558
it sounds right i wish it i honestly

2082
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:18,318
wish it was true

2083
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:20,160
but here's the truth trump actually

2084
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:22,798
governed largely

2085
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:24,239
as a neo-liberal republican who was

2086
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,880
meaner online

2087
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:28,558
and who departed from orthodoxy in some

2088
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,599
very important ways don't get me wrong i

2089
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,599
will always

2090
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,640
support the trade war with china i will

2091
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,480
always support

2092
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:36,480
not expanding the wars in afghanistan

2093
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,039
and in iraq i will support him

2094
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,639
moving the overton window on a million

2095
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:43,119
different things and revealing once and

2096
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:45,598
for all that gop voters don't care about

2097
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:47,280
economic orthodoxy necessarily but

2098
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,920
here's what they do care about

2099
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,798
trump got more votes in 2020 than he did

2100
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,920
in 2016

2101
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:55,440
despite not delivering largely largely

2102
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,079
for all the trump people out there

2103
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,760
on that agenda he wasn't more pro-union

2104
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,400
but he won more union votes

2105
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,799
he wasn't necessarily more pro-worker

2106
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,760
but he actually won more votes in ohio

2107
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:08,960
than he did in 2016. and he won more

2108
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,119
hispanic votes

2109
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,318
than despite being you know all the

2110
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:15,440
immigration agenda

2111
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:16,079
rhetoric etc here's why it's about the

2112
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,358
culture

2113
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:21,599
which is that the culture war is so hot

2114
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:22,960
that negative partisanship is at such

2115
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,519
high levels

2116
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,280
all of the vote is geared upon what the

2117
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:29,038
other guy might do in office and there's

2118
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,599
a poll actually just came out by echelon

2119
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,880
insights

2120
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:33,280
crystal and i were talking about it on

2121
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,440
rising the number one concern

2122
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,319
amongst democratic voters is trump

2123
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,519
voters

2124
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:42,079
number one concern not issues

2125
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:43,199
like trump voters and number two is

2126
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:46,000
white supremacy

2127
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:46,960
and so like which is basically code for

2128
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,798
trump voters

2129
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,240
and it's the same for the other side

2130
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,798
well so on the right the number one

2131
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:53,598
concern

2132
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:54,480
is illegal immigration um and number i

2133
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,640
think

2134
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,559
three or four or whatever is antifa

2135
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,960
which is code four

2136
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,839
from the right is the policy well well

2137
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,920
yeah it's funny

2138
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:05,279
i saw ben shapiro talking about this but

2139
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,720
the reason why i would

2140
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,798
functionally say it's the same is

2141
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:09,919
because the i mean

2142
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:11,280
you can believe whether it's a true or

2143
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,838
not i think it actually largely is true

2144
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,160
but like

2145
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:16,399
the a lot of gop voters feel like a lot

2146
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:17,679
of illegal immigration is code for like

2147
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,960
people who are coming in who are going

2148
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:19,679
to be legalized and are going to go vote

2149
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,439
democrat

2150
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,440
like i can i can just explain it from

2151
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:25,919
their point of view so like

2152
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:26,639
what does that actually mean each other

2153
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,158
like yeah

2154
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,000
each other which is that the number one

2155
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,358
concern is

2156
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,520
the other person so negative

2157
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:36,079
partisanship has never been higher

2158
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,040
and i think people who had my thesis in

2159
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:39,519
terms of why trump was

2160
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,679
elected in 2016 you have to grapple with

2161
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,159
this like how did he win

2162
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,440
10 million more votes he came 44 000

2163
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:46,719
votes away from winning the presidency

2164
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,879
across three states

2165
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,000
like i don't none of our popular

2166
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,679
discourse reflects

2167
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,798
that very stark reality and i think

2168
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:59,600
so much of it is people really hate

2169
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:01,759
liberals like they just really hate them

2170
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,159
and i was driving through

2171
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:04,798
rural nevada before the election and i

2172
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:06,399
was like

2173
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:09,039
literally in the middle of nowhere and

2174
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,599
there was this massive sign this guy had

2175
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:11,039
out

2176
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,798
in front of his house and it just said

2177
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:16,079
trump colon [ __ ]

2178
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:18,640
your feelings and i was like that's it

2179
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:20,318
that is why people voted for trump and i

2180
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,480
don't want to denigrate it because

2181
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:24,480
they truly feel they have no cultural

2182
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:27,119
power in america

2183
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:28,238
except to raise the middle finger to the

2184
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:30,798
elite class

2185
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,318
by pressing the button for trump i get

2186
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:35,439
that that's actually a totally

2187
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:37,520
rational way to vote it's not the way i

2188
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:40,318
wish we did vote but like

2189
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,759
you know it's not my place to say so

2190
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,120
yeah this is interesting if you could

2191
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,560
just psychoanalyze

2192
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:47,278
i'm again i'm probably naive about this

2193
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,560
but

2194
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:52,480
i'm really bothered by the hatred of

2195
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:56,320
liberals

2196
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:59,599
it's uh it's this amorphous monster

2197
01:09:56,319 --> 01:10:01,920
that's mocked it's like the shapiro

2198
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,640
liberal tears and i'm also really

2199
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,640
bothered by

2200
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:10,238
probably more of my colleagues and

2201
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:13,679
friends the hatred of trump yeah

2202
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:16,799
uh the the trump and

2203
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,359
and white supremacist so apparently 70

2204
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,400
there's

2205
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:21,198
70 million white supremacists 75 million

2206
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:25,119
sorry

2207
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:27,519
there's millions of white supremacists

2208
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:28,479
and apparently whatever liberal is i

2209
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,400
mean lib

2210
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:31,759
you know you literally liberal has

2211
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,920
become

2212
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,400
equivalent to white supremacists in the

2213
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,079
power of negativity it arouses

2214
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:39,679
i don't even know what those i mean

2215
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:41,519
honestly i just don't they've become

2216
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:45,279
swears essentially

2217
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:48,719
uh is that i mean how do we get

2218
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:49,920
out of this because that uh that's why i

2219
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,560
just don't even say anything about

2220
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:55,760
politics online because it's like

2221
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:59,280
really like you you can't

2222
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,760
you if here's what happens anything you

2223
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:02,479
say

2224
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,199
that's like thoughtful like hmm i wonder

2225
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:06,399
like

2226
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:10,479
immigration something right i wonder

2227
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:12,479
like why you know uh we have

2228
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:13,678
these many we allow these many

2229
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:15,519
immigrants in or

2230
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:17,600
some version of the like thinking

2231
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,320
through these difficult policies and so

2232
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,560
on

2233
01:11:18,319 --> 01:11:23,119
that they'll immediately try to find

2234
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:26,239
like a single word in something you say

2235
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:28,880
they can put you in a bin of liberal

2236
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:30,158
or white supremacist and then hammer you

2237
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,560
to death

2238
01:11:30,158 --> 01:11:34,399
by saying you're one of the two and then

2239
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,719
everybody just piles on

2240
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:37,839
happily that we finally nailed this

2241
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:41,039
white supremacist

2242
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,199
or liberal and that

2243
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:44,800
is this some kind of weird like feature

2244
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,839
of online communication that we've just

2245
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,320
stumbled upon

2246
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,520
is there a way or is it possible to

2247
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:51,840
argue that this is like

2248
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,199
a feature not a bug like this is a a

2249
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,800
good thing

2250
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:56,399
yeah well look i just think it's a

2251
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,920
reflection of who we are people like to

2252
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:59,279
blame social media i think we're just

2253
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,480
incredibly divided right now i think

2254
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:03,039
we've been divided like this

2255
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:04,879
for the last 20 years and i think that i

2256
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:07,519
can the reason i focus

2257
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,359
almost 99 of my public commentary on

2258
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,800
economics is because you asked an

2259
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:13,599
important question at the top

2260
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,520
how do we fix this what did i say about

2261
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,000
the stimulus checks stimulus checks have

2262
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,760
80

2263
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,600
approval rating so that's the type of

2264
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,880
thing if i was joe biden and i wanted to

2265
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,159
actually heal this country

2266
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,640
that's the very first thing i would have

2267
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:26,879
done when i came into office same thing

2268
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,400
on uh when you look at anything that's

2269
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,800
gonna increase wages

2270
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:32,319
um i i said on the show i was like look

2271
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,159
i think joe biden will have a 80

2272
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:35,679
approval rating if he does two things if

2273
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:37,839
he gives every american

2274
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,920
a 2 000 stimulus check and gives

2275
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,079
everybody who wants a vaccine a vaccine

2276
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,359
that's it it's pretty simple because

2277
01:12:42,079 --> 01:12:44,640
here's the thing

2278
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,759
i don't really like greg abbott that

2279
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,119
much we have like very different

2280
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,440
politics i'm from texas

2281
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:50,158
but my parents got vaccinated really

2282
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:52,319
quickly

2283
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:53,599
that means something to me i'm like

2284
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:56,000
listen i don't really

2285
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:58,079
care about a lot of the other stuff he

2286
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,198
got my family vaccinated

2287
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:03,359
like that well i will forever

2288
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:04,238
remember that and that's how we will

2289
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:05,839
remember

2290
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:07,839
the checks this isn't part of a reason

2291
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,600
why trump almost won the election

2292
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,520
and why if the republicans had been

2293
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,000
smart enough to give him a 2000

2294
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,640
another round of checks 100 would have

2295
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,039
won

2296
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,159
which is that people were like look i

2297
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:20,640
don't really like trump

2298
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:21,359
but i got a check with his name on it

2299
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,320
and that

2300
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:25,279
meant something to me and my family i'm

2301
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:26,880
not saying

2302
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:28,960
for all the libertarians out there that

2303
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,440
you should go and like endlessly

2304
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,560
spend money and buy votes what i am

2305
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:35,759
saying is

2306
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:38,159
lean into the majoritarian

2307
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,679
positions without adding your culture

2308
01:13:38,158 --> 01:13:41,920
war [ __ ] on top of it

2309
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:43,760
yeah so for example what's the number

2310
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,199
one concern that aoc says after the

2311
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,880
first round of checks got out

2312
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:48,399
oh the checks didn't go to illegal

2313
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,520
immigrants i'm like are you out of your

2314
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:51,279
[ __ ] mind

2315
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,960
like this is the most popular policy

2316
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:56,399
america has probably done

2317
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,560
in 50 years you know since like medicare

2318
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:00,079
and you're you're considering it you're

2319
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,920
ruining it yeah

2320
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:03,920
and then on the right is the same thing

2321
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,560
which is that they'll be like these

2322
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,119
checks are going to like you know low

2323
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,199
level

2324
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:10,800
blah blah you know people who are lazy

2325
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:12,158
and don't work i'm like oh there you go

2326
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,039
you know like you're just playing a

2327
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,719
caricature of what you are like if you

2328
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:17,198
lean into those issues and you got to do

2329
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,480
it clean

2330
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:20,319
this is this is what everybody hates

2331
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:23,039
about dc which is that

2332
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:24,399
biden right now is doing the 1400 checks

2333
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:26,238
but he's looping it in

2334
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:27,679
with his coveted relief bill and all

2335
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:29,039
that that's his prerogative that's the

2336
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,399
democrats prerogative they won the

2337
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:32,079
election that's fine

2338
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,079
but i'll tell you what i would have done

2339
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:35,279
if i was him i would have come in

2340
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:36,719
and i would have said there's five

2341
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:38,399
united states senators who are on the

2342
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:39,840
record republicans who say they'll vote

2343
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:41,599
for a two thousand dollar check

2344
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,440
and i would put that on the floor of the

2345
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,480
united states senate on my you know

2346
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:46,559
first or

2347
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:48,000
the first day possible and i would have

2348
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,920
passed it and i would have

2349
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,158
forced those republican senators to live

2350
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,800
up to that vote for this bill

2351
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:56,238
come to the oval office for a signing so

2352
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,279
that the very first thing of my

2353
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:59,759
presidency

2354
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:00,559
was to say i'm giving you all this

2355
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,320
relief check

2356
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,000
this night long national nightmare is

2357
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:05,840
over take this money

2358
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,198
do with it what you need we've all

2359
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,360
suffered together

2360
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:10,960
the thing about biden is he has a

2361
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:12,960
portrait of fdr in his

2362
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,480
in the oval which kind of bothers me

2363
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,840
because he thinks of himself as an

2364
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:17,759
fdr-like figure

2365
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,880
but this is you have to understand the

2366
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,360
majesty of

2367
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,199
fdr we're talking about a person who

2368
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:25,439
passed a piece of legislation

2369
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:26,238
five days after he became president and

2370
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:29,119
he passed

2371
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:30,718
15 transformative pieces of legislation

2372
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:34,238
in the first hundred days

2373
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:36,158
we are on day like 34 35 and

2374
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:37,759
nothing is passed the reconciliation

2375
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:39,119
bill will eventually become law but it

2376
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:42,000
will become law with no

2377
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:43,359
republican votes and again that's fine

2378
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,679
if but it's not

2379
01:15:43,359 --> 01:15:47,039
fulfilling that legacy and the urgency

2380
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,880
of the action

2381
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:50,158
and the mandate which i believe that

2382
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,000
history has handed

2383
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:54,000
it handed it to trump and he [ __ ] it

2384
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,600
up right he totally screwed it up he

2385
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,960
could have remade america and made us

2386
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,400
into the greatest country

2387
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,880
ever coming out on the other side of

2388
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:02,960
this he decided not to do that

2389
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,640
i think biden was again handed that like

2390
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,000
a scepter almost it's like all you have

2391
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,760
to do all america wants

2392
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,039
is for you to raise it up high yeah but

2393
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,400
he's keeping it within the realm of

2394
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:12,319
traditional politics

2395
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:14,158
i think it's a huge mistake why so this

2396
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:16,319
is everything you're saying is makes

2397
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:17,519
perfect sounds like take yeah okay it's

2398
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:19,359
like

2399
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,719
it's like again if the aliens showed up

2400
01:16:19,359 --> 01:16:23,679
it's like the obvious

2401
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,960
thing to do is like what's the popular

2402
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:28,000
thing

2403
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:31,359
like 80 of americans support this

2404
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,640
like do that clean

2405
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:37,519
uh also do it like with

2406
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:39,039
like grace where you're able to bring

2407
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:42,560
people together not like

2408
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:45,920
in a political way but like obvious like

2409
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,920
obvious common sense way like uh

2410
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,440
just people the republicans the

2411
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,000
democrats just bring them together on a

2412
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:52,639
policy

2413
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,119
and like bold just hammer it without the

2414
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,600
dirt

2415
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,960
without the mess whatever tried to

2416
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,440
compromise just

2417
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,840
the yell with have a good twitter

2418
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:03,919
account like

2419
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,880
loud very clear we're gonna give a two

2420
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,600
thousand dollar

2421
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:09,760
stimulus check anyone who wants a

2422
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:13,440
vaccine guess a vaccine

2423
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,800
at scale would make america let's make

2424
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:17,039
america great again

2425
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,239
by manufacturing like we are

2426
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:20,479
manufacturing

2427
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:22,079
most of the world's vaccine because

2428
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:25,119
we're bad [ __ ]

2429
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,479
yeah and without maybe uh with more

2430
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:29,599
eloquence than that and

2431
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:30,158
and just do that why haven't we seen

2432
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,960
that for

2433
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:34,399
many for several presidencies because of

2434
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:36,560
coalitional politics

2435
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:37,679
and they owe something to somebody else

2436
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,560
for example

2437
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:42,800
biden has got a lot of the democratic

2438
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:45,760
constituency has to satisfy

2439
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,279
within this bill so there's gonna be a

2440
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,079
lot of [ __ ] that goes in there state and

2441
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:49,599
local aid

2442
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:51,279
um all this stuff again i'm not even

2443
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,159
saying this is bad but he's like

2444
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:54,559
his theory is and this isn't wrong is

2445
01:17:54,158 --> 01:17:56,000
like

2446
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,400
we're gonna take the really popular

2447
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,359
stuff and use it as cover for the more

2448
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:02,639
downwardly

2449
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:03,519
less popular and so the dems could face

2450
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,360
the accusation

2451
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,560
the people who are on this side this is

2452
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:08,639
their push back to me they're like

2453
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,600
why would we give away the most popular

2454
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,199
thing in the bill

2455
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,120
and then we would never be able to pass

2456
01:18:11,198 --> 01:18:14,960
state and local aid right

2457
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:16,319
why would we do that and the republicans

2458
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,920
are the same thing right like

2459
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,519
mitch mcconnell because he's a [ __ ]

2460
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,719
idiot decided to say

2461
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,880
we're gonna pair these two thousand

2462
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:23,920
dollar stimulus checks with like section

2463
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,840
230 repeal

2464
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,440
it was like oh it's obviously dead right

2465
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,679
like it's not gonna happen

2466
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:30,960
together that's largely why i believe

2467
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,279
trump lost the election

2468
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,039
and why those races down in georgia went

2469
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:37,439
the way that they did obviously trump

2470
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:38,399
had something to do with it but the

2471
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:39,919
reason why is

2472
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:41,359
they have long-standing things that

2473
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,440
they've wanted to get done and in the

2474
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:44,639
words of rahm emanuel never let a good

2475
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:46,399
crisis go to waste

2476
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,960
and try and get as much as you possibly

2477
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:51,920
can done within a single bill

2478
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:53,520
my counter would be this things have

2479
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,079
worked this way for too long

2480
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,120
which is that the reconciliation bill is

2481
01:18:56,079 --> 01:19:00,800
almost certainly

2482
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:02,719
going to be the only large signature

2483
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,400
legislative accomplishment of the biden

2484
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:05,279
presidency that's just how american

2485
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:08,000
politics works

2486
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:09,840
maybe he gets one more maybe one he gets

2487
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,600
a second reconciliation bill

2488
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,679
then you're running for midterms it's

2489
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,159
over i believe

2490
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:17,279
that by trying to change the paradigm of

2491
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:19,119
our politics

2492
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:22,238
leaning into exactly what i'm talking

2493
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:25,039
here you could possibly transcend that

2494
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:26,158
to a new one and i'm not naive i think

2495
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:27,600
people respond

2496
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:29,359
to political pressures and the way that

2497
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:32,400
we found this out

2498
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:34,880
was david perdue who was just a total

2499
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:36,639
corporate you know dollar jor dollar

2500
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,039
general ceo guy

2501
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,079
he was against the original 1200

2502
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:41,840
stimulus checks

2503
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,119
but then trump came out who's the single

2504
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,600
most popular figure in the republican

2505
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:44,719
party

2506
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,719
he's like i want two thousand dollar

2507
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:49,600
stimulus checks and all of a sudden

2508
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:51,840
purdue running in georgia is like yeah

2509
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:54,480
i'm with president trump i want a 2

2510
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,880
000 stimulus check that was if you're an

2511
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:58,879
astute observer of politics to say

2512
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,560
you can see there that you can force

2513
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,880
people to do the right thing

2514
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,159
because it's the popular thing and that

2515
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,079
if it's clean

2516
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:07,359
if you don't give them any other excuse

2517
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:09,519
they have to do it

2518
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:12,079
yeah so this is this is what we've been

2519
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:13,120
gaslit into our culture war framework of

2520
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:16,559
politics

2521
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:17,279
and the reason it feels so broken and

2522
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,480
awful

2523
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:22,639
is because it is but there is a way out

2524
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:24,319
it's just that nobody wants to be it's a

2525
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:26,000
game of chicken right because maybe it

2526
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,319
is true maybe we would never be able to

2527
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,840
get

2528
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:29,679
your other democratic priorities or

2529
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,279
republican priorities but i think that

2530
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:34,158
the country understands

2531
01:20:31,279 --> 01:20:36,000
that this is [ __ ] terrible and would

2532
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:36,879
be willing to support somebody who does

2533
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,880
it differently

2534
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,800
there's just a lot of disincentives to

2535
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:43,520
not stay without

2536
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,800
there's a lot of incentives to not stray

2537
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,920
from the traditional path

2538
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:51,199
yeah is it also possible that

2539
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:54,480
the a students are not participating

2540
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:56,079
like we drove all the the superstars

2541
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:57,759
away from politics

2542
01:20:56,079 --> 01:21:01,439
so like you just had this argument

2543
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:05,119
before i mean everything you're saying

2544
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:07,759
sort of uh rings

2545
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:08,399
true like this is the obvious thing to

2546
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,079
do

2547
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:11,679
as a student of history you can almost

2548
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:14,238
like tell like

2549
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:15,679
if you look at great people in history

2550
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:16,959
this is what great leaders in history

2551
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:20,319
this is what they did

2552
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:23,760
it's like uh clean bold

2553
01:21:20,319 --> 01:21:25,279
action uh sometimes facing crisis but

2554
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,360
we're facing a crisis no we're in a

2555
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:30,399
christ

2556
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:32,799
so why don't we uh

2557
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:34,158
uh why don't we see those leaders step

2558
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,079
up that's i mean

2559
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:37,519
you say that's kind of like it makes

2560
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:39,119
sense there's a lot of different

2561
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,719
interests to play

2562
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:43,198
you don't want to risk too many things

2563
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:46,239
so on so forth but that's what like

2564
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:47,279
that sounds like the c students i don't

2565
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:49,198
think it's that

2566
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:51,039
i think it's that the pipeline of

2567
01:21:49,198 --> 01:21:53,439
politician creation

2568
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,158
is just totally broken from beginning to

2569
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:56,638
end

2570
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:57,439
so it's not that ace students don't want

2571
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,480
to be

2572
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:01,119
uh politicians it's basically the way

2573
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:04,000
that our

2574
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:05,679
current primary system is constructed is

2575
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,039
what is the greatest threat to you as a

2576
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:10,319
member of congress

2577
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:13,600
it's not losing your reelection

2578
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:15,198
it's losing your primary right so that

2579
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,360
means especially in a safe

2580
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:18,960
district you're most concerned about

2581
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:19,599
being hit if you're a republican from

2582
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,359
the right

2583
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,719
if you're a democrat from the left for

2584
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:25,439
not being a good enough one

2585
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:27,198
that's actually what stops people more

2586
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:28,799
heterodox people in particular

2587
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:30,638
from winning primaries because the

2588
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,719
people who vote in our primaries

2589
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:34,319
are the party faithful that's how you

2590
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:35,600
get the production

2591
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:37,439
the production it's important to

2592
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,560
understand the production pipeline which

2593
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:39,919
is that

2594
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,080
all right i'm from texas so that's what

2595
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,880
i know best so it's like if you think in

2596
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:45,119
texas

2597
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,000
if you're a more heterodox like state

2598
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:47,599
legislature

2599
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,679
or something who's real works with the

2600
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,280
left on this and does that

2601
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:52,960
you're going to get your ass beat in a

2602
01:22:51,279 --> 01:22:55,519
republican primary because they're going

2603
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:57,679
to be like he worked with the left to do

2604
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,719
this blah blah take it out of context

2605
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:01,520
and you're screwed

2606
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:03,119
and then that means you never ascend up

2607
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,440
the next level of the ladder

2608
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:06,880
and then so on and so forth all the way

2609
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,638
but i do think

2610
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,719
trump changed everything this is why i

2611
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:14,000
have some hope which is that

2612
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:14,719
he showed me that all the people i

2613
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,719
listened to

2614
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,920
were totally wrong about politics and

2615
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,800
that's the most valuable lesson you

2616
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,119
could ever teach me

2617
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,400
which was i was like wait i don't have

2618
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:24,079
to listen to these people

2619
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:26,079
they don't know anything actually you

2620
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:27,679
know yeah that's that's powerful man

2621
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:30,319
like he did it that's exceptionally

2622
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:33,119
powerful this guy even if he didn't

2623
01:23:30,319 --> 01:23:33,439
do anything with it it doesn't matter

2624
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:35,840
right

2625
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:36,638
he showed that it's possible exactly and

2626
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,039
that

2627
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,679
that means uh that means a lot that

2628
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:41,119
means

2629
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,960
you're absolutely right there's young

2630
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:45,519
people right now that kind of look

2631
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,359
turn around like huh you're like wait i

2632
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,760
don't have to comb my hair a certain way

2633
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:50,319
yeah

2634
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,239
and go to law school and be an [ __ ]

2635
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:54,158
who everybody knows is an [ __ ] yeah

2636
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:55,678
and and then get elected to state

2637
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:58,158
legislature i mean look

2638
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:59,600
who's the number one person in the new

2639
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:02,399
york prime or new york city

2640
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,039
uh primary right now andrew yang he's

2641
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:05,439
polling

2642
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:07,119
higher than everybody else in the race i

2643
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:08,479
look maybe the polls are totally [ __ ]

2644
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:10,319
and maybe he'll lose because of ranked

2645
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:11,839
choice voting and all that but i

2646
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:13,039
consider andrew i mean i know him a

2647
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,880
little bit and i've you know followed

2648
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:17,279
his candidacy from the very beginning

2649
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,239
i consider him an inspiration he's the

2650
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:20,559
new

2651
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:21,599
generation of politics like if i see

2652
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,760
who's going to be president

2653
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,880
20 years from now it's going to be i'm

2654
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,079
not saying it's going to be andrew yang

2655
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,000
i think it'll be somebody

2656
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:30,559
like andrew yang outside the political

2657
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,119
system who talks in a totally different

2658
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,520
way

2659
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:34,719
right just a completely one of my

2660
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,679
favorite things that he said on the

2661
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:38,000
debate stage he's like

2662
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:39,440
look at us we're all wearing makeup it's

2663
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,679
cr you know yeah

2664
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,198
he like he like brought that that he

2665
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:44,560
brought that and he's writing like yeah

2666
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:46,638
why are they're all wearing makeup he

2667
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,280
probably arguably hasn't gone far enough

2668
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:49,920
almost

2669
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:50,559
yes uh but he showed that as possible

2670
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,800
and then

2671
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,159
you you see other like aoc is a good

2672
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,279
example of somebody at least in my

2673
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:56,879
opinion

2674
01:24:55,279 --> 01:24:58,639
is doing the same kind of thing but

2675
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,719
going too far

2676
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:02,239
in like well i don't know she's doing

2677
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:03,279
the trump thing but on the other side so

2678
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:05,678
i don't know

2679
01:25:03,279 --> 01:25:06,719
what's too far don't know judgment of it

2680
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:07,279
yeah i will tell you the future of

2681
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,359
politics

2682
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:11,359
appreciate the art of it right no i do

2683
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:14,479
look i don't i'm not a big aoc

2684
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:15,839
fan but she's a genius media genius once

2685
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:19,039
in a generation talent

2686
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,560
the way that she uses social media

2687
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:22,238
instagram and everybody on the right is

2688
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,199
like trying to copy her like matt gates

2689
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:24,718
like i want to be the

2690
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:26,719
conservative aoc i'm like it's just not

2691
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,560
gonna happen dude like it you just don't

2692
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,840
have it like what she has it's like it's

2693
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:32,560
electric

2694
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,520
and trump had that like i've been to a

2695
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,760
trump rally

2696
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,560
like to cover as a journalist there's

2697
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:39,199
nothing like it

2698
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,039
in america and yang is similar it's the

2699
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:42,960
same way where you're like there is

2700
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:45,198
something going on here

2701
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:47,198
which is just like i've been to an obama

2702
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:50,638
rally i've been to a clinton rally

2703
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:54,079
i've been to um several normal politics

2704
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:54,560
that's fine you know with trump and with

2705
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:56,319
yang

2706
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,760
it was it's another world yeah it's

2707
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:59,198
another world yeah

2708
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,400
there's there's probably thousands of

2709
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:01,359
people listening right now who are just

2710
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:04,479
like doing a

2711
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:08,639
yes slow clap yes i know i know

2712
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:11,039
uh yang gang uh forever okay but uh

2713
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:11,920
yeah i mean my worst fear i i prefer

2714
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:14,960
yeah uh

2715
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:18,158
uh andrew yang kind of

2716
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:21,520
free uh improvisational

2717
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:24,559
idea exchange all that versus aoc

2718
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,280
who i think no matter what she stands

2719
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,400
for

2720
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:30,238
is a drama machine creates dramas just

2721
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:31,119
like trump does i would say my worst

2722
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:34,238
fear

2723
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:36,559
would be in 2024 is aoc old enough

2724
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:37,759
it'd be aoc versus trump i don't think

2725
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,639
she's old enough i think you'd have to

2726
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,320
be

2727
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,679
i think she's 30 so she needs five more

2728
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:43,840
years so probably not

2729
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:46,079
yeah okay but that kind of yeah that

2730
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,760
that's or trump jr well aoc probably

2731
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:48,960
wouldn't win a democratic primary so i

2732
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,800
mean look joe biden is

2733
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,319
you know that's pretty much showed that

2734
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,079
that's exactly what you're saying yeah

2735
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:56,559
this process grooms you

2736
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:58,238
over time it's you see the same thing in

2737
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,840
academia actually which is very

2738
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:02,319
interesting

2739
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,760
is the the process of getting tenure

2740
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:06,880
there's this

2741
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:10,639
it's like you're being taught

2742
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:12,960
without explicitly being taught yes

2743
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,319
to behave in the way that everybody's

2744
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,000
behaved before

2745
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:17,679
i've heard this it was funny i've had a

2746
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,039
few conversations

2747
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:23,440
that um were deeply disappointing

2748
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:25,039
which which are which involved

2749
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:28,000
statements like

2750
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:29,920
this is what's good for your career yes

2751
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,279
this kind of conversation almost like

2752
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:35,359
mentor to mentee conversation

2753
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:36,880
or it's you know it's like there's a

2754
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:38,880
grooming process in the same way i guess

2755
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:40,960
you're saying the primary process

2756
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,159
does the same kind of thing so i mean

2757
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,639
that's what people have talked about

2758
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:44,960
with andre

2759
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:46,239
yang it was uh it was he was being

2760
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,480
suppressed by a bunch of different

2761
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:50,399
forces the mainstream media and all

2762
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:51,678
just the democratic just that whole

2763
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:54,638
process didn't

2764
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:56,158
didn't like the the honesty that he was

2765
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:57,279
showing right for now but here's my

2766
01:27:56,158 --> 01:27:59,519
question to you

2767
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:00,559
people got to see look jordan peterson

2768
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,280
is one of the most famous people in

2769
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,520
america

2770
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:04,960
right like you have a massive podcast

2771
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:08,000
you're more famous than half the

2772
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:10,000
99 of the people at mit so like

2773
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,198
from that perspective everything has

2774
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,960
changed and

2775
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:14,319
somewhere out there there's a student

2776
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,920
who's taking notice

2777
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:17,519
and i've noticed that with my own career

2778
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,480
everybody thought i was crazy for doing

2779
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,600
the show with crystal

2780
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:21,279
the hill they thought it was nuts

2781
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,880
they're like what are you doing you're a

2782
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:23,439
white house correspondent you've got a

2783
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,679
job

2784
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:27,198
forever the other job offer i had was

2785
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,679
being a white house correspondent

2786
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:30,799
and people thought i was nuts for not

2787
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:34,079
just sticking there

2788
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:37,119
and you know aging out within washington

2789
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:38,079
pining for appearances on fox news and

2790
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:41,119
cnn and

2791
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:42,880
msnbc but i hated it i just hated doing

2792
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:44,479
it and i did not want to be a company

2793
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,359
man like a washington man who's one of

2794
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:47,198
those guys

2795
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:48,799
who like brags to his friends about how

2796
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:50,879
many times he's been on fox

2797
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,400
or whatever mostly because i just have a

2798
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,679
rebellious streak and i hate being at

2799
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:56,079
the subject of

2800
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:57,279
other people i created something new

2801
01:28:56,079 --> 01:29:00,000
which a lot of people watch

2802
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:01,119
to get their news and i notice that

2803
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,520
younger people who are

2804
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:05,039
almost all my audience they don't really

2805
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,600
look up to any of the people in

2806
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:07,760
traditional

2807
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:09,039
right they don't they don't go and

2808
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,719
they're not coming up and being like how

2809
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:12,399
do i be like jim acosta

2810
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:14,079
you know they're like they're like hey

2811
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:16,079
how did you do what you do and the way

2812
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:19,439
you did it is by bucking the system

2813
01:29:16,079 --> 01:29:21,359
yeah so i think that we are at a total

2814
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:23,439
split point and look there will always

2815
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:24,960
be a path for people

2816
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:26,559
because like i don't want people to over

2817
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,679
learn this lesson i have people who are

2818
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,639
like i'm not going to go to college and

2819
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:30,639
i'm like well

2820
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:32,239
just wait yeah like i'm like just i'm

2821
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:35,119
starting yeah like stop

2822
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:36,399
just like just hold on a second but

2823
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:37,119
there will always be a path for the

2824
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:38,719
institutional

2825
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:40,800
there will that will always be there for

2826
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:42,319
you but now there's something else

2827
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,840
now there's another game in town and

2828
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:45,759
that's more appealing to

2829
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,520
millions and millions and millions and

2830
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:51,039
millions of people who feel

2831
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:53,120
unserved by the corporate media cnn

2832
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:54,079
and these people possibly who feel

2833
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:56,639
unserved

2834
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:57,359
um in the you know the faculty like if

2835
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:59,920
you are

2836
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:00,559
an up and comer who wants to teach as

2837
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,880
many

2838
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,159
young people as possible i think you

2839
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,760
should be on youtube

2840
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:07,839
right like look at the khan academy guy

2841
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,480
that guy created a huge business

2842
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:12,560
so i just think we can be cynical and

2843
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:13,839
like upset about what that system is but

2844
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,760
we should also have hope

2845
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,679
like i have a lot of hope for what can

2846
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,199
be in the future yeah there's a there's

2847
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:20,480
a guy people should check out so

2848
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:22,719
my story is a little bit different

2849
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:26,718
because i basically uh

2850
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:28,239
stepped aside with the dream of being an

2851
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:31,279
entrepreneur

2852
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:31,678
earlier in the pipeline than like a like

2853
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:34,238
a

2854
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:35,520
legitimate like senior faculty would

2855
01:30:34,238 --> 01:30:37,599
there's an example somebody

2856
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,080
people should check out andrew huberman

2857
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:42,800
from stanford who's a neuroscientist

2858
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:43,359
who's as world-class as it gets in terms

2859
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:46,719
of like

2860
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:49,119
10-year faculty just a really

2861
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:50,000
world-class researcher and now he's

2862
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:51,760
doing youtube

2863
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,039
yeah i see him on instagram yeah and

2864
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,119
he's great so he switched

2865
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,639
so he not just does instagram he now has

2866
01:30:55,119 --> 01:30:59,198
a podcast

2867
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:00,319
and he's doing he's changing the nature

2868
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:02,638
of like

2869
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:04,639
i believe that andrew might be the

2870
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:07,679
future of stanford

2871
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:09,760
and for a lot it's funny like he's

2872
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:11,359
basically joe rogan is an inspiration to

2873
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,520
andrew

2874
01:31:11,359 --> 01:31:15,119
and and to me as well and so those

2875
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,760
ripple effects and andrew is an

2876
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:17,279
inspiration

2877
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,800
probably just like you're saying to

2878
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:21,359
these young like

2879
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,800
25 year olds who are soon to become

2880
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:23,679
faculty if we're just talking about

2881
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,440
academia

2882
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:27,840
and the same is probably happening with

2883
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:31,439
with government is

2884
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:33,520
funny enough trump probably is inspiring

2885
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:34,879
a huge number of people who are saying

2886
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:36,560
wait a minute i don't have to play by

2887
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:39,440
the rules exactly and i

2888
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,840
have to i can think outside the box here

2889
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:41,919
and

2890
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,480
you're right and the institutions we're

2891
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:47,920
seeing are just probably lagging behind

2892
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:49,519
so the optimistic view is the future

2893
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,440
is going to be full of exciting new

2894
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,400
ideas so andrew young is just kind of

2895
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,279
the beginning of this

2896
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:56,238
tip of the iceberg and i hope that

2897
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:57,920
iceberg doesn't

2898
01:31:56,238 --> 01:31:59,439
it's not this influencer one of the

2899
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:02,239
things that really

2900
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:04,319
bothers me yeah i've gotten a chance no

2901
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:04,638
i should be careful here i don't wanna i

2902
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:07,599
love

2903
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:09,039
everybody but you know these people who

2904
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,039
talk about like

2905
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:13,119
you know how to make your first million

2906
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:16,399
or how to succeed and

2907
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:20,238
and they're so i mean yeah that

2908
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:23,599
that makes me a little bit cynical

2909
01:32:20,238 --> 01:32:25,279
about uh i'm worried that the people

2910
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:28,560
that win the game of politics

2911
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:29,599
will be ones that want to win the game

2912
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,760
of politics

2913
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,280
they already are man and like we

2914
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:36,480
mentioned alc

2915
01:32:33,279 --> 01:32:39,679
it's i hope they optimize for the

2916
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:40,399
80 populist thing right like they

2917
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,880
optimized

2918
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:44,960
for that badass thing that history will

2919
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,319
remember you as the great man or woman

2920
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:49,359
that did this thing

2921
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:49,840
versus how do i maximize engagement

2922
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:52,158
today

2923
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,039
and keep growing those numbers the the

2924
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:56,319
influencers

2925
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:58,079
are so i'm so allergic to this man

2926
01:32:56,319 --> 01:32:59,920
they keep saying how many followers they

2927
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:03,279
have on the different accounts

2928
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:04,319
and it's like i i don't think they

2929
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:06,158
understand

2930
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:07,599
maybe i don't understand i don't really

2931
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:11,439
care

2932
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:13,360
i think it has destructive psychological

2933
01:33:11,439 --> 01:33:15,599
effects

2934
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:17,679
one like thinking about the number like

2935
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:20,719
getting excited your number one from

2936
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:23,840
100 to 101 and being like

2937
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:25,840
and today went out to 105. whoa that's a

2938
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,360
big jump that maybe like thinking this

2939
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:30,239
way like i wonder what i did

2940
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:31,920
i'll do that again in this way one it's

2941
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:34,000
uh it creates anxiety almost

2942
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:36,399
psychological effects whatever

2943
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,359
the the more important thing is it

2944
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:40,719
prevents you from

2945
01:33:37,359 --> 01:33:43,599
truly thinking boldly

2946
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:44,560
in the long arc of history in uh

2947
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,639
creatively

2948
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,840
thinking outside the box doing huge

2949
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:50,159
actions

2950
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,960
and i actually up my optimism is in the

2951
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:52,960
sense that

2952
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,239
that kind of action will beat out all

2953
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,880
the influencers

2954
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:57,759
well i don't know lex this is where my

2955
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,400
cynicism comes

2956
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,280
in so there's a guy madison cawthorne

2957
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:04,319
the youngest member

2958
01:34:01,279 --> 01:34:05,840
of congress um and he

2959
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:08,079
i don't want to say god caught but there

2960
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:11,440
was like an email where he was like

2961
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:12,880
my staff is only oriented around comms

2962
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:14,719
like he was basically saying he got

2963
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:18,000
basically like

2964
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:21,119
my staff is only uh centered on

2965
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:23,760
communications and that's the right play

2966
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:25,599
if you do want to get the benefits of

2967
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,679
our current electoral political

2968
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:29,120
and engagement system which is that

2969
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,119
what's the best way to be known

2970
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:33,039
within the right as a as a right-wing

2971
01:34:31,119 --> 01:34:35,599
politician it's to be

2972
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:36,639
a culture warrior go on ben shapiro's

2973
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:39,280
podcast

2974
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:41,600
be one of the people on fox news go on

2975
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:44,079
sean hannity's show go on tucker's show

2976
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,039
and all that because you become a mini

2977
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:48,158
celebrity

2978
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:50,238
within that world left unsaid is that

2979
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:51,920
that world is increasingly shrinking

2980
01:34:50,238 --> 01:34:54,158
portion of the american population

2981
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:55,520
and they barely they can't even win a

2982
01:34:54,158 --> 01:34:58,079
popular vote election

2983
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:59,520
um let alone barely win and eek out an

2984
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:03,519
electoral college victory

2985
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:04,480
in 2016. well but the incentives are all

2986
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,000
aligned within that

2987
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:08,559
and it's the same thing really on the

2988
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,399
left but you're right which is that

2989
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,639
ultimate look this is this is why

2990
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:15,759
geniuses are geniuses because they buck

2991
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:16,719
the short-term incentives they focus on

2992
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,600
the long-term

2993
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,480
they bet big and they usually fail but

2994
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:24,480
then when they get

2995
01:35:20,479 --> 01:35:26,879
big they uh succeed spectacularly yeah

2996
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:28,238
the people i know who have done this the

2997
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,920
best are like

2998
01:35:28,238 --> 01:35:31,439
a lot of the crypto folks that i've

2999
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,800
spoken to like

3000
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:34,399
some of the stuff they say i'm like i

3001
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,800
don't know if that's going to happen but

3002
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:39,759
look they're like billionaires right

3003
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,440
yeah and you're like so they were wrong

3004
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,520
the way i've heard it expressed is

3005
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:44,879
you can be wrong a lot but when you're

3006
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,199
right you get right

3007
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,079
big and i mean i've seen this on my

3008
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:52,158
career i mean he

3009
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:54,238
took spectacular risk like spectacular

3010
01:35:52,158 --> 01:35:56,079
risk and just double down double down

3011
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:57,919
double down double down double down

3012
01:35:56,079 --> 01:35:59,359
and you can kind of tell to him i mean

3013
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,118
you know him better than i do but like

3014
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:02,559
for my observation i don't think the

3015
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:04,960
money matters

3016
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,960
as right i just i like when i see him

3017
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,359
i'm like i don't it's

3018
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,800
nobody works as hard as you do and

3019
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:12,719
builds the way that you build

3020
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,920
if it's just about the money it just it

3021
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:17,279
just doesn't happen like

3022
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:18,880
nobody wills spacex into existence

3023
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:20,319
just for the money like it's not worth

3024
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,239
it frankly right like he probably

3025
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:24,559
destroyed years of his life and like

3026
01:36:22,238 --> 01:36:25,519
mental sanity money or attention or fame

3027
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,880
none of that yeah

3028
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,880
that's not the primary priority well

3029
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,719
that's what's so appealing to me to me

3030
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,480
in particular about him just like in how

3031
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:33,760
he built like i read a biography of him

3032
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:35,439
and just like the way that he

3033
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:37,199
constructed his life and like is

3034
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:38,479
able to hyper focus and meeting after

3035
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:40,559
meeting and drill down

3036
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:41,519
and also hire all the right people who

3037
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,679
execute

3038
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,639
each one of his tasks discreetly to his

3039
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,279
perfection

3040
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:48,400
is amazing like that's actually the mark

3041
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:50,479
of a good leader

3042
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:52,079
but i mean if you think about his career

3043
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:53,839
the reason he's a renegade is because

3044
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:55,600
probably he was told to like put it in

3045
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,279
an index fund or whatever like whenever

3046
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,880
he made his like 29 million

3047
01:36:57,279 --> 01:37:00,559
and from paypal i don't know how much he

3048
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,199
made and then just go along that run

3049
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,080
he's like no

3050
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:05,599
so he you know succeeds spectacularly so

3051
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:07,679
you have to have somebody

3052
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,800
who's willing to come in and buck that

3053
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:10,880
system so for

3054
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,960
for for now i think our politics are

3055
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:15,840
generally frozen i think that

3056
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,719
that model is going to be most generally

3057
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,440
appealing

3058
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:20,560
to the mean person but somebody will

3059
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:21,839
come along and we'll change everything

3060
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,719
yeah i'm just surprised there's not more

3061
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:26,079
of them

3062
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:29,118
yeah on on that topic uh it's now

3063
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:30,719
20 what is it 21 yes let's

3064
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:34,880
let's make some predictions he can be

3065
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:37,760
wrong about good what major

3066
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:39,118
political people are you thinking will

3067
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:42,480
run in 2024

3068
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:46,000
including trump junior senior mm-hmm

3069
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:49,919
or ivanka i don't know

3070
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:53,039
any trump trump uh

3071
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,760
and uh who do you think wins i think joe

3072
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:56,479
biden

3073
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,239
will run again in 2024 and i think he

3074
01:37:56,479 --> 01:38:01,279
will run against someone with the last

3075
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:04,319
name trump i do not know whether that

3076
01:38:01,279 --> 01:38:05,359
is trump or trump jr uh but i think one

3077
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:07,279
of those people

3078
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:08,799
will probably be the gop nominee in

3079
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:10,800
2024. who was it

3080
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,079
some prominent political figure was it

3081
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,400
romney somebody like that

3082
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:15,519
said that trump will win the primary if

3083
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:17,198
he runs again of course

3084
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,960
that's not even a question trump is the

3085
01:38:17,198 --> 01:38:22,799
single most popular figure

3086
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:25,279
in the republican party by orders of max

3087
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,800
oh i mean probably more honestly there

3088
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:27,519
was a actually i can tell you because i

3089
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:30,480
saw the data

3090
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:31,600
which is that pre-january 6th it was

3091
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:33,678
like 54

3092
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,960
of republicans wanted him to run again

3093
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,679
then it went down

3094
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,239
eight points after january six two days

3095
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:40,239
later

3096
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:42,238
and then after impeachment it went right

3097
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:45,759
back up to 54

3098
01:38:42,238 --> 01:38:48,319
so the exact same number is in

3099
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:49,360
february at post impeachment vote as it

3100
01:38:48,319 --> 01:38:51,519
was after

3101
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:52,960
november now look yeah again surveys

3102
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,159
[ __ ] etc but like

3103
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,800
that's all the data we have that's what

3104
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:57,679
i can point to if trump runs he will be

3105
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,760
the nominee

3106
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:00,719
and he will be he will be the 2024

3107
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,719
nominee

3108
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:04,000
i just don't know if he wants to it it

3109
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:06,639
really depends like

3110
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,439
do you think he wins after the trump

3111
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:10,079
vaccine

3112
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:11,919
heals all of us do you think trump wins

3113
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:13,600
it depends on how popular culture

3114
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,039
functions over the next four years and i

3115
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,159
can tell you that they are

3116
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:18,079
because i don't think biden has that

3117
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:20,960
much to do with it because again

3118
01:39:18,079 --> 01:39:22,960
trump is not a manifestation of an

3119
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:26,480
affirmative policy action

3120
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:29,600
it is a defensive wall

3121
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:31,599
against cultural liberalism at its best

3122
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:33,199
so it's like this is why it doesn't

3123
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:36,320
matter what biden does

3124
01:39:33,198 --> 01:39:39,678
if there are more riots if there is

3125
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:42,158
a more sense of persecution amongst

3126
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:43,600
people who are more lean towards

3127
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:45,679
conservative or like hey

3128
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,800
i don't know about that that's crazy

3129
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:49,039
then he

3130
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,320
very well could win let's okay let's say

3131
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:51,760
joe biden doesn't run and they put up

3132
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:52,559
like kamala harris i think he would i

3133
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,480
think he would beat her

3134
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,840
and i i don't think there's a question

3135
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:57,839
that trump would beat kamala harris in

3136
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,600
2024.

3137
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,360
and you don't think anybody else i don't

3138
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,800
know how the the process works you don't

3139
01:40:01,359 --> 01:40:03,599
think anybody else on the democratic

3140
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,760
side can uh

3141
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,199
take the well how could you run against

3142
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:09,199
the sitting vice president

3143
01:40:07,198 --> 01:40:11,198
you know it's like if joe joe biden has

3144
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:13,519
a 98 approval rating

3145
01:40:11,198 --> 01:40:14,559
in the democratic party if he says she

3146
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,239
is my heir

3147
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:17,760
i think enough people will listen to him

3148
01:40:16,238 --> 01:40:19,359
in a competitive primary

3149
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:21,119
or a non-competitive primary and then

3150
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:22,960
there's all these things about how

3151
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:24,880
primary systems themselves are rigged

3152
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,880
the dnc could make it known

3153
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:29,118
that they'll blacklist anybody who does

3154
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:31,840
try and primary kamala harris

3155
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:33,359
um and look i mean progressives aren't

3156
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:35,440
necessarily all that popular

3157
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:37,599
amongst actual democrats like we found

3158
01:40:35,439 --> 01:40:39,599
that out um during the election

3159
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:41,360
there's an entire constituency which

3160
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,239
loves joe biden and joe biden level

3161
01:40:41,359 --> 01:40:43,599
politics

3162
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:45,759
and so if he tells them to vote for

3163
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,960
kamala i think i think she would

3164
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,119
probably get it

3165
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,000
but again there's a lot of game theory

3166
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:52,158
obviously happening but

3167
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,279
see i think you're talking about

3168
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:56,000
everything you're saying is

3169
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:57,279
correct about mediocre candidates it

3170
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,439
feels like

3171
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:00,880
if there's somebody like a really strong

3172
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:02,238
i don't want to use this term

3173
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,279
incorrectly but populist

3174
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:08,799
somebody that speaks to the the 80

3175
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:13,039
that's is able to provide

3176
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:15,360
bold eloquently described

3177
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:17,039
solutions that are popular i think that

3178
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:18,559
breaks through all of this nonsense

3179
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:20,319
how how do they break through the

3180
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:22,400
primary system because the problem is

3181
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:24,719
the primary system is not populism

3182
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:26,399
it's primaries so it's like but you

3183
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:28,880
don't think they can tweet

3184
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:30,638
their way to well you have to be willing

3185
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:33,440
to win a gop primary

3186
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:35,520
you basically have to be at whoever wins

3187
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:37,599
the gop primary in my opinion will be

3188
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:39,199
the person most hated by the left

3189
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:41,119
one of the people things that people

3190
01:41:39,198 --> 01:41:41,759
forget is you know who came in second to

3191
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:44,238
trump

3192
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,880
ted cruz and the reason why is because

3193
01:41:44,238 --> 01:41:49,759
ted cruz was the second most hated guy

3194
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:51,440
by liberals in america a second to trump

3195
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,520
they have nothing in policy in common

3196
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:56,238
but don't you think this kind of

3197
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:58,000
brilliantly described system of hate

3198
01:41:56,238 --> 01:42:01,198
being the

3199
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,079
the main mechanism of our electoral

3200
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,519
choices yeah

3201
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:06,000
don't you think that just has to do with

3202
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:09,760
mediocre candidates like

3203
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:11,600
it like it's basically the field of

3204
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,560
candidates including trump including

3205
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:15,280
everybody

3206
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:16,480
was just like didn't make anyone feel

3207
01:42:15,279 --> 01:42:18,479
great right

3208
01:42:16,479 --> 01:42:19,678
it's like really this is what we have to

3209
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:23,118
choose from

3210
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:27,679
maybe a mark cuban or like

3211
01:42:23,118 --> 01:42:28,960
uh mark cuban is a democrat or

3212
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:30,319
it would have to be somebody like that

3213
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,840
somebody who because here's the thing

3214
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:32,319
about trump it's not just that it was

3215
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,560
trump

3216
01:42:32,319 --> 01:42:36,319
he was so [ __ ] famous like people

3217
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:39,440
don't realize he was so

3218
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:40,238
famous like i even when i first met

3219
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:41,919
trump i met

3220
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:43,519
a couple of other presidents but when i

3221
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,960
met trump even i felt like

3222
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:47,280
kind of star struck because i was like

3223
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:50,319
yo this is the guy from the apprentice

3224
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:52,559
yeah i'm like this is the dude yeah

3225
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:54,479
like because i'm like my dad and i used

3226
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,080
to sit and watch the apprentice when i

3227
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:57,519
was in high school and then one of the

3228
01:42:56,079 --> 01:42:59,359
guys was from college station where i

3229
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,199
grew up and were like oh my god like

3230
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:02,880
that guy's on the apprentice like it was

3231
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:04,079
a phenomenon there's like that level

3232
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,239
it's kind of like when i met joe rogan

3233
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:07,840
i'm like holy [ __ ] that's yeah

3234
01:43:06,238 --> 01:43:10,000
that's i don't feel that way when i meet

3235
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,639
mitt romney or tom cotton or josh hall i

3236
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,079
met all of them

3237
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:12,960
um but there's a lot of celebrities

3238
01:43:12,079 --> 01:43:14,158
right do you think there's some

3239
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,118
celebrities we're not even thinking

3240
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:18,158
about that could step

3241
01:43:15,118 --> 01:43:19,679
in the rock so i was about to say i

3242
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:21,198
think the rock could do it but

3243
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:23,600
does he want to do it i mean it's

3244
01:43:21,198 --> 01:43:25,919
terrible like it's terrible gig

3245
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:27,840
it's very hard to do i don't know if the

3246
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:30,079
rock necessarily has like

3247
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:31,520
the formed policy agenda because then

3248
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:33,118
here's the other problem what what if we

3249
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,719
set ourselves up for a system where like

3250
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:36,158
these people keep winning but like with

3251
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:36,880
trump they have no idea how to run a

3252
01:43:36,158 --> 01:43:38,719
government

3253
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:40,880
it's actually really hard right and you

3254
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:43,600
have to have the know-how and the trust

3255
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:45,199
to find the right people this is this is

3256
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,960
where the genius

3257
01:43:45,198 --> 01:43:48,399
element comes in is you have to

3258
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,760
understand that front

3259
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:52,799
and you have to understand how to

3260
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:55,600
execute discrete tasks like

3261
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,000
this is the fdr this is why it's so hard

3262
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,760
like

3263
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:01,279
fdr lincoln tr they were who they were

3264
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:04,560
and they live in history and

3265
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:06,559
their name rings like for a reason and

3266
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,480
yeah i mean one of the most depressing

3267
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:11,760
lessons i got from 2020

3268
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:14,638
is it almost it seems like in my opinion

3269
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:16,400
that we over learn the lesson of our

3270
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:18,560
success and not of our failures

3271
01:44:16,399 --> 01:44:19,439
for example like we have this narrative

3272
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:21,840
in our head

3273
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:22,799
that we always have the right person at

3274
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,880
the right time

3275
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:26,800
during crisis and in some cases it was

3276
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:30,159
true we didn't deserve lincoln

3277
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:32,079
we didn't deserve fdr we didn't deserve

3278
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:33,198
we didn't deserve a lot of presidents at

3279
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:35,840
times of crisis

3280
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:36,638
but then you're like okay george w bush

3281
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:39,279
911

3282
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:40,639
that was terrible um reconstruction

3283
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:43,599
andrew johnson

3284
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:44,400
awful right like we had several periods

3285
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:47,440
in our history

3286
01:44:44,399 --> 01:44:48,319
where the crisis was there they they

3287
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:51,359
were called

3288
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:52,799
and they did not show up and i really it

3289
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:55,839
hadn't happened

3290
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:57,360
in my lifetime except for 911 and even

3291
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:59,360
then you could kind of see

3292
01:44:57,359 --> 01:45:01,118
that as an opportunity for somebody like

3293
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:03,279
obama to come in and fix it

3294
01:45:01,118 --> 01:45:04,399
but then he didn't do it and then trump

3295
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:07,759
didn't do it

3296
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:09,118
and you realize i feel like our politics

3297
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:12,480
are most analogous

3298
01:45:09,118 --> 01:45:14,319
to like the 1910s like all

3299
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:16,479
in terms of the gilded age in terms of

3300
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:16,880
that remember there's that long period

3301
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:20,000
of

3302
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:22,400
presence between um between

3303
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,359
like lincoln and teddy roosevelt we were

3304
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:26,319
like wait like

3305
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:27,599
who's president like or or even in even

3306
01:45:26,319 --> 01:45:28,158
tr was like an exception where you'll

3307
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,960
have like

3308
01:45:28,158 --> 01:45:31,759
calvin coolidge who like silent cow so

3309
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:34,800
we're living through

3310
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:36,480
over cleveland that's kind of how i if i

3311
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:38,639
think of us within history

3312
01:45:36,479 --> 01:45:39,519
i feel like we're in one of those times

3313
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:41,118
we're just waiting

3314
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:42,639
it feels really important to us right

3315
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:44,399
now like this is the most important

3316
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:46,400
moment in history but it might be

3317
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,000
could just be a blip right 20 30 year

3318
01:45:46,399 --> 01:45:50,799
blip like when you think about

3319
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,679
who was president between 1890 and 19

3320
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:56,560
before i mean

3321
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:57,920
yeah between like 1888 and 1910

3322
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:59,679
like nobody really thinks about that

3323
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:01,279
period of america but like that was an

3324
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:02,880
entire lifetime for people

3325
01:46:01,279 --> 01:46:04,719
right like what did they how did they

3326
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,600
feel about the country that they were in

3327
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:06,880
that's hilarious

3328
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,400
that's how i kind of think about where

3329
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:10,319
we are funny to think i mean i don't

3330
01:46:08,399 --> 01:46:12,879
want to minimize it but like we haven't

3331
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:15,679
really gone through uh a world war ii

3332
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:18,000
style crisis so like

3333
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:19,118
say that there is a crisis in like

3334
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,880
several decades

3335
01:46:19,118 --> 01:46:26,079
of that level right existential risks

3336
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:28,800
to a large portion of the world

3337
01:46:26,079 --> 01:46:29,760
then what will be remembered is world

3338
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:32,480
war ii

3339
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,000
maybe a little bit about vietnam and

3340
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:35,359
then whatever that crisis is

3341
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,118
and this whole period that we see as

3342
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:40,158
dramatic even coronavirus

3343
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:41,679
even 911 even 911

3344
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:43,198
it's like because you can look at how

3345
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:44,719
many people died and all those kinds of

3346
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:46,399
things all the drama around

3347
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:47,760
the war on terror and all those kinds of

3348
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:49,839
things

3349
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:52,239
maybe obama will be remembered for being

3350
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:55,039
the first african-american president

3351
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:56,158
but then like that's yeah that's

3352
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:59,840
fascinating to think about

3353
01:46:56,158 --> 01:47:02,879
oh man even trump will be like oh

3354
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,679
okay that guy yeah like maybe he'd be

3355
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:08,159
remembered as

3356
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:10,239
the first uh celebrity

3357
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:11,519
i mean reagan was already a governor

3358
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:14,079
right yeah so

3359
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:14,800
so like the first a political celebrity

3360
01:47:14,079 --> 01:47:17,118
that was a

3361
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,840
so maybe if there's more celebrities in

3362
01:47:17,118 --> 01:47:19,279
the future

3363
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:21,520
they'll say that trump was the first

3364
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:24,158
person to pave the

3365
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:25,679
the way for celebrities to win oh man

3366
01:47:24,158 --> 01:47:28,000
yeah

3367
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:29,600
and uh yeah i still i still hold that

3368
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,600
this this era will probably be

3369
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:33,360
remembered

3370
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:35,280
the you know people say i talk about

3371
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:37,439
elon way too much but

3372
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:38,960
but the reality is like there's not many

3373
01:47:37,439 --> 01:47:39,919
people that are doing the kind of things

3374
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,880
he's doing is why

3375
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:44,960
i talk about is i think this era it's

3376
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:46,880
not necessarily elon and spacex but this

3377
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:50,399
error will be remembered by

3378
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:51,440
the new the like of the space

3379
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:53,839
exploration

3380
01:47:51,439 --> 01:47:55,678
of uh the commercial of companies

3381
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:59,679
getting into space exploration

3382
01:47:55,679 --> 01:48:01,600
of space travel and perhaps

3383
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:03,359
perhaps like artificial intelligence

3384
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,000
around social media all those kinds of

3385
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:06,158
things

3386
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,679
this might be remembered for that but

3387
01:48:06,158 --> 01:48:08,638
every all the political bickering all

3388
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:11,039
that nonsense

3389
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:12,239
that might might be very well forgotten

3390
01:48:11,039 --> 01:48:15,840
one way to think about it

3391
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:18,799
is that the internet is so young

3392
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:20,880
yeah i think about it um so jeff jarvis

3393
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:22,239
he's a media scholar i respect

3394
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,920
he's not the only person to say this but

3395
01:48:22,238 --> 01:48:25,599
many others have which is that look this

3396
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:27,840
is kind of like the printing press

3397
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,199
there was a whole 30 years war because

3398
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:31,679
of the printing press yeah

3399
01:48:29,198 --> 01:48:32,719
it took a long time for [ __ ] to sort out

3400
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:34,158
i think that's where we're at with the

3401
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:35,198
internet like at a certain level it

3402
01:48:34,158 --> 01:48:37,359
disrupts

3403
01:48:35,198 --> 01:48:39,039
everything and that's a good thing it

3404
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:41,039
can be very tumultuous

3405
01:48:39,039 --> 01:48:43,118
um i never felt like i was living

3406
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:43,519
through history until corona paris like

3407
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:45,198
you know

3408
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,880
like until we were all locked down i was

3409
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:48,879
like i'm living through history

3410
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,239
like this there's this very overused

3411
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:52,000
cliche in dc

3412
01:48:50,238 --> 01:48:53,439
where every com staffer wants you to

3413
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,118
think that what their boss just did

3414
01:48:53,439 --> 01:48:56,479
is history and i've always been like

3415
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:57,519
this isn't history this is some like

3416
01:48:56,479 --> 01:48:59,118
stupid [ __ ] bill

3417
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:00,719
you know whatever but like that was the

3418
01:48:59,118 --> 01:49:03,039
first time i was like this

3419
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:04,399
is history like this yeah right here

3420
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:08,158
well i was hoping

3421
01:49:04,399 --> 01:49:10,719
uh tragedy aside that this i wish the

3422
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:13,920
primaries happened during coronavirus

3423
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:16,480
so that we because like then we can see

3424
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:17,279
so okay here's a bunch of people facing

3425
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:18,879
crisis

3426
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:20,719
and it's an opportunity for leaders to

3427
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:23,279
step up like

3428
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:24,158
i still believe the optimistic view is

3429
01:49:23,279 --> 01:49:27,359
uh

3430
01:49:24,158 --> 01:49:30,158
the game theory of like influencers

3431
01:49:27,359 --> 01:49:31,198
will always be defeated by actual great

3432
01:49:30,158 --> 01:49:34,000
leaders

3433
01:49:31,198 --> 01:49:35,919
so like maybe the great leaders are rare

3434
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,679
but i think they're sufficiently

3435
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:39,760
out there that they will step up

3436
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:43,039
especially in the moments of crisis

3437
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:44,719
and coronavirus is is obviously a crisis

3438
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:48,479
where like

3439
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:50,560
you know mass manufacture of tests uh

3440
01:49:48,479 --> 01:49:52,399
all kinds of infrastructure building

3441
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,239
that you could have done in 2020

3442
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:56,238
there's so many possibilities for just

3443
01:49:54,238 --> 01:49:59,598
like bold action

3444
01:49:56,238 --> 01:50:01,839
and sad uh none of that

3445
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:03,279
even just forget actually doing the

3446
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:05,279
action

3447
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:07,679
advocating for it yeah just saying like

3448
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:10,158
this we need we need to do this

3449
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:11,679
and none of that like the speeches that

3450
01:50:10,158 --> 01:50:13,359
biden made

3451
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:14,719
i don't even remember a single speech

3452
01:50:13,359 --> 01:50:16,639
that bad made

3453
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:18,319
because there's zero bold i mean their

3454
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:22,000
strategy was to be quiet

3455
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:22,880
and let donald trump uh polarize the

3456
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,800
electorate

3457
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:26,159
polarized electorate and hope that

3458
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:29,520
results in

3459
01:50:26,158 --> 01:50:30,879
in uh them winning uh because of the

3460
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:31,840
high unemployment numbers and all those

3461
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:34,880
kinds of things

3462
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:36,000
as opposed to like let's go big let's go

3463
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:39,440
with a big speech

3464
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:41,439
like you know that ah

3465
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:42,479
yeah it's a loss lost opportunities in

3466
01:50:41,439 --> 01:50:44,399
some sense

3467
01:50:42,479 --> 01:50:46,399
so we talked a bunch about politics but

3468
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:49,519
one of the other interesting things is

3469
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:51,759
that you're involved with is uh

3470
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:53,040
or involved with defining the future of

3471
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:55,039
is journalism

3472
01:50:53,039 --> 01:50:57,118
i suppose you can think of podcasts as a

3473
01:50:55,039 --> 01:50:59,279
kind of journalism

3474
01:50:57,118 --> 01:51:00,719
but also just writing in general just

3475
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:02,238
whatever the hell the future of this

3476
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:04,719
thing looks like

3477
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:05,279
uh is up to be defined by people like

3478
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:08,399
you

3479
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:09,920
so what do you think is broken about

3480
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:11,598
journalism and what do you think is the

3481
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:13,279
future of journalism

3482
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:14,639
i think the future of journalism looks

3483
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:16,960
much more like

3484
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:17,920
what we and i are doing here right now

3485
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,359
and

3486
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:21,599
journalism is going to be downstream

3487
01:51:19,359 --> 01:51:23,198
from a culture that can be a good and a

3488
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:23,840
bad thing depending on how you look at

3489
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:26,158
it

3490
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:27,520
we are going to look at our media our

3491
01:51:26,158 --> 01:51:31,118
media is going to look

3492
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:33,280
much more like it did pre-mass media

3493
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:34,799
and the way that i mean that is that

3494
01:51:33,279 --> 01:51:37,920
back in the 18

3495
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:39,440
um in the 1800s in particular

3496
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:42,560
especially after the invention of the

3497
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:44,319
telegraph when information itself was

3498
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:46,320
known so for example like

3499
01:51:44,319 --> 01:51:47,599
you and i don't need to let's say you

3500
01:51:46,319 --> 01:51:50,000
and i are competing journalists

3501
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:50,639
you and i are no longer competing quote

3502
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
unquote

3503
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:57,599
to tell the public x event happened

3504
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:01,118
all journalism today is largely

3505
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:03,279
explaining why did x happen

3506
01:52:01,118 --> 01:52:04,399
and part of the problem with that is

3507
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:06,880
that

3508
01:52:04,399 --> 01:52:07,920
that means that it's all up for partisan

3509
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:09,679
interpretation

3510
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,960
now you can say that that's a bad thing

3511
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:13,599
i think it's a great thing

3512
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:14,399
because the highest level of literacy

3513
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:17,679
and

3514
01:52:14,399 --> 01:52:19,679
news viewership in america was during

3515
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:21,118
the time of yellow journalism

3516
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:22,880
it was during the time of partisan

3517
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:25,198
journalism not a surprise

3518
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:26,639
people like to really read the news from

3519
01:52:25,198 --> 01:52:29,039
people that they agree with

3520
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:29,760
you could say that's bad echo chambers

3521
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:32,000
etc

3522
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:33,360
that's the downside of it the upside is

3523
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,399
more people are more educated

3524
01:52:33,359 --> 01:52:39,359
more people are interested in the news

3525
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:41,679
so i think the proliferation of mass

3526
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:45,839
media i mean sorry of this format

3527
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:47,599
of long form of not just long form

3528
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:49,279
dude i do i do updates on instagram

3529
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:49,599
which are five minutes oh you consider

3530
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:52,238
like

3531
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:52,960
instagram yeah almost even twitter oh of

3532
01:52:52,238 --> 01:52:54,559
course twitter

3533
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:56,158
twitter is where i get my news from i

3534
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:57,760
don't read the paper i have literally

3535
01:52:56,158 --> 01:53:00,319
twitter is my news aggregator it's

3536
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:01,920
called my wire where i find out about

3537
01:53:00,319 --> 01:53:03,118
hard events like the president has

3538
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,319
departed the white house

3539
01:53:03,118 --> 01:53:06,000
but not only like that i don't know

3540
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:06,559
about you but for i also looked at

3541
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,920
twitter

3542
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:10,239
to the exact thing you're saying which

3543
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:13,118
is the response to the news right

3544
01:53:10,238 --> 01:53:14,638
the thoughtful sounds ridiculous but you

3545
01:53:13,118 --> 01:53:15,598
can be pretty thoughtful in a single

3546
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:17,520
tweet if you fi

3547
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:19,440
if you follow the right people yeah you

3548
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:21,199
can get that and so

3549
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:22,799
that is the future of media which is

3550
01:53:21,198 --> 01:53:26,000
that the future of media

3551
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:27,520
is it will be much smaller amount

3552
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,439
or much larger amounts of people which

3553
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:31,599
are famous to smaller groups

3554
01:53:29,439 --> 01:53:32,879
so walter cronkite's never gonna happen

3555
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:34,960
again at least in our

3556
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:37,118
probably within our lifetimes where

3557
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,520
everybody in america know who's this guy

3558
01:53:37,118 --> 01:53:39,598
is

3559
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:41,119
that that age is over i think that's a

3560
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:42,800
good thing because

3561
01:53:41,118 --> 01:53:44,639
now people are going to get the news

3562
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:46,480
from the people that they trust

3563
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:48,400
yes some of it will be opinionated i'm

3564
01:53:46,479 --> 01:53:51,519
going to my my program

3565
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:53,839
i'm crystal and i are like we are this

3566
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:55,119
she's coming from this like view i'm

3567
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:56,880
coming from this view

3568
01:53:55,118 --> 01:53:58,079
that's our bias when we talk about

3569
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:58,960
information and we're going to talk

3570
01:53:58,079 --> 01:54:01,039
about the information

3571
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:02,560
that we think is important and it has

3572
01:54:01,039 --> 01:54:04,479
garnered a large audience

3573
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:06,000
i think that's very much where the

3574
01:54:04,479 --> 01:54:08,000
future is going to be

3575
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,679
and the reason why i think that's a good

3576
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,039
thing is because

3577
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:14,560
people will be engaged more within it

3578
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:16,719
rather than the current system

3579
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,760
where news is highly concentrated highly

3580
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:21,118
consolidated

3581
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:23,520
has group think has the same elite

3582
01:54:21,118 --> 01:54:25,118
production pipeline problem of

3583
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:27,199
everybody knows journalists all come

3584
01:54:25,118 --> 01:54:29,118
from the same socioeconomic background

3585
01:54:27,198 --> 01:54:30,960
and they all party together here in dc

3586
01:54:29,118 --> 01:54:32,799
or in new york or in la

3587
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:35,118
or wherever and there's part of the same

3588
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:37,279
mono culture and that affects what they

3589
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:39,279
uh that affects what they report this

3590
01:54:37,279 --> 01:54:42,319
will cause a total dispersion

3591
01:54:39,279 --> 01:54:43,198
of all of that the the a the battle of

3592
01:54:42,319 --> 01:54:45,039
our age

3593
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:46,399
is going to be the guild versus the

3594
01:54:45,039 --> 01:54:48,399
non-guild so

3595
01:54:46,399 --> 01:54:50,479
like what we see right now with the new

3596
01:54:48,399 --> 01:54:53,519
york times and clubhouse

3597
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:54,479
this is a very very very very very

3598
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,480
intentional

3599
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:57,598
thing that is happening which is that

3600
01:54:56,479 --> 01:55:00,158
the times

3601
01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:00,639
talking about unfettered conversations

3602
01:55:00,158 --> 01:55:02,000
that's

3603
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:05,118
happening on clubhouse for people who

3604
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:07,920
aren't aware this is important because

3605
01:55:05,118 --> 01:55:08,799
they need to be the fetterers of

3606
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,679
conversation

3607
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,960
they need to be the inter-agent that's

3608
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:13,920
where they get their power they get

3609
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,840
their power

3610
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:17,279
from convincing facebook that they are

3611
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:20,239
the ones who can

3612
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:22,079
check stuff they are the ones who can

3613
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:25,439
tell you whether something is right

3614
01:55:22,079 --> 01:55:27,920
or wrong that battle over

3615
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:29,359
unimpeded conversation and the explosion

3616
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:30,319
of a format that you and i are doing

3617
01:55:29,359 --> 01:55:32,559
really well in

3618
01:55:30,319 --> 01:55:34,319
and then this more consolidated one

3619
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:35,920
which holds cultural power

3620
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:38,238
and elite power and more importantly

3621
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:39,840
money right over you and i

3622
01:55:38,238 --> 01:55:41,678
that's the battle that we're all gonna

3623
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:43,679
do do you think unfettered conversations

3624
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:46,158
have a chance to win this battle

3625
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:48,319
yes i do in the long run in the long run

3626
01:55:46,158 --> 01:55:50,479
the internet is simply too powerful

3627
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:52,000
but here's the mistake everybody makes

3628
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:54,158
the new york times will never lose

3629
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,520
it will just become one of us see you

3630
01:55:54,158 --> 01:55:57,598
think so they already are

3631
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,639
they are the largest daily the daily

3632
01:55:57,599 --> 01:56:00,239
look at the daily

3633
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:01,840
not even that think about it not in

3634
01:56:00,238 --> 01:56:05,279
podcasting the times

3635
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:07,440
is not a mass media product it

3636
01:56:05,279 --> 01:56:08,399
is a subscription product for upper

3637
01:56:07,439 --> 01:56:11,598
middle class

3638
01:56:08,399 --> 01:56:12,719
largely white liberals who live the same

3639
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:15,279
circumstances

3640
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:16,719
across the united states and in europe

3641
01:56:15,279 --> 01:56:18,479
there's nothing wrong with that

3642
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:20,800
but here's the thing you can't be the

3643
01:56:18,479 --> 01:56:22,638
paper of record when you're actually

3644
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:25,039
the paper of upper middle class white

3645
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:25,679
america your job is to report on the

3646
01:56:25,039 --> 01:56:27,760
news

3647
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:28,880
from that angle and deliver them the

3648
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:30,800
product that they want

3649
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:32,400
there's nothing wrong with that their

3650
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:34,159
stock price is higher than ever

3651
01:56:32,399 --> 01:56:36,158
they're making 10 times more money than

3652
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:39,519
they did 10 years ago

3653
01:56:36,158 --> 01:56:40,079
but it comes at the cost of not having a

3654
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:42,639
mass

3655
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:44,079
application audience so like when people

3656
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:45,279
i think people in our space

3657
01:56:44,079 --> 01:56:47,840
are always like the new york times going

3658
01:56:45,279 --> 01:56:48,479
to be destroyed no it's actually even

3659
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:50,639
better

3660
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:52,959
they will just become one of us they

3661
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:54,239
already are their subscription platform

3662
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:56,319
well yes in terms of the actual

3663
01:56:54,238 --> 01:56:58,238
mechanism but you know

3664
01:56:56,319 --> 01:56:59,840
new york times is still and i don't

3665
01:56:58,238 --> 01:57:02,479
think i'm speaking about a particular

3666
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:05,599
sector i think it

3667
01:57:02,479 --> 01:57:07,359
as a brand it is it does have the

3668
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:08,960
level of credibility assigned to it

3669
01:57:07,359 --> 01:57:12,479
still you know there's

3670
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:14,158
politization of it totally but

3671
01:57:12,479 --> 01:57:15,598
if there's a credibility like it has

3672
01:57:14,158 --> 01:57:18,238
much more credibility than

3673
01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:18,719
i forgive me but then i think you and i

3674
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:21,919
have

3675
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:23,599
no you're right in in terms of uh your

3676
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:24,639
podcast like people are not going to be

3677
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:27,360
like

3678
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:28,880
uh they're going to cite the new york

3679
01:57:27,359 --> 01:57:29,519
times versus what you said on the

3680
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:32,639
podcast

3681
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:35,280
for uh for an opinion

3682
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:37,039
that i wonder in the sense of battles

3683
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:38,399
whether unfettered conversations whether

3684
01:57:37,039 --> 01:57:41,760
joe rogan whether

3685
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:43,920
your podcast can become the

3686
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,119
have at the same level of legitimacy or

3687
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:47,679
the the flip side

3688
01:57:45,118 --> 01:57:49,759
new york times loses the legitimacy to

3689
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:52,480
be at the same level

3690
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:54,079
of uh in terms of how we talk about it

3691
01:57:52,479 --> 01:57:55,839
it's getting long it's a long battle

3692
01:57:54,079 --> 01:57:57,118
right it's going to take a long time and

3693
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:58,079
i'm saying this is where i think the end

3694
01:57:57,118 --> 01:57:59,359
state is going

3695
01:57:58,079 --> 01:58:01,198
and look at what the times is doing

3696
01:57:59,359 --> 01:58:01,839
they're leaning into podcasting for a

3697
01:58:01,198 --> 01:58:05,039
reason

3698
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:07,599
but not just podcasting as in

3699
01:58:05,039 --> 01:58:09,920
npr level like here's what's happening

3700
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:11,599
michael barbaro is a [ __ ] celebrity

3701
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:13,279
right the guy who does the daily yeah

3702
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:15,039
that guy's famous

3703
01:58:13,279 --> 01:58:16,960
amongst these people because they're

3704
01:58:15,039 --> 01:58:18,158
like oh my god i love michael like i

3705
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:19,760
love the way he does this stuff

3706
01:58:18,158 --> 01:58:21,118
again that's fine more people are

3707
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,679
listening to the news i think that's a

3708
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:23,839
good thing

3709
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:25,118
yeah and then who else do they hire ezra

3710
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,679
klein from vox

3711
01:58:25,118 --> 01:58:29,519
yeah kara swisher also from box who does

3712
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:32,840
pivot which is an amazing podcast

3713
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:34,800
um or uh jane coston same thing it's

3714
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:38,159
personalities who are becoming

3715
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:40,750
bundled together within this brand right

3716
01:58:38,158 --> 01:58:42,638
here's yeah okay maybe i'm just a hater

3717
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:44,719
[Laughter]

3718
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:46,480
because i loved podcasting from the

3719
01:58:44,719 --> 01:58:48,399
beginning i loved green day before they

3720
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:51,678
were cool man

3721
01:58:48,399 --> 01:58:53,359
but i am bothered by it like why doesn't

3722
01:58:51,679 --> 01:58:55,440
karis wish her she's done successfully i

3723
01:58:53,359 --> 01:58:57,359
think i know oh no she was always a part

3724
01:58:55,439 --> 01:59:00,118
of some kind of institution i'm not sure

3725
01:58:57,359 --> 01:59:02,238
but she started her own thing i think it

3726
01:59:00,118 --> 01:59:03,439
would

3727
01:59:02,238 --> 01:59:05,759
i don't know if that's her own thing

3728
01:59:03,439 --> 01:59:07,039
yeah yeah so she she was very successful

3729
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:08,800
there why the hell

3730
01:59:07,039 --> 01:59:11,359
did she join the new york times with the

3731
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,920
new podcast why is michael barbaro not

3732
01:59:11,359 --> 01:59:13,920
do his

3733
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:16,560
own thing because he gets paid and

3734
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:18,158
because he has he wants the elite cachet

3735
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,679
that you just referenced within his

3736
01:59:18,158 --> 01:59:20,879
social circle in new york

3737
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:22,960
which is that i think the biggest

3738
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:23,760
mistake that some of the venture people

3739
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:26,000
make is

3740
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:27,520
if we give everybody the tools that

3741
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,520
those people are all going to leave to

3742
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:32,639
like go sub sack and go independent

3743
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:34,639
within their social circle sacrificing

3744
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:37,118
some money from being independent is

3745
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:37,920
worth it to be a part of the new york

3746
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:41,920
times

3747
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:44,800
that's sad to me because it propagates

3748
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:46,239
old thinking like you know it propagates

3749
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:47,760
old institutions

3750
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:50,718
and you could say that new york times is

3751
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:54,079
going to evolve quickly and so on but

3752
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:56,158
i would love it if there was a mechanism

3753
01:59:54,079 --> 01:59:58,238
for re-establishing like for building

3754
01:59:56,158 --> 02:00:00,399
new new york times

3755
01:59:58,238 --> 02:00:02,158
in terms of public legitimacy and i

3756
02:00:00,399 --> 02:00:02,960
suppose that's uh wishful thinking

3757
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:05,359
because

3758
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:07,359
it takes time to build trust in

3759
02:00:05,359 --> 02:00:09,039
institutions and it takes time to build

3760
02:00:07,359 --> 02:00:11,118
new institutions my main thing i would

3761
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:12,560
say is public legitimacy as a concept

3762
02:00:11,118 --> 02:00:13,118
it's not going to be there in mass media

3763
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:14,719
anymore

3764
02:00:13,118 --> 02:00:16,799
because of the balkanization of

3765
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:17,679
audiences i mean think about it right

3766
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:19,520
like

3767
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:21,359
um this is like legion you know the

3768
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:22,320
classic stuff around a thousand true

3769
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:24,319
fans or

3770
02:00:22,319 --> 02:00:25,519
no sorry like 100 true fans even now

3771
02:00:24,319 --> 02:00:26,799
like you can make a living on the

3772
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:27,199
internet just talking to a hundred

3773
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,320
people

3774
02:00:27,198 --> 02:00:30,319
yeah if as long as they're all high

3775
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:30,960
frequency traders some of the highest

3776
02:00:30,319 --> 02:00:32,799
people

3777
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:34,079
pay people on sub stack they don't have

3778
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:35,760
that many subs

3779
02:00:34,079 --> 02:00:37,599
it's just that they're wall street guys

3780
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:40,480
right so people pay a lot of money again

3781
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:41,119
that's great so what you will have is an

3782
02:00:40,479 --> 02:00:43,919
increasing

3783
02:00:41,118 --> 02:00:46,079
balkanization of the internet um of

3784
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,840
audiences and of niches

3785
02:00:46,079 --> 02:00:49,519
people will become increasingly famous

3786
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:51,279
within us you will become

3787
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:52,480
astoundingly famous i'm sure you've

3788
02:00:51,279 --> 02:00:54,559
noticed this with your fan base i

3789
02:00:52,479 --> 02:00:55,839
certainly have with mine like 99 of

3790
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:57,280
people have no idea who i am

3791
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:59,520
but when somebody meet they're like oh

3792
02:00:57,279 --> 02:01:02,639
my god i watch your show

3793
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:04,880
every day right looks the only thing

3794
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:06,239
watching for news right like instead of

3795
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:07,440
casually famous

3796
02:01:06,238 --> 02:01:09,519
if that makes sense like oh yeah that's

3797
02:01:07,439 --> 02:01:10,879
like alec baldwin yeah you know yeah oh

3798
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:11,840
[ __ ] that's solid ball but you're not

3799
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:14,480
like oh [ __ ]

3800
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:15,520
i love you alec baldwin it's this is a

3801
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:17,198
ben smith

3802
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,800
of the new york times actually he wrote

3803
02:01:17,198 --> 02:01:20,000
this column he's like the future is

3804
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:22,800
everybody will be famous

3805
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,000
but only to a small group of people and

3806
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:26,400
i think that is true

3807
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:28,238
but again i don't decry it i think it's

3808
02:01:26,399 --> 02:01:29,920
great because i think that the more

3809
02:01:28,238 --> 02:01:32,399
that that happens the more engaged

3810
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:34,399
people will be and it empowers

3811
02:01:32,399 --> 02:01:36,399
different voices to be able to come in

3812
02:01:34,399 --> 02:01:37,439
and then possibly i wouldn't say destroy

3813
02:01:36,399 --> 02:01:39,759
but compete

3814
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:40,638
against i mean look at joe joe is more

3815
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:43,840
powerful

3816
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:46,159
than cnn and msnbc and fox

3817
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:47,199
all put together that gives me like

3818
02:01:46,158 --> 02:01:49,439
immense inspiration

3819
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:50,879
yeah like he created the space for me to

3820
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:52,238
succeed and i told him that when i met

3821
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:54,159
him i was like

3822
02:01:52,238 --> 02:01:56,158
dude like i listened to his podcast when

3823
02:01:54,158 --> 02:01:57,679
i was like young and like

3824
02:01:56,158 --> 02:01:59,519
and i remember like when i got to meet

3825
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:01,279
him and all that and i told him this

3826
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,639
on this pod i was like i didn't know

3827
02:02:01,279 --> 02:02:04,639
people were millions

3828
02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:07,199
were willing to listen to a guy talk

3829
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:08,960
about chimps for three straight hours

3830
02:02:07,198 --> 02:02:10,399
including me i didn't know that yeah

3831
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:12,399
he's one of those people yeah me too i

3832
02:02:10,399 --> 02:02:14,879
learned something about myself okay

3833
02:02:12,399 --> 02:02:15,839
yeah and so by creating that space i'd

3834
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:18,639
be like wait

3835
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:20,000
there's a hunger here like he showed us

3836
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:21,520
all the way

3837
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,439
and none of us will ever again be as

3838
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:26,080
famous as rogan because he was the first

3839
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:29,039
and that's fine because he created the

3840
02:02:26,079 --> 02:02:31,439
umbrella ecosystem for us all to thrive

3841
02:02:29,039 --> 02:02:32,238
that is where i see like a great amount

3842
02:02:31,439 --> 02:02:33,919
of hope

3843
02:02:32,238 --> 02:02:35,678
within that story yeah and the cool

3844
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,399
thing he also supports that ecosystem

3845
02:02:35,679 --> 02:02:38,960
he's such a

3846
02:02:36,399 --> 02:02:40,879
he's so so generous one of the things he

3847
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:43,840
paved the way on for me

3848
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:45,359
is to to show that you can just be

3849
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:48,480
honest

3850
02:02:45,359 --> 02:02:51,118
publicly honest yes and uh

3851
02:02:48,479 --> 02:02:53,198
not jealous of other people's success

3852
02:02:51,118 --> 02:02:54,960
but instead of being supportive and

3853
02:02:53,198 --> 02:02:56,479
and all those kinds of things just like

3854
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:57,198
loving towards others he's been an

3855
02:02:56,479 --> 02:03:01,118
inspiration

3856
02:02:57,198 --> 02:03:04,000
i mean uh to the comics community

3857
02:03:01,118 --> 02:03:04,399
i think there are a bunch of uh before

3858
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,599
that

3859
02:03:04,399 --> 02:03:07,519
i think there were all a bunch of

3860
02:03:05,599 --> 02:03:08,719
competitive haters towards each other

3861
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:11,280
yeah and now he's like

3862
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:12,800
just injected love yeah you know they're

3863
02:03:11,279 --> 02:03:14,559
like they're still like many are still

3864
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:16,880
resistant but they're like they can't

3865
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:19,360
help it because he's such a huge voice

3866
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:21,199
he like forces them to be like loving

3867
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:23,359
towards each other and the same

3868
02:03:21,198 --> 02:03:24,319
i tried to one of the reasons i wanted

3869
02:03:23,359 --> 02:03:27,519
to start this

3870
02:03:24,319 --> 02:03:30,238
podcast was to try to enj

3871
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:31,440
i wanted to be like a uh do what joe

3872
02:03:30,238 --> 02:03:34,399
rogan did

3873
02:03:31,439 --> 02:03:36,000
but for the scientific community like my

3874
02:03:34,399 --> 02:03:36,879
little circle scientific community of

3875
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,118
like

3876
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:40,239
like let's support each other yeah well

3877
02:03:39,118 --> 02:03:42,158
like avi loeb

3878
02:03:40,238 --> 02:03:43,678
i would have no idea who he was if it

3879
02:03:42,158 --> 02:03:44,719
wasn't for you i mean i assume you put

3880
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:46,239
him in touch with joe

3881
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:48,399
he went on joe's show i had him on my

3882
02:03:46,238 --> 02:03:50,078
show like millions of people would have

3883
02:03:48,399 --> 02:03:51,279
no idea who he was if it wasn't for you

3884
02:03:50,078 --> 02:03:54,000
just by the way in terms of

3885
02:03:51,279 --> 02:03:56,639
deep state of government avilo has to do

3886
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:58,479
with aliens you better believe joe

3887
02:03:56,639 --> 02:04:00,319
dude the last thing i sent to him was

3888
02:03:58,479 --> 02:04:03,198
the american airlines audio

3889
02:04:00,319 --> 02:04:07,198
did you see that uh the pilots who were

3890
02:04:03,198 --> 02:04:09,279
oh my god dude this is amazing so like

3891
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:11,039
this american airlines flight crew was

3892
02:04:09,279 --> 02:04:12,158
over new mexico this happened five or

3893
02:04:11,039 --> 02:04:14,800
six days ago

3894
02:04:12,158 --> 02:04:16,238
and they the guy comes and goes hey do

3895
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:19,199
you have any targets up here

3896
02:04:16,238 --> 02:04:20,479
a large cylindrical object just flew

3897
02:04:19,198 --> 02:04:23,118
over me

3898
02:04:20,479 --> 02:04:24,078
oh so this happens so this happens yes

3899
02:04:23,118 --> 02:04:27,039
then

3900
02:04:24,078 --> 02:04:29,039
a guy or like a radio catcher records

3901
02:04:27,039 --> 02:04:31,920
this and posts it online

3902
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:33,359
american airlines confirms that this is

3903
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:35,440
authentic audio

3904
02:04:33,359 --> 02:04:36,960
and they go all further questions should

3905
02:04:35,439 --> 02:04:39,279
we refer to the fbi

3906
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:41,439
so then okay american airlines just

3907
02:04:39,279 --> 02:04:45,679
confirmed it's a legitimate transmission

3908
02:04:41,439 --> 02:04:49,039
fbi then the faa comes out and says

3909
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:51,199
we were tracking no objects

3910
02:04:49,039 --> 02:04:52,319
in the vicinity of this plane at the

3911
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:54,638
time of the transmission

3912
02:04:52,319 --> 02:04:56,639
so the only plausible explanation that

3913
02:04:54,639 --> 02:04:59,679
online salutes have been able to say is

3914
02:04:56,639 --> 02:05:02,560
maybe he saw a learjet which was

3915
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:03,840
you know using like open source data faa

3916
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:05,760
rules that out

3917
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,360
so what was it he saw a large

3918
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:09,199
cylindrical object

3919
02:05:07,359 --> 02:05:10,559
while he was mid-flight american

3920
02:05:09,198 --> 02:05:12,960
airlines but you can go

3921
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:14,079
online listen to the audio yourself this

3922
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:16,239
is a 100

3923
02:05:14,078 --> 02:05:17,519
no [ __ ] transmission confirmed by

3924
02:05:16,238 --> 02:05:21,439
american airlines

3925
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:24,719
of a commercial pilot over new mexico

3926
02:05:21,439 --> 02:05:25,439
seeing a quote-unquote large cylindrical

3927
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:27,599
object

3928
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:29,039
in the air like i said um when you first

3929
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:30,400
start talking i've never believed

3930
02:05:29,039 --> 02:05:32,158
i've never believed more in ufos and

3931
02:05:30,399 --> 02:05:34,719
aliens yeah yeah

3932
02:05:32,158 --> 02:05:36,319
this is awesome yeah i i i just wish

3933
02:05:34,719 --> 02:05:39,359
both the american airlines

3934
02:05:36,319 --> 02:05:41,840
uh fbi and uh government would be more

3935
02:05:39,359 --> 02:05:43,839
transparent like there would be voices

3936
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:45,760
i know it sounds ridiculous but the kind

3937
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:47,360
of transparency do you see maybe not joe

3938
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:49,119
rogan

3939
02:05:47,359 --> 02:05:50,799
he's like overly transparent he's just a

3940
02:05:49,118 --> 02:05:53,359
comic really but

3941
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:54,960
just uh i don't know like a podcast from

3942
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:57,359
the fbi

3943
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:58,399
just like being honest like excited

3944
02:05:57,359 --> 02:06:01,598
confused

3945
02:05:58,399 --> 02:06:03,519
uh i'm sure the car

3946
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:05,039
they're being overly cautious about the

3947
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:06,480
release information i'm sure there's a

3948
02:06:05,039 --> 02:06:07,359
lot of information that would inspire

3949
02:06:06,479 --> 02:06:09,359
the public

3950
02:06:07,359 --> 02:06:10,880
that will inspire trust in institutions

3951
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:13,598
that will not damage

3952
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:14,960
national security like it seems to me

3953
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:16,319
obvious and the reason they're not

3954
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:18,399
sharing it is because of this

3955
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:20,719
momentum of bureaucracy of caution and

3956
02:06:18,399 --> 02:06:21,439
so on but there's probably so much cool

3957
02:06:20,719 --> 02:06:24,000
information

3958
02:06:21,439 --> 02:06:26,479
that the government has the way i almost

3959
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,800
i wouldn't say it confirmed it's real

3960
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:30,799
but trump didn't didn't declassify it

3961
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:32,079
like you know that if there was ever a

3962
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:33,360
president that actually wanted to get to

3963
02:06:32,078 --> 02:06:36,960
the bottom of it it was him

3964
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:37,279
yeah i mean he didn't declassify it man

3965
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:39,599
and

3966
02:06:37,279 --> 02:06:40,479
people begged him to i know for a fact

3967
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:42,319
because i pushed

3968
02:06:40,479 --> 02:06:44,238
to try and make this happen that some

3969
02:06:42,319 --> 02:06:46,399
people did speak to him about it

3970
02:06:44,238 --> 02:06:47,919
and he was like no i'm not gonna do it

3971
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:49,759
so he might be afraid

3972
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:50,560
uh that's what i mean though he's a they

3973
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:52,000
were probably all telling him they're

3974
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:54,159
like sir you can't do this you know all

3975
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,840
this like wow and and i get that and

3976
02:06:54,158 --> 02:06:57,598
there's this legislation written in

3977
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:58,480
coveted that like they have six months

3978
02:06:57,599 --> 02:06:59,760
to release it

3979
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:01,279
is that real what is that that was a

3980
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:01,679
bunch of [ __ ] [ __ ] i think it's

3981
02:07:01,279 --> 02:07:03,439
both

3982
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:04,880
there's so many different levels of

3983
02:07:03,439 --> 02:07:06,879
classification that people

3984
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:08,719
need to understand i mean look i read

3985
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:10,480
john podesta he was the

3986
02:07:08,719 --> 02:07:12,078
chief of staff to bill clinton he's a

3987
02:07:10,479 --> 02:07:14,879
big ufo guy he he

3988
02:07:12,078 --> 02:07:16,399
tried like him and clinton tried to get

3989
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:17,199
some of this information and they could

3990
02:07:16,399 --> 02:07:18,719
not get

3991
02:07:17,198 --> 02:07:20,319
any of it and they were talking about

3992
02:07:18,719 --> 02:07:21,198
the president and the white house chief

3993
02:07:20,319 --> 02:07:22,639
of staff

3994
02:07:21,198 --> 02:07:24,638
well there's a whole bureaucracy bill

3995
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:25,279
just like you're saying with intent you

3996
02:07:24,639 --> 02:07:27,199
have to be

3997
02:07:25,279 --> 02:07:28,880
like that has to be your focus because

3998
02:07:27,198 --> 02:07:29,678
there's a whole bureaucracy built around

3999
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:32,159
secrecy

4000
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:33,599
for probably for a good reason so to get

4001
02:07:32,158 --> 02:07:35,279
through to the information

4002
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:36,560
there's a whole like paperwork process

4003
02:07:35,279 --> 02:07:37,759
all that kind of stuff you can't just

4004
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:40,400
walk in and get the

4005
02:07:37,760 --> 02:07:41,360
unless again with intention that becomes

4006
02:07:40,399 --> 02:07:44,238
your thing like exactly

4007
02:07:41,359 --> 02:07:44,639
let's revolutionize this thing and then

4008
02:07:44,238 --> 02:07:46,959
you get

4009
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:48,400
only so many things that it's it's sad

4010
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:51,920
that the the bureaucracy

4011
02:07:48,399 --> 02:07:53,759
has gotten so bulky um but i think

4012
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:56,000
the hopeful messages from earlier in our

4013
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:58,400
conversation it seems like

4014
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,560
a single person can't fix it but if you

4015
02:07:58,399 --> 02:08:02,319
hire the right team

4016
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:03,599
it feels like you can can't fix

4017
02:08:02,319 --> 02:08:04,639
everything i don't want to i don't want

4018
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:05,360
to give people on real estate

4019
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:07,760
expectations

4020
02:08:05,359 --> 02:08:09,039
you can fix a lot especially in crisis

4021
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:10,400
you can remake america

4022
02:08:09,039 --> 02:08:12,479
yeah and the reason i know that is

4023
02:08:10,399 --> 02:08:15,839
because it's already happened twice

4024
02:08:12,479 --> 02:08:18,959
fdr or in modern history fdr

4025
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:19,920
and jfk sorry fdr and jfk's

4026
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:23,118
assassination

4027
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:26,399
lbj two hyper-competent men

4028
02:08:23,118 --> 02:08:28,000
who understood government who understood

4029
02:08:26,399 --> 02:08:29,279
personnel and coincidentally were

4030
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,920
friends i love this i don't think

4031
02:08:29,279 --> 02:08:33,519
actually people

4032
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:36,880
understand this fdr met johnson

4033
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:38,079
three days after he won his congress

4034
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:40,239
his election to congress special

4035
02:08:38,078 --> 02:08:43,118
election he was only 29 years old

4036
02:08:40,238 --> 02:08:44,078
and he left that meeting and called

4037
02:08:43,118 --> 02:08:45,439
somebody and said

4038
02:08:44,078 --> 02:08:47,439
this young man is gonna be president of

4039
02:08:45,439 --> 02:08:50,158
the united states someday like

4040
02:08:47,439 --> 02:08:51,839
even then like what was within him to

4041
02:08:50,158 --> 02:08:53,519
understand and to recognize that

4042
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:54,960
and sometimes johnson as a young member

4043
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:57,119
of congress would come and have

4044
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:57,760
breakfast with fdr like just to the

4045
02:08:57,118 --> 02:09:00,238
great

4046
02:08:57,760 --> 02:09:01,920
political minds of the 20th century just

4047
02:09:00,238 --> 02:09:02,799
sitting there talking like i would give

4048
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:04,880
anything

4049
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:06,320
to know what that was happening i hope

4050
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:08,000
they were real with each other and there

4051
02:09:06,319 --> 02:09:09,039
was like a genuine human connection

4052
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,560
right that

4053
02:09:09,039 --> 02:09:13,118
i that seemed like johnson wasn't a

4054
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:13,119
genuine guy

4055
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:20,719
i need to read those thousands of pages

4056
02:09:17,118 --> 02:09:22,158
uh i've been way too focused on hitler

4057
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:23,520
i was gonna say one of my goals in

4058
02:09:22,158 --> 02:09:24,879
coming to this is i was like i gotta get

4059
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:25,440
lex into two things because i know he'll

4060
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:28,000
love it

4061
02:09:25,439 --> 02:09:29,919
i know he'll love lbj if he's it has to

4062
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,560
take the time to read the books

4063
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:33,760
100 he's the most of all the presidents

4064
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:35,360
i didn't say you'll love him but you'll

4065
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:37,360
love the books about him because the

4066
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:39,439
books are a story of america

4067
02:09:37,359 --> 02:09:40,559
the story of politics the story of power

4068
02:09:39,439 --> 02:09:41,359
this is the guy who wrote the power

4069
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:44,400
broker

4070
02:09:41,359 --> 02:09:46,078
these books are up there with decline

4071
02:09:44,399 --> 02:09:48,319
and fall of the roman empire

4072
02:09:46,078 --> 02:09:49,679
by edward gibbon in terms of how power

4073
02:09:48,319 --> 02:09:52,158
works study of power

4074
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:52,800
exactly that's no that's why carol wrote

4075
02:09:52,158 --> 02:09:54,399
the books

4076
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:56,480
and that's why the books are not really

4077
02:09:54,399 --> 02:09:57,359
about lbj they're about power in

4078
02:09:56,479 --> 02:09:58,959
washington

4079
02:09:57,359 --> 02:10:01,519
and about the consolidation of power

4080
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:03,520
post new deal the consolidation then

4081
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:05,679
or the using the levers of power like

4082
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:08,000
johnson knew in order to

4083
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:09,359
change the house of representatives the

4084
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,639
senate of the united states

4085
02:10:09,359 --> 02:10:12,399
and ultimately the presidency of the

4086
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:14,800
united states which ended in failure and

4087
02:10:12,399 --> 02:10:17,598
disaster with vietnam don't get me wrong

4088
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:19,599
but he's overlooked for so many of the

4089
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:21,440
incredible things that he did with civil

4090
02:10:19,599 --> 02:10:23,760
rights nobody else could have done it no

4091
02:10:21,439 --> 02:10:25,118
no one else could have gotten it done

4092
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:27,199
and the second thing is

4093
02:10:25,118 --> 02:10:28,559
we gotta get you into world war one we

4094
02:10:27,198 --> 02:10:30,638
gotta get you more

4095
02:10:28,560 --> 02:10:32,159
into world war one because i think

4096
02:10:30,639 --> 02:10:33,440
that's a rabbit hole which i know you're

4097
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:35,920
a dan carlin fan

4098
02:10:33,439 --> 02:10:36,719
so blueprint for armageddon yeah

4099
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:39,920
guaranteed

4100
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:43,520
but but there's fewer evil people there

4101
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:45,840
yes but well but that's what actually

4102
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:46,639
there's a banality of that evil of the

4103
02:10:45,840 --> 02:10:50,159
kaiser

4104
02:10:46,639 --> 02:10:52,960
and of the uh austro-hungarians

4105
02:10:50,158 --> 02:10:54,319
and of see i like world war one more

4106
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:55,520
because it was unresolved

4107
02:10:54,319 --> 02:10:56,880
it's one of those periods i was talking

4108
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:58,079
to you about about like sometimes you're

4109
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:00,319
called and you fail

4110
02:10:58,078 --> 02:11:02,000
like that's what happened i mean 50

4111
02:11:00,319 --> 02:11:04,078
million people were killed

4112
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,238
in the most horrific way like people

4113
02:11:04,078 --> 02:11:09,679
literally drowned in the mud

4114
02:11:06,238 --> 02:11:10,000
like like an entire generation one stat

4115
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:12,399
i love

4116
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,319
is that you know britain didn't need a

4117
02:11:12,399 --> 02:11:16,238
draft till

4118
02:11:13,319 --> 02:11:18,559
1916. like they went two

4119
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:20,158
years of throwing people into barbed

4120
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:22,159
wire voluntarily

4121
02:11:20,158 --> 02:11:23,598
yeah and because people love their

4122
02:11:22,158 --> 02:11:25,198
country and they love the king

4123
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:26,880
and they thought they were going against

4124
02:11:25,198 --> 02:11:29,198
the kaiser it's just like

4125
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,000
that conflict to me i just can't read

4126
02:11:29,198 --> 02:11:32,559
enough about it

4127
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,118
also just like births russian revolution

4128
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:35,119
you know

4129
02:11:33,118 --> 02:11:37,118
yeah i mean hitler you can't talk about

4130
02:11:35,118 --> 02:11:37,598
world war ii without world war one right

4131
02:11:37,118 --> 02:11:39,279
right

4132
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:40,800
and i'm obsessed with the conflict i've

4133
02:11:39,279 --> 02:11:41,920
read way too many books about it for

4134
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:44,239
this reason is it's

4135
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:46,078
unresolved and like the the roots of so

4136
02:11:44,238 --> 02:11:48,158
much of even our current problems

4137
02:11:46,078 --> 02:11:49,359
are happening in versailles right like

4138
02:11:48,158 --> 02:11:51,598
vietnam is

4139
02:11:49,359 --> 02:11:53,279
because of the treaty of versailles um

4140
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:55,119
many ways the middle eastern problems

4141
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:56,880
and the division of the states there

4142
02:11:55,118 --> 02:11:58,158
the treaty of versailles in terms of the

4143
02:11:56,880 --> 02:12:01,039
penalties against

4144
02:11:58,158 --> 02:12:02,638
germany but also the uh fallout from

4145
02:12:01,039 --> 02:12:04,399
those wars on the french

4146
02:12:02,639 --> 02:12:06,400
and the german population french and the

4147
02:12:04,399 --> 02:12:10,078
british populations and their reluctance

4148
02:12:06,399 --> 02:12:12,158
for war in 1939 or 1938

4149
02:12:10,078 --> 02:12:13,439
when when neville chamberlain goes right

4150
02:12:12,158 --> 02:12:14,879
like that's one of the things people

4151
02:12:13,439 --> 02:12:15,919
don't understand is the actual appetite

4152
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:17,118
of the british public

4153
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:19,118
at that time they didn't want to go to

4154
02:12:17,118 --> 02:12:19,598
war only churchill he was the only one

4155
02:12:19,118 --> 02:12:21,359
in the

4156
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:24,078
you know in the gathering storm right

4157
02:12:21,359 --> 02:12:25,598
like being like hey this is really bad

4158
02:12:24,078 --> 02:12:27,840
and all of that and then even in the

4159
02:12:25,599 --> 02:12:28,319
united states our streak of isolationism

4160
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:31,360
which

4161
02:12:28,319 --> 02:12:32,078
swept i mean things were because of that

4162
02:12:31,359 --> 02:12:34,960
conflict

4163
02:12:32,078 --> 02:12:35,439
we were convinced as a country that we

4164
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:36,800
wanted

4165
02:12:35,439 --> 02:12:38,638
nothing to do with europe and its

4166
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:39,679
problems and in many ways that

4167
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:41,279
contributed to

4168
02:12:39,679 --> 02:12:43,039
the proliferation of hitler and more so

4169
02:12:41,279 --> 02:12:43,759
like i'm obsessed with world war one for

4170
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:45,920
this reason

4171
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:47,280
which is that it's just like the root oh

4172
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:49,760
it's like the culmination

4173
02:12:47,279 --> 02:12:51,759
of the monarchies then the fall and then

4174
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:53,520
just all the [ __ ] spills out

4175
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:55,280
so from there for like a hundred years

4176
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:58,000
so world war one is like the most

4177
02:12:55,279 --> 02:12:59,679
important shift in human history

4178
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:02,158
world war ii is like a consequence of

4179
02:12:59,679 --> 02:13:04,000
that yeah it's so so i have a degree in

4180
02:13:02,158 --> 02:13:05,519
security studies from georgetown and one

4181
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,960
of the thing is that we would focus a

4182
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:10,480
lot on that is like war

4183
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:10,960
and but also like the complexity around

4184
02:13:10,479 --> 02:13:13,439
war

4185
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:14,399
and it's funny we never spent that much

4186
02:13:13,439 --> 02:13:16,238
time on world war

4187
02:13:14,399 --> 02:13:18,960
ii because there's actually quite a

4188
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:22,078
clean war it's a very atypical war

4189
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:23,198
as in the war object which we learned

4190
02:13:22,078 --> 02:13:25,519
from world war one

4191
02:13:23,198 --> 02:13:26,479
is we must inflict suffering on the

4192
02:13:25,520 --> 02:13:28,960
german people

4193
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:30,399
and invade the borders of germany and

4194
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:32,560
destroy hitler

4195
02:13:30,399 --> 02:13:34,158
like the center of gravity is the nazi

4196
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:37,280
regime and hitler

4197
02:13:34,158 --> 02:13:40,479
so it had a very basic begin and end

4198
02:13:37,279 --> 02:13:44,000
begin liberate france invade germany

4199
02:13:40,479 --> 02:13:46,879
destroy hitler reoccupy rebuild

4200
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,599
world war one what are you fighting for

4201
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,679
like

4202
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:51,199
are you i mean and nobody even knew you

4203
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:51,920
can go the german general staff they

4204
02:13:51,198 --> 02:13:54,319
were like

4205
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:56,000
even in 1917 they're like the war was

4206
02:13:54,319 --> 02:13:57,279
worth it because now we have luxembourg

4207
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,719
i'm like really like you killed two

4208
02:13:57,279 --> 02:13:59,599
million of your citizens for [ __ ]

4209
02:13:58,719 --> 02:14:01,359
luxembourg

4210
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:03,599
and like half of belgium which is now

4211
02:14:01,359 --> 02:14:06,078
like a pond yeah and same thing

4212
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:07,440
the french are like well the french more

4213
02:14:06,078 --> 02:14:07,759
so they're defending their borders but

4214
02:14:07,439 --> 02:14:09,439
like

4215
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:10,560
what are the british fighting for why

4216
02:14:09,439 --> 02:14:11,359
did hundreds of thousands of british

4217
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:13,039
people die

4218
02:14:11,359 --> 02:14:15,679
in order to preserve the balance of

4219
02:14:13,039 --> 02:14:18,399
power in europe and prevent the kaiser

4220
02:14:15,679 --> 02:14:19,118
from having a port on the english

4221
02:14:18,399 --> 02:14:21,839
channel

4222
02:14:19,118 --> 02:14:22,719
like really that's why these that's more

4223
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:26,400
what wars are

4224
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:30,078
they become these like atypical

4225
02:14:26,399 --> 02:14:33,198
they become these protracted conflicts

4226
02:14:30,078 --> 02:14:36,319
with a necessary diplomatic resolution

4227
02:14:33,198 --> 02:14:38,000
it's not clean it's very dirty it

4228
02:14:36,319 --> 02:14:39,359
usually leads in the outbreak

4229
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,039
of another war and another war and

4230
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:41,839
another war in a slow burn of ethnic

4231
02:14:41,039 --> 02:14:44,399
conflict

4232
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:45,279
which bubbles up so that's why i look at

4233
02:14:44,399 --> 02:14:46,879
that one

4234
02:14:45,279 --> 02:14:48,960
even because it's it's more typical of

4235
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:50,719
warfare yeah how it works

4236
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:52,239
exactly yeah it's it's kind of

4237
02:14:50,719 --> 02:14:54,719
interesting you're making me realize

4238
02:14:52,238 --> 02:14:55,678
uh that uh world war ii is one of the

4239
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:57,679
rare

4240
02:14:55,679 --> 02:14:59,840
wars where you can make a strong case

4241
02:14:57,679 --> 02:15:01,520
for it's a fight of good versus

4242
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:03,119
war theory obviously like yeah they're

4243
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:04,320
literally slaughtering jews like

4244
02:15:03,118 --> 02:15:05,839
you know we have to kill them and

4245
02:15:04,319 --> 02:15:07,840
there's one person doing it i mean

4246
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:08,880
there's one person at the core there's

4247
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:11,920
it's

4248
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:15,520
uh yeah that's fascinating and it's

4249
02:15:11,920 --> 02:15:18,639
short and there's a clear aggression

4250
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:22,400
it's interesting that dan uh carlin

4251
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:24,560
has been avoiding hitler as well yeah

4252
02:15:22,399 --> 02:15:25,598
probably for this reason probably for

4253
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:27,199
this reason yeah i mean

4254
02:15:25,599 --> 02:15:28,719
but it's it's complicated too right

4255
02:15:27,198 --> 02:15:31,198
because there's a pressure

4256
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:32,000
that guy has his demons i love this so

4257
02:15:31,198 --> 02:15:34,238
much

4258
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,719
it's so this is the the i don't know if

4259
02:15:34,238 --> 02:15:38,959
you feel this pressure

4260
02:15:36,719 --> 02:15:40,639
but as a creative he feels the pressure

4261
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:43,760
of being

4262
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:46,319
maybe not necessarily correct

4263
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:47,039
but maybe correct in the in the sense

4264
02:15:46,319 --> 02:15:50,559
that

4265
02:15:47,039 --> 02:15:53,760
his understanding he gets to the bottom

4266
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:56,320
of uh of why

4267
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:57,760
something happened of what really

4268
02:15:56,319 --> 02:16:00,078
happened

4269
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:02,400
did get to the bottom of it before he

4270
02:16:00,078 --> 02:16:04,960
can say something publicly about it

4271
02:16:02,399 --> 02:16:06,799
and he is uh tortured by that burden i

4272
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:08,719
know it you know he takes so much [ __ ]

4273
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:09,119
from the historical community for no

4274
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:11,439
reason

4275
02:16:09,118 --> 02:16:13,198
i think he's the greatest popularizer

4276
02:16:11,439 --> 02:16:15,598
quote-unquote of history

4277
02:16:13,198 --> 02:16:16,879
and i wish more people in history

4278
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:18,800
understood it that way

4279
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:20,800
he was an inspiration to me i mean i do

4280
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:22,480
some videos sometimes on my instagram

4281
02:16:20,800 --> 02:16:23,920
now where i'll like i'll do like a book

4282
02:16:22,479 --> 02:16:24,959
tour i'll be like here's my bookshelf of

4283
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:26,078
these presidents and like

4284
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:27,439
here's what i learned from this book in

4285
02:16:26,078 --> 02:16:28,559
this book and this and that was very

4286
02:16:27,439 --> 02:16:31,598
much like a

4287
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:33,840
a skill i learned from him of being like

4288
02:16:31,599 --> 02:16:34,639
as you know as the historian writes you

4289
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:36,558
know you know

4290
02:16:34,638 --> 02:16:37,920
i just love the way he talks he's like

4291
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:41,279
in the mud

4292
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:41,280
oh you know he'll be like quote

4293
02:16:42,318 --> 02:16:46,079
he he inspires me man yeah he really

4294
02:16:44,959 --> 02:16:48,318
does to like learn

4295
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:49,920
more and i've read i bought a lot of

4296
02:16:48,318 --> 02:16:51,439
books because of dan carlin he'll be you

4297
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,840
know because of this guy because of that

4298
02:16:51,439 --> 02:16:53,599
guy

4299
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:55,359
um in terms of you know another thing he

4300
02:16:53,599 --> 02:16:56,318
does which nobody else and i'm probably

4301
02:16:55,359 --> 02:16:59,280
guilty of this

4302
02:16:56,318 --> 02:17:00,959
he focuses on the actual people involved

4303
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:03,840
like he would tell the story

4304
02:17:00,959 --> 02:17:04,478
of actual british soldiers in world war

4305
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,159
one

4306
02:17:04,478 --> 02:17:08,239
and i probably and maybe you're guilty

4307
02:17:06,159 --> 02:17:10,079
of this too we over focus

4308
02:17:08,239 --> 02:17:11,679
on what was happening in the german

4309
02:17:10,079 --> 02:17:13,200
general staff what's happening in the

4310
02:17:11,679 --> 02:17:14,079
british general staff and he doesn't

4311
02:17:13,200 --> 02:17:16,479
make that mistake

4312
02:17:14,079 --> 02:17:17,519
that's why he tells real history yeah

4313
02:17:16,478 --> 02:17:19,519
and and make it

4314
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:21,519
gives it a feeling the result is that

4315
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:24,159
there's a feeling you get the feeling of

4316
02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:26,159
what it was like to be there exactly

4317
02:17:24,159 --> 02:17:29,840
you know you're becoming quickly

4318
02:17:26,159 --> 02:17:29,840
becoming more and more popular

4319
02:17:30,079 --> 02:17:37,439
speaking about political issues in part

4320
02:17:34,159 --> 02:17:40,799
do you feel a burden

4321
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:41,200
like almost like uh the the prison of

4322
02:17:40,799 --> 02:17:44,879
your

4323
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:46,319
prior convictions of having to

4324
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:48,718
being popular with a certain kind of

4325
02:17:46,318 --> 02:17:51,519
audience and thereby

4326
02:17:48,718 --> 02:17:51,919
unable to really think outside the box i

4327
02:17:51,519 --> 02:17:54,800
had

4328
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:56,318
i've really struggled with this i came

4329
02:17:54,799 --> 02:18:00,159
up in right-wing media

4330
02:17:56,318 --> 02:18:02,000
i came up a much more doctrinaire

4331
02:18:00,159 --> 02:18:03,200
conservative in my professional life i

4332
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
wasn't always conservative we can get to

4333
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:07,200
that later

4334
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:10,558
um if you want and i did

4335
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:14,960
feel an immense pressure after jan

4336
02:18:10,558 --> 02:18:17,438
after the election by people to say

4337
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:18,959
wanted me to say the election was stolen

4338
02:18:17,439 --> 02:18:21,760
and i knew

4339
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:22,718
i had a sizable part of my audience well

4340
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:24,478
here's the benefit

4341
02:18:22,718 --> 02:18:26,159
most people know me from rising which is

4342
02:18:24,478 --> 02:18:29,358
with crystal and me

4343
02:18:26,159 --> 02:18:32,478
that is inherently a left-right program

4344
02:18:29,359 --> 02:18:34,159
so it's a large audience so i felt

4345
02:18:32,478 --> 02:18:34,638
comfortable and i knew that i could

4346
02:18:34,159 --> 02:18:37,119
still

4347
02:18:34,638 --> 02:18:38,959
be fine in terms of my numbers whatever

4348
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:40,160
because a lot many people knew me who

4349
02:18:38,959 --> 02:18:42,398
were on the left

4350
02:18:40,159 --> 02:18:43,439
and if you know my right listeners

4351
02:18:42,398 --> 02:18:45,840
abandoned me

4352
02:18:43,439 --> 02:18:46,880
so be it i was had the luxury of able to

4353
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:50,000
take that choice

4354
02:18:46,879 --> 02:18:50,799
but i still felt an immense amount of

4355
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,040
pressure

4356
02:18:50,799 --> 02:18:54,159
to say the election was stolen to give

4357
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:55,359
credence to a lot of the stuff that

4358
02:18:54,159 --> 02:18:58,558
trump was doing

4359
02:18:55,359 --> 02:18:59,920
to downplay january 6th to downplay many

4360
02:18:58,558 --> 02:19:01,438
of the republican senators

4361
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:03,120
or justify many of the republican

4362
02:19:01,439 --> 02:19:04,960
senators some of whom i know

4363
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:07,040
who objected to the electoral college

4364
02:19:04,959 --> 02:19:09,759
certification and who stoked

4365
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:11,519
some of the flames um that have eaten

4366
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:14,398
the republican base

4367
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:15,280
and i just wouldn't do it and that was

4368
02:19:14,398 --> 02:19:19,279
hard man

4369
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:20,000
like i feel more politically homeless

4370
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:23,519
right now than i

4371
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,799
ever have but i have realized

4372
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:26,318
in the last couple of months that's the

4373
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:26,959
best thing that ever happened to me it's

4374
02:19:26,318 --> 02:19:30,000
freedom

4375
02:19:26,959 --> 02:19:32,959
it's true freedom i now say i

4376
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:34,799
say exactly what i think and it's not

4377
02:19:32,959 --> 02:19:37,358
that i wasn't doing that before

4378
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:38,638
it's maybe um i would avoid certain

4379
02:19:37,359 --> 02:19:41,120
topics or like

4380
02:19:38,638 --> 02:19:43,438
i would think about things more from a

4381
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:43,840
team perspective of like am i making

4382
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:46,318
sure

4383
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:48,239
that it's it's i'm not saying i didn't

4384
02:19:46,318 --> 02:19:49,920
fight it i still i criticized the right

4385
02:19:48,239 --> 02:19:51,280
plenty and trump plenty before the

4386
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:54,239
election and more

4387
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:55,439
it's more just like i no longer feel as

4388
02:19:54,239 --> 02:19:58,398
if i even have

4389
02:19:55,439 --> 02:20:00,639
the illusion of a stake within the game

4390
02:19:58,398 --> 02:20:03,439
i'm like i only look at myself

4391
02:20:00,639 --> 02:20:05,119
as an outside observer and i will only

4392
02:20:03,439 --> 02:20:07,280
call it as i see it

4393
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:08,240
truly and i i was aspiring to that

4394
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:11,760
before

4395
02:20:08,239 --> 02:20:13,760
but i i had to have in a way

4396
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:14,960
trump's stopped the steel thing it like

4397
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:17,040
took my shackles off

4398
02:20:14,959 --> 02:20:18,959
100 yeah cause i was like no this is

4399
02:20:17,040 --> 02:20:20,560
[ __ ] and i'm gonna say it's [ __ ]

4400
02:20:18,959 --> 02:20:22,239
and i think it's bad and i think it's

4401
02:20:20,559 --> 02:20:24,000
bad for the republican party

4402
02:20:22,239 --> 02:20:25,520
and if people in the republican party

4403
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,159
don't agree with me on that

4404
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:30,079
that's fine i'm just not gonna be

4405
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:30,719
necessarily like associated with you

4406
02:20:30,079 --> 02:20:31,840
anymore

4407
02:20:30,719 --> 02:20:34,159
this is probably one of the first

4408
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:35,760
political related politics-related

4409
02:20:34,159 --> 02:20:37,600
conversations we've had

4410
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:39,439
uh i mean unless you caught michael

4411
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:43,120
malus who he was great

4412
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:45,120
yeah i he's the funny guy he's not

4413
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:47,600
so much political as he is like burning

4414
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:50,319
down man

4415
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:50,640
he leans too far in anarchy for me yeah

4416
02:20:50,318 --> 02:20:53,119
i

4417
02:20:50,639 --> 02:20:54,159
i think he's uh there's a place for that

4418
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:55,680
it's it's almost

4419
02:20:54,159 --> 02:20:57,840
well first of all he's uh he's working

4420
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:58,479
on a new book which i really appreciate

4421
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:00,478
outside of

4422
02:20:58,478 --> 02:21:02,159
he's working on like a big book for a

4423
02:21:00,478 --> 02:21:05,519
while which is white pill

4424
02:21:02,159 --> 02:21:08,079
he's also working on this like

4425
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:09,040
short little thing which is uh like

4426
02:21:08,079 --> 02:21:11,520
anarchist

4427
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:13,040
um handbook or something like that yeah

4428
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:14,720
it's like anarchy for idiots or

4429
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:18,880
something like that

4430
02:21:14,719 --> 02:21:18,879
which i think is really yeah

4431
02:21:18,959 --> 02:21:22,639
well me being an idiot right and being

4432
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:24,239
curious about anarchy

4433
02:21:22,639 --> 02:21:26,318
seems useful so i like those kinds of

4434
02:21:24,239 --> 02:21:29,600
books that's russian heritage man yeah

4435
02:21:26,318 --> 02:21:32,000
anarchist 101 yeah i mean it's a uh

4436
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:33,520
i find those kinds of things a useful

4437
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:36,959
thought experiment

4438
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:38,479
because uh that's why and then it's it's

4439
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:40,239
frustrating to me when people talk about

4440
02:21:38,478 --> 02:21:43,039
communism or socialism

4441
02:21:40,239 --> 02:21:46,000
or even capitalism where they can't

4442
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:49,680
enjoy the thought experiment of like

4443
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:52,559
why did uh communism

4444
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:53,120
fail and maybe ask the question of like

4445
02:21:52,559 --> 02:21:55,359
are there

4446
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:57,200
is it possible to make communism succeed

4447
02:21:55,359 --> 02:21:59,200
or are there good ideas in communism

4448
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:01,600
like i enjoy the thought experiment like

4449
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:02,880
this the the discourse of it like the

4450
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:04,880
the reasoning and like

4451
02:22:02,879 --> 02:22:06,799
devil's advocate and all that people

4452
02:22:04,879 --> 02:22:08,318
have like seem to not have patience for

4453
02:22:06,799 --> 02:22:10,879
that they're like communism bad

4454
02:22:08,318 --> 02:22:11,519
red i was obsessed with the question and

4455
02:22:10,879 --> 02:22:14,559
still am

4456
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:18,399
i will never be i will never

4457
02:22:14,559 --> 02:22:22,000
quench my thirst for russian history

4458
02:22:18,398 --> 02:22:26,719
i love that period

4459
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:30,079
of 1890 to 1925.

4460
02:22:26,719 --> 02:22:33,199
it's just like it's so [ __ ] crazy

4461
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:35,520
like the autocracy embodied in

4462
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:37,439
zara alexander and then you get this

4463
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:40,720
like weird fail son

4464
02:22:37,439 --> 02:22:42,800
nicholas who is kind of a good guy

4465
02:22:40,719 --> 02:22:44,879
but also terrible and also russian

4466
02:22:42,799 --> 02:22:46,879
autocracy itself is terrible

4467
02:22:44,879 --> 02:22:48,318
and then i just became obsessed with the

4468
02:22:46,879 --> 02:22:49,438
question of like why did the bolshevik

4469
02:22:48,318 --> 02:22:51,439
revolution succeed

4470
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:53,760
because like people in russia didn't

4471
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:56,239
necessarily want bolshevism

4472
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:58,079
people suffered a lot under bolshevism

4473
02:22:56,239 --> 02:23:01,359
and it led to stalinism

4474
02:22:58,079 --> 02:23:04,318
how did vladimir lenin do it right like

4475
02:23:01,359 --> 02:23:06,159
and i became obsessed with that question

4476
02:23:04,318 --> 02:23:07,439
and it's still i find it so interesting

4477
02:23:06,159 --> 02:23:10,559
which is that

4478
02:23:07,439 --> 02:23:13,760
series of accidents of history

4479
02:23:10,559 --> 02:23:17,680
incredible boldness by lenin

4480
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:20,318
incredible real politic smart

4481
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:21,680
unpopular decisions made by trotsky and

4482
02:23:20,318 --> 02:23:25,279
stalin

4483
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:28,880
and just like the arrogance of the czars

4484
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:31,920
and of the of the russian

4485
02:23:28,879 --> 02:23:33,679
like autocracy and just but at the same

4486
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:35,600
time there's all these like cultural

4487
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:37,600
implications of this right in terms of

4488
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:40,079
like how it became hollowed out

4489
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:40,800
post catherine the great and all that i

4490
02:23:40,079 --> 02:23:42,799
was obsessed with

4491
02:23:40,799 --> 02:23:43,920
talk because russia was an actual

4492
02:23:42,799 --> 02:23:45,679
autocracy

4493
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:48,159
and like actually and i'm like it was

4494
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:51,120
there like they didn't even

4495
02:23:48,159 --> 02:23:52,159
remove serfdom to like the civil war in

4496
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:54,319
america like that's

4497
02:23:52,159 --> 02:23:55,680
crazy like you know and nobody really

4498
02:23:54,318 --> 02:23:58,239
talks about it

4499
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:59,280
and i just beca yeah i was like was

4500
02:23:58,239 --> 02:24:02,318
bolshevism

4501
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:03,840
a natural reaction to the excesses of

4502
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:05,760
tsarism

4503
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:07,120
there is a convenient explanation where

4504
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:09,280
that is true

4505
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:11,600
but there were also a series of

4506
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:13,520
decisions made by lenin and stalin

4507
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:15,040
to kill many of the people in the center

4508
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:17,680
left and marginalize them

4509
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:18,399
to and also not to associate with the

4510
02:24:17,680 --> 02:24:22,000
more

4511
02:24:18,398 --> 02:24:22,959
quote unquote like uh like amenable

4512
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,799
communists

4513
02:24:22,959 --> 02:24:26,559
in order to make sure that their pure

4514
02:24:24,799 --> 02:24:28,719
strain of bolshevism

4515
02:24:26,559 --> 02:24:30,159
was the only thing and the reason i like

4516
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:30,719
that is because it comes back to a point

4517
02:24:30,159 --> 02:24:32,639
i made it

4518
02:24:30,719 --> 02:24:34,000
earlier it's all about intentionality

4519
02:24:32,639 --> 02:24:36,799
which is that you actually

4520
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:38,318
can will something into existence yes

4521
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:39,759
even if people don't want it

4522
02:24:38,318 --> 02:24:41,840
that was the craziest thing like that

4523
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:42,800
nobody wanted this yeah but it still

4524
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:45,280
ruled for

4525
02:24:42,799 --> 02:24:47,039
half a century well more actually i mean

4526
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:49,120
almost you know that's seven

4527
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:50,080
years to think that there could have

4528
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:53,200
been a history

4529
02:24:50,079 --> 02:24:56,639
of uh the soviet union

4530
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:59,359
that was dramatically different than uh

4531
02:24:56,639 --> 02:25:01,039
leninism stalinism

4532
02:24:59,359 --> 02:25:03,520
that was completely different like

4533
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:06,160
almost would be the american story yeah

4534
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:07,680
oh easily i mean there's a world where

4535
02:25:06,159 --> 02:25:09,520
and i don't have all the characters

4536
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:10,159
there's like karensky and then there was

4537
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:12,000
like

4538
02:25:10,159 --> 02:25:13,520
uh whoever lenin's number two stalin's

4539
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:15,280
chief rival and even

4540
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:16,960
i mean look even a soviet union led by

4541
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:19,359
trotsky that's a whole other world

4542
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:20,398
right like literally a whole other world

4543
02:25:19,359 --> 02:25:22,079
and

4544
02:25:20,398 --> 02:25:23,199
yeah it's just i don't know i find it so

4545
02:25:22,079 --> 02:25:24,478
interesting i will never not be

4546
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:26,399
fascinated by russia

4547
02:25:24,478 --> 02:25:27,519
i always will it's funny that i get to

4548
02:25:26,398 --> 02:25:29,039
talk to you because it's like

4549
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:30,560
i read this book i forget what it's

4550
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:31,200
called it won i think it won a pause

4551
02:25:30,559 --> 02:25:34,879
surprise

4552
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:35,439
and it was like the story of i tried to

4553
02:25:34,879 --> 02:25:38,719
understand

4554
02:25:35,439 --> 02:25:40,559
russia post crimea because i i

4555
02:25:38,719 --> 02:25:41,920
came up amongst people who are much more

4556
02:25:40,559 --> 02:25:42,639
like neoconservative and they're like

4557
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:44,639
[ __ ] russia

4558
02:25:42,639 --> 02:25:46,159
russia bad bye and i was like okay like

4559
02:25:44,639 --> 02:25:48,559
what do these people think

4560
02:25:46,159 --> 02:25:50,318
and we have this narrative of like the

4561
02:25:48,559 --> 02:25:50,879
fall of the soviet union and then i read

4562
02:25:50,318 --> 02:25:53,039
this book

4563
02:25:50,879 --> 02:25:54,318
from the perspective of russians who

4564
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:54,720
lived through the fall and they were

4565
02:25:54,318 --> 02:25:56,559
like this

4566
02:25:54,719 --> 02:25:58,318
i was like this is terrible like

4567
02:25:56,559 --> 02:25:59,439
actually the introduction of capitalism

4568
02:25:58,318 --> 02:26:02,159
was awful

4569
02:25:59,439 --> 02:26:02,960
and all like the rise of all these crazy

4570
02:26:02,159 --> 02:26:06,000
oligarchs

4571
02:26:02,959 --> 02:26:09,679
that's why putin was came to power

4572
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:12,318
to like restore um restore

4573
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:13,840
order to the oligarchy and he still

4574
02:26:12,318 --> 02:26:15,600
talks to this day do you guys i mean

4575
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:17,120
that's always the threat of like do you

4576
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:19,920
want to return to the 90s

4577
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:21,520
right do you want to return yeah and and

4578
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:23,600
like but the thing is in the west

4579
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:25,280
we have this like our own propaganda of

4580
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:26,880
like no yeltsin was great that was the

4581
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:28,319
golden age what could have been

4582
02:26:26,879 --> 02:26:30,079
with russia and i was like well what do

4583
02:26:28,318 --> 02:26:33,199
actual russians think

4584
02:26:30,079 --> 02:26:34,000
and so that yeah i i i'll always be

4585
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:37,120
fascinated by

4586
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:40,559
it and then just like to understand the

4587
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:42,240
idea of feeling encircled by nato

4588
02:26:40,559 --> 02:26:43,760
and all that you have to understand like

4589
02:26:42,239 --> 02:26:45,680
russian defense

4590
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:47,439
theory all the way up going back to the

4591
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:50,559
tsars has always been

4592
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:52,639
defense in depth in terms of having

4593
02:26:50,559 --> 02:26:54,719
estonia lithuania and more as like

4594
02:26:52,639 --> 02:26:56,478
protection of the heartland i'm not

4595
02:26:54,719 --> 02:26:57,840
justifying in this so nato shills like

4596
02:26:56,478 --> 02:27:00,719
please don't come after me

4597
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:02,159
but and look estonian estonians like

4598
02:27:00,719 --> 02:27:03,438
nato they want to be in nato so i don't

4599
02:27:02,159 --> 02:27:04,159
want to minimize that i'm more just

4600
02:27:03,439 --> 02:27:07,520
saying like

4601
02:27:04,159 --> 02:27:10,159
i understand him and russia much better

4602
02:27:07,520 --> 02:27:11,840
having done that and we're very

4603
02:27:10,159 --> 02:27:12,719
incapable in america i think this is

4604
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:14,159
probably because my parents are

4605
02:27:12,719 --> 02:27:16,559
immigrants and i've traveled a lot

4606
02:27:14,159 --> 02:27:17,200
of putting yourself in the mind of

4607
02:27:16,559 --> 02:27:20,318
people

4608
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:20,960
who aren't western and haven't lived a

4609
02:27:20,318 --> 02:27:22,559
history

4610
02:27:20,959 --> 02:27:23,679
especially our lives of america is

4611
02:27:22,559 --> 02:27:24,559
[ __ ] awesome we're the number one

4612
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:25,920
country in the world

4613
02:27:24,559 --> 02:27:27,840
yeah i'm like we're literally better

4614
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:30,799
than you like in many ways

4615
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:32,478
and they they they can't empathize with

4616
02:27:30,799 --> 02:27:34,719
people who have suffered

4617
02:27:32,478 --> 02:27:35,920
so much yeah and i just yeah it's just

4618
02:27:34,719 --> 02:27:37,920
so interesting to me

4619
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:39,920
what about if we could talk for just a

4620
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:44,478
brief moment about the human of

4621
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:48,239
putin and power

4622
02:27:44,478 --> 02:27:51,438
you are clearly fascinated by power

4623
02:27:48,239 --> 02:27:54,239
do you think power changed putin

4624
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:55,200
do you think power changes leaders if

4625
02:27:54,239 --> 02:27:57,840
you look at the

4626
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:59,200
great leaders in history whether it's

4627
02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:02,478
lbj

4628
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:04,159
fdr do you think power really changes

4629
02:28:02,478 --> 02:28:04,959
people like is there truth to that kind

4630
02:28:04,159 --> 02:28:07,760
of old

4631
02:28:04,959 --> 02:28:08,239
proverb it reveals i think that's what

4632
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:12,000
it is

4633
02:28:08,239 --> 02:28:13,039
it reveals so putin was a much more deft

4634
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:15,439
politician

4635
02:28:13,040 --> 02:28:18,080
much more amenable to the west if you

4636
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:19,760
think back you know to 2001 and more

4637
02:28:18,079 --> 02:28:21,760
right when he came because he was still

4638
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:23,760
because at that time his biggest problem

4639
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:25,520
was intra-russian politics

4640
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:27,359
right like it was all consolidating

4641
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:30,880
power within the oligarchy

4642
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:33,520
once he did that by around like 2007

4643
02:28:30,879 --> 02:28:35,119
there's that famous time when he spoke

4644
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:37,359
out against the west at the munich

4645
02:28:35,120 --> 02:28:38,960
security conference i forget when it was

4646
02:28:37,359 --> 02:28:40,640
and that's when everybody in the

4647
02:28:38,959 --> 02:28:42,879
audience was like whoa and he was

4648
02:28:40,639 --> 02:28:45,039
talking about like nato encirclement and

4649
02:28:42,879 --> 02:28:46,959
like we will not be beaten back

4650
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:49,120
by the west very shortly afterwards like

4651
02:28:46,959 --> 02:28:50,959
the georgia invasion happens

4652
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:52,399
and that was like a big wake up call of

4653
02:28:50,959 --> 02:28:53,119
like we will not be pushed around

4654
02:28:52,398 --> 02:28:55,358
anymore

4655
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:56,960
i mean he said before publicly like the

4656
02:28:55,359 --> 02:28:57,520
worst thing that ever happened was the

4657
02:28:56,959 --> 02:28:58,639
fall or

4658
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:00,720
what did he say it was like the fall of

4659
02:28:58,639 --> 02:29:02,079
the soviet union was a tragedy right

4660
02:29:00,719 --> 02:29:03,119
yeah of course people in the west were

4661
02:29:02,079 --> 02:29:04,559
like what i'm like

4662
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:06,800
i get it right like they were a

4663
02:29:04,559 --> 02:29:08,799
superpower now their

4664
02:29:06,799 --> 02:29:10,159
population is declining like it's like a

4665
02:29:08,799 --> 02:29:13,279
petrol state it sucks

4666
02:29:10,159 --> 02:29:13,680
like i understand um i understand like

4667
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:15,760
how

4668
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:17,520
somebody could feel about that i think

4669
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:21,040
it revealed his character

4670
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:23,439
um which is that he

4671
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:25,840
i think he thinks of himself probably as

4672
02:29:23,439 --> 02:29:28,079
he always has since 2001

4673
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:29,760
as like this benevolent almost as a

4674
02:29:28,079 --> 02:29:31,200
benevolent dictator he's like without me

4675
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:32,719
the whole system would collapse

4676
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:34,000
i'm the only guys keeping these people

4677
02:29:32,719 --> 02:29:35,199
and i'm the only guy keeping all these

4678
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:38,318
people in check

4679
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:40,880
most russians probably do support putin

4680
02:29:38,318 --> 02:29:41,359
because they feel like they support some

4681
02:29:40,879 --> 02:29:44,559
form

4682
02:29:41,359 --> 02:29:45,520
of functional government it's like a

4683
02:29:44,559 --> 02:29:47,920
check

4684
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:49,200
against that which is a long you know

4685
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:52,559
has a long history

4686
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:54,560
within russia too so i don't know if it

4687
02:29:52,559 --> 02:29:56,159
changed him i think it just revealed him

4688
02:29:54,559 --> 02:29:57,840
um because it's not like he i mean he

4689
02:29:56,159 --> 02:30:00,559
has a bill you know navalny has put that

4690
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:02,478
like billion dollar palace and all that

4691
02:30:00,559 --> 02:30:03,600
i don't know sometimes i feel like putin

4692
02:30:02,478 --> 02:30:05,119
does that for show

4693
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:07,120
he doesn't seem like somebody who

4694
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:08,720
indulges in all that stuff or maybe we

4695
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:09,200
just don't see it like i don't know well

4696
02:30:08,719 --> 02:30:10,799
i don't

4697
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:12,159
i it's very difficult for me to

4698
02:30:10,799 --> 02:30:13,759
understand i've been hanging out thanks

4699
02:30:12,159 --> 02:30:16,159
to clubhouse

4700
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:17,200
a lot of i've gotten to learn a lot

4701
02:30:16,159 --> 02:30:19,439
about the

4702
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:21,200
navalny folks and it's been very

4703
02:30:19,439 --> 02:30:23,760
educational

4704
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:24,880
made me ask a lot of important questions

4705
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:26,559
about what

4706
02:30:24,879 --> 02:30:28,159
um you know question a lot of my

4707
02:30:26,559 --> 02:30:29,279
assumptions about what i do and don't

4708
02:30:28,159 --> 02:30:33,119
know

4709
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:34,880
but i'll just say that

4710
02:30:33,120 --> 02:30:36,640
i do believe you know there's a lot of

4711
02:30:34,879 --> 02:30:38,000
the navalny folks say that putin is

4712
02:30:36,639 --> 02:30:40,959
incompetent

4713
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:42,559
and there's a is a bad uh executive like

4714
02:30:40,959 --> 02:30:46,318
is bad at

4715
02:30:42,559 --> 02:30:48,799
basically running government but to me

4716
02:30:46,318 --> 02:30:49,439
why do russians not think that right

4717
02:30:48,799 --> 02:30:51,199
well they

4718
02:30:49,439 --> 02:30:52,479
probably would probably press right yeah

4719
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:55,200
they will say the control there

4720
02:30:52,478 --> 02:30:56,559
there is a strong either control or

4721
02:30:55,200 --> 02:30:58,240
pressure on the press

4722
02:30:56,559 --> 02:31:00,799
but i think there is a legitimate

4723
02:30:58,239 --> 02:31:02,639
support and love of putin in russia

4724
02:31:00,799 --> 02:31:05,279
that is not grounded in just

4725
02:31:02,639 --> 02:31:07,519
misinformation and uh propaganda there's

4726
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:10,079
there's legitimacy there

4727
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:10,880
mostly i try to remain apolitical and

4728
02:31:10,079 --> 02:31:13,039
actually

4729
02:31:10,879 --> 02:31:15,679
genuinely remain up apolitical i am

4730
02:31:13,040 --> 02:31:18,800
legitimately not interested

4731
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:20,800
in the politics of russia of today

4732
02:31:18,799 --> 02:31:23,119
i feel i have some responsibility and

4733
02:31:20,799 --> 02:31:24,079
i'll take it that responsibility on as i

4734
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:26,479
need to but

4735
02:31:24,079 --> 02:31:28,318
my fascination as it is perhaps with you

4736
02:31:26,478 --> 02:31:30,799
in part is

4737
02:31:28,318 --> 02:31:32,159
in the historical figure of putin i know

4738
02:31:30,799 --> 02:31:34,239
he's currently president

4739
02:31:32,159 --> 02:31:36,318
but i'm almost looking like as if i was

4740
02:31:34,239 --> 02:31:36,959
a kid in 30 years from now reading about

4741
02:31:36,318 --> 02:31:40,079
him

4742
02:31:36,959 --> 02:31:43,358
studying the the human being

4743
02:31:40,079 --> 02:31:44,959
the the games of power that are played

4744
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:47,359
that got him to

4745
02:31:44,959 --> 02:31:48,719
gain power to maintain power what that

4746
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:52,479
says about

4747
02:31:48,719 --> 02:31:54,799
his human nature the the nature of

4748
02:31:52,478 --> 02:31:56,799
the bureaucracy that's around him the

4749
02:31:54,799 --> 02:31:58,719
nature of russia the people

4750
02:31:56,799 --> 02:32:00,639
all those kinds of things as opposed to

4751
02:31:58,719 --> 02:32:01,920
the politics and the manipulation and

4752
02:32:00,639 --> 02:32:04,079
the corruption and the

4753
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:05,439
control of the media that results in

4754
02:32:04,079 --> 02:32:07,039
misinformation

4755
02:32:05,439 --> 02:32:08,479
you know those those are the bickering

4756
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:10,240
of the day just like we're saying

4757
02:32:08,478 --> 02:32:12,159
what will actually be remembered about

4758
02:32:10,239 --> 02:32:13,520
this moment in history totally he's a

4759
02:32:12,159 --> 02:32:15,520
transformational figure in russian

4760
02:32:13,520 --> 02:32:16,800
history really like the bridge between

4761
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:18,399
the fall of the soviet union and the

4762
02:32:16,799 --> 02:32:21,039
chaos of yeltsin

4763
02:32:18,398 --> 02:32:22,159
that will be how he's remembered the

4764
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:24,240
only question is what comes

4765
02:32:22,159 --> 02:32:25,760
next and what he wants to come next

4766
02:32:24,239 --> 02:32:27,280
that's i'm always fat i'm like

4767
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:30,318
he's getting up how old is he 60

4768
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:32,880
something yeah 60 so he would be

4769
02:32:30,318 --> 02:32:34,000
i think he would be 80 so with the with

4770
02:32:32,879 --> 02:32:37,199
the change of the

4771
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:41,120
constitution he cannot be president

4772
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:41,120
until uh

4773
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:46,800
uh 2034 i think it is

4774
02:32:44,398 --> 02:32:48,318
so he would be like 80 something and he

4775
02:32:46,799 --> 02:32:50,719
would be in power for over 30 years

4776
02:32:48,318 --> 02:32:54,159
which is longer than stalin

4777
02:32:50,719 --> 02:32:56,559
so but he's still he still seems to be

4778
02:32:54,159 --> 02:32:58,318
he seems fit i think he's gonna be

4779
02:32:56,559 --> 02:32:59,760
around for a long time but this is a

4780
02:32:58,318 --> 02:33:00,398
fascinating question that you ask which

4781
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:02,559
is like

4782
02:33:00,398 --> 02:33:04,398
what does he want i don't know yeah

4783
02:33:02,559 --> 02:33:06,559
that's the question i don't i uh

4784
02:33:04,398 --> 02:33:07,680
and this is where i think given all of

4785
02:33:06,559 --> 02:33:09,439
his behavior and more

4786
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:11,040
i don't know if it's about money i don't

4787
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:12,960
know if it's about enriching himself

4788
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:15,040
obviously he did to the tune of billions

4789
02:33:12,959 --> 02:33:18,000
and billions and billions of dollars

4790
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:18,880
but i think he probably he's as close to

4791
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,520
like an actual

4792
02:33:18,879 --> 02:33:23,039
russian nationalist like at the top who

4793
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:25,920
really does believe

4794
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:28,000
in russia as its rightful superpower

4795
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:30,478
everything he does seems to stem

4796
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,639
from that opposition to nato intro to

4797
02:33:30,478 --> 02:33:35,679
syria like wanting to play

4798
02:33:32,639 --> 02:33:38,719
a large role in uh affairs

4799
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:41,520
deeply distrustful and yet coveting

4800
02:33:38,719 --> 02:33:42,159
of the european powers like look i could

4801
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:44,079
describe

4802
02:33:42,159 --> 02:33:45,920
every czar you know in those same

4803
02:33:44,079 --> 02:33:47,039
language like every czar falls into the

4804
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:49,200
exact same category

4805
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:50,560
yeah and i mean it makes me wonder

4806
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:52,960
looking at some of the

4807
02:33:50,559 --> 02:33:54,159
biggest leaders in human history to ask

4808
02:33:52,959 --> 02:33:55,599
the question of

4809
02:33:54,159 --> 02:33:57,280
what was the motivation what was the

4810
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:59,520
motivation for even just the

4811
02:33:57,280 --> 02:34:01,920
revolutionaries like lennon trotsky

4812
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:04,319
and stalin what was the motivation

4813
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:07,840
because it sure as hell seems

4814
02:34:04,318 --> 02:34:11,359
like the motivation was at least in part

4815
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:15,439
the driven by the idea

4816
02:34:11,359 --> 02:34:17,439
by ideas not self interest of like power

4817
02:34:15,439 --> 02:34:18,559
for lenin it was i think he was a true

4818
02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:20,318
believer and an

4819
02:34:18,559 --> 02:34:22,239
actual narcissist who thought he was the

4820
02:34:20,318 --> 02:34:23,519
only one who could do it stalin i do

4821
02:34:22,239 --> 02:34:25,520
think just wanted power

4822
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:26,960
and realized well i don't know look he

4823
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:27,680
wrote very passionately when he was

4824
02:34:26,959 --> 02:34:29,679
young

4825
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:31,120
and he was he really believed in

4826
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:33,520
communism in the beginning he did

4827
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:34,319
i i i always what i'm always fascinated

4828
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:36,800
is i'm like

4829
02:34:34,318 --> 02:34:38,318
around 1920 what happened right

4830
02:34:36,799 --> 02:34:40,799
post-revolution

4831
02:34:38,318 --> 02:34:42,398
you crushed the whites now it's all

4832
02:34:40,799 --> 02:34:44,879
about consolidation

4833
02:34:42,398 --> 02:34:46,239
that's where the games really begin yeah

4834
02:34:44,879 --> 02:34:47,519
i mean i'm like i don't think that was

4835
02:34:46,239 --> 02:34:50,639
about communism

4836
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:52,880
yeah yeah yeah

4837
02:34:50,639 --> 02:34:53,760
yeah maybe it became a useful propaganda

4838
02:34:52,879 --> 02:34:55,920
tool but it still

4839
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:57,200
seemed like he believed in it uh whether

4840
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:59,040
it was of course

4841
02:34:57,200 --> 02:35:00,960
this the question i mean this is the

4842
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:02,319
problem with uh conspiracy theories for

4843
02:35:00,959 --> 02:35:04,559
me

4844
02:35:02,318 --> 02:35:07,359
and this is legitimate criticism towards

4845
02:35:04,559 --> 02:35:09,359
me about conspiracy theories which is uh

4846
02:35:07,359 --> 02:35:10,880
you know just because you're not like

4847
02:35:09,359 --> 02:35:12,960
this doesn't mean others aren't like

4848
02:35:10,879 --> 02:35:14,398
this so like i can't believe that

4849
02:35:12,959 --> 02:35:17,438
somebody'd be

4850
02:35:14,398 --> 02:35:20,239
like deeply two-faced oh i've met them

4851
02:35:17,439 --> 02:35:22,318
you're welcome to washington

4852
02:35:20,239 --> 02:35:24,398
but like i think that i would be able to

4853
02:35:22,318 --> 02:35:27,680
detect

4854
02:35:24,398 --> 02:35:29,680
like no people are good well this

4855
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:30,720
my question is i've seen it i mean well

4856
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:33,920
so this difference this

4857
02:35:30,719 --> 02:35:36,079
just two-face like uh there's

4858
02:35:33,920 --> 02:35:37,520
different levels of two-face like what i

4859
02:35:36,079 --> 02:35:40,719
mean is to be

4860
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:43,680
killing people and uh

4861
02:35:40,719 --> 02:35:46,478
it's like house of cards style right and

4862
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:49,040
and still present a front like you're

4863
02:35:46,478 --> 02:35:49,679
you're like you're not killing people i

4864
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:52,560
don't know

4865
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:54,720
if i guess it's possible but i just

4866
02:35:52,559 --> 02:35:56,239
don't see that at scale

4867
02:35:54,719 --> 02:35:58,079
uh like there's a lot of people like

4868
02:35:56,239 --> 02:36:00,159
that and i don't i have trouble

4869
02:35:58,079 --> 02:36:02,719
imagining

4870
02:36:00,159 --> 02:36:04,079
um some you know that's such a

4871
02:36:02,719 --> 02:36:08,079
compelling narrative

4872
02:36:04,079 --> 02:36:09,840
that people like to say like people

4873
02:36:08,079 --> 02:36:11,200
that's the conspiratorial mindset i

4874
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:13,439
think that skepticism was really

4875
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:15,200
powerful and important to have because

4876
02:36:13,439 --> 02:36:17,840
it's true a lot of powerful people abuse

4877
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:21,680
their power but saying that a bottle

4878
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:23,439
i feel like people over assume that

4879
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:25,439
it's like i see that with the use of

4880
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:28,318
steroids often in sports

4881
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:30,559
people seem to make that claim about

4882
02:36:28,318 --> 02:36:32,239
like everybody who's successful

4883
02:36:30,559 --> 02:36:33,840
and i want to be very i don't know

4884
02:36:32,239 --> 02:36:35,520
something about me wants to be cautious

4885
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:38,079
because

4886
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:39,760
i want to give people a chance being

4887
02:36:38,079 --> 02:36:41,120
purely cynical isn't helpful people say

4888
02:36:39,760 --> 02:36:41,920
that's about me he's always saying this

4889
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:44,000
to do this

4890
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:45,920
yeah but at the same time being naively

4891
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:47,920
optimistic about everything is also

4892
02:36:45,920 --> 02:36:48,960
kind of productive because people are

4893
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:51,439
going to [ __ ] you over

4894
02:36:48,959 --> 02:36:52,879
and more importantly that doesn't bother

4895
02:36:51,439 --> 02:36:54,000
me more importantly you're not gonna be

4896
02:36:52,879 --> 02:36:55,438
able to reason about

4897
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:58,159
how to create systems that are going to

4898
02:36:55,439 --> 02:37:02,079
be robust to corruption to uh

4899
02:36:58,159 --> 02:37:04,879
malevolent uh like parties so

4900
02:37:02,079 --> 02:37:07,359
so in order to create you have to have a

4901
02:37:04,879 --> 02:37:08,719
healthy balance of both i suppose

4902
02:37:07,359 --> 02:37:10,640
especially if you want to actually

4903
02:37:08,719 --> 02:37:12,478
engineer things that that that work in

4904
02:37:10,639 --> 02:37:14,079
this world that has evil in it

4905
02:37:12,478 --> 02:37:16,159
right i can't believe there's a book of

4906
02:37:14,079 --> 02:37:18,478
hitler on the desk

4907
02:37:16,159 --> 02:37:20,318
um we've mentioned a lot of books

4908
02:37:18,478 --> 02:37:22,879
throughout this conversation

4909
02:37:20,318 --> 02:37:23,680
i wonder and this makes me really

4910
02:37:22,879 --> 02:37:27,438
curious to

4911
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:29,600
explore in a lot of depth

4912
02:37:27,439 --> 02:37:32,800
the kind of books that you're interested

4913
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:35,680
in i think you mentioned in your show

4914
02:37:32,799 --> 02:37:36,079
that you uh you provide recommendations

4915
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:39,359
yes

4916
02:37:36,079 --> 02:37:40,799
i do in the form of spoken word

4917
02:37:39,359 --> 02:37:42,960
can you be on what we've already

4918
02:37:40,799 --> 02:37:46,478
recommended mention

4919
02:37:42,959 --> 02:37:48,719
books whether it is historical

4920
02:37:46,478 --> 02:37:50,799
uh non-fiction or whether it's more like

4921
02:37:48,719 --> 02:37:52,079
philosophical or even fiction that had a

4922
02:37:50,799 --> 02:37:53,759
big impact on your life

4923
02:37:52,079 --> 02:37:55,359
so is there a few that you can mention

4924
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:57,200
sure i already talked about the johnson

4925
02:37:55,359 --> 02:37:57,840
book so i'll leave that alone robert a

4926
02:37:57,200 --> 02:37:59,760
carro

4927
02:37:57,840 --> 02:38:01,439
he's still alive thank god he's

4928
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:04,159
finishing the last book

4929
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:05,359
uh i hope he makes it so that those

4930
02:38:04,159 --> 02:38:06,959
johnson books

4931
02:38:05,359 --> 02:38:08,880
second but can i ask you a question

4932
02:38:06,959 --> 02:38:10,879
about those books yes what the

4933
02:38:08,879 --> 02:38:12,799
hell do you fit into so many pages

4934
02:38:10,879 --> 02:38:14,079
everything man

4935
02:38:12,799 --> 02:38:15,438
let me tell you this so i'll just give

4936
02:38:14,079 --> 02:38:16,318
it an anecdote this is why i love these

4937
02:38:15,439 --> 02:38:18,318
books

4938
02:38:16,318 --> 02:38:19,439
the beginning the first book is about

4939
02:38:18,318 --> 02:38:21,760
lyndon johnson yes

4940
02:38:19,439 --> 02:38:22,639
his life to when he gets elected to

4941
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:26,079
congress

4942
02:38:22,639 --> 02:38:28,398
the book begins with a history of texas

4943
02:38:26,079 --> 02:38:29,280
and its weather patterns and then of his

4944
02:38:28,398 --> 02:38:32,639
great

4945
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:35,040
great grandfather moving to texas yes

4946
02:38:32,639 --> 02:38:36,318
then the story of that about a hundred

4947
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:39,359
or so pages in you get to

4948
02:38:36,318 --> 02:38:39,760
lyndon johnson yes that's that's how you

4949
02:38:39,359 --> 02:38:42,960
do it

4950
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:44,639
okay which is you like a tolstoy this is

4951
02:38:42,959 --> 02:38:45,679
the thing it's not a biography it's a

4952
02:38:44,639 --> 02:38:48,639
story of the times

4953
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:50,220
that's a great biography so another one

4954
02:38:48,639 --> 02:38:51,920
this isn't part of my list so don't

4955
02:38:50,219 --> 02:38:53,840
[Laughter]

4956
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:56,239
is all right grant off the record ron

4957
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:57,359
chernow ron chernow's grant it's a

4958
02:38:56,239 --> 02:38:58,799
thousand pages

4959
02:38:57,359 --> 02:39:01,359
and the reason i tell everybody to read

4960
02:38:58,799 --> 02:39:04,159
it is it's not just the story of grant

4961
02:39:01,359 --> 02:39:06,079
it is the story of pre-civil war america

4962
02:39:04,159 --> 02:39:09,200
the mexican-american war

4963
02:39:06,079 --> 02:39:10,959
the civil war and reconstruction all

4964
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:12,399
told in the life of one person who was

4965
02:39:10,959 --> 02:39:13,358
involved in all three

4966
02:39:12,398 --> 02:39:14,639
most people don't know anything about

4967
02:39:13,359 --> 02:39:15,600
the mexican-american war it's

4968
02:39:14,639 --> 02:39:16,639
fascinating

4969
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:19,120
most people don't know anything about

4970
02:39:16,639 --> 02:39:20,879
reconstruction now more so because

4971
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:22,720
people are talking it's a hot topic now

4972
02:39:20,879 --> 02:39:24,000
i've been reading about it for years

4973
02:39:22,719 --> 02:39:26,478
that is another thing people

4974
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:28,639
need to learn a lot more about in terms

4975
02:39:26,478 --> 02:39:30,719
of non-history books

4976
02:39:28,639 --> 02:39:32,719
the book that probably had the most

4977
02:39:30,719 --> 02:39:36,079
impact on me which is also

4978
02:39:32,719 --> 02:39:40,559
a historical nonfiction is i

4979
02:39:36,079 --> 02:39:43,680
am obsessed with antarctic exploration

4980
02:39:40,559 --> 02:39:46,318
and it all began with a book called

4981
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:47,120
shackleton's incredible journey which is

4982
02:39:46,318 --> 02:39:49,680
the

4983
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:51,359
collection of diaries of everybody who

4984
02:39:49,680 --> 02:39:52,800
was on shackleton's journey for those

4985
02:39:51,359 --> 02:39:56,559
who don't know

4986
02:39:52,799 --> 02:39:58,639
shackleton was the last explorer

4987
02:39:56,559 --> 02:39:59,840
of the heroic age of antarctic

4988
02:39:58,639 --> 02:40:02,959
exploration

4989
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:06,478
he led a ship called the endurance

4990
02:40:02,959 --> 02:40:07,759
which froze in the ice um off the coast

4991
02:40:06,478 --> 02:40:10,959
of antarctica

4992
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:12,880
in 1914 and

4993
02:40:10,959 --> 02:40:15,119
they didn't have radios or the last

4994
02:40:12,879 --> 02:40:15,920
exploration a last one without the age

4995
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:18,720
of radio

4996
02:40:15,920 --> 02:40:19,439
and he happens to freeze in the ice and

4997
02:40:18,719 --> 02:40:22,318
then

4998
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:23,200
the ship collapses after a year frozen

4999
02:40:22,318 --> 02:40:27,278
in the ice

5000
02:40:23,200 --> 02:40:30,000
and this man leads his entire crew

5001
02:40:27,279 --> 02:40:31,120
from that ship onto the ice with a team

5002
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:34,318
of dogs

5003
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:37,279
survives out on the ice for another year

5004
02:40:34,318 --> 02:40:38,000
with three little lifeboats and is able

5005
02:40:37,279 --> 02:40:39,840
to get

5006
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:41,920
all of his men every single one of them

5007
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:43,760
alive to an island

5008
02:40:41,920 --> 02:40:45,600
hundreds of miles away called elephant

5009
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:48,719
island and when they got

5010
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:50,318
there he had to leave everybody behind

5011
02:40:48,719 --> 02:40:53,199
except for six people

5012
02:40:50,318 --> 02:40:54,639
and him and two other guys i'm

5013
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:58,880
forgetting their names

5014
02:40:54,639 --> 02:41:00,639
navigated by the stars 800 miles through

5015
02:40:58,879 --> 02:41:03,679
the drake passage with seas

5016
02:41:00,639 --> 02:41:05,599
of hundreds of feet to prince i think

5017
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:07,439
it's called prince george's island

5018
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:09,680
and then when they got to prince

5019
02:41:07,439 --> 02:41:10,239
george's island they landed on the wrong

5020
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:13,359
side

5021
02:41:10,239 --> 02:41:13,920
and they had to hike from one side to

5022
02:41:13,359 --> 02:41:16,399
the other

5023
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:17,760
to go and meet the whalers and every

5024
02:41:16,398 --> 02:41:18,799
single one of those things was supposed

5025
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:20,639
to be impossible

5026
02:41:18,799 --> 02:41:22,639
nobody was ever nobody was ever supposed

5027
02:41:20,639 --> 02:41:24,079
to hike that island it wasn't done again

5028
02:41:22,639 --> 02:41:26,159
until like the 1980s

5029
02:41:24,079 --> 02:41:28,079
with professional equipment he did it

5030
02:41:26,159 --> 02:41:31,119
after two years of starvation

5031
02:41:28,079 --> 02:41:34,318
nobody was ever supposed to make it from

5032
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:36,240
elephant island to prince the guy they

5033
02:41:34,318 --> 02:41:38,478
had to hold him steady his legs

5034
02:41:36,239 --> 02:41:39,920
so that he could chart the stars and if

5035
02:41:38,478 --> 02:41:42,719
they miss this island

5036
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:44,000
they're into open sea they're dead and

5037
02:41:42,719 --> 02:41:45,920
then before that

5038
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:47,359
how do you survive for a year on the ice

5039
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:50,478
yeah on seals

5040
02:41:47,359 --> 02:41:52,720
and before that he kept his crew

5041
02:41:50,478 --> 02:41:53,519
from depression frozen one year in the

5042
02:41:52,719 --> 02:41:56,079
ice

5043
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:57,120
it's just an amazing story and it made

5044
02:41:56,079 --> 02:41:58,639
me obsessed

5045
02:41:57,120 --> 02:42:00,560
with antarctic exploration so i've read

5046
02:41:58,639 --> 02:42:02,559
like 15 books on what the hell is it

5047
02:42:00,559 --> 02:42:03,840
about the human spirit that's amazing

5048
02:42:02,559 --> 02:42:05,760
that's the thing about antarctica is it

5049
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:06,478
brings it out of you so for example i

5050
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:09,279
read another one

5051
02:42:06,478 --> 02:42:11,278
recently called mawson's will douglas

5052
02:42:09,279 --> 02:42:12,720
mawson he was an australian he was on

5053
02:42:11,279 --> 02:42:14,479
the or one of the first

5054
02:42:12,719 --> 02:42:16,559
shackled uh frost robert frost

5055
02:42:14,478 --> 02:42:17,438
expeditions he leads an expedition down

5056
02:42:16,559 --> 02:42:20,559
to the south

5057
02:42:17,439 --> 02:42:23,279
him and a partner they're leading

5058
02:42:20,559 --> 02:42:24,318
uh explorations 1908 something like that

5059
02:42:23,279 --> 02:42:27,439
they're going around

5060
02:42:24,318 --> 02:42:30,398
antarctica with dog teams

5061
02:42:27,439 --> 02:42:31,439
and one of the what happens is they keep

5062
02:42:30,398 --> 02:42:33,119
going over these

5063
02:42:31,439 --> 02:42:34,479
snow bridges where there's a crevice but

5064
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:38,319
it's covered in snow

5065
02:42:34,478 --> 02:42:41,039
and so the one of the the lead driver

5066
02:42:38,318 --> 02:42:42,318
the dogs go over and they plummet and

5067
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:44,640
that sled

5068
02:42:42,318 --> 02:42:46,000
takes with it so the guy survives but

5069
02:42:44,639 --> 02:42:49,439
that sled takes

5070
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:52,719
all their food half the dogs their

5071
02:42:49,439 --> 02:42:54,559
stove the camping tent

5072
02:42:52,719 --> 02:42:56,000
the tent specifically designed for the

5073
02:42:54,559 --> 02:42:58,159
snow everything

5074
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:59,760
and they're hundreds of miles away from

5075
02:42:58,159 --> 02:43:02,079
base camp

5076
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:03,439
he and this guy have to make it back

5077
02:43:02,079 --> 02:43:05,600
there in time

5078
02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:07,520
before the ship comes to come get them

5079
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:10,159
on an agreed-upon date

5080
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:10,960
and he makes it but the guy he was with

5081
02:43:10,159 --> 02:43:12,639
he dies

5082
02:43:10,959 --> 02:43:14,239
and it's a crazy story they have first

5083
02:43:12,639 --> 02:43:15,760
of all they have to eat the dogs the a

5084
02:43:14,239 --> 02:43:17,520
really creepy part of antarctic

5085
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:18,000
exploration is everyone ends up eating

5086
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:20,479
dogs

5087
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:23,439
at different points yeah um and part of

5088
02:43:20,478 --> 02:43:26,719
the theory which is so crazy is that

5089
02:43:23,439 --> 02:43:29,520
the guy he was with was dying because

5090
02:43:26,719 --> 02:43:31,119
they were eating dog liver and dog liver

5091
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:33,120
has a lot of vitamin e

5092
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:34,560
which if you eat too much of it can give

5093
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:37,680
you like a poisoning

5094
02:43:34,559 --> 02:43:39,278
and so uh mawson by trying to help his

5095
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:41,120
friend was giving him more of

5096
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:42,479
all the things that kills you i know

5097
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:44,319
it's dog liver

5098
02:43:42,478 --> 02:43:45,679
so his friend ends up dying have a

5099
02:43:44,318 --> 02:43:48,478
horrific heart attack

5100
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:49,600
all of that mauson crawls back hundreds

5101
02:43:48,478 --> 02:43:52,398
of miles away

5102
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:54,079
makes it back to base camp hours after

5103
02:43:52,398 --> 02:43:56,639
the ship leaves

5104
02:43:54,079 --> 02:43:57,760
and two guys or a couple of guys stayed

5105
02:43:56,639 --> 02:43:59,439
behind for him

5106
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:01,760
and he basically has to recuperate for

5107
02:43:59,439 --> 02:44:02,398
like six months before he can even walk

5108
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:03,439
again

5109
02:44:02,398 --> 02:44:06,239
but it's like you're saying about the

5110
02:44:03,439 --> 02:44:08,239
human spirit it's like antarctica

5111
02:44:06,239 --> 02:44:10,398
brings that out of people or amundsen

5112
02:44:08,239 --> 02:44:13,600
the guy who made it to the south pole

5113
02:44:10,398 --> 02:44:16,639
robert amundsen oh my god like this guy

5114
02:44:13,600 --> 02:44:19,920
trained his whole life in the ice

5115
02:44:16,639 --> 02:44:22,239
from norway to make it to the south pole

5116
02:44:19,920 --> 02:44:23,680
and he beat robert frost the the british

5117
02:44:22,239 --> 02:44:25,920
guy with all this money

5118
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:27,200
and all these i could go on this forever

5119
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:29,200
i'm sorry i'm obsessed with it

5120
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:31,279

going to listen to this over and over in

5128
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:45,920
my head you're going to be

5129
02:44:44,318 --> 02:44:47,760
elon's obsessed with shackleton he talks

5130
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:49,120
about him all the time he uses

5131
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:51,840
i was going to ask you about that yeah

5132
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:54,240
as an example of

5133
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:56,159
that is a as an example of what mars

5134
02:44:54,239 --> 02:44:58,799
colonization

5135
02:44:56,159 --> 02:45:00,239
would be like he's right no that

5136
02:44:58,799 --> 02:45:03,278
antarctica is as close

5137
02:45:00,239 --> 02:45:04,959
to you can simulate that um

5138
02:45:03,279 --> 02:45:06,560
the antarctic goes as close to what you

5139
02:45:04,959 --> 02:45:09,119
could simulate what it would get that

5140
02:45:06,559 --> 02:45:09,920
that nat geo series on mars i'm not sure

5141
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:12,000
if you watched it

5142
02:45:09,920 --> 02:45:13,520
it's incredible elon's actually in it um

5143
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:15,680
and it kind of and it's like

5144
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:17,040
they get there everything goes wrong

5145
02:45:15,680 --> 02:45:19,439
somebody dies

5146
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:20,399
like it's horrible it they can't find

5147
02:45:19,439 --> 02:45:22,559
any water

5148
02:45:20,398 --> 02:45:23,840
it's not working so what what is it is

5149
02:45:22,559 --> 02:45:25,119
it like simulating the experience of

5150
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:27,359
what it'd be like

5151
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:28,880
so it's like a docu-series where the

5152
02:45:27,359 --> 02:45:32,159
fictionalized part

5153
02:45:28,879 --> 02:45:34,079
is the like astronauts on mars but then

5154
02:45:32,159 --> 02:45:35,600
they're interviewing people like elon

5155
02:45:34,079 --> 02:45:36,159
musk and others who are the ones who

5156
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:38,880
like

5157
02:45:36,159 --> 02:45:40,159
paved the way to get to mars this is a

5158
02:45:38,879 --> 02:45:43,119
really interesting concept

5159
02:45:40,159 --> 02:45:44,079
i think it's on netflix and yeah i agree

5160
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:46,160
with him 100

5161
02:45:44,079 --> 02:45:48,000
which is that the first guys to make

5162
02:45:46,159 --> 02:45:51,200
like for example robert frost who

5163
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:54,159
uh uh went to australia sorry

5164
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:56,079
to antarctica the british explorer who

5165
02:45:54,159 --> 02:45:58,478
was beaten to the south pole three weeks

5166
02:45:56,079 --> 02:46:00,239
by robert amundsen he died on the way

5167
02:45:58,478 --> 02:46:02,478
back and the reason why is because he

5168
02:46:00,239 --> 02:46:05,199
wasn't well prepared he was arrogant

5169
02:46:02,478 --> 02:46:06,079
he didn't have the proper amounts of

5170
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:08,880
supplies

5171
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:10,639
his team had terrible morale antarctica

5172
02:46:08,879 --> 02:46:13,438
is a brutal place if you [ __ ] up

5173
02:46:10,639 --> 02:46:14,799
one time you die and it's like you and

5174
02:46:13,439 --> 02:46:15,200
this is what you read a lot about which

5175
02:46:14,799 --> 02:46:17,039
is

5176
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:19,040
the reason why such heroic characters

5177
02:46:17,040 --> 02:46:21,520
like shackleton shine

5178
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:23,439
is a lot of people died like there were

5179
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:25,760
some people who got frozen in the eye

5180
02:46:23,439 --> 02:46:27,760
i mean man this again also came to the

5181
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:29,120
north exploration

5182
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:30,960
so i read a lot about like the

5183
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:35,040
exploration of the north pole

5184
02:46:30,959 --> 02:46:37,039
and same thing these unextraordinary men

5185
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:38,080
take people out into the ice and get

5186
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:41,120
frozen out there for

5187
02:46:38,079 --> 02:46:42,398
years and [ __ ] goes so bad they end up

5188
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:44,960
eating each other

5189
02:46:42,398 --> 02:46:46,079
they all die there's a famous one i'm

5190
02:46:44,959 --> 02:46:48,639
forgetting his name the british

5191
02:46:46,079 --> 02:46:50,719
franklin expedition where they went

5192
02:46:48,639 --> 02:46:52,159
searching for them for like 20 years

5193
02:46:50,719 --> 02:46:53,840
and they eventually came across a group

5194
02:46:52,159 --> 02:46:56,079
of inuit who were like oh yeah we saw

5195
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:56,719
some weird white men here like 15 years

5196
02:46:56,079 --> 02:46:58,000
ago

5197
02:46:56,719 --> 02:46:59,519
and they find their bones and there's

5198
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,959
like saw marks which show that they were

5199
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:02,960
eating each other

5200
02:47:00,959 --> 02:47:04,000
so history remembers the ones who didn't

5201
02:47:02,959 --> 02:47:06,079
eat each other yeah

5202
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:07,439
we were well yeah we remember the ones

5203
02:47:06,079 --> 02:47:10,398
who made it but there

5204
02:47:07,439 --> 02:47:10,800
are uh and that would be the story of

5205
02:47:10,398 --> 02:47:12,478
mars

5206
02:47:10,799 --> 02:47:13,920
that will be the story of ours so but

5207
02:47:12,478 --> 02:47:14,398
and nevertheless that's the interesting

5208
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:17,600
thing

5209
02:47:14,398 --> 02:47:20,159
about antarctica nevertheless

5210
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:20,640
something about human nature drives us

5211
02:47:20,159 --> 02:47:22,879
to

5212
02:47:20,639 --> 02:47:24,879
explore it yes that and that seems to be

5213
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:26,079
like you know a lot of people have this

5214
02:47:24,879 --> 02:47:28,398
kind of

5215
02:47:26,079 --> 02:47:30,079
to me frustrating conversations like

5216
02:47:28,398 --> 02:47:32,000
well

5217
02:47:30,079 --> 02:47:34,318
earth is great man why do we need to

5218
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:36,398
colonize mars you just don't get it

5219
02:47:34,318 --> 02:47:37,840
it i don't know i mean i don't know it's

5220
02:47:36,398 --> 02:47:39,760
the same people that say like

5221
02:47:37,840 --> 02:47:41,439
why are you running like why are you

5222
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:43,920
running a marathon

5223
02:47:41,439 --> 02:47:44,479
what are you running from man yeah i

5224
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:47,600
don't know

5225
02:47:44,478 --> 02:47:49,519
it's pushing the limits of the uh of the

5226
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:52,559
human mind of the

5227
02:47:49,520 --> 02:47:55,520
of what's possible it's like mallory

5228
02:47:52,559 --> 02:47:55,840
because it's there yeah it's simple and

5229
02:47:55,520 --> 02:47:57,760
that

5230
02:47:55,840 --> 02:47:59,200
and that somehow actually the result of

5231
02:47:57,760 --> 02:48:01,840
that

5232
02:47:59,200 --> 02:48:03,359
if you want to be pragmatic about it

5233
02:48:01,840 --> 02:48:04,079
there's something about pushing that

5234
02:48:03,359 --> 02:48:05,840
limit

5235
02:48:04,079 --> 02:48:08,079
that has side effects that you don't

5236
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:09,680
expect that will create a better world

5237
02:48:08,079 --> 02:48:12,318
back home for the people

5238
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:13,200
not necessarily on earth but like just

5239
02:48:12,318 --> 02:48:15,359
in general

5240
02:48:13,200 --> 02:48:17,040
it raises the quality of life for

5241
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:18,880
everybody even though

5242
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:21,600
the initial endeavor doesn't make any

5243
02:48:18,879 --> 02:48:24,879
sense the very fact of pushing

5244
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:27,760
the limits of what's possible

5245
02:48:24,879 --> 02:48:28,639
then has side effects of benefiting

5246
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:31,600
everybody

5247
02:48:28,639 --> 02:48:33,358
and it's difficult to predict ahead of

5248
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:35,840
time or what those benefits will be

5249
02:48:33,359 --> 02:48:37,840
same with colonizing mars it's unclear

5250
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:38,880
what the benefits will be for earth or

5251
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:41,359
in general

5252
02:48:38,879 --> 02:48:42,719
what's struggling get from the moon what

5253
02:48:41,359 --> 02:48:44,559
did we get from apollo

5254
02:48:42,719 --> 02:48:46,159
right technically and there were a lot

5255
02:48:44,559 --> 02:48:47,039
of socialists at the time making this

5256
02:48:46,159 --> 02:48:49,359
argument they're like

5257
02:48:47,040 --> 02:48:50,800
all this money going you know what we

5258
02:48:49,359 --> 02:48:54,720
went to the [ __ ] moon

5259
02:48:50,799 --> 02:48:58,318
in 1969 that was amazing the greatest

5260
02:48:54,719 --> 02:48:59,119
feat in human history period what did we

5261
02:48:58,318 --> 02:49:01,119
learn from it

5262
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:03,920
we learned and we learned about

5263
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:06,479
interstellar or interplanetary travel

5264
02:49:03,920 --> 02:49:07,600
we learned that we could do something

5265
02:49:06,478 --> 02:49:09,679
off of

5266
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:11,439
a device less powerful than the computer

5267
02:49:09,680 --> 02:49:14,960
in my pocket yeah like the

5268
02:49:11,439 --> 02:49:16,720
the amount of potential locked within my

5269
02:49:14,959 --> 02:49:18,159
pocket and your pocket

5270
02:49:16,719 --> 02:49:19,760
i mean this is if you were to define my

5271
02:49:18,159 --> 02:49:22,079
politics in one way it's

5272
02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:22,960
greatness like national a quest for

5273
02:49:22,079 --> 02:49:25,439
national

5274
02:49:22,959 --> 02:49:26,318
greatness there is no greatness without

5275
02:49:25,439 --> 02:49:28,559
fulfilling

5276
02:49:26,318 --> 02:49:30,159
the ultimate calling of the human spirit

5277
02:49:28,559 --> 02:49:32,159
which is more

5278
02:49:30,159 --> 02:49:33,680
it's not enough and why should it be

5279
02:49:32,159 --> 02:49:36,799
yeah it wasn't enough

5280
02:49:33,680 --> 02:49:37,359
you know our ancestors could have been

5281
02:49:36,799 --> 02:49:39,679
content

5282
02:49:37,359 --> 02:49:41,040
to sit well actually many of them were

5283
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:42,720
were content to sit

5284
02:49:41,040 --> 02:49:44,160
and say these berries will be here for a

5285
02:49:42,719 --> 02:49:46,639
long time and they got eaten

5286
02:49:44,159 --> 02:49:47,200
and they died and it's the ones who got

5287
02:49:46,639 --> 02:49:49,039
out

5288
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:51,200
and went to the next place in the next

5289
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:51,760
place and went across the siberian land

5290
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:54,399
bridge

5291
02:49:51,760 --> 02:49:56,639
and went across more and it just did

5292
02:49:54,398 --> 02:49:59,278
extraordinary things the craziest ones

5293
02:49:56,639 --> 02:50:00,239
we are their offspring and we fail them

5294
02:49:59,279 --> 02:50:03,760
if we don't

5295
02:50:00,239 --> 02:50:06,478
go into space that's how i would put it

5296
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:08,398
you should run for president i'm just

5297
02:50:06,478 --> 02:50:11,119
broke space man i love face

5298
02:50:08,398 --> 02:50:11,840
no you're pro doing difficult things and

5299
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:14,000
pushing

5300
02:50:11,840 --> 02:50:16,719
uh exploring the world in all of its

5301
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:19,680
forms i hope that kind of spirit

5302
02:50:16,719 --> 02:50:20,318
permeates politics too that same kind of

5303
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:24,639
uh

5304
02:50:20,318 --> 02:50:25,840
can it well it can and i hope so

5305
02:50:24,639 --> 02:50:27,760
i don't know if you want to stay on it

5306
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:29,680
but i think that was book number one

5307
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:31,040
or two [ __ ] yeah okay all right all

5308
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:32,318
right um is there

5309
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:34,080
well this one is a second this actually

5310
02:50:32,318 --> 02:50:35,680
is a corollary to that which is sapiens

5311
02:50:34,079 --> 02:50:38,000
and i know that's a very normal

5312
02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:39,359
normie answer yeah um one of the best

5313
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:41,359
selling but i think there's a reason for

5314
02:50:39,359 --> 02:50:43,520
that yeah you've all know harari

5315
02:50:41,359 --> 02:50:44,479
of course okay look yes he didn't do any

5316
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:46,479
new research

5317
02:50:44,478 --> 02:50:47,679
i get that all he did was aggregate i'm

5318
02:50:46,478 --> 02:50:48,799
sure he's very controversial in the

5319
02:50:47,680 --> 02:50:50,559
scientific community

5320
02:50:48,799 --> 02:50:52,159
but guess what he wrote a great book

5321
02:50:50,559 --> 02:50:56,239
it's a very

5322
02:50:52,159 --> 02:50:57,279
easy to read general explanation of the

5323
02:50:56,239 --> 02:50:59,680
rise of human

5324
02:50:57,279 --> 02:51:01,439
history and it helps challenge a lot of

5325
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:03,279
preconceptions are we special

5326
02:51:01,439 --> 02:51:05,120
are we an accident are we more like a

5327
02:51:03,279 --> 02:51:07,920
parasite or are we not

5328
02:51:05,120 --> 02:51:08,640
what is there a destiny to all of us i

5329
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:10,159
don't know

5330
02:51:08,639 --> 02:51:11,920
you know if anything it's like what i

5331
02:51:10,159 --> 02:51:15,439
just described which is more

5332
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:17,920
move move out um the evolution of money

5333
02:51:15,439 --> 02:51:19,439
like i know he gets a lot of hate but i

5334
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:21,600
think that he writes it

5335
02:51:19,439 --> 02:51:23,359
so clearly and well that for your

5336
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:24,479
average person to be able to read that

5337
02:51:23,359 --> 02:51:26,239
you will come away

5338
02:51:24,478 --> 02:51:27,840
with a more clear understanding of the

5339
02:51:26,239 --> 02:51:29,600
human race

5340
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:32,000
than before and i think that that's why

5341
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:34,640
it's worth it i agree with you 100

5342
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:36,398
i uh i'm ashamed to i usually don't

5343
02:51:34,639 --> 02:51:38,318
bring up sapiens because it's like

5344
02:51:36,398 --> 02:51:40,719
yeah it's like everybody's uncle has

5345
02:51:38,318 --> 02:51:42,799
read it but it's that's a good thing

5346
02:51:40,719 --> 02:51:44,239
yeah it is one of the i think you'll be

5347
02:51:42,799 --> 02:51:46,000
remembered as one of the great books of

5348
02:51:44,239 --> 02:51:48,398
this particular era

5349
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:49,439
and yeah because it's it's so clearly

5350
02:51:48,398 --> 02:51:51,278
it's like the

5351
02:51:49,439 --> 02:51:53,439
selfish gene with darkest i mean it just

5352
02:51:51,279 --> 02:51:55,520
aggregates so many ideas together and

5353
02:51:53,439 --> 02:51:57,840
puts language to it that's

5354
02:51:55,520 --> 02:51:59,200
makes it very useful to talk about so it

5355
02:51:57,840 --> 02:52:02,719
is one of the great books

5356
02:51:59,200 --> 02:52:03,279
100 um another one is definitely born to

5357
02:52:02,719 --> 02:52:04,879
run

5358
02:52:03,279 --> 02:52:06,960
for the same reason by christopher

5359
02:52:04,879 --> 02:52:08,879
mcdougall which is that i'm just gonna

5360
02:52:06,959 --> 02:52:11,759
listen to this whole podcast next week

5361
02:52:08,879 --> 02:52:13,119
you have to well you should because it

5362
02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:15,840
you are inheriting

5363
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:16,800
our most basic skill which is running

5364
02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:20,398
and

5365
02:52:16,799 --> 02:52:23,599
reimagining human history or reimagining

5366
02:52:20,398 --> 02:52:27,039
like what we were as opposed to what we

5367
02:52:23,600 --> 02:52:29,680
are is very useful because it helps you

5368
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:31,439
understand how to tap into primal

5369
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:33,760
aspects of your brain which just

5370
02:52:31,439 --> 02:52:35,439
drive you and the reason i love

5371
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:37,040
mcdougall's writing is because

5372
02:52:35,439 --> 02:52:39,520
i love anybody who writes like this

5373
02:52:37,040 --> 02:52:42,399
malcolm gladwell um who else

5374
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:44,479
michael lewis people who find characters

5375
02:52:42,398 --> 02:52:45,840
to tell a bigger story michael lewis

5376
02:52:44,478 --> 02:52:47,920
finds characters to tell us the story of

5377
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:49,760
the financial crisis um

5378
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:51,120
you know malcolm gladwell writes finds

5379
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:53,120
characters to tell us the story of

5380
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:54,640
learning new skills and outliers and

5381
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:54,960
diff you know whatever his latest book

5382
02:52:54,639 --> 02:52:57,439
is

5383
02:52:54,959 --> 02:52:58,719
i forget what it's called and but

5384
02:52:57,439 --> 02:53:01,279
mcdougall

5385
02:52:58,719 --> 02:53:02,398
tells the vignettes and a tiny story of

5386
02:53:01,279 --> 02:53:05,200
a single person

5387
02:53:02,398 --> 02:53:05,519
in the history of running and like how

5388
02:53:05,200 --> 02:53:08,479
it's

5389
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:10,399
baked into your dna and i think there

5390
02:53:08,478 --> 02:53:11,840
was just something very useful

5391
02:53:10,398 --> 02:53:13,760
to that for me for being like i don't

5392
02:53:11,840 --> 02:53:14,880
need to go to the gym or like

5393
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:16,719
i'm not saying you should still go to

5394
02:53:14,879 --> 02:53:18,478
the gym i'll be clear i'm saying like in

5395
02:53:16,719 --> 02:53:21,039
order to fulfill like

5396
02:53:18,478 --> 02:53:21,840
who you are you can actually tap into

5397
02:53:21,040 --> 02:53:24,240
something that's

5398
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:25,680
the most basic um i i don't know i'm

5399
02:53:24,239 --> 02:53:28,639
sure if you listen to the david cho

5400
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:29,520
episode with joe rogan um you know i

5401
02:53:28,639 --> 02:53:32,000
mean oh where he's

5402
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:32,640
the animal yeah with the baboon when he

5403
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
goes and

5404
02:53:32,639 --> 02:53:35,920
there's something to that man there's

5405
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:38,239
something to that which is like

5406
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:39,120
they are living the way that we were

5407
02:53:38,239 --> 02:53:40,639
supposed to

5408
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:42,319
yeah we're not suppo well i don't want

5409
02:53:40,639 --> 02:53:43,760
to put a normal judgment on it they're

5410
02:53:42,318 --> 02:53:45,439
living the way

5411
02:53:43,760 --> 02:53:46,960
that we used to yeah there's something

5412
02:53:45,439 --> 02:53:49,279
feels very honest somehow

5413
02:53:46,959 --> 02:53:50,318

want to

5426
02:54:07,439 --> 02:54:10,880
i'm so glad that somebody who thinks

5427
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:13,279
deeply about politics

5428
02:54:10,879 --> 02:54:14,239
is so fascinating with exploration and

5429
02:54:13,279 --> 02:54:17,680
with

5430
02:54:14,239 --> 02:54:19,279
the very basic nature

5431
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:21,439
like human nature nature of our

5432
02:54:19,279 --> 02:54:23,439
existence i love that

5433
02:54:21,439 --> 02:54:25,040
there's something in you and still

5434
02:54:23,439 --> 02:54:29,520
you're stuck in dc

5435
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:29,520
for now for now speaking of which

5436
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:33,600
the you are from texas yes what do you

5437
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:35,840
make

5438
02:54:33,600 --> 02:54:37,279
of the future of texas politically

5439
02:54:35,840 --> 02:54:41,040
culturally

5440
02:54:37,279 --> 02:54:43,359
uh economically i am in part

5441
02:54:41,040 --> 02:54:44,240
moving well i'm moving to austin

5442
02:54:43,359 --> 02:54:46,399
congrats

5443
02:54:44,239 --> 02:54:48,159
but i'm also doing the eric weinstein

5444
02:54:46,398 --> 02:54:49,760
advice which is like

5445
02:54:48,159 --> 02:54:52,318
dude you're not married you don't have

5446
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:54,719
kids everywhere there's no such thing as

5447
02:54:52,318 --> 02:54:55,439
moving what what are you moving you're

5448
02:54:54,719 --> 02:54:58,478
like

5449
02:54:55,439 --> 02:54:58,800
you're like like your three suits and

5450
02:54:58,478 --> 02:55:01,039
some

5451
02:54:58,799 --> 02:55:02,559
shirts and underwear what exactly is the

5452
02:55:01,040 --> 02:55:05,439
move and tail

5453
02:55:02,559 --> 02:55:06,079
so i have nothing so i'm basically you

5454
02:55:05,439 --> 02:55:09,120
know

5455
02:55:06,079 --> 02:55:11,600
it's very just remain mobile but

5456
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:12,479
there's a promise there's a hope to uh

5457
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:16,399
austin

5458
02:55:12,478 --> 02:55:18,159
outside of i mean my uh outside of just

5459
02:55:16,398 --> 02:55:19,680
like friendships i have no it's a very

5460
02:55:18,159 --> 02:55:20,478
different culture that joe rogan is

5461
02:55:19,680 --> 02:55:23,279
creating i'm

5462
02:55:20,478 --> 02:55:25,278
mostly interested in the what the next

5463
02:55:23,279 --> 02:55:28,399
silicon valley will be with the next

5464
02:55:25,279 --> 02:55:32,079
hub of technological innovation

5465
02:55:28,398 --> 02:55:34,559
and there's a promise uh maybe a dream

5466
02:55:32,079 --> 02:55:35,279
for austin being that next place that's

5467
02:55:34,559 --> 02:55:38,639
very possible

5468
02:55:35,279 --> 02:55:42,000
doesn't have this the baggage of uh

5469
02:55:38,639 --> 02:55:45,439
some of the political things maybe

5470
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:45,920
some of the sort of um things that hold

5471
02:55:45,439 --> 02:55:49,760
back

5472
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:50,159
the beauty of that makes capitalism that

5473
02:55:49,760 --> 02:55:52,719
makes

5474
02:55:50,159 --> 02:55:55,119
innovation so powerful which is like

5475
02:55:52,719 --> 02:55:57,278
meritocracy which is excellence

5476
02:55:55,120 --> 02:55:58,399
uh diversity is exceptionally important

5477
02:55:57,279 --> 02:56:01,680
but not

5478
02:55:58,398 --> 02:56:03,680
uh it should not be the only priority it

5479
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:06,880
has to be something that

5480
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:10,239
uh it coexists with a like

5481
02:56:06,879 --> 02:56:13,119
insatiable drive towards excellence

5482
02:56:10,239 --> 02:56:14,719
and uh it seems like texas is a nice

5483
02:56:13,120 --> 02:56:18,479
place like having a

5484
02:56:14,719 --> 02:56:20,879
austin which is like a kind of uh this

5485
02:56:18,478 --> 02:56:21,599
weird i hope it stays weird man i love

5486
02:56:20,879 --> 02:56:25,358
weird people

5487
02:56:21,600 --> 02:56:28,960
know about that but we can get it but

5488
02:56:25,359 --> 02:56:31,600
as this uh hope is

5489
02:56:28,959 --> 02:56:32,639
it remains this weird place of brilliant

5490
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:35,680
innovation

5491
02:56:32,639 --> 02:56:37,119
amidst the uh a state that's like more

5492
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:38,239
conservative so like there's a nice

5493
02:56:37,120 --> 02:56:39,520
balance of everything

5494
02:56:38,239 --> 02:56:42,159
what are your thoughts about the future

5495
02:56:39,520 --> 02:56:43,040
of texas i think it's so fascinating to

5496
02:56:42,159 --> 02:56:45,279
me

5497
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:46,880
because i never thought i would want to

5498
02:56:45,279 --> 02:56:50,479
move back

5499
02:56:46,879 --> 02:56:52,559
but now i'm beginning to be convinced

5500
02:56:50,478 --> 02:56:54,318
so you have that joe i'm going to say

5501
02:56:52,559 --> 02:56:55,920
this

5502
02:56:54,318 --> 02:56:58,239
i'm being honest and many texans will

5503
02:56:55,920 --> 02:57:00,799
hate me for this texas was not a place

5504
02:56:58,239 --> 02:57:03,279
that was kind to me quote unquote and

5505
02:57:00,799 --> 02:57:05,920
this is because of my

5506
02:57:03,279 --> 02:57:08,640
own parent look i was raised in college

5507
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:11,520
station texas which is a town of 50 000

5508
02:57:08,639 --> 02:57:12,959
it's a university town it exists only

5509
02:57:11,520 --> 02:57:14,960
for the university

5510
02:57:12,959 --> 02:57:17,119
so it was a very str i did not get the

5511
02:57:14,959 --> 02:57:19,119
full texas experiences purely speaking

5512
02:57:17,120 --> 02:57:22,240
from a college station experience

5513
02:57:19,120 --> 02:57:24,399
but growing up first

5514
02:57:22,239 --> 02:57:25,680
you know first generation or i forget

5515
02:57:24,398 --> 02:57:26,959
what it is whatever i'm the first

5516
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:27,760
american i was born and raised in

5517
02:57:26,959 --> 02:57:31,759
college station

5518
02:57:27,760 --> 02:57:34,880
my parents are from india being raised

5519
02:57:31,760 --> 02:57:36,000
in a town where the dominant culture was

5520
02:57:34,879 --> 02:57:38,719
predominantly like

5521
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:40,478
white evangelical christian was hard

5522
02:57:38,719 --> 02:57:43,760
like he was just difficult

5523
02:57:40,478 --> 02:57:46,079
and i think of it

5524
02:57:43,760 --> 02:57:48,159
in the beginning i would say like ages

5525
02:57:46,079 --> 02:57:50,639
like zero to like eight

5526
02:57:48,159 --> 02:57:51,520
it was like cultural ignorance as in

5527
02:57:50,639 --> 02:57:52,879
like they just don't know how to

5528
02:57:51,520 --> 02:57:56,000
interact with you

5529
02:57:52,879 --> 02:57:57,519
um and there was a level of always there

5530
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,478
was like the evangelical kind of

5531
02:57:57,520 --> 02:58:01,040
antipathy

5532
02:57:58,478 --> 02:58:02,318
towards like you being not christian you

5533
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:03,680
know my parents are hindu like that's

5534
02:58:02,318 --> 02:58:07,199
how i was raised

5535
02:58:03,680 --> 02:58:08,079
and so like there was that but 9 11 was

5536
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:11,439
very difficult

5537
02:58:08,079 --> 02:58:14,559
like 9 11 happened when i was in third

5538
02:58:11,439 --> 02:58:14,880
fourth grade and that changed everything

5539
02:58:14,559 --> 02:58:17,278
man

5540
02:58:14,879 --> 02:58:18,239
like i mean our temple had to like print

5541
02:58:17,279 --> 02:58:19,760
out t-shirts

5542
02:58:18,239 --> 02:58:21,279
and i'm not saying this is a sob story

5543
02:58:19,760 --> 02:58:23,359
to be clear i've still actually

5544
02:58:21,279 --> 02:58:24,720
largely from my adult life identified on

5545
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:25,600
the political right so don't take this

5546
02:58:24,719 --> 02:58:27,519
as some like

5547
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:29,040
you know race manifesto i'm just telling

5548
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:32,319
it like this is what happened

5549
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:35,760
which is that like we had

5550
02:58:32,318 --> 02:58:38,799
it was just hard to be brown frankly and

5551
02:58:35,760 --> 02:58:41,600
to have some of the fallout from 911

5552
02:58:38,799 --> 02:58:42,799
and during iraq and the reason i am

5553
02:58:41,600 --> 02:58:46,720
political

5554
02:58:42,799 --> 02:58:50,639
is because i realize in myself i have a

5555
02:58:46,719 --> 02:58:53,199
strong rebellious nature against

5556
02:58:50,639 --> 02:58:55,519
systems and structures of power and the

5557
02:58:53,200 --> 02:58:58,319
first people i ever rebelled against

5558
02:58:55,520 --> 02:58:58,720
were all the people telling me to shut

5559
02:58:58,318 --> 02:59:00,879
up

5560
02:58:58,719 --> 02:59:02,478
and not question the iraq war so the

5561
02:59:00,879 --> 02:59:05,920
reason i am in politics

5562
02:59:02,478 --> 02:59:08,959
is because i hated george w bush

5563
02:59:05,920 --> 02:59:10,960
with a passion and i hated the war and i

5564
02:59:08,959 --> 02:59:12,318
was so again my entire background is

5565
02:59:10,959 --> 02:59:13,278
largely a national security for this

5566
02:59:12,318 --> 02:59:15,680
reason which is

5567
02:59:13,279 --> 02:59:16,720
i was obsessed with the idea of like how

5568
02:59:15,680 --> 02:59:18,639
do we get people

5569
02:59:16,719 --> 02:59:20,159
who are not gonna get us into these

5570
02:59:18,639 --> 02:59:21,519
quagmire situations

5571
02:59:20,159 --> 02:59:23,359
in positions of power that's how i

5572
02:59:21,520 --> 02:59:24,079
became fascinated by power in the first

5573
02:59:23,359 --> 02:59:27,600
place

5574
02:59:24,079 --> 02:59:28,079
was all a question of how do this happen

5575
02:59:27,600 --> 02:59:30,399
like

5576
02:59:28,079 --> 02:59:31,920
how did this catastrophe happen i

5577
02:59:30,398 --> 02:59:33,599
realized it's not as bad as like you

5578
02:59:31,920 --> 02:59:34,398
know previous conflicts but this one was

5579
02:59:33,600 --> 02:59:36,479
mine

5580
02:59:34,398 --> 02:59:37,920
and to see how it changed our domestic

5581
02:59:36,478 --> 02:59:40,959
politics forever

5582
02:59:37,920 --> 02:59:42,559
and so that was my rebellion but

5583
02:59:40,959 --> 02:59:44,398
it's funny because i identified as a

5584
02:59:42,559 --> 02:59:47,760
left on the left when i was growing up

5585
02:59:44,398 --> 02:59:49,358
up until i was 18 i had also a funny

5586
02:59:47,760 --> 02:59:50,800
two-year stint this is where everything

5587
02:59:49,359 --> 02:59:51,439
kind of changed for me when i was 16

5588
02:59:50,799 --> 02:59:53,840
actually

5589
02:59:51,439 --> 02:59:54,960
i moved to qatar to doha qatar because

5590
02:59:53,840 --> 02:59:57,840
my dad

5591
02:59:54,959 --> 02:59:58,959
was a dean or associate dean of texas a

5592
02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:01,120
m university

5593
02:59:58,959 --> 03:00:02,000
at doha so my last two years of high

5594
03:00:01,120 --> 03:00:04,479
school were at this

5595
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:06,000
i went from this small town in texas and

5596
03:00:04,478 --> 03:00:08,000
i love my parents because

5597
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:10,000
they could recognize that i had within

5598
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:12,159
me that i was not a small town kid

5599
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:13,439
so they took me out of this country

5600
03:00:12,159 --> 03:00:15,439
every chance they got i

5601
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:17,359
traveled everywhere and constantly let

5602
03:00:15,439 --> 03:00:20,159
me go and so i was

5603
03:00:17,359 --> 03:00:21,600
i went from school in college station to

5604
03:00:20,159 --> 03:00:24,478
like this ritzy

5605
03:00:21,600 --> 03:00:26,079
private school american school best

5606
03:00:24,478 --> 03:00:27,840
thing that ever happened to me

5607
03:00:26,079 --> 03:00:29,439
because first of all it got me out of

5608
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:32,719
college station

5609
03:00:29,439 --> 03:00:33,279
second at that time i had this annoying

5610
03:00:32,719 --> 03:00:36,239
streak

5611
03:00:33,279 --> 03:00:38,479
of i wouldn't call it being anti-america

5612
03:00:36,239 --> 03:00:39,600
but you don't appreciate america

5613
03:00:38,478 --> 03:00:41,599
let me tell everybody out there

5614
03:00:39,600 --> 03:00:44,880
listening leave for a while

5615
03:00:41,600 --> 03:00:48,079
you will miss it so much yes

5616
03:00:44,879 --> 03:00:49,278
you do not know what it is like to not

5617
03:00:48,079 --> 03:00:51,200
have freedom of speech

5618
03:00:49,279 --> 03:00:53,040
until you don't have it yeah and i was

5619
03:00:51,200 --> 03:00:56,159
going to i was going

5620
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:57,840
to high school with these guys in the

5621
03:00:56,159 --> 03:01:00,159
qatari royal family

5622
03:00:57,840 --> 03:01:01,680
and all i wanted to do was speak out how

5623
03:01:00,159 --> 03:01:02,719
they were pieces of [ __ ] for the way

5624
03:01:01,680 --> 03:01:04,800
that they treated

5625
03:01:02,719 --> 03:01:06,799
indian citizens in the country who are

5626
03:01:04,799 --> 03:01:09,039
basically used as slave labor

5627
03:01:06,799 --> 03:01:11,039
and i could not say one word because i

5628
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:12,399
knew i would be deported and i knew my

5629
03:01:11,040 --> 03:01:14,240
dad would lose his job

5630
03:01:12,398 --> 03:01:15,760
and my mom will lose her job and we

5631
03:01:14,239 --> 03:01:16,799
would be forced out of the country

5632
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:19,439
you don't know what it's like to live

5633
03:01:16,799 --> 03:01:20,079
like that or to be in a society where

5634
03:01:19,439 --> 03:01:21,600
like you know

5635
03:01:20,079 --> 03:01:23,920
you have like a high school girlfriend

5636
03:01:21,600 --> 03:01:26,559
or something and you can't even touch

5637
03:01:23,920 --> 03:01:27,520
in public or you're lectured for public

5638
03:01:26,559 --> 03:01:29,920
decency

5639
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:31,040
like i listen i've lived under a gulf

5640
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:33,920
monarchy now

5641
03:01:31,040 --> 03:01:35,760
and i have that turned me into the most

5642
03:01:33,920 --> 03:01:39,200
pro-america guy

5643
03:01:35,760 --> 03:01:42,239
ever like i came back so like

5644
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:43,680
america like that's i still am frankly

5645
03:01:42,239 --> 03:01:45,760
because of that experience

5646
03:01:43,680 --> 03:01:48,318
living living abroad like that will do

5647
03:01:45,760 --> 03:01:51,439
it to you live in a non-democracy

5648
03:01:48,318 --> 03:01:52,879
you haven't even in europe i would say

5649
03:01:51,439 --> 03:01:53,520
you guys aren't living as free as we are

5650
03:01:52,879 --> 03:01:56,239
here it's

5651
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:58,319
awesome you're ultimately another human

5652
03:01:56,239 --> 03:02:01,039
being than the one who left texas

5653
03:01:58,318 --> 03:02:03,680
yeah so i mean have you actually

5654
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:05,520
considered moving to texas and broadly

5655
03:02:03,680 --> 03:02:07,279
just outside your own story

5656
03:02:05,520 --> 03:02:08,800
what do you think is the future of texas

5657
03:02:07,279 --> 03:02:12,000
what is the future of austin yes

5658
03:02:08,799 --> 03:02:13,920
there's so much transformation seemingly

5659
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:16,000
happening now related to silicon valley

5660
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:18,159
living in california

5661
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:20,239
which is that since i left it's changed

5662
03:02:18,159 --> 03:02:23,279
dramatically which is that it used to be

5663
03:02:20,239 --> 03:02:25,760
like this conservative state where

5664
03:02:23,279 --> 03:02:27,120
the main money to be made was oil and

5665
03:02:25,760 --> 03:02:30,318
everybody knew that petro

5666
03:02:27,120 --> 03:02:32,079
it was a petro state houston all of that

5667
03:02:30,318 --> 03:02:34,239
austin was always weird but it was more

5668
03:02:32,079 --> 03:02:35,520
of a music town and a university town it

5669
03:02:34,239 --> 03:02:39,039
was not a tech town

5670
03:02:35,520 --> 03:02:40,960
but in the 10 years or so since i left

5671
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:42,160
i have begun to realize i'm like well

5672
03:02:40,959 --> 03:02:45,438
the texas i grew up in

5673
03:02:42,159 --> 03:02:48,079
is over it is not a deep red state

5674
03:02:45,439 --> 03:02:49,439
in any sense in any sense of the term

5675
03:02:48,079 --> 03:02:51,760
the number one

5676
03:02:49,439 --> 03:02:53,760
u-haul route in the country pre-pandemic

5677
03:02:51,760 --> 03:02:56,559
already was san francisco to austin

5678
03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:58,800
okay so like you have this massive

5679
03:02:56,559 --> 03:03:01,840
influx of people from california

5680
03:02:58,799 --> 03:03:02,959
and new york and the state the

5681
03:03:01,840 --> 03:03:04,920
composition of it

5682
03:03:02,959 --> 03:03:06,159
is changed dramatically the

5683
03:03:04,920 --> 03:03:08,159
intracomposition

5684
03:03:06,159 --> 03:03:10,000
and the outro yeah so the

5685
03:03:08,159 --> 03:03:11,439
intracomposition it's become way more

5686
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:13,439
urban it's from when i grew when i grew

5687
03:03:11,439 --> 03:03:15,520
up texas was a much more rural state

5688
03:03:13,439 --> 03:03:17,680
its politics were much more static it

5689
03:03:15,520 --> 03:03:18,159
looked much more like rick perry like

5690
03:03:17,680 --> 03:03:20,559
that

5691
03:03:18,159 --> 03:03:22,639
he was a very accurate representation

5692
03:03:20,559 --> 03:03:25,199
yes of who we were

5693
03:03:22,639 --> 03:03:26,318
now i don't think that that's the case

5694
03:03:25,200 --> 03:03:29,760
texas is now

5695
03:03:26,318 --> 03:03:30,799
a dynamic economy not just 100 reliant

5696
03:03:29,760 --> 03:03:34,000
on oil

5697
03:03:30,799 --> 03:03:36,318
because of its kind of like i would call

5698
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:37,920
it like regulatory arbitrage relative to

5699
03:03:36,318 --> 03:03:40,719
california and new york

5700
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:41,359
offers a large incentive to people who

5701
03:03:40,719 --> 03:03:42,959
are more

5702
03:03:41,359 --> 03:03:44,559
i wouldn't say culturally liberal but

5703
03:03:42,959 --> 03:03:46,159
they're not necessarily like culturally

5704
03:03:44,559 --> 03:03:46,959
conservative like the people who i grew

5705
03:03:46,159 --> 03:03:48,159
up with

5706
03:03:46,959 --> 03:03:50,478
that's changed the whole state's

5707
03:03:48,159 --> 03:03:51,760
politics beto came two points away from

5708
03:03:50,478 --> 03:03:53,278
beating ted cruz

5709
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:54,719
i'm not saying the state's gonna go blue

5710
03:03:53,279 --> 03:03:55,359
i think the republican party will just

5711
03:03:54,719 --> 03:03:58,278
change

5712
03:03:55,359 --> 03:04:00,399
and we'll have to readjust but the

5713
03:03:58,279 --> 03:04:03,120
re-urbanization of texas

5714
03:04:00,398 --> 03:04:03,920
has made it uh i'll put it in this way

5715
03:04:03,120 --> 03:04:07,680
much more

5716
03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:09,760
uh much much more attractive to me

5717
03:04:07,680 --> 03:04:10,720
than the place that i grew up and from

5718
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:13,359
my perspective

5719
03:04:10,719 --> 03:04:14,478
uh well first of all i love uh some of

5720
03:04:13,359 --> 03:04:16,479
the

5721
03:04:14,478 --> 03:04:18,079
the cowboy things that texas stands for

5722
03:04:16,478 --> 03:04:20,478
but for more practically from my

5723
03:04:18,079 --> 03:04:23,520
perspective the injection of the

5724
03:04:20,478 --> 03:04:24,159
uh tech innovation right that's moving

5725
03:04:23,520 --> 03:04:27,200
to

5726
03:04:24,159 --> 03:04:29,600
texas has made it very exciting

5727
03:04:27,200 --> 03:04:31,120
to me it seems like outside of all that

5728
03:04:29,600 --> 03:04:31,920
maybe you can speak to the weird in

5729
03:04:31,120 --> 03:04:35,200
austin

5730
03:04:31,920 --> 03:04:39,279
it seems like i i know that

5731
03:04:35,200 --> 03:04:41,680
joe rogan is uh a rich

5732
03:04:39,279 --> 03:04:42,479
sort of uh almost like mainstream at

5733
03:04:41,680 --> 03:04:44,398
this point

5734
03:04:42,478 --> 03:04:46,719
right but he's also attracting a lot of

5735
03:04:44,398 --> 03:04:48,159
weirdos and so is elon

5736
03:04:46,719 --> 03:04:49,920
and a lot of those weirdos are my

5737
03:04:48,159 --> 03:04:50,879
friends and though they're like like

5738
03:04:49,920 --> 03:04:54,000
michael malus

5739
03:04:50,879 --> 03:04:56,318
like those weirdos and it's like

5740
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:58,159
i have a hope for austin that all kinds

5741
03:04:56,318 --> 03:04:58,879
of different flavors of weirdos will get

5742
03:04:58,159 --> 03:05:00,799
injected

5743
03:04:58,879 --> 03:05:02,239
it's possible you know i i actually

5744
03:05:00,799 --> 03:05:02,879
think the most significant thing that

5745
03:05:02,239 --> 03:05:06,159
happened

5746
03:05:02,879 --> 03:05:07,039
were at tesla moving there yeah the

5747
03:05:06,159 --> 03:05:08,879
reason why is

5748
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:10,800
i love joe obviously but like he can

5749
03:05:08,879 --> 03:05:13,759
only attract x amount of people

5750
03:05:10,799 --> 03:05:14,478
yeah elon actually employs thousands of

5751
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:17,439
people

5752
03:05:14,478 --> 03:05:19,119
and then you also oracle oracle's

5753
03:05:17,439 --> 03:05:22,239
decision to move to austin

5754
03:05:19,120 --> 03:05:25,279
is just as important because those

5755
03:05:22,239 --> 03:05:25,840
two men larry was ellison right yeah

5756
03:05:25,279 --> 03:05:29,439
elson

5757
03:05:25,840 --> 03:05:31,359
and uh elon they actually employ tens of

5758
03:05:29,439 --> 03:05:33,439
thousands of people collectively

5759
03:05:31,359 --> 03:05:34,559
that can change the nature of the city

5760
03:05:33,439 --> 03:05:36,720
yeah so

5761
03:05:34,559 --> 03:05:38,959
you combine that with joe bringing this

5762
03:05:36,719 --> 03:05:41,599
entire new entertainment complex

5763
03:05:38,959 --> 03:05:42,639
with the bodies of people who will

5764
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:45,040
appreciate

5765
03:05:42,639 --> 03:05:46,159
said entertainment complex spend money

5766
03:05:45,040 --> 03:05:48,479
on the entertainment

5767
03:05:46,159 --> 03:05:49,439
exactly you just remade the entire city

5768
03:05:48,478 --> 03:05:51,278
yeah and and that's

5769
03:05:49,439 --> 03:05:52,639
that's why i'm fascinated and obviously

5770
03:05:51,279 --> 03:05:54,479
there's network effects which is

5771
03:05:52,639 --> 03:05:56,079
now that all those people are down there

5772
03:05:54,478 --> 03:05:57,519
i mean if i were elon musk i would

5773
03:05:56,079 --> 03:05:59,120
donate a [ __ ] ton of money to the

5774
03:05:57,520 --> 03:06:00,000
university of texas and i would turn it

5775
03:05:59,120 --> 03:06:02,160
into my stanford

5776
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:03,040
for silicon valley let's introduce some

5777
03:06:02,159 --> 03:06:06,318
competition

5778
03:06:03,040 --> 03:06:08,640
and let ut austin hire the best software

5779
03:06:06,318 --> 03:06:11,439
developers engineers professors and more

5780
03:06:08,639 --> 03:06:13,519
and turn texas into a true like austin

5781
03:06:11,439 --> 03:06:14,559
revolving door hub where people come to

5782
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:16,800
ut austin

5783
03:06:14,559 --> 03:06:18,239
to get an internship at tesla and then

5784
03:06:16,799 --> 03:06:20,079
become an executive there

5785
03:06:18,239 --> 03:06:21,680
and then create their own company in

5786
03:06:20,079 --> 03:06:24,079
their own garage

5787
03:06:21,680 --> 03:06:25,520
in austin which is the next facebook

5788
03:06:24,079 --> 03:06:26,799
twitter that's how it happens

5789
03:06:25,520 --> 03:06:28,640
this is why i'm much more skeptical of

5790
03:06:26,799 --> 03:06:31,039
miami there's a whole like tech

5791
03:06:28,639 --> 03:06:32,000
miami crew i'm like yeah like there's no

5792
03:06:31,040 --> 03:06:34,319
university

5793
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:35,279
it's very inorganic um look i think

5794
03:06:34,318 --> 03:06:37,439
miami is awesome

5795
03:06:35,279 --> 03:06:39,439
i just like i don't know if the same

5796
03:06:37,439 --> 03:06:42,159
building blocks are there and also

5797
03:06:39,439 --> 03:06:42,720
no multi-billion dollar companies which

5798
03:06:42,159 --> 03:06:44,719
employ

5799
03:06:42,719 --> 03:06:45,840
thousands of people are coming there

5800
03:06:44,719 --> 03:06:47,920
that's the ingredient

5801
03:06:45,840 --> 03:06:49,680
it's not just joe rogan it's not just

5802
03:06:47,920 --> 03:06:50,559
even elon musk if he's still operated in

5803
03:06:49,680 --> 03:06:52,960
california

5804
03:06:50,559 --> 03:06:53,920
it's all the people he employs i think

5805
03:06:52,959 --> 03:06:56,639
that is

5806
03:06:53,920 --> 03:06:58,559
where i think texas is going to

5807
03:06:56,639 --> 03:06:59,278
dramatically change within the next 10

5808
03:06:58,559 --> 03:07:01,119
years

5809
03:06:59,279 --> 03:07:02,399
alternative to our it's already become a

5810
03:07:01,120 --> 03:07:05,279
more urbanized

5811
03:07:02,398 --> 03:07:05,680
state that's moved away from oil and gas

5812
03:07:05,279 --> 03:07:07,520
um

5813
03:07:05,680 --> 03:07:08,800
in terms of like its emphasis not

5814
03:07:07,520 --> 03:07:09,680
necessarily in terms of its real

5815
03:07:08,799 --> 03:07:11,599
economics

5816
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:13,439
and 10 years from now i don't think it

5817
03:07:11,600 --> 03:07:16,640
will be necessarily the name

5818
03:07:13,439 --> 03:07:17,840
prop like of the of the town the only

5819
03:07:16,639 --> 03:07:19,278
question to me

5820
03:07:17,840 --> 03:07:21,920
is how that manifests politically

5821
03:07:19,279 --> 03:07:23,279
because it's very possible though

5822
03:07:21,920 --> 03:07:26,000
because a lot of these workers

5823
03:07:23,279 --> 03:07:27,279
themselves are california culturally

5824
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,959
liberal

5825
03:07:27,279 --> 03:07:30,399
you could see a gavin newsome type

5826
03:07:28,959 --> 03:07:33,679
person getting elected

5827
03:07:30,398 --> 03:07:35,278
governor of texas yeah or like the mayor

5828
03:07:33,680 --> 03:07:36,559
of austin i mean look mayor boston is

5829
03:07:35,279 --> 03:07:38,479
already a democrat right like

5830
03:07:36,559 --> 03:07:40,478
i mean uh joe has his own problems with

5831
03:07:38,478 --> 03:07:42,959
austin it's funny i remember him

5832
03:07:40,478 --> 03:07:45,119
leaving la and i'm like well we've been

5833
03:07:42,959 --> 03:07:46,879
to austin

5834
03:07:45,120 --> 03:07:48,399
it ain't you know it's not everything

5835
03:07:46,879 --> 03:07:49,119
it's cracked up to me you know

5836
03:07:48,398 --> 03:07:51,760
necessarily

5837
03:07:49,120 --> 03:07:54,479
but no matter what you know a new place

5838
03:07:51,760 --> 03:07:56,960
allows the possibility for new ideas

5839
03:07:54,478 --> 03:07:58,639
uh even if they're somehow left-leaning

5840
03:07:56,959 --> 03:08:00,159
and all those kinds of things i do think

5841
03:07:58,639 --> 03:08:04,000
the only two things missing

5842
03:08:00,159 --> 03:08:05,359
from austin and texas are two dudes in a

5843
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:07,200
suit

5844
03:08:05,359 --> 03:08:08,640
that sometimes have a podcast talk a

5845
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:11,040
bunch of nonsense and a mic

5846
03:08:08,639 --> 03:08:12,318
so let's let's bring the best suit game

5847
03:08:11,040 --> 03:08:15,120
to texas i hope you do

5848
03:08:12,318 --> 03:08:17,039
make it to texas uh at some point thanks

5849
03:08:15,120 --> 03:08:18,079

and now let me leave you with some words

5860
03:08:36,719 --> 03:08:41,438
from martin luther king jr

5861
03:08:38,719 --> 03:08:42,639
about the idea that what is just and

5862
03:08:41,439 --> 03:08:46,079
what is legal

5863
03:08:42,639 --> 03:08:48,318
and not always the same thing he said

5864
03:08:46,079 --> 03:08:49,200
never forget that what hitler did in

5865
03:08:48,318 --> 03:08:52,239
germany

5866
03:08:49,200 --> 03:08:53,279
was legal thank you for listening and

5867
03:08:52,239 --> 03:09:02,719
hope to see you

5868
03:08:53,279 --> 03:09:04,800
