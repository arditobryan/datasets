1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,040
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,278
george st pierre

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,040
considered by many to be the greatest

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:09,919
fighter in the history of ufc

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,800
and mma but even more than that one of

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,080
the greatest

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,200
martial artists ever quick mention of

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,719
our sponsors

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,879
out in the description to support this

12
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,759
podcast

13
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,599
as a side note let me say that getting

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,000
the chance to hang out with george

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,159
talk to him on the podcast record a

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,960
quick self-defense video that

17
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,238
i'll release soon all while both of us

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,480
wearing suits

19
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,359
was one of the most memorable days of my

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:43,039
life

21
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,878
in setting all this up i talked to joe

22
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,719
rogan and originally we couldn't

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,238
schedule a chat with him and george on

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,719
the jre

25
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,439
which allowed me to pretend for a brief

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,600
time

27
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,799
that george came down to austin just to

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,079
see me

29
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,679
who the hell am i in truth him and joe

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,239
probably conspired to make me feel

31
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,479
special

32
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,439
but that's the point it's inspiring to

33
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,920
see george

34
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,478
and joe who are at the top of their

35
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,200
field

36
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,879
treat others as equals as human beings

37
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,920
no matter who they are

38
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,560
even silly russians in a suit meeting

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,680
george

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,400
was an honor for me beyond words

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,920
this is a lex friedman podcast and

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
here's my conversation

43
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,439
with my long time martial arts hero and

44
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,519
now

45
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,039
my friend mr george sampire

46
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,560
in your fighting career where you're

47
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,000
more motivated by

48
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,359
the love of winning or the fear

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,560
and hatred of losing i like to win

50
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,478
better than i hate to lose because if it

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,320
would not have been the case

52
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,000
i would never have fought in the first

53
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,679
place because i don't like

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,560
to fight at all but you talked about the

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
anxiety

56
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,799
the fear that you experience leading up

57
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,039
to a fight so

58
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,960
to you ultimately the reason to go

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,280
through that

60
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,478
difficult process is because it feels

61
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,199
damn good to have your hand raised

62
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,038
there is that there is also the fact

63
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,598
that

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,878
martial art i've been introduced when i

65
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,199
was very young

66
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,159
and it's probably the best thing i can

67
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,759
do in my life

68
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:24,878
fighting it's that's what i do best

69
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:28,878
also it provides me of

70
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:32,639
freedom of access of things that

71
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,639
most of people do not have

72
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,159
but all that as a price and a lot of

73
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,079
money i made a lot of money of course

74
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,280
with it

75
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,120
i was maybe predisposed with certain

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,159
abilities

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,719
i met incredible mentors

78
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:53,120
throughout my life i worked really hard

79
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,759
and of course i had a lot of chances the

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,879
the stars were all aligned

81
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:02,079
and in order to to

82
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:05,280
kept keep that those advantages

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,640
of freedom money and glory and excess of

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,080
things that most people don't have and

85
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,279
have the these

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,599
dream life that i have i had

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,158
to sacrifice myself and fight in order

88
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:19,518
to keep it

89
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:21,840
it's very hard to understand because i

90
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,719
also believe most fighters are not like

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,519
me

92
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,479
they a lot of guys because i corner a

93
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,560
lot of guys

94
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,639
and it seems to me that they love their

95
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,920
job they enjoyed

96
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,359
to to go fight in a cage i love to train

97
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,399
i love the science

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,319
of fighting the sport the to to be in

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,360
good shape the confidence that

100
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:46,399
training in mixed martial art give me

101
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,480
however i do not like the feeling

102
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,760
of uncertainty the stress that i have

103
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:58,000
not knowing if i will be badly injured

104
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:00,639
or humiliated or

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,519
winning the fight it's to me unbearable

106
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,158
and it

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,719
that's what takes the most out of me

108
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:06,560
more than

109
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,719
brain damage more than anything that's

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,560
what takes the most out of me

111
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,400
but the thing you get from it is the

112
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,598
freedom that you

113
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,280
get because uh because of the money but

114
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,560
because of the celebrity because of

115
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,000
everything that comes with it

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,918
so you can be the best version of

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,959
yourself because of fighting but

118
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:27,120
at the same time you've said that quote

119
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,039
i don't believe there's pleasure in life

120
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,759
i believe there's only a relief from

121
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,479
pain

122
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,919
we have to suffer to be on top so isn't

123
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,399
there something to just the

124
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,680
suffering in itself just doing really

125
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,560
difficult

126
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,879
just to get to the top to explain that

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,879
and

128
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,199
so people can relate to it because not

129
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,689
everybody is a fighter

130
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,960
i think the best example i can

131
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:52,000
[Music]

132
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,439
gives is let's say you're you haven't

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,478
eat for a long time

134
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,839
and you're craving right so you're

135
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,800
suffering and then when it's time to eat

136
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,000
finally

137
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,639
you're about to eat your favorite dish

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,240
it's gonna taste so much better so

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,360
that's why i believe

140
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,879
there's always a some sort of sacrifice

141
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,439
before the pleasure and the more

142
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,079
sacrifice you do

143
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,120
like they say in fighting the bigger the

144
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,120
risk

145
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
bigger is the reward and i feel that's

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,519
that's how it is

147
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,038
for me yeah i feel that with uh i've

148
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,198
started fasting a little bit

149
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:30,079
in the past couple of years and uh

150
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,520
there's nothing as

151
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:36,000
amazing as a delicious meal or anything

152
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,319
actually anything any food when you

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,879
haven't eaten for several days

154
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,360
it's it's kind of incredible uh it's not

155
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,959
incred

156
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,280
it's not incredible in this simple way

157
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,399
of finally i get to eat

158
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,439
it's you get to truly experience the the

159
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,000
beauty of

160
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,360
of what it is to be alive like that

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,639
little piece of food

162
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,520
you see all the flavors you you you

163
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,800
feel just the experience of it is uh

164
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,799
ultimately

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,079
of gratitude of how awesome it is to be

166
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,840
alive

167
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,439
but when you eat many times a day and

168
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,879
you're pigging out and

169
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,879
you don't get to experience that and

170
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,159
it's fascinating it's re it's really

171
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,038
like fasting

172
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,199
is one of the most accessible things for

173
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:17,918
people i think to experience that kind

174
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
of

175
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:24,000
uh pairing of hardship to pleasure

176
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,638
i agree and in my case it changed my

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,360
life

178
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,918
on a good good way i cannot recommend it

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,240
to people because everybody is different

180
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,439
but after my to to fight michael bisping

181
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,160
my last fight

182
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,879
was against uh the champion in the

183
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,199
heavier

184
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,000
weight class that i used to compete at

185
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,919
so

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,639
i thought that if i would gain weight

187
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,478
it would increase my performance yeah

188
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,439
and i struggled a lot to gain weight i

189
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,399
gained a lot

190
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,038
about eight to 10 10 pounds normally i

191
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,279
walk around

192
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,759
185 pounds and for that fight i was

193
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,359
walking around 195

194
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,479
however i forced myself to eat like six

195
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,840
times a day i was

196
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:10,159
on a very strict diet

197
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,598
and i didn't feel it didn't feel right

198
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,800
to me because

199
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,560
i feel like i i was carrying like a

200
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,759
little bit like i was carrying a bag

201
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,478
on my shoulder and

202
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,319
i think it was a bad idea for me because

203
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:28,000
when i

204
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,319
did the weight the weigh-in and i i

205
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,279
go went on a scale at 185 i couldn't go

206
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,400
back to my

207
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,879
initial weight that was 180 195 that i

208
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,478
worked

209
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:41,360
so hard for several months to get there

210
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,918
so i was 190 pounds but i couldn't get

211
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,639
back

212
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,478
and the morning of the fight i i i got i

213
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,720
got sick i had like uh

214
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,318
we didn't know what what it was and the

215
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,199
beginning

216
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,720
because in order to know to find out

217
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,478
what it was i needed to do what they

218
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
call a colonoscopy they put a camera

219
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:02,560
inside of you and to do that

220
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,560
they give you um something that makes

221
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,800
that empty you and i was trying to gain

222
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,759
weight not to lose weight

223
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,400
so i i told myself i'm gonna wait after

224
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,720
the fight

225
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,918
whatever it is because it was pretty bad

226
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,680
it was blood and

227
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,198
i i didn't know what i was i was very

228
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,000
concerned concerned i thought i had

229
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,639
maybe cancer i was freaking out

230
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,160
so i said i'm gonna do that fight and

231
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,960
then after right away i'm gonna make a

232
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,039
checkup

233
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,959
so i did that fight everything went well

234
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,159
i won the fight i went back home i did

235
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,439
the colonoscopy and i

236
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,719
i got diagnosed with ulcer colitis

237
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,200
then i got on very severe medication

238
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,719
to get better and i'm not a big fan of

239
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,839
medication i was

240
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,959
trying to look for more natural way to

241
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,399
to to get better and i found out about

242
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,838
fasting

243
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,399
and it really changed my life i met dr

244
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,760
jason

245
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:59,039
fong was one of the one i'm

246
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:02,399
one of the world authority of fasting

247
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:06,719
he treat diabetes patient with fasting

248
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:09,440
and he gave me a program of fasting and

249
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,240
it really changed my life and right away

250
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,760
what i did

251
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,560
is i went in in a cat scan to see the

252
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,159
difference

253
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,679
because it was right after my fight with

254
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,039
michael bisping and i

255
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:24,319
i did the cat scan so i had my uh

256
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:26,240
muscle mass bone density uh fat

257
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,800
percentage water retention it's pretty

258
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,959
amazing

259
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,000
it can show you which harm has more

260
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,559
muscle than

261
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,200
the other it's very precise and i did it

262
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,399
like uh

263
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,600
two two months after yeah so i i started

264
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,559
doing um

265
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,519
time restricted eating uh sixteen eight

266
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,239
but

267
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,639
right that right away when i started i

268
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,639
did

269
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,480
three days water fast and the doctor

270
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,480
jason funk says because i like to train

271
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,600
during those days

272
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,159
i cons i consume himalayan salt to make

273
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,759
sure

274
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:57,679
because when you sweat there's a lot of

275
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:01,039
minerals to to make sure you don't

276
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,799
depleted your mineral and um

277
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,120
when i went when i compared the two

278
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,120
results in the cat scan i found out

279
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,600
my biggest concern was to lose muscle

280
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,639
mass i found out that i did not lose

281
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,639
muscle mass

282
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,759
instead of losing it i it increased a

283
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,120
little bit

284
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:20,319
even though my weight on the scale

285
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,959
was lighter i i kept the same muscle

286
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
mass even

287
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,599
increases a little bit my bone density

288
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,800
increases a little bit

289
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,079
my water retention is the biggest thing

290
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,958
that decrease so the my inflammation

291
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,479
and my fat percentage so basically the

292
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,838
by looking at the data

293
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,759
i found out that by eating

294
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,320
so much trying to gain weight for to

295
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:47,120
fight michael bisping i only increases

296
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,120
my water retention which is not good

297
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
because it's like dead weight and

298
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,679
inflammation on you

299
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,320
so what uh was the actual process of

300
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,000
fasting

301
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,079
she said 16 8 time restricted so

302
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
intermittent fasting but you also

303
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,919
mentioned the three out

304
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,039
of the three day water fast what did

305
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:06,719
that feel like

306
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,240
and you also said training during the

307
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,839
three day yeah

308
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,278
how did that feel oh can you give me

309
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,240
some details of absolutely this is

310
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,679
fascinating

311
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,039
so i do three days water fast

312
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:22,000
uh four times a year nice and for me

313
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,039
i do it everybody's different but for me

314
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,278
i do it after

315
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,799
uh new year's because during the the

316
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,600
early days that's when i

317
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,599
i eat bad foods and i drink i see it

318
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,000
more like a like a cleansing you know

319
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,639
like a

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,078
like like a detox so to speak mental too

321
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,199
like psychologically yes

322
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,639
i do it after the new years right before

323
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,440
the summer

324
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,879
cut for the beach yeah yeah yeah after

325
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,279
the summer because of the summer i've

326
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,439
been

327
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,919
partying a little bit sometime let

328
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,160
myself go and right before the

329
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:56,639
the holidays and um i've tried the doc

330
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,439
dr fungi says to me say george everybody

331
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,278
is different

332
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,240
because i'm a very active person and

333
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:05,439
everybody has a different genetics so so

334
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,639
for me i i feel that three days is the

335
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,399
sweet spot

336
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
because i still train during those three

337
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,919
days the first day the first

338
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,278
two days i don't change nothing i i

339
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,599
train regularly on every

340
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,759
on my regular schedule however on the on

341
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,240
the third day

342
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,169
i modify a little bit i i do something

343
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,560
more

344
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:26,078
[Music]

345
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:28,958
more easy and that's how i do it and

346
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,000
i've tried before because i when i say

347
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,799
three days is my

348
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,440
sweet spot i've tried to go up to five

349
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,759
days

350
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,720
but the problems is after my third days

351
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,480
i i

352
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,079
found out that i had a big problem

353
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,320
sleeping i i get into a

354
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,759
hyperactive mode yeah they call that the

355
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,720
hunter-gatherer uh

356
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,679
uh mode you know like you you you you

357
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
your brain

358
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,199
i mean it's amazing your creativity is

359
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,359
at its peak

360
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,399
but you cannot sleep very well and

361
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,320
sleeping

362
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,919
for me i think it's very important so

363
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,040
that's why i do three days for me it's

364
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,639
my sweet spot

365
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,719
that's interesting you're right it's the

366
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,519
four or five days when you start

367
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,278
see sleep is not important for me so the

368
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,278
creativity is really important

369
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,439
so it's very interesting with the places

370
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:15,039
your mind goes after a few days

371
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,880
you're right but uh i mean

372
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,719
what does it do to your mind so you

373
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,519
mentioned your body likes it

374
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,759
in terms of training does it um do you

375
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,759
find that it helps you focus and think i

376
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,759
mean you're one of the

377
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,120
great strategic thinkers in terms of

378
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,958
martial arts does it help

379
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,799
with learning does it help with thinking

380
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,439
does it help with strategizing and all

381
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,519
that

382
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,480
well unfortunately i got into fasting

383
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,159
after i retired i wish i would have i

384
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,480
really wish people

385
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,919
asked me would you have done it during

386
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,159
the time that you competed and the

387
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,879
answer is yes

388
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,719
i think we live in a society that we're

389
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:57,278
bombarded by publicity

390
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:59,278
oh buy this eat protein this that and

391
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,480
fasting nobody makes money with it

392
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,000
because there's nothing

393
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,159
to sell you know i think that's why

394
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,600
a lot of people have not heard about it

395
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,439
and even my

396
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,278
for myself if someone would have talked

397
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,480
to me about fast the benefits

398
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:17,439
of fasting when i was training

399
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,959
before i got sick i would probably have

400
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,560
ignored

401
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:24,879
ignored him because it i'm not you know

402
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,799
it was it's hard to believe sorry it

403
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,559
sounds ridiculous

404
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,559
yes it's going to help your mind and

405
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,198
you're going to gain muscle potentially

406
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,319
exactly and and perhaps people have

407
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,039
talked to me about it but i

408
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,680
kind of it went in one of my hair and

409
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,240
got out

410
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,198
from the other side you know but uh it

411
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,639
really changed my

412
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,759
my life and dying i i was diagnosed with

413
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,959
ulcer colitis

414
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,480
and it helps me get rid of all my

415
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,679
symptoms what i do is

416
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,519
i know a lot of people have ulcer

417
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,638
colitis and and

418
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,000
for me i cannot recommend it to to other

419
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,720
people because everybody is it's

420
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,159
different but

421
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,120
for me i made a a lot of research

422
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,039
of how people from those circulations

423
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,839
got better and i found out that a lot of

424
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,278
people that got that condition get

425
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,480
better in the natural way

426
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:17,679
fasting eating fermented food collagen

427
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,000
and like bone broth and stuff all i got

428
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,439
and it made a huge difference in my life

429
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,320
i just wish i would have known that

430
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,959
before

431
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,240
so do you have a specific diet wise

432
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,319
stuff you like so

433
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,399
you know i've recently another

434
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,040
ridiculous sounding thing but it makes

435
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,320
me feel

436
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:36,639
really good it's very low carbs so

437
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,519
you know keto even carnivore it sounds

438
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,680
ridiculous

439
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,320
it doesn't make any sense but it makes

440
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,399
me feel really good even for performance

441
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,839
is rogan has an influence you know he's

442
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,759
a no carnivore diet

443
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,360
i was influenced actually by people yeah

444
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,120
like he

445
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,278
there's i'll tell you where cause i was

446
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,759
doing it before he was doing it uh

447
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,000
is there's it was uh popular in the

448
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,320
endurance athlete community

449
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,278
where it was fat adapted athletes it's

450
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
people who

451
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,799
insane people who run 50 miles 100 miles

452
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,120
they

453
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,479
figured out that they could fuel their

454
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,799
body by

455
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,959
with fat they can go to fat as the

456
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:16,319
source of energy as opposed to carbs

457
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:18,638
so and i remember

458
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,399
hoping that i'll be able to learn how to

459
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,680
run 50 miles and so on

460
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,600
i've never done more than 22 but

461
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,958
it i i just remember switching away from

462
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,000
carbs

463
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,518
and feeling really liberated

464
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,320
like i wasn't thinking about food as

465
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,959
much i'm able to eat once a day

466
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,800
and feel really good i mean it i think

467
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:44,479
every everybody's body is different

468
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:47,359
but i think carbs make me lazy

469
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,720
maybe it's because uh yeah it's the

470
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,159
crash but also just

471
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,920
psychologically something it uh it

472
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,399
forces me to also think about food too

473
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,120
much

474
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,639
like it starts becoming you know art

475
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,919
just like you said our society is so

476
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,919
much about food there's so many

477
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,439
so much advertisement and so much of our

478
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,038
social life is about food

479
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,439
and so it's very easy to live life

480
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:10,558
like live day to day thinking when is

481
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,839
the next meal

482
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:12,959
like what am i gonna eat for lunch what

483
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:14,720
am i gonna eat for dinner what am i

484
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,279
gonna eat for breakfast

485
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,880
and uh if you're not careful that's

486
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,078
going to get in the way of you doing

487
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,679
cool for like

488
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,359
liberating yourself and thinking like

489
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,919
what am i actually passionate about in

490
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,918
this life

491
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,120
like creating and forgetting to eat

492
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,679
those kinds of things

493
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,399
and still being able to fuel your body i

494
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,840
don't know

495
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,880
it's been fascinating to to figure out

496
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,879
like later in life that carbs aren't

497
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,400
necessary to function well

498
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,919
it's it makes me think like we don't

499
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,840
know anything about nutrition

500
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:51,120
that's right yes you know um

501
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:53,439
personally i don't think i

502
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,798
could have a diet without carbs i love

503
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,880
chocolate too much

504
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,440
for me eating it's a it's a pleasure of

505
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,440
life i love my carbs i love my sugar

506
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,200
however if you talk about that i don't

507
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,840
have a specific diet

508
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:10,960
but recently i what i'm trying to do is

509
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,759
the days that i do not work out i only

510
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,360
eat

511
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,558
once that's kind of my rules plus i try

512
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:21,119
to respect

513
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:23,678
sixteen eight and do my three day fast

514
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,399
four time years and but the rest of the

515
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,160
thing i

516
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,480
i i i let myself lose because i

517
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,600
i don't think i would be happy if i if i

518
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
uh

519
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,439
if i if i don't give myself the the the

520
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,200
right to

521
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,640
to eat for me personally i love to eat

522
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,519
so much next

523
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,120
and um you talk about diet carnivore

524
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:47,918
diet is very interesting because i

525
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,199
a few years ago i went to africa in

526
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,480
masai mara

527
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,160
and it's a tribe in

528
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:00,079
in east africa and i went to visit

529
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:04,558
them i did a safari and i talked to them

530
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:07,279
and these guys they their diet is 99

531
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,359
carnivore they that's crazy and you

532
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,359
should see they're very beautiful people

533
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,959
shredded like yeah some people would say

534
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,000
oh it's genetic i'm like yeah maybe it's

535
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,279
genetic but

536
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,279
i mean and think about the eskimos also

537
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,399
that like most of their diet is

538
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:24,879
on on fish right they so

539
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,000
i believe it can be done you know like i

540
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,679
believe it can be done

541
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,519
like an exclusive carnivore diet and i

542
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,600
i think i'm gonna try it pretty soon

543
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,639
just to have the experience you know to

544
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,199
see how it feels like

545
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,640
where you're gonna hang out with joe be

546
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,480
careful bringing it up because he'll

547
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,480
convince you to uh forever switch to

548
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,599
carnivore definitely he loves it

549
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,558
i mean but just like you i think he

550
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,519
loves

551
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,480
food so he's he can't ever stay on

552
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,000
carnivore

553
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,679
it was funny because we went to an

554
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,679
italian restaurant together and

555
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:01,280
i still only eat meat like i love um

556
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,798
i love the constraints of discipline

557
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,359
that's that's partially why i like

558
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,230
carnivore i like saying no to food that

559
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,798
is delicious

560
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:11,679
[Laughter]

561
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:13,119
but a part of the problem is that i

562
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,480
don't know how to moderate you said

563
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,239
chocolate i don't know how to have one

564
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,279
chocolate is that something you're able

565
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,798
to do

566
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,639
have like in moderation no it's when it

567
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:22,879
when i have an opportunity i do it i

568
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,520
don't

569
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,559
have any i'm an extremist person alex i

570
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,839
i

571
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,480
that's the thing i when i when i have a

572
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,199
chance i

573
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,640
i like i i just eat i go too much and

574
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
that's why i like about my life you know

575
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,320
that's what i

576
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,480
like about fasting because probably if

577
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,639
i would not have discovered fasting

578
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,880
eating chocolate would give me cramps

579
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,679
and all sorts of problems yeah because

580
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,919
people on

581
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,440
circulitis normally they cannot eat

582
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,880
chocolate they cannot drink alcohol

583
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,080
but i believe because i'm fasting

584
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,159
that's the reason why i'm i'm medication

585
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,918
medicine medication free i can eat

586
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,159
whatever i want whenever i want

587
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,000
but i have to do that that fasting you

588
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,480
know and now it becomes to

589
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,400
it became to a point that it's no longer

590
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,200
hard for me it's it's like normal

591
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,919
i don't even force myself yeah i don't

592
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,840
it's easy

593
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,640
you know what i mean some of my friend

594
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,879
thinks i'm think i'm i'm insane you know

595
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,038
but i tell them it's like with when you

596
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,120
get used to it it becomes like an

597
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,319
abbot and i'm and i know that

598
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:26,558
hunter-gatherer

599
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,519
like our ancestor did not eat three

600
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,720
times a day

601
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,558
it's it's it's not true they

602
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,919
they ate when they they could and when

603
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,240
they eat they they

604
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,280
they they feed themselves as much as

605
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,319
they can until that

606
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,639
because the next time because they

607
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:44,000
didn't know when they could eat again

608
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,200
right so it's uh i think that's

609
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,558
how we're we're built you know to to to

610
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,400
have this similar lifestyle

611
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,678
if we could take a step back to the

612
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,120
discussion about fear

613
00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:00,000
a little bit so mike tyson talks about

614
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,079
this process of him walking to the ring

615
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
he sounds similar to you in many ways

616
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,199
of the anxiety and the fear that he

617
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,400
experiences

618
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,640
and uh he has this uh

619
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,080
sort of story that he tells about

620
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,880
walking to the ring and being

621
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,038
supremely afraid but as he walks and

622
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,679
gets closer and steps in he finds the

623
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,919
confidence

624
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,840
and becomes supremely confident i think

625
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,919
he calls himself like a god i feel like

626
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,918
a god in the ring

627
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,280
is is do you go through a similar

628
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:32,720
process of finding the confidence

629
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:36,240
well it yes and um

630
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,440
i usually i use a james lange theory

631
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,480
they they did so what i do is because

632
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,400
i'm i'm

633
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,880
i'm not afraid to admit that i'm afraid

634
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,798
and uh in the beginning of my of my

635
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,200
career

636
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,798
i really thought i asked myself because

637
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,960
i was very good

638
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,279
in mixed martial but i i really thought

639
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,558
i wasn't made for this because

640
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:03,279
the idea of fighting didn't

641
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,158
was was didn't make me happy it's

642
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,599
something like i

643
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:10,640
i was i was forced to do in order to

644
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:12,639
keep that lifestyle that i have

645
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,080
and achieve my goal perhaps one day to

646
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,000
make enough money to

647
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,199
retire and you know that that was my

648
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,519
dream but when i was looking around

649
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,880
the gym where i was training most of my

650
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,879
training partner they were happy they

651
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,400
were excited and sometimes i corner i

652
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,679
corner a lot of guys and they're happy

653
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,120
and they're in the locker room they

654
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,038
don't react the same way

655
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:36,399
i do some perhaps does but

656
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:38,079
if you see me in the locker room

657
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,360
like when i get like my last fight with

658
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,000
michael bisping just to give you an

659
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,319
example

660
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,079
in my last fight with michael bisping

661
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,278
because it's fresh it's the one that is

662
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,359
the most recent

663
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:48,400
and but it's always the same thing my

664
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,038
last fight

665
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,798
and my thing i get in the locker room i

666
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,359
had like

667
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,079
three guys that i trained with mickey

668
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,439
gall

669
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:02,000
amon zahabi and uh joseph duffy

670
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,640
they all lost it was like like my locker

671
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
room was

672
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,919
basically cursed you know the

673
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,919
when you're in the locker room and

674
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,440
people from your locker room leave for a

675
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,120
fight and then they come back it's kind

676
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,200
of a momentum you know you

677
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,399
you shake and yeah good job now it's my

678
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,440
you know it's kind of a

679
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,038
team brotherhood sort of thing

680
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,080
so the the the

681
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,679
the atmosphere in my locker room was

682
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:32,240
pretty bad it was like uh

683
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:34,960
going to a you know like a funeral

684
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,679
so i was very scared and ever before

685
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,960
every fight i

686
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,440
i asked myself i i asked myself always

687
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,000
what the hell i'm doing here why

688
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,840
did i choose to come back oh my god

689
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,278
and i'm freaking out however

690
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,959
i'm putting on a mask like i'm acting

691
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,558
because if i don't do that it will

692
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,558
reflect on my coaches

693
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,480
and if my coach might the confidence of

694
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,558
my coaches is affected

695
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,400
it will reflect reflect on me so i need

696
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:06,240
to feel strong

697
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,240
i need to make them believe that

698
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:09,359
i'm excited to be there and i'm happy to

699
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,880
be there so

700
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:15,199
this sort of play start when i

701
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,919
get when i first step in the locker room

702
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,319
even though i

703
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,000
feel completely different but that's how

704
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,319
i play it

705
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,119
normally the day the fight day i never

706
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:27,519
felt

707
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:30,000
feel 100 i always feel exhausted tired

708
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,918
my highs are hitching because i don't

709
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,119
sleep enough the few nights before

710
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,278
because i'm constantly

711
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,439
rehearse rehearsing scenarios that might

712
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,558
happen and i find

713
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,120
so mentally it's not

714
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,918
that i'm not on top but you keep all

715
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,479
that to yourself

716
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,480
i keep it to myself and i'm lying to

717
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,079
everybody around me

718
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,919
but everybody knows you know for us

719
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,519
john denahar they they know freddie

720
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,960
roach they've been with me for a long

721
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,519
time so they know what's going on but at

722
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,038
least

723
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,359
i'm lying to them i'm like i'm feeling

724
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,798
great so and seeing all my training

725
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,959
partner

726
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,000
like very disappointed because they lost

727
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,319
their fight some were

728
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,599
were badly hurt as well it was hard

729
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,278
so and i remember i get i get more i get

730
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,038
i start to warm up and everything and as

731
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,759
you start to warm up

732
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,960
you become a different person because

733
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,440
you know

734
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,319
cert we know that certain posture and

735
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,798
yoga can have

736
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,480
affects your men there's mental state

737
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,158
but it's i would say it's a little bit

738
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,558
the same thing in in fighting you know

739
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,559
like when you start hitting the pads

740
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,720
you your your muscle memory your

741
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,119
instincts comes back and and

742
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,798
you remember that you're good at this

743
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,759
you know and your confidence start to

744
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,599
grow

745
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,400
and as seeing your trainers holding the

746
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,000
pad and then repeating your moves

747
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
it makes you also remember all the

748
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,720
sacrifices you have done through your

749
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,879
your training camp and confidence come

750
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,440
from how you prepared yourself

751
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,480
and even you're afraid you can be

752
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,240
confident

753
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,919
confident in the same time being afraid

754
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,120
and being confidence is two different

755
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,159
thing

756
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:08,079
and before every fight just right before

757
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,320
i walk in

758
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,359
it's when i'm scared i go in in the

759
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,720
bathroom

760
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,719
and i look at myself in the mirror i

761
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,038
used to have a bandana and a ghee

762
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,360
but now i it no more i didn't have this

763
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:22,398
this for my last fight because of the

764
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:24,079
the the new reebok deal they had but i

765
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,359
did the same rehearsal that i always do

766
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,879
i look at myself in the mirror and i

767
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,079
start to compliment

768
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,159
myself like even if i don't believe it

769
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,240
i'm starting to trying to believe it as

770
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,840
i am i'm finding all the reason why i'm

771
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,640
going to win the fight

772
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,319
and and all my trainer knows that before

773
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,440
every fight when when the guy from the

774
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:42,720
ufc goes and

775
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,880
steppen maroon says saint pierre are you

776
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,839
up next i always take a few minutes

777
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,440
to do that that same rehearsal and i

778
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,158
tell myself i'm gonna win this fight

779
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,240
because

780
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,159
i'm better and and i'm very cocky about

781
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,200
myself i'm telling all the reasons that

782
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,960
i'm gonna

783
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,880
you know when i'm i got a better team i

784
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,960
made more sacrifice you know

785
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,039
i'm i'm faster i'm more powerful way

786
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,278
more athletic my fighting iq is better

787
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,200
than him i got a strategy on point

788
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,359
that he's never going to be able to keep

789
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,759
up with and and this and that

790
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,359
and i'm and be i was telling myself hey

791
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,960
i'm going to show these young kids

792
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,798
how things should be done you know i'm

793
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,880
trying to boost myself yeah

794
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,558
try to to boost yourself and you start

795
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,360
to believe in it you become a different

796
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,398
person

797
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:27,599
so when you walk out the bathroom now

798
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,359
rock and roll now i really believe it

799
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,158
for real you know like i'm still scared

800
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,759
but i believe

801
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,360
it for real and that's the

802
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,919
transformation that happened for me

803
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,319
right there and from that from now

804
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,679
from from there to the fight it's until

805
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,639
the fight is over it's called

806
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,320
i call it cruise control because i do

807
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,159
not have time to think in a fight if

808
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:49,119
you're trying to think you're missing

809
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,480
the opportunity so that's how i see it

810
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,479
for myself so at that point you stop

811
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,120
thinking and you just go cruise control

812
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,120
autopilot trust yourself you know trust

813
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:59,599
yourself because you you repeated

814
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,678
all the scenarios you know so everything

815
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,359
that you have done it's it's inside that

816
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,720
your computer your computer your brain

817
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,759
is programmed to react

818
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,159
accordingly to certain situations and

819
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,158
the it's not the the night of the fight

820
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,840
that you you'll tell yourself oh finally

821
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,000
i'm gonna do this if you do this now now

822
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:19,038
if you have not practiced it before

823
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,640
you're screwed it the preparation the

824
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,200
repetition that

825
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,679
makes it happen you know what about like

826
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,319
the

827
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,798
really difficult moments in a fight

828
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,798
where you

829
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,839
are tested to your limits essentially

830
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,519
usually it's cardio related exhaustion

831
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,359
right where you have to ask yourself

832
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,558
that same questions like why the hell am

833
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,519
i doing this

834
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:42,000
yeah do you do do you experience those

835
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,278
or

836
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,440
are you able to ride through the

837
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,720
autopilot and if you do like what do you

838
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,480
do in those moments

839
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,159
never in a fight when i'm in a fight

840
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,960
when it's the the

841
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,559
when the fight is is on i never change

842
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,679
my mind i go

843
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,359
until the end however

844
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,880
for example my first fight would be

845
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,599
japan i

846
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,039
had a terrible first round so i had to

847
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,759
switch gear

848
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:09,440
that happened sometime but it's part of

849
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,879
my plan i always have a plan b

850
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,640
plans plan a plan b plan c

851
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,559
you need to have that if fighters goes

852
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,840
into a fight thinking oh what i'm gonna

853
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:19,839
do this is this

854
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,959
and they don't have a plan b if this

855
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,959
doesn't work

856
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,240
that's mean they're not well prepared if

857
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,720
you talk to me before

858
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,960
every fight i can like in 30 seconds

859
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,880
give you my old strategy

860
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,159
you know for bj penn my first fight

861
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,360
would be japan was

862
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,120
i'm gonna keep it standing up

863
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,639
keep the fight from the outside you know

864
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,798
because i'm faster than him

865
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,919
then the fight would be japan's start i

866
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:44,798
found out that

867
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,080
i was not faster than him and i found

868
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,720
out that

869
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,439
his reaction time was better than than

870
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,558
than mine

871
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,720
so i got beat up the first round

872
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,240
and i got the bloody nose and everything

873
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,480
so my plan b

874
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,399
was now i'm gonna wrestle him you know

875
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,000
i'm gonna wrestle him and

876
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:03,839
you know make him tired and trying to

877
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,319
put him down and that's how i beat him

878
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,359
because i

879
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,798
switch gear you know but if you can't do

880
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,558
that if you cannot

881
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:11,839
find a way to become the perfect nemesis

882
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:13,759
to your opponent

883
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,599
you you you might win if you fight but

884
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:18,240
you you're gonna

885
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,000
find a uh you're gonna fight someone

886
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,798
sooner or later that will

887
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,278
that will give you a lot of uh a lot of

888
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,960
trouble

889
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:26,558
so that's where the anxiety pays off

890
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,240
you're anticipating all the ways it goes

891
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:31,918
wrong so you develop the plan b

892
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:35,200
and plan c hi you know we talked a lot

893
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,840
with uh like john donahue who you work

894
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,278
with

895
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,678
it's interesting i don't think i've

896
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:43,759
heard him talk about plan b and plan c

897
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:46,000
he usually has a really clear plan a

898
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:46,798
an entire system of plan a i don't think

899
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,398
i've heard him

900
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:51,038
we've had uh we had a a good discussion

901
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:55,839
about it

902
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:58,640
in um uh over some cheeseburgers

903
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,199
and he's uh he was kind of espousing the

904
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,880
value

905
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,759
of mastering escapes so

906
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,159
when you find yourself in bad situations

907
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,079
being

908
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,000
exceptionally good at finding ways out

909
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:11,278
of those bad situations and that's a way

910
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,159
of dominance

911
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,278
there's nothing there's no better way to

912
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,519
dominate your opponent

913
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,278
according to him than to show that they

914
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,880
can't possibly hurt you no matter how

915
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,119
bad the position is

916
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,039
uh it's like it's a as opposed to a

917
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,038
physical dominance it's a psychological

918
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:30,480
dominance it's very interesting

919
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:33,200
but i wonder if he has plan b

920
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,759
and plan c in his mind too you know in

921
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,519
uh

922
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,038
mixed martial arts sometimes it's like

923
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,919
in science something you can make a mis

924
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:41,679
like a mistake you know like every human

925
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,600
can make mistakes you know

926
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,600
there's certain sport or a certain

927
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,398
situation that you

928
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,199
if there's a mistake made you're you're

929
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,678
you're that's it

930
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,038
exactly sometimes it's the case in mma

931
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,880
but sometimes you

932
00:32:53,038 --> 00:33:00,240
able to redeem yourself and uh

933
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,480
if you look the fight with bj pen

934
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,839
one that i had which was probably one of

935
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,919
the most competitive fight i

936
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,599
and it was probably the it was the fight

937
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,240
that i got the most

938
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:10,959
damage and i was messed up it took me

939
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,640
three days

940
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,880
like two three days to recuperate from

941
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,960
that fight i was really damaged

942
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,840
and my first fight versus my second

943
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,679
fight i made a lot of adjustment

944
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:24,639
because i i've learned from my first

945
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,880
fight and also i had a guy

946
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,480
one thing people don't know like they

947
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,120
talk about fighters having secret

948
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,000
weapons

949
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:34,079
see for me my secret weapons was not

950
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,599
like some is that they used like certain

951
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,639
like different things for me was

952
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,599
knowledge

953
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,159
i had a guy in montreal he was measuring

954
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,558
frames

955
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,840
he's not a scientist is he's a friend of

956
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,720
uh ferrous and i

957
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:47,678
and what he does he watch fight and he

958
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,600
measure frames

959
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,840
the way he does it is when you watch a

960
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,319
fight and one of the guy throw a punch

961
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:54,798
he

962
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,480
he cut the picture by frame the video by

963
00:33:54,798 --> 00:34:00,079
frame

964
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,640
so he's able to see which fighter has

965
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,359
better reaction time than others

966
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,640
and bjpen he found out that bj penn

967
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:08,639
evolved the

968
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,398
ufc roster at the time when he was in

969
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,559
his prime he had probably the best

970
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,559
reaction time of all

971
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,838
according to him lyoto meshido was the

972
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:18,960
second one

973
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:21,440
but bj penn was the first one so

974
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,199
i knew that if i would try to go first

975
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,000
because i always been the fastest

976
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,759
guy normally when i fight someone but

977
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,358
when i fought big japan i tried to go

978
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,359
first and he was always able to like

979
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,878
i never was never able to to touch him

980
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,199
with my jab and he came back with a

981
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:40,878
counter punch

982
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,878
however because of what he told me

983
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,799
i knew that big japan has a very fast

984
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:48,480
reaction time but had a very poor

985
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,159
reset time to him the way he described

986
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,838
it to me is like your nervous system is

987
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,838
like a muscle

988
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,119
bj pen was so fast but he's like more

989
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,199
like a sprinter

990
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,280
so what i did the second fight i when i

991
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,118
fought with japan i made him flinch

992
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,359
like i fake a lot so i make him react

993
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,320
and flinch so all that that reaction

994
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,838
time

995
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,039
that he used to flinch was not used

996
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:14,078
properly to avoid my punches so he i

997
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:16,400
burn i i load up his his nervous system

998
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,560
with a lot of information and fit and

999
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,519
fake and to make him flinch and

1000
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,759
pretending i was kicking and wrestling

1001
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:26,719
so he got overwhelmed and he got tired

1002
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,480
very very fast so that's how i beat him

1003
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,719
people sometimes they don't know

1004
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,320
really what's the strategy behind the

1005
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,000
thing they only see the physical part

1006
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,838
but when you fight someone if i fight

1007
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,358
you i look at you in the eyes

1008
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,880
there's a lot of things that going on

1009
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:41,039
between you and i

1010
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,480
i can look down here pump jab you in the

1011
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,639
face

1012
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,599
the audience will not see this little

1013
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,239
detail

1014
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,359
but you will see it and that's what it

1015
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,439
makes the magic

1016
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,119
during a fight the relation that you

1017
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,039
have with the opponent you know like

1018
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,599
like the mental game what you you make

1019
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,480
him believe

1020
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,880
those little things i use a lot of those

1021
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,719
if you

1022
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,160
talk to a lot of my opponent they'll

1023
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:03,598
tell you like i use a lot of these

1024
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,319
little thing you know like i look down a

1025
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,400
banana i go

1026
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,599
i go up or i'm pretending i want to

1027
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,838
attack you so i'm i'm

1028
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,039
making flinch but in reality i'm just

1029
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:12,719
doing this

1030
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,358
because i want to rest i want to

1031
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:16,879
recuperate and i'm tired

1032
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:18,559
how much is you know people talk about

1033
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,838
that with poker for example

1034
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:24,159
how much is the value of this you know

1035
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,679
so like some people argue that poker is

1036
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:27,440
more about the betting

1037
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:28,960
you know it's just the money it's just

1038
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,679
how much you bet and so on

1039
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,960
so that would be more like uh the

1040
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,598
analogy there with

1041
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,358
with fighting would be just strictly the

1042
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,800
physical movement of your body

1043
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,880
and then a lot of people argue that

1044
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,560
there's a lot here in the way you look

1045
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,800
in the little movements in the face

1046
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:46,000
so do you think there's do you think

1047
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,720
you're communicating

1048
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,119
with your opponent when you look at them

1049
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:54,159
there's no way to know for sure 100

1050
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,760
and i'm by no no mean psychic nothing

1051
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,078
like that and i don't believe in that at

1052
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,560
all

1053
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,400
the only thing is i know to looking

1054
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,799
through the eyes of my opponent

1055
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,358
when he's afraid and when he gives up on

1056
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,400
me yeah i've been accused very often

1057
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,960
in my career to not take enough risk to

1058
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,119
not

1059
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,119
finish my opponent but the reason why i

1060
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,280
didn't finish my opponent is because

1061
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,800
i saw in his eyes that he gave up he

1062
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,760
gave me the fight and i'm winning the

1063
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,519
fight

1064
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,440
so it's not up to me

1065
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:25,599
it's not to me to make it to try to

1066
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,400
sacrifice myself trying to finish him

1067
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,440
perhaps if i do that i will open up from

1068
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,039
for him to

1069
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,320
to to capitalize on my mistake

1070
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,759
it's up to him to make a risk so

1071
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,359
people sometimes they they don't

1072
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,040
understand that this is the art of

1073
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,880
fighting my friend you know

1074
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,400
like if i'm winning the fight like in

1075
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,400
aki and isaac

1076
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,838
if you're winning the game and it's the

1077
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,039
third period

1078
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:50,159
it's at the end of the third period

1079
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:52,000
you're not gonna take out your

1080
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,279
goaltender trying to score another goal

1081
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,880
because winning

1082
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,880
uh uh five to three or five to four

1083
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,640
is the same thing same thing in mma we

1084
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,838
make a living out of this

1085
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,719
and sometimes you know as sad as bad as

1086
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:06,239
it can be

1087
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,759
you want to save yourself for another

1088
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:08,879
day you know you want to minimize the

1089
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,680
damage

1090
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,838
but if he knows he's losing the fight

1091
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,358
it's up to you him to take the risk it's

1092
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,279
not up to me

1093
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,598
so i'm having i'm a good counter fighter

1094
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,960
i use a lot of my attack or counter

1095
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,680
strike or uh reactive techno proactive

1096
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,720
take down

1097
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:29,440
that's my specialty so i'm not gonna i

1098
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,358
i'd have no desire to sacrifice myself

1099
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,760
trying to to trying to finish my

1100
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,598
opponent if he want to

1101
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,000
if if if perhaps i might give him the

1102
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:41,838
opportunity to capitalize on me

1103
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,400
it's it's not it's not smart to do that

1104
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,799
and very often when i fight someone i

1105
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,599
can read him i see the fear in his eyes

1106
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,599
now i'm like i

1107
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,519
got you now he's very desperate that

1108
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,280
doesn't mean i have to

1109
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,838
put my guard down because he's going to

1110
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,119
be desperate but i know i'm beating you

1111
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:58,559
and i know i'm beating you i'm just

1112
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,920
going to do what i need you know if i

1113
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,239
have a chance of course i'll knock him

1114
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,320
out

1115
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:04,159
but i'm not gonna try to sacrifice

1116
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,838
myself to knock you out

1117
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:09,039
and if you do that maybe one day you'll

1118
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:10,559
make a mistake and

1119
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,159
you'll get dropped and you're you'll

1120
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,719
you'll tell yourself i shoot

1121
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,399
i just got brain damage maybe i'm never

1122
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,719
gonna come back the same maybe you know

1123
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,280
i

1124
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,559
i ruin my career or you know it's a it's

1125
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,160
a very serious

1126
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:25,358
game that we're playing it's very

1127
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:28,879
dangerous in the face of that

1128
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:31,920
risk i mean uh mike tyson talked about

1129
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,519
you know when the opponent looks away he

1130
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,920
knows he's got him

1131
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:40,800
right that uh that he's broken

1132
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,639
for a person like me who has trouble

1133
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,400
making eye contact with people

1134
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,920
there's there's truth to that i mean

1135
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,480
there there's truth to that

1136
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,760
that there's there's an animal nature to

1137
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,920
us looking away

1138
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,040
i mean you could see that the way the

1139
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,880
body language

1140
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:56,800
the way the eyes move between two

1141
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,440
animals going at it

1142
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,160
uh in in the wild when like two lions

1143
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,440
fight or

1144
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:05,838
to whatever fight there's a certain

1145
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,559
beta move when you've you've been

1146
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:10,000
defeated

1147
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:12,480
yes or one thing when i know that that

1148
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,679
when it happened one of the sign is when

1149
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,599
i just like

1150
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,279
made a faint and the guy flinched like

1151
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,760
crazy that's mean he's really scared of

1152
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,359
me

1153
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,960
it's a little bit like you're you're

1154
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,078
you're you're doing this that guy flinch

1155
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,199
a little bit or you're doing this he's

1156
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,839
flint like

1157
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:28,000
that's mean you hurt him and he doesn't

1158
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:28,719
want to get hurt again so he's really

1159
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,920
trying to

1160
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:33,679
run away and not

1161
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,400
not winning the fight anymore but not

1162
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,759
losing sort of surviving the the five

1163
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,800
round and it's hard to

1164
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,280
to finish a guy who does doesn't want to

1165
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,599
fight

1166
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,359
a guy who's not fighting anymore to win

1167
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,720
and he's fighting to not lose

1168
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:48,239
and the proof of that if you don't

1169
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,078
believe me just look the reign of all

1170
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:53,039
the greatest champion in ufc

1171
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,839
i don't care who they are jon jones or

1172
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,599
uh

1173
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:57,199
like you could clearly see that in the

1174
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,119
beginning of their rank they could

1175
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:00,480
you know finish a lot of their opponents

1176
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,920
the same as me in the beginning i was

1177
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,400
finishing all of my opponent

1178
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,720
but there's a time that the entire ufc

1179
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,119
roster is studying you

1180
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:11,919
and they found ways to perhaps not

1181
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,559
beating you but they found a way to

1182
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,159
navigate to the the fight in a way that

1183
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,838
they minimize the damage

1184
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:19,759
you know what i mean so it's a big

1185
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:22,400
difference between fighting to win and

1186
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,839
fighting to not lose

1187
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,920
you said that there's a difference

1188
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:28,239
between a fighter and a martial artist

1189
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,318
so now we were talking about fighting

1190
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,719
you're considered by many to be one of

1191
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:34,318
the greatest fighters of all time

1192
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,399
but you've said that there's a

1193
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:37,679
difference between a fighter and a

1194
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,680
martial artist

1195
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,279
a fighter is training for a purpose he

1196
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:44,239
has a fight

1197
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,960
i'm i'm a martial artist i don't train

1198
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:47,358
for a fight

1199
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,000
i train for myself i'm training all the

1200
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:50,719
time

1201
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,480
my goal is perfection but i will never

1202
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,799
reach perfection

1203
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,800
so what do you does it mean to be a

1204
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:01,359
martial artist

1205
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,440
martial artist is because that lifestyle

1206
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:05,679
that i have has been introduced to me

1207
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,400
and the seed has been planted to my mind

1208
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,759
a long

1209
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:14,079
long time ago by my father i

1210
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,760
am i do not train

1211
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,680
because i have a fight i will always

1212
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,680
train even now it kind of

1213
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:23,279
amused me that to see that

1214
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:25,118
a lot of people because i'm still

1215
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,800
training because i love the science of

1216
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,079
fighting i do not like to fight but i

1217
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,160
love the science of it

1218
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,200
and i will always do it as long as i can

1219
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:32,318
do it

1220
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,799
people think i'm going to make a

1221
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:35,679
comeback and everything i'm i'm about to

1222
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,039
get to have

1223
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:42,559
40 years old you know like it's i have

1224
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:44,480
you know like well mike

1225
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,559
i want to fight in a cage at 40 years

1226
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,679
old i mean some people have done it they

1227
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,159
did it very well but i

1228
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:52,639
i'm not one of them i'm i feel a little

1229
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:55,759
bit to me that

1230
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:57,358
and you never say never i feel like to

1231
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,720
me like it's a little like a kid that

1232
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:00,159
you play with this train when he's young

1233
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:01,759
like

1234
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:03,519
he's five years old brother six years

1235
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,680
old or seven years old eight years old

1236
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:07,358
and then i was like

1237
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,879
what the hell i'm doing here and i'm too

1238
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:12,239
old for this like i said

1239
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,599
i i have done it you know and

1240
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:18,239
and and i got out of it

1241
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,440
on top and i'm i'm healthy which is the

1242
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,519
most important thing

1243
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,720
right now i'm touching wood and i'm i'm

1244
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:24,480
wealthy

1245
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,639
i beat the game you know what i mean in

1246
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,159
a way like i that's not to be cocky but

1247
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,799
i did it and i wish

1248
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,000
more more fighters could do the same

1249
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,480
thing i wish

1250
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,519
but it's unfortunate because a lot of

1251
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,079
them they stay

1252
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:41,838
there and hang out for too long and and

1253
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:45,200
they get badly hurt they get

1254
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:47,920
beaten and and and broken you know

1255
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,598
and they finish broke as well because

1256
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,159
the lifestyle you have when you're a pro

1257
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,240
athlete

1258
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,679
it's crazy you know it's it's it's

1259
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,838
unbelievable

1260
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:56,960
however everything that goes up in life

1261
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:59,119
goes down

1262
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,400
and you need to plan your future you

1263
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,039
know so

1264
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,240
for for me what if some guys have the

1265
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,880
same mentality as me and they're

1266
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,719
watching us right now i would say

1267
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,960
if you do it because you're just good at

1268
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,318
it you like the money the the advantage

1269
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,559
the freedom that it gives you but you

1270
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:16,480
don't necessarily like to fight

1271
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:17,838
when you're done you finish on top you

1272
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,679
know go

1273
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:20,880
go cash out and get out of here walk

1274
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,118
away this is

1275
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,920
hard to do however lex it's not

1276
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,838
everybody that

1277
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,720
does it for that reason some people

1278
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:30,719
generally love to fight love to compete

1279
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:32,480
so they do it because i love it you know

1280
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:33,279
or they do it because of the money but

1281
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,719
if you don't

1282
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,319
love it if you don't like to fight

1283
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:37,118
because it's very stressful and you

1284
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:38,880
don't enjoy you

1285
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,400
you enjoy the training perhaps but you

1286
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,400
don't like to fight you do it because

1287
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,760
it's part of what you need to do in

1288
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,800
order to keep that lifestyle

1289
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,880
yeah and you know like

1290
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,240
you don't need the money get out of here

1291
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,599
man if you're in your

1292
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,598
you're in your prime get out of here

1293
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,640
because if you don't you you you'll hurt

1294
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,800
your own legacy

1295
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:57,759
your damage your your health it's it's

1296
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,960
very sad

1297
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,280
and and it's a it's a it's a sad

1298
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,960
business you know what i mean i i

1299
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,680
it's like a lot of uh one one of the

1300
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,559
place

1301
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,000
where is the the mo the mo one of the

1302
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:14,400
most happiest place

1303
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
for me to go and the most the saddest

1304
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,039
place for me to go it's on the gym

1305
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,719
to try sorry montreal because

1306
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,719
it's one of the happiest place for me to

1307
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,559
go because i can go train and do what i

1308
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,399
love to do

1309
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,400
but it's also a very sad place for me

1310
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,358
because after when i'm about to leave

1311
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,240
there's always a

1312
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:33,039
bunch of young kid that comes or guys

1313
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:35,759
that are

1314
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,279
around 30 33 years old and they come to

1315
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,800
me hey george you have some advice for

1316
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,160
me

1317
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,680
and i look at them and

1318
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,039
if they're my friend they're real close

1319
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:46,159
friend of mine i'll tell them the truth

1320
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,920
in their face

1321
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:49,358
and i've done it many times and it was

1322
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,960
not well received

1323
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:52,719
but if they're not my friend i have to

1324
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,400
you know you know there's always an

1325
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,318
advice about fighting and i answer

1326
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,400
their their question it's my pleasure

1327
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,800
but the truth if they

1328
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,639
they want me to tell the truth the big

1329
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,960
majority of them

1330
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:05,759
i would tell them i said listen man

1331
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,639
you're in a

1332
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,200
maybe a three like an a on a losing

1333
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,598
streak

1334
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:15,759
of three fight you're 30 33 years old

1335
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,880
you know i think you should think about

1336
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,960
doing something else

1337
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,079
in your life you know have other goals

1338
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,480
you know because

1339
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,318
you're not gonna make it and you know

1340
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,440
i've seen that movie before

1341
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,960
and it's a very sad ending and i'm i'm

1342
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,800
sad to tell you the truth

1343
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,318
because you're not going to make the

1344
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,079
money just choose some

1345
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:35,199
but if i tell them that they're going to

1346
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,800
be angry at me because they're going to

1347
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,318
be like oh you you make it and you think

1348
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,480
i cannot make it so it's kind of

1349
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:42,318
they're going to think i'm cocky but i

1350
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,920
was lucky to make it you know what

1351
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:45,759
the star were all annoying but at one

1352
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,880
point you need to be able to

1353
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,920
to have a plan b you know like like some

1354
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,880
parent they come

1355
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,880
to see me with their kids hey this is

1356
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,280
the future world champion and then

1357
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,358
in ufc and what advice would you give

1358
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,280
him i always tell the same thing

1359
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,519
and it doesn't not make everybody happy

1360
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,240
when i said i say i go to the case say

1361
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:08,318
are you good at school say stay at

1362
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,919
school school is very important for you

1363
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:14,159
stay educated yeah do boxing martial

1364
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,000
arts it's a great sport stay in shape

1365
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,159
but don't put your eggs all in the same

1366
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,719
basket and the parents sometimes are

1367
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:20,159
angry when i'm

1368
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,118
not angry but i can see their eyes

1369
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:26,318
they're like they kind of

1370
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:29,200
surprise and it's not because i

1371
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:30,639
made it that i will tell their kid to

1372
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:34,078
follow the same path that i

1373
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:36,159
did i went to school too i i studied

1374
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,839
i i dropped of school when i had my

1375
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,118
first world championship fight against

1376
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:41,599
matt hughes

1377
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,318
but before that i was school so i had

1378
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,599
another

1379
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:47,440
you know a a a a another way to go if

1380
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,519
things would not have gone the same the

1381
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,039
the way i wanted

1382
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,199
but the problem and i'm saying that it's

1383
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,519
not only about boxing in mma i'm talking

1384
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:58,480
about hockey basketball baseball same

1385
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,599
same thing maybe it's the one on the 100

1386
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,679
000 that make it

1387
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,599
and i'm saying i'm saying that make it

1388
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,759
when i'm saying make it that's mean

1389
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,960
they can retire and have enough money

1390
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,839
for the rest of his life

1391
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,199
because it's a sad story the only people

1392
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:14,480
only heard about the people

1393
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:15,279
that makes it but a lot of fighter even

1394
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,519
a ufc

1395
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,040
champion in boxing champion even

1396
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,239
football basketball i don't i don't i

1397
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:22,239
don't care the big names

1398
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:23,679
when they retire they have zero they're

1399
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,959
bankrupt my friend

1400
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:28,719
and it's a very sad sad story and a sad

1401
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,440
reality that most people are not aware

1402
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:31,519
of

1403
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,639
but having other paths in life actually

1404
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,239
can also

1405
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:37,759
increase the chance of you dominating

1406
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,159
and like reaching the highest

1407
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,359
peak uh in your main thing i mean jimmy

1408
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:43,519
pedro i don't know if you know who that

1409
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:47,119
is as a judo coach in uh

1410
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:48,719
in america he was uh he says that to all

1411
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,280
of his athletes is to make sure that you

1412
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,358
go

1413
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,720
he has a lot of you know kayla harrison

1414
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:55,199
two-time olympic gold medalist

1415
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,799
he has a lot of uh olympic medalists but

1416
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:58,480
basically there's something about going

1417
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,920
to school like having a

1418
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,480
forget school any other avenue in life

1419
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,119
that

1420
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,240
gives you the freedom to go all out in

1421
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,160
your main

1422
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:09,279
like that you know you're doing it for

1423
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,318
the right reasons

1424
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,040
you're not stuck it clears the mind to

1425
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:15,679
where you're

1426
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:16,079
free to be the best in the world yes as

1427
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,358
opposed

1428
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,119
to kind of you have to i mean different

1429
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:23,920
people are motivated by different things

1430
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,358
so sometimes some people like

1431
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,358
having their back to the wall and that's

1432
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,440
the only option they have but

1433
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:31,759
most people i think excel when you have

1434
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,440
other options i think it's a distraction

1435
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,640
and i think it's important to have a

1436
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,400
distraction

1437
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,558
uh when you say that i think about one

1438
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,440
of my coach john danaher

1439
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,559
he put his academic background

1440
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,720
experience

1441
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,800
into jiu jitsu and that for me that's

1442
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:51,279
why he's the best teacher i ever had

1443
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:53,599
he's incredible he started

1444
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,280
teaching me when i even couldn't speak

1445
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:58,240
much english at the time and

1446
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,400
i was able to communicate and understand

1447
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:02,959
you know that's how good he is

1448
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,079
but i i truly believe that most of

1449
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,039
athlete especially

1450
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,240
in sport like mixed martial art trained

1451
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:11,358
way too much

1452
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,838
if i could go back and talk to a young

1453
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:15,279
george

1454
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:16,400
i would tell him say you do way too much

1455
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,720
volume

1456
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,559
you train way too hard train smarter

1457
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:23,598
it's more important

1458
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,440
and i think sometimes we underestimate

1459
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:28,880
the benefit of uh

1460
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,280
recuperation because you i think

1461
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,240
we assimilate the information that we

1462
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,359
learn

1463
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:37,519
during a training when we recuperate and

1464
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:40,960
not during the training itself

1465
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:44,480
and this whole mentality of harder

1466
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:47,199
heavier you know like like it's

1467
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,480
it's good for someone who's lazy but if

1468
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:50,558
you're an elite athlete

1469
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,480
most of the time you know like you're

1470
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,519
not always but most of the times because

1471
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,039
you're not

1472
00:50:53,519 --> 00:51:00,000
lazy and a lot of guys sometimes they're

1473
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,480
elite athletes champions and you hear

1474
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,679
people

1475
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,480
say oh i can't believe he's very gifted

1476
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,118
but he doesn't work but perhaps it's not

1477
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,800
really

1478
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,640
because perhaps it's because we don't

1479
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,680
understand perhaps he's doing the right

1480
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,719
thing and it's

1481
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:16,799
us who's working too much and too hard

1482
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:19,759
that's what i think

1483
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,480
there's a guy i train with he's uh he

1484
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,880
made me

1485
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,599
think about about it his name is mansoor

1486
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,640
bernawi

1487
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,760
he's going to be a future star is he's

1488
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,719
an incredible fighter

1489
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,720
he trained once a day

1490
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,159
and he asked me some time advice when he

1491
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,280
came in montreal he's from france you'll

1492
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:38,558
hear about him he's

1493
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:41,040
he's very good and

1494
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,640
i i saw him in the morning at tristar

1495
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:44,239
and i said okay i'll see you perhaps

1496
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,400
later in the other 20s oh no i only

1497
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:48,799
train once a day

1498
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,400
and he kind of wait for me to give him

1499
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,760
like like like

1500
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,920
not not an approval but like

1501
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,680
to see how i react or or you know i

1502
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,159
don't know it was kind of a strange

1503
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,399
feeling but

1504
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:01,279
i i told myself at that point i kind of

1505
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,160
i had an

1506
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:08,480
awakening and i and i told myself man

1507
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,159
maybe he's doing the right thing because

1508
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,039
a lot a lot of people would say for

1509
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:15,598
example oh that's a lazy way of doing it

1510
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:16,480
but perhaps it's the best way to do it

1511
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,160
i'm not saying

1512
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,599
training once a day is the the best way

1513
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:21,358
to do it that's what i'm saying i'm

1514
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,079
saying that

1515
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:24,799
everybody is different but for him it

1516
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,880
works

1517
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,480
beautifully and i wouldn't change

1518
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,039
anything you know like

1519
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,000
if i would be him because he is he's

1520
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:35,679
improving like

1521
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,639
crazy yeah and ultimately the bigger

1522
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,519
picture there is

1523
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:41,279
to do something that everyone else's uh

1524
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:42,079
says is stupid it's like the fasting

1525
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,160
thing

1526
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,839
that that a lot of people would say a

1527
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,879
lot of nutritional experts would say

1528
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:48,960
that that's

1529
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,318
that's a dumb way you know if you want

1530
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,318
to be an mma fighter

1531
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:53,920
you should be eating like many times a

1532
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:54,880
day you should be starting every day

1533
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,838
with oatmeal

1534
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,039
you should be carbing up constantly but

1535
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:00,159
that's not necessarily true for

1536
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:01,920
everybody and

1537
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:03,279
it's possible i'm sure there's actually

1538
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,358
now a few mma fighters that are

1539
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,559
carnivore only it's possible

1540
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:11,838
i i used to eat right before training

1541
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:16,720
and i it didn't bother me

1542
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:19,119
however now i my first training

1543
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:20,558
that i do normally in average around

1544
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:24,800
noon 11

1545
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:26,559
a.m i'm uh i'm i haven't eat anything

1546
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:29,119
when i do my first training and it feels

1547
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,680
to me that i'm much

1548
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,920
i'm much more clear and much more clear

1549
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,558
in my mind i'm much more creative

1550
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,838
i feel better yeah yeah it's a big

1551
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,880
difference i just wish i would have

1552
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:40,480
known that before

1553
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,200
you know well it's fascinating the role

1554
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:46,079
of the mind and all this how important

1555
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:47,439
is it for your mind to be clear to to

1556
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,559
really think deeply

1557
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,960
i there's a

1558
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,760
there's a judoka american named travis

1559
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,318
stevens

1560
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,319
i remember he said something that

1561
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,760
the right kind of practice is when your

1562
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,639
mind is exhausted

1563
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:07,520
at the end of it that you were

1564
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:09,279
constantly thinking through things

1565
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:10,880
like your body shouldn't be exhausted

1566
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,839
first your mind should be exhausted

1567
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,160
first

1568
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:16,400
it's really fascinating so people think

1569
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:18,558
about training hard

1570
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,079
you know a successful practice is where

1571
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,319
you walk away

1572
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,519
just overwhelmed how much you have to

1573
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:26,079
think

1574
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,199
it's fascinating framing of of a

1575
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,240
successful practice

1576
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:32,078
it's true travis stephen was one of my

1577
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,318
main training partners when i got ready

1578
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:38,000
for my fight with

1579
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:42,079
nick diaz and carlos conditt

1580
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:45,119
he drove every friday

1581
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,200
from i believe boston it's like a six

1582
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:50,640
hour drive

1583
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:54,480
drive to the gym in montreal

1584
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:57,358
train with us an hour and a half

1585
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,358
drive back

1586
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:01,919
he's got such an amazing discipline i

1587
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:04,480
was

1588
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,960
so happy for him when he won the medal

1589
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:10,159
at the olympic game man

1590
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,720
what a well-deserved uh

1591
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:15,039
you know uh accomplishment it's

1592
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:19,039
unbelievable it paid off you know i'm

1593
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:21,279
i was so happy for him and every time we

1594
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,400
we got to the the gym it was waiting for

1595
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,079
me in a in in

1596
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:29,519
in the kneeling position like a soldier

1597
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:32,480
i was like my god this guy he's made of

1598
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:34,239
steel you know and and after training i

1599
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,079
always have to offer him i say hey

1600
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:37,358
travis i know you you like to train with

1601
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,318
that because in montreal they have very

1602
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:41,358
good judo team

1603
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:43,119
nicholas gill and all that that was guy

1604
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:44,719
and i say if you want to stay i'll get

1605
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,160
you the hotel you know like every

1606
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:47,919
anything you want is like no no i gotta

1607
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:49,598
go back i have another training later

1608
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,480
i'm like not only that he trained with

1609
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,640
with us

1610
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,519
he had to go back because he had another

1611
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:56,239
training i'm like

1612
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:57,679
this is insane and he's gone through a

1613
00:55:56,239 --> 00:56:01,838
huge number of injuries

1614
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:03,519
so he's also an innovator because i mean

1615
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:04,798
it's difficult to say but for american

1616
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,599
judo there's not

1617
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:08,318
many high-level judoka so if you want to

1618
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,640
be the

1619
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:12,558
like fight with the best in the world

1620
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:14,798
you're you have to be alone

1621
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,480
it's a lonely journey actually it's kind

1622
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,400
of sad uh

1623
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,679
it's much easier to be in japan where

1624
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,000
everybody's a killer

1625
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:23,039
when you're alone at it it's uh it's a

1626
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,280
difficult journey

1627
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,798
and you know it's it's funny we talked

1628
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,319
about

1629
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:29,838
kind of there's some sports where a

1630
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,960
mistake

1631
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:34,480
is um that's it you know you can't

1632
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,480
recover from a mistake

1633
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,079
i think judo oftentimes is one of those

1634
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,599
sports and

1635
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:45,119
added on top of that is um

1636
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:47,680
the olympics only every four years

1637
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,838
and travis's story he's the reason why

1638
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:52,239
uh when i saw him in 2008 as i

1639
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:53,920
i started martial arts uh i switched

1640
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:56,639
from like wrestling and

1641
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,000
street fighting to doing jiu jitsu and

1642
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,798
judo

1643
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,079
and i just saw so much guts and the in

1644
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:04,400
2000

1645
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,920
i might be messing up the years here but

1646
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,280
in the next olympics

1647
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:12,240
he fought and he lost

1648
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,319
on just the referee call yeah and just

1649
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:17,759
he went to war and he just

1650
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:20,079
so much guts and just everything

1651
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,599
on the line and to lose and then to

1652
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,039
still persevere through all their

1653
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,798
injuries through all that

1654
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,960
through incredibly difficult training

1655
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:27,519
sessions to go another four years and

1656
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,599
then

1657
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:31,599
compete and then win a medal i mean that

1658
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,680
guy is just

1659
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:35,039
and like he clearly could have been very

1660
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:36,798
successful

1661
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:38,159
he's also an incredible jiu jitsu

1662
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:41,358
competitor so he could have

1663
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:46,480
switched to that but he's stuck in

1664
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:48,960
in a lot of sport when you're in elite

1665
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:52,159
like for example in canada i saw he's

1666
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,920
the number one sport in the country

1667
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:56,000
kids when they're in elite when they're

1668
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:59,440
young they get chosen

1669
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,079
and they're kind of uh already um

1670
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,720
known as a superstar you know the the

1671
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,798
school

1672
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:06,159
where they go and on the program they

1673
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:07,679
follow like i'm sure it's the same thing

1674
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:11,759
in us and basketball

1675
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:14,558
baseball perhaps uh american football

1676
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,440
because they already chosen so they grew

1677
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,640
up with that

1678
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:22,079
uh that it that itsy kid that that

1679
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:24,879
uh superstar stardom so to speak and

1680
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,160
it's already gla glass sort of glamorous

1681
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,358
you know

1682
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:32,639
however in in mma there's no

1683
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:34,639
mma judo wrestling like

1684
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:35,679
in america because it's not our national

1685
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:38,318
sport it's it

1686
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:39,279
actually it's it's not like even when i

1687
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:42,400
first started was

1688
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:45,839
not really well received by the media

1689
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,440
there's no glamour into it now i don't

1690
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:51,519
know it seems like it's another

1691
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:53,599
era now and i feel sometimes

1692
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,880
that some people do it for the wrong

1693
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,599
reason

1694
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,920
you know some people do it because of

1695
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:02,400
the glamour because of the money

1696
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,480
but even if you're an elite and very

1697
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,480
good the glamour and the money

1698
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:11,519
won't come in the beginning it's a

1699
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,519
very long grind before

1700
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:16,079
you know it start it start to come in

1701
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:18,559
and you need to make those sacrifices

1702
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,280
and it's a it's a journey that where you

1703
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:23,200
will be

1704
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:26,319
tested you will be hurt repetitively

1705
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:29,759
and you're gonna have to to reach the

1706
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:31,440
down deep and come back up and then once

1707
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,520
you finally think you made it you're

1708
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,960
gonna go back in the down deep again

1709
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:40,318
it's a very exhausting and decorating

1710
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:42,480
um adventure sometimes but if you hold

1711
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:45,039
on to your dream and you believe in it

1712
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,440
you know and you have the the the stars

1713
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:49,199
are aligned you're going to make it

1714
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,039
that's why it's only a few people that

1715
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:53,279
that make it you know

1716
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:54,318
and and that's why i feel i feel

1717
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,839
sometimes

1718
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:58,079
the new a lot of people in the new

1719
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:00,480
generation do it for the wrong reason

1720
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:03,359
in my in my generation because a sport

1721
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,119
at first it was there were no rules

1722
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:06,719
i thought it was more pure the people

1723
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,079
that did it was really

1724
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:10,719
because of the passion that they we

1725
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:14,079
didn't seek money and

1726
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:14,719
fame we did it because we wanted to be i

1727
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,480
did it

1728
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,759
because i wanted to be the man you know

1729
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,358
i i like

1730
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,960
to have the confidence that when i walk

1731
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:21,838
somewhere i'm you know i have the

1732
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,440
confidence that

1733
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:25,920
you know it's an illusion because nobody

1734
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,720
is faster than a bullet yes

1735
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,680
but i wanted to achieve it for myself

1736
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:32,318
and i

1737
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:35,118
which today now because i don't know if

1738
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:38,480
it's social media and all that that

1739
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:40,798
the world has changed the glamour the

1740
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,719
you know it's i feel it's a different

1741
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:44,639
thing right now

1742
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,399
yeah the uh if you get in it for the

1743
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:47,279
glamour or the money you may not have

1744
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,358
the right

1745
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,720
the right amount of fuel to persevere

1746
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:52,639
through all the ups and downs

1747
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:54,558
yeah sure you know when you talk about

1748
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:58,558
motivation

1749
01:00:54,559 --> 01:01:00,720
of uh money and glamour

1750
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,880
the a guy comes to mind and i don't know

1751
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:06,000
how many wrestlers you know but

1752
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:09,599
in russia there's a guy named

1753
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,639
uh bovaci assatea of the satia brothers

1754
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,960
one of the greatest

1755
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:14,798
uh freestyle wrestlers of all time but

1756
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,079
he also has um

1757
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:18,159
it's funny he doesn't have many

1758
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,480
interviews one of my goals is to go out

1759
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:20,078
and

1760
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,519
talk to him in russian do an interview

1761
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:24,400
with him because he's

1762
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:26,318
exceptionally poetic and a deep thinker

1763
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,200
he's a the kind of martial artist that

1764
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:29,199
you are

1765
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:30,399
in the way that it's not just about the

1766
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:31,598
the different battles you've been

1767
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,519
through or whatever

1768
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,440
it's about the philosophy behind the way

1769
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:38,079
he approaches life

1770
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,720
and he he's spoken quite a bit about

1771
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,119
that the

1772
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:41,919
the glamour the fame the money are all

1773
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,280
things that get

1774
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:48,000
in the way of um

1775
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,480
the purity of the experience the art

1776
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,440
that

1777
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:52,960
the way to achieve greatness is to just

1778
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,240
lose yourself in the art

1779
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:59,440
of the actual combat

1780
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:02,399
in this case it's wrestling and then

1781
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,599
kind of not to worry and actively make

1782
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,639
sure that you block out

1783
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,798
anybody who you know

1784
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,558
feeds you the narrative where you're

1785
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:12,719
supposed to be this famous person and

1786
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,240
all those kinds of things that uh he

1787
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:17,519
basically says let others

1788
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:19,118
write your story i make sure that you

1789
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:21,440
just focus on the art

1790
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:22,480
and now another person from that side of

1791
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,679
the world is

1792
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,039
of course khabib so he represents that

1793
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:28,719
side of the world and we were talking

1794
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,960
about walking away

1795
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:32,000
and most people not being able to walk

1796
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,519
away at

1797
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:39,358
the top as you have but also now

1798
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,920
could be has it looks like incredibly so

1799
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:42,318
so

1800
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,119
i mean maybe you can comment about what

1801
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:45,599
your thoughts are

1802
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,480
about uh khabib nurmagomedov being able

1803
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,559
to just

1804
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,159
walk away you know we talk about the

1805
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,798
goat very often

1806
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:53,519
khabib is you know one of isn't the

1807
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:57,358
argument

1808
01:02:53,519 --> 01:03:00,798
because he has the most dominant

1809
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:03,038
carrier of all martial art guy

1810
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:04,639
you know some guys can be named the goat

1811
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:07,680
for different reasons but khabib

1812
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:10,558
for that reason and he's undefeated he'd

1813
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:11,199
i don't even know if he lost he might

1814
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,319
have lost

1815
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:17,838
round but he'd dominate

1816
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:22,159
all his opponent it was ridiculous and

1817
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:24,159
such an incredible career that he had um

1818
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:26,960
i love to watch him fight he's

1819
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:29,199
incredible um

1820
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:32,079
and when you talk about the art when you

1821
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:35,279
say mixed martial art

1822
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:39,039
the idea of a

1823
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,039
flawless performance for me

1824
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,720
everybody often when we say flawless

1825
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:44,960
performance

1826
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:46,798
thinks about a knockout a brutal

1827
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,000
knockout

1828
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:53,599
but for me it's it's to be able

1829
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,760
to showcase beautiful technique

1830
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,640
like a beautiful take down beautiful

1831
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,160
submission be

1832
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:02,400
like something beautiful that

1833
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:04,639
you know when you you look at for

1834
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:08,559
example uh

1835
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:12,318
wayne gretzky or michael jordan or

1836
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:12,640
like stephen curry or even if you don't

1837
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:14,880
know

1838
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:16,480
nothing about basketball and you watch

1839
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,240
michael jordan

1840
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,599
you'll be like wow that's beautiful what

1841
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:21,919
you just did

1842
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,280
like we talked about fighting and and

1843
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,358
trying to say

1844
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,480
the the word beautiful and fighting for

1845
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:28,798
certain people it could

1846
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,199
sound kind of crazy you know but but i'm

1847
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:34,079
talking about the technique

1848
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,118
a beautiful technique you know for me

1849
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,640
that's the goal

1850
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:38,400
you know when i was fighting it's not

1851
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:40,318
only to to have a brutal knockout

1852
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,200
because some people are more gifted than

1853
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:42,719
others and so

1854
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:44,480
i'm saying gifted some people are better

1855
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:46,879
than others in certain

1856
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,400
phases of fighting but for me it was

1857
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,280
that it was to showcase

1858
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,358
to win of course but to showcase some

1859
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,240
beautiful technique that that you can

1860
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:55,838
watch the

1861
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:58,719
watch it and be like wow that was

1862
01:04:55,838 --> 01:05:01,679
incredible the timing he did it that

1863
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:03,279
and when i talk when i think about kabir

1864
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:05,679
norma gomanov

1865
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,519
i see all the detail that that of his

1866
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:08,000
work especially when he got he's got his

1867
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:10,480
opponent

1868
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,239
against defense that's like that's his

1869
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,280
area of expertise where he's

1870
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:16,558
to me he's the best that ever did it in

1871
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,599
in terms of

1872
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:22,319
that fighting style that that particular

1873
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:24,400
expertise that he has it's just the the

1874
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,440
flawless execution of that particular

1875
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,720
set of techniques

1876
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:33,039
yes conor mcgregor had the

1877
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:36,159
the accuracy the spider anderson silver

1878
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:38,079
was like was i would say the most

1879
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:40,000
flamboyant of all you know like he was

1880
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:41,839
moving like the matrix

1881
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,039
john jones was incredible in terms of

1882
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:45,119
creativity

1883
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,799
spinning elbows and that and he faced

1884
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:50,880
incredible

1885
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:52,559
adversity symmetry johnson was

1886
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,798
so complete you could you could bring

1887
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,480
like he was slamming a guy to an armbar

1888
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:59,599
it was just unbelievable like like

1889
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:02,880
he was like the complete fighter

1890
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:04,240
bj penn was like so flexible he he did

1891
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,480
stuff with his body then

1892
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:08,078
like nobody could do his dick the

1893
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,000
dexterity of his hips was just

1894
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,720
unbelievable

1895
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,599
um dominic cruz to me was incredible his

1896
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:17,919
footwork his distance control

1897
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:19,440
so when you talk about like the goat

1898
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,280
royce gracie another one

1899
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,880
he did things that i think for me is not

1900
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,559
number one because yeah i gotta i gotta

1901
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,079
and starting to interrupt the hoist is a

1902
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,440
fascinating one i'd love to hear what

1903
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,559
you think about them but

1904
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,960
many people consider you

1905
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,160
most people consider you to be the

1906
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:38,079
number one

1907
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:40,318
greatest mixed martial arts fighter ever

1908
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,519
so it's fascinating to remove you from

1909
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:44,159
that list

1910
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:45,838
and continue this discussion and asking

1911
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:47,598
like who do you think is the greatest

1912
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:48,400
fighter ever you listed some amazing

1913
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,200
ones

1914
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,358
hois you somehow skipped fedor it's as

1915
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:55,679
i'm very as a russian i'm very offended

1916
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:56,639
no i was going to there's so many

1917
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,279
fedoras one

1918
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:59,679
as well fedor i think in his prime was

1919
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,000
like

1920
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:04,639
when you say when you talk about a name

1921
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,239
for example like

1922
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,400
we talked about him when he was in his

1923
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:09,759
prime like when i talked for example

1924
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,720
about anderson silva i'm not talking

1925
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,760
about the andersons

1926
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:15,679
who fought his last fight uh against

1927
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,799
urayo hall i'm talking about anderson

1928
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:21,118
servo who knocked out

1929
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:24,079
victor belfor yes bg pen same thing

1930
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,519
the problem is when fighters hang on for

1931
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,920
too long in the sport that's what

1932
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:29,199
happened

1933
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:32,318
they kind of make make

1934
01:07:29,199 --> 01:07:34,000
people forget how good they were and

1935
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:34,639
it's very sad we talk about fedor and

1936
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,760
just

1937
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:39,920
just think about uh stephen yochich

1938
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,319
me which is probably the greatest

1939
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:44,720
heavyweight of all time with fedor

1940
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:45,358
i would really wonder who would have won

1941
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:48,639
this fight

1942
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:50,558
the both guys in their prime i tend to

1943
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:51,920
lean towards fedor because my heart was

1944
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,760
with fever the fedor but he could have

1945
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,720
gone the other way but just because meow

1946
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:56,559
chich

1947
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:58,719
lose his last fight now everybody's like

1948
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:01,760
oh yeah they forgot about him

1949
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:02,798
it's crazy man it's one fight you zig

1950
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,920
when you shoot zag

1951
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:07,358
boom it's that's the reality of mixed

1952
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,639
martial art well that's why

1953
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:13,199
the thing is the mixed martial arts

1954
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:14,798
isn't just the performance the strictly

1955
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:16,479
who won and who lost it's also the

1956
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:19,039
stories we tell ourselves

1957
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:20,079
and so i mean there's beautiful stories

1958
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:22,719
being weaved

1959
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:24,318
and that also is part of uh who is the

1960
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:27,439
greatest of all time

1961
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,759
is what what were the battles what what

1962
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:31,678
what

1963
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:34,960
had to be overcome what was the

1964
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:37,920
the flavor of the flawless performances

1965
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,798
you know all of that plays into it and

1966
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,640
you're right

1967
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:42,238
being able to walk away at the top is

1968
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:46,079
also part of that

1969
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:49,919
a lot of people ask me about khabib and

1970
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:52,318
that fight i want it to happen

1971
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,520
khabib wanted to happen but ufc did not

1972
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,080
want to happen

1973
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,279
between you and khabib yes and we tried

1974
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:58,880
to make it like about

1975
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:00,880
three three years ago when i when i

1976
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,600
retired two you know three no it was

1977
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,560
after

1978
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,759
two years ago and it didn't never came

1979
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,759
to fruition

1980
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,359
the ufc were clear they said they would

1981
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:11,679
they have their plan for khabib

1982
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,960
and it makes sense to for the business

1983
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:15,440
standpoint because they want to keep the

1984
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,359
ball rolling

1985
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:20,238
now can be retired and like everybody

1986
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:22,239
else after just justin gaitrey i was

1987
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:24,158
doing the comment theater in french

1988
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:26,718
for the ufc and now i have butterfly i

1989
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:28,318
thought he was going to call me out

1990
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:30,399
if there's one guy that i would have

1991
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,880
said yes it would be him because for a

1992
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,759
fighter

1993
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,079
the most exciting thing things to do

1994
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:38,319
it's

1995
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:40,399
often the scariest one and khabib was

1996
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,520
you know where is the scariest matchup

1997
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:44,639
yes

1998
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:47,440
but it was worth the risk because nobody

1999
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,039
have ever been able to solve them

2000
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:50,639
how would you solve the khabib

2001
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:53,359
nurmagomedov puzzle

2002
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:55,679
well khabib is very good against the

2003
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,679
fans

2004
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:00,718
i would have to establish a game plan

2005
01:09:58,238 --> 01:10:03,439
and everything but i think

2006
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:05,439
what i would needed to do is take the

2007
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:08,319
center of the octagon right away

2008
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:09,359
use a lot of fake and fate keep the

2009
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:11,439
fight

2010
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:13,439
all the way all the way out or all the

2011
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:15,439
wind and when i sell the win is when you

2012
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:16,079
close the gap use my proactive and

2013
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:18,079
reactive

2014
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:20,238
take down and my perhaps my superior

2015
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:23,119
explosivity to put them down

2016
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:24,718
i like to use those proactive and cr and

2017
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:27,198
reactive technology because for me i

2018
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:29,520
feel it's more economical

2019
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:31,359
khabib is a much better chain wrestler

2020
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,920
than me chain wear stories when you got

2021
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:36,799
the guys to defense it's pure resting

2022
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,840
what makes my takedown very efficient

2023
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,560
it's my karate

2024
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,319
it's not my wrestling it's i'm a i'm

2025
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:45,520
very good at timing

2026
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:48,238
my opponent and getting in

2027
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,280
with with my explosivity so if you watch

2028
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:51,678
at my takedown

2029
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:53,439
it does not demand often it does not

2030
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:57,199
demand a lot of work when i use the

2031
01:10:53,439 --> 01:11:00,238
i call it proactive takedown when um

2032
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:02,399
he's coming to punch me and i react so

2033
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:03,759
i mean proactive is when when i i'm

2034
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:06,559
faking it so

2035
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,119
i i i i instigate the attack down by a

2036
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,280
fake

2037
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:10,399
then i take take him down and reactive

2038
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:12,158
is when he's

2039
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:13,599
i'm baiting him to throw something and

2040
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:15,759
then he then have a counter

2041
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,120
yeah yeah yes but all might take down in

2042
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,280
the center of the octagon

2043
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:21,119
yes my takedowns are more in the center

2044
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:23,359
of the octagon like for example another

2045
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:24,960
guy that does it well is gleeson tebow

2046
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:28,238
that did it well in his best

2047
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,760
days you know khabib has more a style of

2048
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:30,399
chain wrestling i would say like kamaru

2049
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,400
uzman

2050
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:34,000
or sort of speak kind of kind of guy

2051
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:36,399
it's a different style you cannot

2052
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,319
compare both town

2053
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:40,399
and that's the kind of takedown i'm good

2054
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:41,840
and i would if i would have fight kevin

2055
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:43,839
that's one of the strategies i would

2056
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,440
have had i would not have been afraid

2057
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,800
because everybody that i thought i was

2058
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:50,000
able to put them down

2059
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,800
and and and i have the pedigree to to

2060
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,920
prove it in my

2061
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,279
fight resume so you would have perhaps

2062
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,279
see him on his back and i would have

2063
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:58,880
perhaps be on my back as well so it

2064
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:59,359
would have been a very interesting fight

2065
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,279
and

2066
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:03,519
how hard do you think he is to take down

2067
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:05,439
i mean a lot of people speak about his

2068
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,320
wrestling being just it has nothing to

2069
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:08,000
do with it like

2070
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:09,599
the wrestling because let's do the

2071
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,760
correct if i get that timing

2072
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,120
and i got my boat hand around around his

2073
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,440
knees he's going down

2074
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:16,559
everybody goes down yeah yes yes this

2075
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:18,719
goes down and and

2076
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,320
and i had a lot of uh that's what i

2077
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,239
would have done i would not have been

2078
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,960
afraid of his wrestling

2079
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:26,879
uh i would have be the instigator i

2080
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,800
would have forced the fight

2081
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,239
forward and that's what that's how i

2082
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,199
would have approached that

2083
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:34,959
fight which i believe most of his

2084
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:36,319
opponent

2085
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,079
were afraid of his wrestling because

2086
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:39,920
they didn't have the tools that i have

2087
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:41,760
to put him down

2088
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,600
i would not have forced the wrestling i

2089
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,600
would have in in the clinch i would have

2090
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:47,600
tried to disengage i have many ways to

2091
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,440
disengage the clinch

2092
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,719
i would have wanted to force the fight

2093
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:53,198
in in that in a

2094
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:55,520
in a fighting distance you know like in

2095
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:59,279
in a shoot box distance not in that in a

2096
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:02,560
wrestling distance is it possible

2097
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:06,479
this fight still happens i

2098
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:10,080
you're young look great in a suit

2099
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:13,039
well there's a lot of problems now

2100
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:14,559
and the thing is now i made peace with

2101
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:16,880
it

2102
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,480
i no longer don't wanna fight and i

2103
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,560
don't it's not gonna happen ufc

2104
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:22,559

01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,560
contract with the ufc

2106
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,320

2107
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:29,360
people says to me oh how about if

2108
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:31,840

01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:36,799
i said i have the i'm gonna be uh in

2112
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:40,158

and and also i'm older now and when i go

2114
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:44,158
home man i'm like

2115
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:46,158
i don't want to do this you know like

2116
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:47,039
and we're always like this i don't want

2117
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:48,319
to do this but

2118
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:50,238
like for example i was training with

2119
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:51,039
freddie roach a few days ago and i'm

2120
01:13:50,238 --> 01:13:54,238
hitting pads

2121
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:55,198
you know and freddie is looking at me

2122
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:57,439
and he's like hey

2123
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,678
you have the hitch back i'm like yeah if

2124
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:00,079
dana white would walk in the room in the

2125
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:02,319
in the

2126
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:03,679
gym at that precise moment with a with a

2127
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:06,079
ufc contract

2128
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,880
i would sign it sign it in a blink of an

2129
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:09,840
eye

2130
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,239
but then after i go home i'm like hell

2131
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,079
no

2132
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:17,119
no my belly is full my you know i'm

2133
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:18,880
healthy i'm wealthy why would i want to

2134
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,719
fight for i made peace with it

2135
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,560
but the minute i go back in the gym

2136
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,079
because i still get it inside me when i

2137
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,400
train with the young guys

2138
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:27,198
i still get it and a lot of guys think

2139
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,879
hey

2140
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:30,238
tell me the truth you're preparing a

2141
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,039
comeback because i still get it you know

2142
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:33,198
i'm a little bit

2143
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:35,439
older but i i get more knowledge i can

2144
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:38,559
compensate

2145
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:41,119
i i i become a different animal because

2146
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,400
you know it changed you but then after

2147
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:44,880
you go home and you

2148
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:46,879
you you're like man uh no way i'm doing

2149
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,880
this

2150
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,960
yeah it's very hard to explain you need

2151
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:53,199
to be acquired one to understand that

2152
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,279
it's very very hard to explain

2153
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:56,319
well from your perspective i think

2154
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:58,399
khabib

2155
01:14:56,319 --> 01:15:00,799
is one of the rare one of the few

2156
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:01,439
fascinating scientific puzzles yet to be

2157
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,239
solved

2158
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:06,079
so from that aspect as a martial artist

2159
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:07,359
it's just a fascinating journey to try

2160
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:09,439
to solve that puzzle

2161
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:12,000
there is a thing too like say oh who's

2162
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:14,079
the best fighter people

2163
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,679
lex they don't like i underst i i

2164
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:17,760
realize that

2165
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:19,520
later in my life and i'm sure a lot of

2166
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:22,400
young guys will say oh i said

2167
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:24,560
it's not don't speak for me but i'm

2168
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:27,119
telling you right now what i'm about to

2169
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,440
say you will realize it later

2170
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:31,359
when i was young i think you can

2171
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,439
proclaim yourself the

2172
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:35,920
more the badass man on the planet you

2173
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:38,079
know like nobody can beat you at

2174
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:40,079
it's an illusion man that's the sad

2175
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:42,719
thing about for example dc

2176
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:43,600
uh daniel cormier does probably one of

2177
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,560
the greatest

2178
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,640
if not the greatest of all time you said

2179
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,159
miyotis but like

2180
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,679
it's almost because of that little

2181
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:54,158
matchup with jon jones

2182
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:55,840
it's it's difficult for people to

2183
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:56,238
conceive of him as the greatest of all

2184
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,319
time

2185
01:15:56,238 --> 01:15:59,439
it's all about match-up it's all about

2186
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:02,238
timing and

2187
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:04,719
also you make a fight you may you make

2188
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:08,479
both guys fight ten times

2189
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:11,679
the result might be different like

2190
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,639
like every time you know i mean maybe

2191
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:15,279
he's gonna win

2192
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,679
eight out of ten but that knight is

2193
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,679
gonna

2194
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,760
he's gonna lose why because we don't

2195
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:21,279
know the the universe made it like that

2196
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,600
you know maybe he got sick maybe he had

2197
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:23,840
the

2198
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,360
emotional issues he didn't sleep well

2199
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,159
and he makes him

2200
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,359
uh lose focus and he got caught you

2201
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:31,679
don't we don't know

2202
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:32,559
but it's it's that's the thing with

2203
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,319
people ask me would you

2204
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,480
have done it with khabib what would

2205
01:16:34,319 --> 01:16:37,599
happen i don't know maybe out of 10 time

2206
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,079
i don't know maybe

2207
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,960
as a fighter i hope i would have win

2208
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:43,279
more than him

2209
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,640
he thinks the opposite is only one way

2210
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:47,519
to find out but

2211
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,800
that night if there's a fight the guy

2212
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,239
gonna win doesn't mean he's the best

2213
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,719
fighter that's mean

2214
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:54,639
the the he's the one that fought the

2215
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:57,679
best the night of the fight same thing

2216
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,480
in basketball or aki the team that wins

2217
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,319
the game

2218
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:02,079
it's not necessarily the best team is

2219
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:04,639
the team that

2220
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:06,399
play the best the the night of the game

2221
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:09,039
and fighting is no different

2222
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:11,839
so being the baddest man on the planet

2223
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:13,600
it's an illusion

2224
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,760
i mean that's the tragic thing about it

2225
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,600
is uh on any one night

2226
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:19,440
anything can happen and then that tells

2227
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,560
a story for all of human history

2228
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:24,000
it is it's uh it's that

2229
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,159
it's sad to think about but that's what

2230
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,479
makes it beautiful that

2231
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:29,198
there's so much at stake like entire

2232
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:31,039
lives

2233
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:33,279
all the dreams you've had growing up all

2234
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:34,319
the hard work all of it is decided in a

2235
01:17:33,279 --> 01:17:36,000
single night

2236
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:37,519
even though that means nothing in terms

2237
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,640
of who's actually better

2238
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,400
it's uh i mean that's the beauty that's

2239
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,480
why people love the olympics especially

2240
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:48,079
because it happens so rarely

2241
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:51,119
and dreams are broken or uh

2242
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:52,000
like triumph is achieved by the unlikely

2243
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:55,279
hero

2244
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,600
all like right there i mean that's

2245
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:58,559
that's why we love it right that's why

2246
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,800
that's why i love it

2247
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,400
if we would know always the result

2248
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,840
before it would be boring that's why we

2249
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:06,079
do it you know

2250
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,880
uh you watch the odds you know like like

2251
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:09,279
sometimes

2252
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,600
i like to watch the odds uh before a

2253
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:15,039
fight you know

2254
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:16,960
because you know there's things you know

2255
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,319
i believe in causality you know i

2256
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,239
believe in

2257
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:21,599
everybody believe different things but i

2258
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:24,079
believe everything is

2259
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,880
because there's a there's a cause to

2260
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:26,640
everything that's

2261
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,079
personally what i believe i don't

2262
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,239
believe that

2263
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:32,479
i i have like free will i think i have

2264
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:34,479
the illusion of free will but i believe

2265
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:35,919
there's a cause for everything and if

2266
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:37,759
i'm doing something

2267
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,600
because of something because of a cause

2268
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,159
by definition there's no free will in a

2269
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,440
way you know

2270
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:44,960
if there's a cause by definition there's

2271
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:47,678
not how does that make you feel by the

2272
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:50,239
way like the idea that if we just look

2273
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:51,840
uh outside of even just human psychology

2274
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:53,279
and fighting and so on if we look at

2275
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,079
like physics if everything is

2276
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:55,679
predetermined

2277
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:58,880
if all of these little molecules

2278
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:01,359
interacting it's already like your story

2279
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,119
is already written i mean it depends

2280
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:05,039
it's it's written but

2281
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:06,399
i would need to know all the data and

2282
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:10,158
it's impossible right

2283
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:11,759
like it's it's i it's kind of weird i

2284
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:15,279
gotta say but i don't

2285
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:18,640
to me i don't see any argument

2286
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:21,198
to counter that idea i i i i can

2287
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,000
i don't maybe i'm i'm ignorant but i

2288
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:24,000
haven't seen

2289
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,039
nobody and everything from that i've

2290
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,119
read so far

2291
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:28,640
there's nothing that countered that idea

2292
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:31,279
that that

2293
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,679
because in a mechanical world if your

2294
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:34,238
car

2295
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:36,000
broke or you know we don't say oh the

2296
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:39,279
car decided to broke

2297
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,800
or a three a tree is fall

2298
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:42,479
there's reason why the tree is falling

2299
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,199
we don't say the trees decide to fall

2300
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:45,439
right

2301
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:46,479
so what because us human being i think

2302
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:49,039
it's our ego

2303
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:51,198
we decide and i'm no different than

2304
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:55,279
anybody when i make a decision i

2305
01:19:51,198 --> 01:20:00,238
decided to do this i choose to do this

2306
01:19:55,279 --> 01:20:03,279
but i'm aware that there is causes

2307
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:04,000
that make me do certain things and by

2308
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:07,439
definition

2309
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,639
i think if there is a cause there is no

2310
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:11,359
free will by definition

2311
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:11,760
right yes but the thing is just like you

2312
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,238
said

2313
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,920
we understand so little about human

2314
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:16,638
intelligence the human mind and

2315
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,760
especially

2316
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:23,359
consciousness that

2317
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:25,600
the this giant

2318
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:26,799
mystery this darkness that we don't

2319
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,520
understand how

2320
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,600
how it how it feels like to be something

2321
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:34,320
to be a conscious being

2322
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,440
that because of that we're not able to

2323
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:38,559
really even

2324
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:41,519
reason about free will or not because

2325
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,920
there might be some magic that comes

2326
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,880
from

2327
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,000
consciousness the you know the the

2328
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,159
consciousness might be

2329
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,679
the thing that makes us different from a

2330
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:53,359
car that breaks down

2331
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:57,119
there might be something totally

2332
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:57,679
fascinating totally undiscovered yet

2333
01:20:57,119 --> 01:20:59,519
that will

2334
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:01,600
make us realize that free will is

2335
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:03,040
actually real and somehow fundamental to

2336
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,560
the human experience

2337
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:10,158
so it's sometimes i think

2338
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:13,120
we forget when we talk about free will

2339
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:14,399
and physics and it all seeming to be

2340
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:16,079
predetermined

2341
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:18,158
we forget how little we actually

2342
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:20,960
understand about the world

2343
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:21,759
and i think in that mystery that could

2344
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,520
be

2345
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,239
totally new ideas that are yet to be

2346
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:29,120
discovered and will make us realize that

2347
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:30,799
it's not just an illusion it is

2348
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:33,439
something that is like

2349
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,920
at the core of how the universe works

2350
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:39,039
some people believe that consciousness

2351
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,158
is a fundamental property of the

2352
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:42,319
universe like it's a

2353
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:43,920
it's a one of the forces of physics like

2354
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:46,719
consciousness permeates

2355
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:49,039
everything it's in everything like this

2356
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:51,359
table is conscious but it's not

2357
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:52,800
as conscious as us and we're this little

2358
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:54,639
peak of consciousness

2359
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,079
and if that's true and if we get to

2360
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:59,039
understand that

2361
01:21:56,079 --> 01:22:01,519
maybe there's something there's an extra

2362
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:04,079
bonus we get in terms of free will

2363
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:05,679
once you become one of those entities

2364
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:09,119
that are super conscious

2365
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:10,639
so i i tend to be sort of humbled by the

2366
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:14,238
mystery of it

2367
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:17,199
do you believe one day with

2368
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:18,238
with the technology that keep improving

2369
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:23,279
we will

2370
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:26,718
make a robot that will be able to

2371
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:29,119
be somehow conscious absolutely

2372
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:31,439
i that's been my dream that's been i

2373
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:33,840
hope i hope to do just that

2374
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:34,638
first of all i believe that all people

2375
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,480
are capable

2376
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:42,159
and want to be good to each other and

2377
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:44,559
i think love is uh is a really powerful

2378
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:46,158
thing that connects us and can create

2379
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:49,920
better and better worlds

2380
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:52,719
sort of like uh create better and better

2381
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,960
societies that improve both the

2382
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:57,119
technology the quality of life and just

2383
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,079
the basics of human experience and i

2384
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:00,158
think

2385
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:01,760
creating ai systems that are conscious

2386
01:23:00,158 --> 01:23:05,119
that are human-like

2387
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:08,320
can enable us to be better to each other

2388
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:10,639
like they can it's almost like adding

2389
01:23:08,319 --> 01:23:12,319
more and more

2390
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:14,319
kindness to the world through the

2391
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:16,399
systems we interact with will inspire us

2392
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:19,198
to be better and better to each other

2393
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:20,238
in terms of them being conscious i think

2394
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:23,759
that is a

2395
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:25,359
an absolute requirement that entities we

2396
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,079
interact with

2397
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:28,960
communicate some element of

2398
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:30,880
consciousness

2399
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,079
to us like that's how we connect to each

2400
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,800
other the reason we

2401
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:35,519
you and i connect is that we believe

2402
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:38,320
that

2403
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,440
each of us are conscious and to me what

2404
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:42,479
consciousness means

2405
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:43,519
is the ability to hurt ability to to

2406
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:46,559
suffer

2407
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:49,440
to uh to struggle in this world because

2408
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,679
just like you said uh

2409
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:52,559
with with without the struggle you don't

2410
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:54,880
have the love

2411
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,320
you don't have the pleasure and

2412
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,440
ultimately consciousness

2413
01:23:56,319 --> 01:24:02,960
is an entity's ability to struggle

2414
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:03,678
to suffer and from that arises the

2415
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:08,239
pleasure

2416
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:11,359
and us together being able to

2417
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:11,359
appreciate sort of uh

2418
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,279
appreciate the highs and

2419
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:19,359
experience together at the lows that's

2420
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:20,960
how we form the deep connections

2421
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:23,198
i personally think we can create that in

2422
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:26,158
robots and i i personally believe it's

2423
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:26,559
a lot easier than uh than we think does

2424
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:30,238
it

2425
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:33,039
make you afraid sometimes about

2426
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:33,839
the fact that one day hey hi like

2427
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:36,960
intelligence

2428
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:39,039
artificial intelligence could be

2429
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,079
you know could hurt us or or you know

2430
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:41,840
like because we're

2431
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:43,600
you know because of hollywood of course

2432
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,000
you know the movies we watch but but it

2433
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,400
seems

2434
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,158
like when i hear sometimes elon musk

2435
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:51,519
talking you know like

2436
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:53,279
yeah so elon talks about with ai we're

2437
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:56,000
summoning the demon

2438
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:56,960
he is very concerned and i talked to him

2439
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,719
about it

2440
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,560
quite a bit he's very concerned about

2441
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:04,480
all the different ways ai could

2442
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:07,039
hurt us humans i tend to believe that

2443
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:08,479
there's a lot more ways in which ai can

2444
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:11,198
make our lives better

2445
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:11,599
and can make life awesome for humans i

2446
01:25:11,198 --> 01:25:14,638
think

2447
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:17,920
humans are the ones that can do a lot of

2448
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:20,480
evil things so i'm less worried about

2449
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:23,119
i am more worried about humans if i look

2450
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:25,279
at what you men have done on

2451
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:28,079
on the course of history you know for

2452
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:30,479
for example

2453
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:32,319
in regards to the planet to the the

2454
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:34,879
scale of the universe

2455
01:25:32,319 --> 01:25:35,920
i think what i'm afraid is that we have

2456
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:39,359
more

2457
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:42,239
of a destructive force than a

2458
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:44,079
beneficial force so if a height take

2459
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:48,479
that and cause the duration

2460
01:25:44,079 --> 01:25:50,719
in order to protect us against ourselves

2461
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:52,799
it could hurt us in a way i don't know

2462
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:54,800
if you if you understand what like

2463
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,880
what do you think about that does it

2464
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,639
makes you afraid sometimes

2465
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,719
not because of a hype but because of

2466
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:04,079
what humans are doing

2467
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:07,679
that heihei could do to us to prevent us

2468
01:26:04,079 --> 01:26:09,439
of hurting ourselves you know yeah no

2469
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:11,199
i mean definitely it can bring out the

2470
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:14,960
the worst in human nature

2471
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:17,678
and uh provide tools

2472
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,960
for evil people to do evil things at a

2473
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:22,158
larger scale

2474
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:24,800
but i just think it depends

2475
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:25,920
what you think human beings are i tend

2476
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:30,159
to believe

2477
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:33,359
that as we get more intelligent we

2478
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:35,039
we start to see the value the

2479
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:36,639
evolutionary value

2480
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:38,960
and the value in terms of happiness of

2481
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:41,039
being good to each other and i think ai

2482
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,119
if if you look at ai as an optimization

2483
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:44,000
problem of how to create a civilization

2484
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:46,158
that works well

2485
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,600
and expands throughout the universe i

2486
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:50,559
think love

2487
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,600
is much uh more effective so ai will

2488
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,400
help us

2489
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,960
maximize that i think there's going to

2490
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:56,960
be

2491
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,239
always spikes throughout as it has been

2492
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:01,679
through human history

2493
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:03,919
where charismatic leaders will do evil

2494
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:05,920
onto the world in the name of good you

2495
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,279
have the stalin and the hitlers and all

2496
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,399
of that

2497
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:13,920
but ultimately

2498
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:17,119
over time i think technology will give

2499
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:20,719
the good uh the good people

2500
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:23,359
power and the evil people

2501
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:24,079
less power now there's a lot of ways in

2502
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:26,719
that

2503
01:27:24,079 --> 01:27:28,319
in uh that that won't be the case

2504
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:31,039
there's a lot of ways for it to go wrong

2505
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:33,840
and elon talks about them but

2506
01:27:31,039 --> 01:27:35,119
i i honestly think in terms of

2507
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,719
intelligent ai

2508
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:39,439
that's going to bring more love to the

2509
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:42,480
world the thing i'm concerned about is

2510
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:43,119
dumb ai so there's been a lot of

2511
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:44,559
discussion

2512
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:47,198
between china and the united states

2513
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:49,280
recently on autonomous weapons system

2514
01:27:47,198 --> 01:27:50,559
this is something people don't they're

2515
01:27:49,279 --> 01:27:54,559
afraid to talk about

2516
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:57,120
but there's now a race

2517
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,400
uh where the united states has

2518
01:27:57,119 --> 01:28:01,679
officially said

2519
01:27:58,399 --> 01:28:05,039
that they're not against adding ai to

2520
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:06,239
its weapon systems so now the us

2521
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:10,000
military

2522
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:13,599
is adding automation adding intelligence

2523
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:16,399
to its drones to its uh

2524
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,039
anything that can create damage and so

2525
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:19,519
of course

2526
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:21,039
and they did this so in response to

2527
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,120
china doing that

2528
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:24,399
so you can imagine this is this is

2529
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:26,479
terminator

2530
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:28,079
you think about terminators intel

2531
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:31,439
intelligent systems they're not

2532
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:34,079
they're pretty dumb the the point is

2533
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:34,719
they're efficient at doing what they do

2534
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:37,119
and

2535
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:38,319
in the space of war efficient at doing

2536
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:41,679
what you do means

2537
01:28:38,319 --> 01:28:42,880
killing so that i'm really afraid of but

2538
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:46,399
those are dumb ai

2539
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:49,119
those aren't your uh loving

2540
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:50,479
deep fulfilling relationships that's

2541
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:53,679
like

2542
01:28:50,479 --> 01:28:55,678
uh efficiently being able to fly to plan

2543
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:58,960
the trajectory of dropping bombs

2544
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:01,119
of missiles of how to do counter-attacks

2545
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,639
of how to maximize the destruction of a

2546
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:03,840
particular facility instead of

2547
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:07,119
individuals

2548
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:09,360
and then that can just escalate

2549
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:10,559
and as opposed to the cold war with the

2550
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:14,319
with the soviet union

2551
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:17,520
this could be a hot war and then

2552
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:19,439
the consequences once you allow

2553
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,280
it's kind of terrifying because

2554
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:21,919
currently the drones are operated by

2555
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:25,519
humans

2556
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:29,199
so you know you have say you have

2557
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,560
information about uh intelligence gives

2558
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:32,960
you information about a particular

2559
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:36,000
terrorist located at this area

2560
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:38,880
and then you use drones to

2561
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,198
maybe uh the automation there is to help

2562
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,440
you

2563
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:42,399
figure out what is the best trajectory

2564
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:45,439
to

2565
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:46,879
strike at that location so

2566
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:48,479
you still have a human that pulls the

2567
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:52,000
trigger at the end

2568
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:54,799
dropping the bomb now automation and ai

2569
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,319
in autonomous weapons systems might be

2570
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,279
where you say

2571
01:29:56,319 --> 01:29:59,840
there's a bad guy over here you figure

2572
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:02,479
out

2573
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,960
how to get rid of the bad guy okay so

2574
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:04,718
then

2575
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,719
of course the systems will be very good

2576
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:07,600
at finding the right trajectory and so

2577
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:11,119
on

2578
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:13,440
but there's bugs that can happen

2579
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:15,439
unexpected bugs that the system might

2580
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:17,359
figure out that there is

2581
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:18,479
this bad guy might actually be in these

2582
01:30:17,359 --> 01:30:21,359
other

2583
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:24,559
five locations so mike's might make

2584
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:27,198
sense to cover the entire area right

2585
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,480
and you see you might just drop bombs on

2586
01:30:27,198 --> 01:30:31,198
the entire area

2587
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:32,319
and then you know that's just okay so

2588
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:34,000
that's going to lead to a lot of

2589
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:36,000
destruction of the scale of a city

2590
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,439
but then you can immediately take that

2591
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,399
to nuclear weapons

2592
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:42,960
if you add automation to uh responding

2593
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:44,719
to counterattacks to nuclear weapons

2594
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:46,239
somebody you might get information that

2595
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:47,359
somebody's planning a nuclear attack on

2596
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:49,119
the united states

2597
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:50,960
and the ai system will immediately

2598
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:52,880
respond and

2599
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,639
you know it can respond at a scale of

2600
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,000
launching nuclear weapons itself

2601
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,079
and so there's all of these

2602
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,198
possibilities that don't require much

2603
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:02,479
intelligence

2604
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:03,919
and that's exceptionally that's

2605
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:07,359
exceptionally concerning

2606
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:11,039
i i'm like you i do not believe there is

2607
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:13,599
babies that are born bad i think people

2608
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:15,279
do bad things because of their

2609
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:18,800
experience

2610
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:21,279
however if i look

2611
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,800
to my experience and from what i can see

2612
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:28,399
some very often

2613
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:28,400
men's of power wants more power

2614
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:32,638
that's what makes me afraid with yeah no

2615
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,199
absolutely

2616
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:36,800
i listen i've been uh i've come from the

2617
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:38,879
soviet union

2618
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,719
uh stalin is arguably one of the most

2619
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,960
powerful humans in history

2620
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:44,800
uh he's not talked often enough about by

2621
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:45,439
the evils he's done hitler gets all the

2622
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,760
attention

2623
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:50,000
yeah but stalin has done arguably much

2624
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,079
more evil than uh than hitler

2625
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,760
yeah well this is this is human nature

2626
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:55,279
it wants power

2627
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:57,280
we see that with institutions we see

2628
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:59,920
that with governments and nations

2629
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:00,960
i think you see you see this with the

2630
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:03,920
internet

2631
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:05,760
people are really hungry for the

2632
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:08,319
distribution of power

2633
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:10,560
like you see that people are very much

2634
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:12,000
distrustful of centralized places of

2635
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:15,199
power of institutions and so

2636
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,880
on so i think successful organizations

2637
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:19,919
successful companies

2638
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:22,000
successful governments will be run by

2639
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,920
people who distribute the power

2640
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,359
like i don't trust myself with power at

2641
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:28,480
all yeah and i think

2642
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:31,679
you have to build into the system

2643
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:32,718
that no one person can have power and

2644
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,639
that you distribute it

2645
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:36,399
that's where you have in the financial

2646
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:37,679
sector you have cryptocurrency right now

2647
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:38,238
with bitcoin and all those kinds of

2648
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,199
things

2649
01:32:38,238 --> 01:32:42,879
people are exploring how can we avoid

2650
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:45,119
the central bank

2651
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,239
to have the control how do you put the

2652
01:32:45,119 --> 01:32:48,158
power in the hands of

2653
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:50,479
people uh thousands of people millions

2654
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:55,359
of people and in the same way with

2655
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:58,718
uh with military with um any kind of

2656
01:32:55,359 --> 01:33:00,319
uh with technology i think the future

2657
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:02,800
looks very distributed

2658
01:33:00,319 --> 01:33:03,769
so what do you think about militarizing

2659
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,600
space

2660
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:08,960
[Laughter]

2661
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:10,320
the uh space force i i i don't think

2662
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:12,399
about it often because

2663
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:14,719
right now i'm filled with excitement

2664
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:17,679
about space exploration which is the

2665
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:20,719
positive aspect so elon

2666
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:22,319
you know i was born in an

2667
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:24,480
era where it was exciting i don't know

2668
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:27,439
about you but for me it's exciting to

2669
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:30,399
look up to the stars and

2670
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:32,638
dream about us humans ex you know uh

2671
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:34,479
colonizing mars colonizing other planets

2672
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:35,199
expanding onto the galaxy into the

2673
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:38,879
universe

2674
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:42,638
that's really exciting uh so

2675
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:43,279
i'm the the possibilities there are

2676
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:45,520
endless

2677
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:47,359
i don't think because the also the

2678
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:50,000
resources are endless

2679
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:51,359
and so i think we get into trouble with

2680
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,439
militarization with

2681
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:54,880
wars when the resources are very

2682
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:58,000
constrained

2683
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:59,440
so i think for a while we're not going

2684
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,600
to be fighting

2685
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:05,119
the the only wars we'll be fighting in

2686
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:07,600
space are the ones that kind of um

2687
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:09,439
another nation to compete yeah who goes

2688
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,960
to the moon first i guess that's those

2689
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:12,960
those are kind of those kinds of things

2690
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,719
or maybe for satellites and all those

2691
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:17,198
kinds of communication and

2692
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:19,198
uh maybe in assistance for like cyber

2693
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:20,399
warfare which is also very dangerous but

2694
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:24,399
in terms of

2695
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:27,599
space wars out in space i think

2696
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:30,479
i think everything out in space will be

2697
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,199
positive and inspiring it's very hard

2698
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:33,678
but

2699
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:34,238
all good things are hard i think this is

2700
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:35,520
where i've been

2701
01:34:34,238 --> 01:34:38,799
i've been talking to a bunch of people

2702
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:42,320
about um extraterrestrial life

2703
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,320
i'm really excited by

2704
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,800
i don't know it's the other thing um

2705
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:48,639
when i look out to the stars

2706
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:51,360
it's exciting to me i know i think

2707
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:53,199
you've spoken about it being scary

2708
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:55,359
but to me it's exciting that there's

2709
01:34:53,198 --> 01:34:57,198
intelligent creatures out there

2710
01:34:55,359 --> 01:34:58,559
far beyond perhaps the intelligence of

2711
01:34:57,198 --> 01:35:01,039
our own

2712
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,239
that uh are just too far away to explore

2713
01:35:01,039 --> 01:35:05,519
yet but we might

2714
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:06,959
one day come in contact with them so uh

2715
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,880
that that to me is the ultimate

2716
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:11,600
motivator is to meet

2717
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,880
other intelligence life forms out there

2718
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:16,000
and connect with them

2719
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:17,760
have you ever meet jacques valley

2720
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,840
no but i've been in communication i want

2721
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,639
to i hope to talk to him he's amazing

2722
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,840
french yeah

2723
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:25,039
i am i know that there are many theories

2724
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:26,880
about yes

2725
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:28,079
you know if there is alien we don't know

2726
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,639
right but but

2727
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:31,679
some people think it's from another star

2728
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:34,159
systems

2729
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:35,840
and jacques valley is a like to make a

2730
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:37,198
long story short he has a different

2731
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:41,199
theory thinks it's

2732
01:35:37,198 --> 01:35:41,198
perhaps beans that

2733
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:46,080
could be living in a different dimension

2734
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:46,879
than us and the reason why he says that

2735
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:48,960
is

2736
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:50,400
when he makes an experiment when there

2737
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:54,239
is a signings very often

2738
01:35:50,399 --> 01:35:57,519
of a ufo let's say i'm i'm the ufo

2739
01:35:54,238 --> 01:36:00,479
that you have three guys and one

2740
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:01,520
they they are looking at the ufo very

2741
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:04,238
often

2742
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,719
one experiment that you can do and

2743
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:07,198
sometimes

2744
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:08,960
that that is the case you asked your two

2745
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:11,198
friend to walk on the side and there's a

2746
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,800
at a point that it's like a corridor you

2747
01:36:11,198 --> 01:36:15,279
see the ufo and then

2748
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,159
you stop seeing like a corridor and

2749
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:18,880
that's one of the

2750
01:36:16,158 --> 01:36:19,759
reason why he's saying that it's perhaps

2751
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,039
a dimension

2752
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:24,960
and i found that fascinating you know i

2753
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:26,560
this is what you know to the discussion

2754
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,319
of consciousness and all that

2755
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:30,400
it it feels like we might be just

2756
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:31,679
experiencing a very particular slice of

2757
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:33,519
this universe

2758
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:35,760
we might not be understanding what's at

2759
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,199
the higher dimensions or

2760
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,800
yeah i mean higher dimensions in

2761
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:41,359
whatever form that means you know

2762
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:44,000
there's all these physical theories now

2763
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:45,359
that describe a world with dimensions

2764
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,238
that's much higher than the four

2765
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:47,759
dimensions of

2766
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:49,678
the three-dimensional space in one

2767
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,000
dimension of time

2768
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:53,199
so whatever the hell is going on in

2769
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,560
those other dimensions

2770
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:58,238
it could be something unfortunately

2771
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,920
this is the sad part it might be

2772
01:36:58,238 --> 01:37:02,399
something we can't even comprehend

2773
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:03,840
with our human brains that the

2774
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:07,198
limitations are just

2775
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,199
um i mean we're built we're just

2776
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:10,719
descendants of apes so like it might not

2777
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:12,238
be possible to even understand

2778
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:14,079
is there alien is there another

2779
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:15,359
dimension are they a human from the

2780
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:18,238
future is there

2781
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:19,439
perhaps chinese or another you know what

2782
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:20,000
i mean a group of people that are

2783
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:22,158
working with

2784
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:24,158
a technology far behind but you know

2785
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:26,799
what lex i had a chance to meet

2786
01:37:24,158 --> 01:37:28,158
you know because of the sport i'm doing

2787
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,320
i met a lot of

2788
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:31,839
people in military and politics

2789
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:34,960
sometimes that i

2790
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:36,000
i asked them every time i met i met one

2791
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:40,079
this week and and

2792
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,079
um i i i asked him i say is it true

2793
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:44,639
about the the uf who is there is there

2794
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:46,639
and he says to me like before even

2795
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,480
before i ask him i say hey

2796
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:51,760
sorry i have to ask you a question i

2797
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:53,439
wasn't in los angeles

2798
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,960
sorry i have to ask you questions oh you

2799
01:37:53,439 --> 01:37:55,599
want to ask me about ufo right away you

2800
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,679
knew

2801
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:59,679
i said yes you saw it in your eyes say

2802
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:00,239
yeah there is things that flies that we

2803
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:02,639
don't know

2804
01:38:00,238 --> 01:38:03,839
but it does it didn't tell me he doesn't

2805
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:05,039
know it they don't know if it's

2806
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,440
you know whatever but there's things

2807
01:38:05,039 --> 01:38:08,238
apparently that are detected and i know

2808
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:10,638
you met

2809
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:11,519
uh forever you know like flavors

2810
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:14,319
fascinating

2811
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:16,080
crazy it makes me sad that we live in a

2812
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,960
different area now that that it's

2813
01:38:16,079 --> 01:38:19,519
used to be a subject that was ridiculed

2814
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:22,079
and now

2815
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,440
it's so cool that it's you know i'm very

2816
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:25,840
excited to live in

2817
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:27,118
to that that era you know yeah it's

2818
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,239
really exciting but still the

2819
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:30,319
governments are

2820
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:31,359
kind of behind the times on that aspect

2821
01:38:30,319 --> 01:38:33,198
is

2822
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:34,960
they're not transparent and they don't

2823
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:36,559
communicate well

2824
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,880
you know it saddens me to think the

2825
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:41,360
possibility that that

2826
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:43,118
you know like the us government might be

2827
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:46,079
in possession of something

2828
01:38:43,118 --> 01:38:47,920
that they don't tell the world about

2829
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:49,359
because they're just scared

2830
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,960
it's because they don't know what the

2831
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:52,880
hell it is and they don't want the

2832
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:54,480
chinese to gain the technology or all

2833
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,639
those kinds of things

2834
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:58,319
do you think the president of the united

2835
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:00,719
states for example because the president

2836
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:02,238
comes and go every right four or eight

2837
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:05,039
years do you think he would know

2838
01:39:02,238 --> 01:39:05,678
all the secret or it would be a guy like

2839
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:08,960
for example

2840
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:10,880
vladimir putin with no much of a

2841
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:12,480
you know i don't think the president

2842
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:15,118
even know like even can

2843
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:16,559
he knows all all the the secrets the u.s

2844
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:19,279
president yeah i don't think so

2845
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,560
because he goes they go back and forth

2846
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:23,519
you know every four years

2847
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,920
you know they have the terms right so i

2848
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:27,199
you know

2849
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:28,239
i i wasn't sure before but i think i

2850
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:30,638
could trust

2851
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:31,839
the previous united states president of

2852
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:34,639
donald trump

2853
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,639
that if he knew

2854
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,239
he would probably tweet about it so

2855
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:41,520
perhaps

2856
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:43,039
so i yeah i i think

2857
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,880
from from the con you know i've worked

2858
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:47,279
with darpa i work with uh dod

2859
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,560
at clearance and i think from the

2860
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:50,238
perspective

2861
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,800
if you if you see the world as

2862
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:55,678
fundamentally a dangerous world

2863
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:57,840
where secrets are important to have from

2864
01:39:55,679 --> 01:40:01,279
a military perspective

2865
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:04,319
i think it's very unsafe to tell

2866
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:06,079
the president in the united states that

2867
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:08,158
you have this kind of technology so if

2868
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:10,800
you think of the world in that way

2869
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:11,679
i i hate that that's how that world is

2870
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,840
viewed because

2871
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:15,440
ultimately i think what's more powerful

2872
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,880
than the military secrets

2873
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:18,799
and i hope that actually is what will

2874
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:22,079
happen in the 21st century

2875
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:25,760
because what's more powerful is inspire

2876
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:28,559
people inspire the the young elon musks

2877
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:28,960
of the world to to create cool new

2878
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:32,639
things

2879
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,639
if we have technology that we've

2880
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,560
come have encountered that we don't

2881
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,239
understand that should only be

2882
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,800
inspiration

2883
01:40:38,238 --> 01:40:43,439
to uh develop that kind of stuff it

2884
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:45,760
shouldn't be seen as military

2885
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:46,638
as a military threat as a secret to hold

2886
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:50,960
on to

2887
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:52,880
i think secrets um i hope

2888
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,279
we more and more let go of the idea that

2889
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:57,920
there are secrets that give us advantage

2890
01:40:55,279 --> 01:40:59,118
you know like in the tech sector people

2891
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:01,279
are more and more

2892
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:03,039
releasing the software they're making an

2893
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:05,840
open source

2894
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:07,439
like secrets don't make sense they share

2895
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,400
the knowledge right share the share the

2896
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:10,479
knowledge like share

2897
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:12,079
like being afraid to share the knowledge

2898
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:14,638
i think i hope is an

2899
01:41:12,079 --> 01:41:16,719
old idea it's more yeah when you make it

2900
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:18,960
things more compartmentalized you know

2901
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:20,960
yes well yeah what that's the other

2902
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,319
thing is the bureaucracy of government

2903
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:24,239
is like

2904
01:41:22,319 --> 01:41:25,759
people only know their own little thing

2905
01:41:24,238 --> 01:41:27,519
and they don't spread the information

2906
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,440
it doesn't travel well i mean there's a

2907
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,360
lot of just inefficiencies that are

2908
01:41:29,439 --> 01:41:32,879
it makes me sad it makes me sad because

2909
01:41:31,359 --> 01:41:35,599
uh

2910
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:37,359
the the science the engineering that

2911
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,159
happens in governments like lockheed

2912
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:40,799
martin

2913
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:42,319
developing the different airplanes that

2914
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,079
they use for military applications is

2915
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:44,799
some of the most incredible engineering

2916
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:47,359
ever

2917
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,239
and it's secret because they're afraid

2918
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:50,000
to share it

2919
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:51,678
with the russians and the chinese and so

2920
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,760
on but

2921
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:55,199
on that topic i do think somebody like

2922
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:58,960
vladimir putin

2923
01:41:55,198 --> 01:42:01,118
window probably knows some stuff my god

2924
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,800
my god i would i would love to know what

2925
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:05,279
he knows but then again

2926
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,480
you never know because even he is you

2927
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:08,479
know people think of him as an

2928
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:10,399
exceptionally powerful person

2929
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:12,238
but he's also just managing a bunch of

2930
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:14,799
tribes

2931
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:16,559
his power is very limited he's trying to

2932
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:20,560
hold together

2933
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:22,400
uh a bunch of greedy power-hungry

2934
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:24,400
mad men that's right okay and he's

2935
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:27,679
trying to establish a balance

2936
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:28,559
he might not know everything so i i hope

2937
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:30,000
this changes

2938
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,760
because i think there's nothing more

2939
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:34,238
exciting about

2940
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:35,280
i don't even know if there is a human

2941
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:38,079
that knows

2942
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:39,039
you know what i mean like this idea that

2943
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:41,118
there's some

2944
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:43,039
civilization alien civilization that

2945
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:45,118
that land on the white house and say hi

2946
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:46,238
i come to meet the prison and like why

2947
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:48,799
would they do that

2948
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:49,519
you know what i mean it's kind of absurd

2949
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,920
you know

2950
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:53,760
well i i do think that actually i mean

2951
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:57,679
that's one possibility right is

2952
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:59,360
lart you know if an alien civilization

2953
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:01,920
really wanted to contact us

2954
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:03,118
i think everybody would know so i think

2955
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:05,199
what we're

2956
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:07,039
if if there's any kind of interaction

2957
01:43:05,198 --> 01:43:09,279
between humans

2958
01:43:07,039 --> 01:43:10,800
and aliens i think most likely what

2959
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:14,158
we're interacting with

2960
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:16,719
is the crappy like probe drone

2961
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:18,000
thing that kind of just like like it's

2962
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:21,520
like this

2963
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,920
yeah yeah this dumb thing you know we're

2964
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:25,119
not interacting with the aliens i think

2965
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:28,399
just like

2966
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:32,000
just like for us i think humans aren't

2967
01:43:28,399 --> 01:43:33,439
when we uh venture out into space

2968
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,560
the first thing that's going to mean

2969
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:38,879
aliens is our robots it's not us humans

2970
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:40,560
because we keep sending robots out so

2971
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,159
they're going to like

2972
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:45,039
they're going to make decisions about

2973
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:48,079
humans by looking at the robots

2974
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:50,238
i say their famous greys the grays

2975
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:52,238
maybe they're our robots maybe it's all

2976
01:43:50,238 --> 01:43:55,439
bs2 you know yeah yeah so

2977
01:43:52,238 --> 01:43:56,559
i i don't know i don't know what uh that

2978
01:43:55,439 --> 01:43:58,399
interaction actually

2979
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:00,080
would look like if aliens really wanted

2980
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:01,198
to reach out really communicate

2981
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:02,719
and i don't know if we're able to

2982
01:44:01,198 --> 01:44:04,238
actually communicate with them that's

2983
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:05,520
one of the sad things we might not be

2984
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:08,158
able to

2985
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,960
that we might the aliens might already

2986
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:12,719
be here

2987
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:14,399
and we might just not even know

2988
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:15,760
know how to see them or know how to

2989
01:44:14,399 --> 01:44:19,039
communicate with them

2990
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:20,400
there's so much misinformation and

2991
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:24,399
sometimes there is

2992
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:27,039
people that are very credible that that

2993
01:44:24,399 --> 01:44:27,439
that made crazy claims you know like

2994
01:44:27,039 --> 01:44:28,880
like

2995
01:44:27,439 --> 01:44:31,359
you don't know what to believe you know

2996
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:34,400
like paul ellior the the

2997
01:44:31,359 --> 01:44:36,880
the minister of defense of canada i've

2998
01:44:34,399 --> 01:44:37,759
said like some that there is many alien

2999
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,679
race that ever

3000
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,880
that that's what he says research it and

3001
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:44,079
then

3002
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:46,560
that that scientists from i think israel

3003
01:44:44,079 --> 01:44:48,960
recently have said something about trump

3004
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:50,880
he was keeping secret or

3005
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:52,239
medvedev you're from russia they have

3006
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,800
been caught in there like

3007
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:56,399
during a break in between interviews to

3008
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,760
talks about like oh it's like men in

3009
01:44:56,399 --> 01:45:00,158
blacks over to speak i don't know

3010
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:01,760
he didn't look like he was joking but i

3011
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:03,439
don't know if he didn't know about this

3012
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:05,039
yeah you can check on youtube it'd say

3013
01:45:03,439 --> 01:45:07,118
it's it's it's it went

3014
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:08,800
viral yeah there's a lot of things like

3015
01:45:07,118 --> 01:45:12,399
that sometime like

3016
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:15,600
or or bob lazar i'm like imagine if it's

3017
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:16,000
true man yeah you might imagine if we if

3018
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,639
we're like

3019
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,279
a fish in the water we live in our own

3020
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:21,359
world and

3021
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:22,319
sometimes there's a fisherman that

3022
01:45:21,359 --> 01:45:24,719
grabbed the fish

3023
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:26,238
yeah take him out of the water and threw

3024
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:27,840
it back in the water and the fish goes

3025
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:30,319
back to the other fish and say

3026
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,760
hey there's someone that that take me

3027
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:34,079
out of the water then i've seen

3028
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:36,159
uh things that i did not like imagine if

3029
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:39,198
it's true like we like

3030
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:40,399
yeah and and one other thing like i

3031
01:45:39,198 --> 01:45:43,279
wanted to ask you because

3032
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:44,559
you were consciousness how about dreams

3033
01:45:43,279 --> 01:45:46,800
what is a dream

3034
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:48,159
yeah well i i more and more i don't know

3035
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,880
if you're paying attention to this

3036
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:50,559
there's now

3037
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:51,920
it's become more acceptable in the

3038
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:53,760
scientific community to do

3039
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,279
large-scale studies of psychedelics for

3040
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,600
example and there's a lot of connection

3041
01:45:55,279 --> 01:46:00,000
between psychedelics and dreams

3042
01:45:57,600 --> 01:46:01,600
it's very similar states there's there's

3043
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,679
a lot our mind does

3044
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,119
when it detaches itself from reality

3045
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:06,079
that it can just explore a lot of

3046
01:46:05,118 --> 01:46:08,000
different ideas

3047
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:09,198
it's very possible that dreams is you're

3048
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,719
traveling somewhere

3049
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:12,399
and the same thing with psychedelics

3050
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:14,719
you're traveling somewhere

3051
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:16,559
in a different not traveling through

3052
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:17,600
physical space it's the other dimensions

3053
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,600
that we're talking about you're

3054
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:21,119
traveling some other

3055
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:23,440
through some other dimension to meet

3056
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:25,198
some other creature people talk with dmt

3057
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:27,039
that they meet some elves i've never

3058
01:46:25,198 --> 01:46:29,519
done i i'd like to

3059
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:30,399
i don't know if there's a safe legal way

3060
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:34,320
to do it but

3061
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:36,799
uh they all talk about meeting elves

3062
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:38,000
and they're like creatures like entities

3063
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:41,840
and like who are

3064
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,520
who are they what's what is this

3065
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,199
is it because they're high or it's

3066
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,840
because they're actually meeting

3067
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:47,519
something

3068
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:50,239
and maybe there's no difference i mean

3069
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:51,760
that uh who knows exactly and that takes

3070
01:46:50,238 --> 01:46:53,039
us right back to us not being able to

3071
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:55,920
really understand

3072
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:58,000
how our mind works you know i work in

3073
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:00,480
artificial intelligence

3074
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,600
it's clear that we understand so little

3075
01:47:00,479 --> 01:47:04,238
about intelligence

3076
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,880
some basic things about intelligence

3077
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:07,839
just at the

3078
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:09,039
at the very sort of basic uh first

3079
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:12,319
principles

3080
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:15,679
level we don't understand what it means

3081
01:47:12,319 --> 01:47:18,559
to to reason to think to

3082
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:18,880
assimilate pieces of knowledge together

3083
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:21,679
from

3084
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,960
the from the basics to the complex we

3085
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:24,960
don't understand it we don't understand

3086
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,399
how the human mind does it

3087
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,639
we don't understand how the human mind

3088
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:31,519
is able to take incredible

3089
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:33,520
waterfall of information and filter

3090
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:35,440
cleanly into just like

3091
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:37,119
clean you only see the things that are

3092
01:47:35,439 --> 01:47:38,479
important and are able to

3093
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:40,319
jump together and be able to reason

3094
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:42,799
about the world and

3095
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:44,559
at the same time have moments of like

3096
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:46,880
genius of creativity

3097
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,600
like what what is that that also you

3098
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:50,159
know people

3099
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:51,280
writers talk about that that they're you

3100
01:47:50,158 --> 01:47:52,000
know they're almost like communicating

3101
01:47:51,279 --> 01:47:54,158
with the muse

3102
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,319
like where do ideas come from yeah this

3103
01:47:54,158 --> 01:47:57,039
is the joe rogan philosophy but but i i

3104
01:47:56,319 --> 01:47:59,039
do know that

3105
01:47:57,039 --> 01:48:00,319
past civilization were a lot of them

3106
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:03,118
were based on

3107
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:04,799
shamanism and you know what i think it's

3108
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:08,079
sad is

3109
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,639
if someone drink alcohol and when he's

3110
01:48:08,079 --> 01:48:11,679
drunk he's

3111
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:13,520
going to commit like create like

3112
01:48:11,679 --> 01:48:14,719
like murders or something we're going to

3113
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:16,239
blame the person right

3114
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:18,158
we're going to say that's his fault it's

3115
01:48:16,238 --> 01:48:20,879
not the fault of alcohol

3116
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:21,359
however if someone does psychedelic or

3117
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:23,920
any

3118
01:48:21,359 --> 01:48:26,399
things that is illegal and do something

3119
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:28,800
crazy now we're gonna

3120
01:48:26,399 --> 01:48:29,439
put the fault on on psychedelic you know

3121
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:33,119
what i mean

3122
01:48:29,439 --> 01:48:35,439
and perhaps the person itself is the

3123
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:37,118
the reason why you know he's been doing

3124
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:40,158
these things you know what i mean

3125
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:40,880
so yeah it's fascinating how like

3126
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:42,719
society

3127
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:44,639
you know like in canada they just

3128
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:48,319
legalized marijuana

3129
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:50,239
oh yeah but before that

3130
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:52,158
before they did it like if you talk for

3131
01:48:50,238 --> 01:48:53,759
example to my dad my dad is

3132
01:48:52,158 --> 01:48:56,399
against it like because the whole

3133
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,079
mentality is like it's drug it's bad at

3134
01:48:56,399 --> 01:48:59,679
that but drinking a glass

3135
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:01,279
you know drinking a beer it's fine i

3136
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:03,359
mean what

3137
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:05,198
is you know what i mean what is good

3138
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:07,599
what is bad and

3139
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:09,678
i guess you think chocolate could be bad

3140
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:11,360
as well for your health or i mean i'm

3141
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:13,840
going to the extreme now but

3142
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:15,920
yeah what is good what is bad if you use

3143
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:16,960
it for recreation you use it for an

3144
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:20,158
experience for

3145
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:23,118
to learn about yourself it's like

3146
01:49:20,158 --> 01:49:24,399
it said that the line is very tiny you

3147
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:27,039
know there are some countries

3148
01:49:24,399 --> 01:49:28,319
that drugs are all legals you know what

3149
01:49:27,039 --> 01:49:30,238
i mean and i

3150
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:31,519
i don't know the the the stats but i

3151
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:34,879
would i would be interesting

3152
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:37,679
to know if they have more

3153
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:38,639
crimes there than other countries where

3154
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:40,560
it's more strict i

3155
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:42,000
would that would be interesting to know

3156
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:44,639
about that it's fascinate me

3157
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,000
you know yeah and i mean we humans kind

3158
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:47,599
of just come up with the

3159
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,840
arbitrary lines of what's good what's

3160
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:50,880
bad that applies with drugs that applies

3161
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:53,599
with anything

3162
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:56,159
uh that applies with animals for example

3163
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:58,000
we talked about carnivore diet

3164
01:49:56,158 --> 01:49:59,359
maybe the time we live and now will be

3165
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,639
remembered for

3166
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:06,639
the cruelty to animals for example

3167
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:08,079
and i believe this the 21st century will

3168
01:50:06,639 --> 01:50:11,279
be remembered

3169
01:50:08,079 --> 01:50:14,559
for our cruelty to robots

3170
01:50:11,279 --> 01:50:17,198
that uh eventually there will be a

3171
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:18,400
civil rights movement for robots where

3172
01:50:17,198 --> 01:50:20,158
the the ones who

3173
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:21,839
uh choose to be conscious the ones who

3174
01:50:20,158 --> 01:50:24,879
have consciousness will

3175
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:26,639
say we deserve rights too

3176
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:27,920
we deserve to be treated with respect

3177
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:30,480
too

3178
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:32,319
how about the people we put in jail

3179
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:34,319
people put in jail i mean if i think in

3180
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:36,880
the future we'll look back

3181
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:38,479
and we'll think of ourselves being

3182
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:40,400
stupid to

3183
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:41,839
you know to put people in jail instead

3184
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:45,198
of you know like

3185
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:47,279
trying to fix the problem in in in

3186
01:50:45,198 --> 01:50:49,519
at the base you know of course now we're

3187
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:51,759
or i guess it's our endurance that

3188
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:53,599
made it in a way that we cannot sort

3189
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:56,000
sometimes understand what makes uh

3190
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:57,039
sometimes a psychopath a psychopath or a

3191
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,920
murder or murderer

3192
01:50:57,039 --> 01:51:00,639
but you know if we can pinpoint the

3193
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,719
problem and

3194
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:04,239
take care of it before you know what i

3195
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:05,679
mean or

3196
01:51:04,238 --> 01:51:08,399
made it in the way that we can

3197
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:10,319
reestablish that person in

3198
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:11,759
the society you know who knows you know

3199
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:13,920
what was their future is

3200
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,599
old it's interesting we live in an

3201
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:18,719
interesting time

3202
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:20,159
you mentioned your father what have you

3203
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:21,520
learned from your dad

3204
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:23,759
you mentioned he was an important part

3205
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:26,400
of your childhood my dad is

3206
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:28,000
amazing i grew up we didn't have a lot

3207
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:30,158
of money but it doesn't mean if

3208
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,279
i'm born in a nice country that always

3209
01:51:30,158 --> 01:51:35,198
nice thing happen

3210
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:36,079
you know my dad for me is a big role

3211
01:51:35,198 --> 01:51:39,759
model

3212
01:51:36,079 --> 01:51:43,599
because i see him through to my life

3213
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:45,039
facing a lot of adversity you know he um

3214
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:47,039
he stopped drinking when i was a

3215
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:50,079
teenager he was an alcoholic

3216
01:51:47,039 --> 01:51:52,479
and i seen him struggle through that

3217
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:53,760
you know and it was very very hard and

3218
01:51:52,479 --> 01:51:57,598
um

3219
01:51:53,760 --> 01:52:01,280
i've seen him work

3220
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:03,520
like crazy hours like

3221
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:06,559
come leave in the morning come home at

3222
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:09,520
night burned out because of work

3223
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:12,320
through almost all his life to the point

3224
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:15,440
that it became

3225
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:16,799
a slave of the system yes it became a

3226
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:20,399
habit and a normal

3227
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:21,840
way of living and it made me realize

3228
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:23,198
that i've learned a lot through my

3229
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:26,000
father

3230
01:52:23,198 --> 01:52:26,719
he taught me perseverance hard work you

3231
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,319
know

3232
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:31,198
when you face adversity you know to

3233
01:52:28,319 --> 01:52:36,079
never give up until you achieve it

3234
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:37,839
but also he it taught me a lesson that

3235
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:41,359
in a way that i don't want to be like

3236
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:43,119
him even if he is happy

3237
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:44,399
it's because i realize i don't think he

3238
01:52:43,118 --> 01:52:47,439
knows anything else

3239
01:52:44,399 --> 01:52:50,479
like he works through all his life

3240
01:52:47,439 --> 01:52:51,759
and i don't want to live to work i want

3241
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:53,118
to work for it for

3242
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:56,560
you know what i mean i want to decide

3243
01:52:53,118 --> 01:52:58,799
when i work you know i feel like like he

3244
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:00,000
he lived to work instead of working for

3245
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:02,560
a living

3246
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,840
and perhaps it's because he did not have

3247
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:06,159
choice

3248
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,520
he he was the older of his family they

3249
01:53:06,158 --> 01:53:09,920
had they were nine kid

3250
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:11,199
his dad my grandfather died when he was

3251
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,239
young so he had to become

3252
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:17,039
the father of the family and and work

3253
01:53:14,238 --> 01:53:18,238
to put money on the table so perhaps

3254
01:53:17,039 --> 01:53:21,679
that what

3255
01:53:18,238 --> 01:53:26,158
made him that way and he became like

3256
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:28,000
like a habit for him my dad taught me uh

3257
01:53:26,158 --> 01:53:30,719
when i was at school i was bullied at

3258
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
school he's the first one to initiate me

3259
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:34,239
to a martial art

3260
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,479
he taught me kyrati my dad my dad was a

3261
01:53:34,238 --> 01:53:38,879
black belt in kyokushin karate as well

3262
01:53:36,479 --> 01:53:41,279
very nice but because he was working too

3263
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:43,520
much he didn't have time to teach me

3264
01:53:41,279 --> 01:53:46,238
and i needed self defense in order to

3265
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:46,239
defend myself

3266
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:49,679
i have a winning a great carrier and

3267
01:53:48,158 --> 01:53:52,719
mixed martial art but in the

3268
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:55,840
in the schoolyard that's so good my

3269
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:57,679
mixed record my my record is not very

3270
01:53:55,840 --> 01:54:01,920
good

3271
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:04,319
when you're a kid and you're about

3272
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:05,359
seven eight years old and you're facing

3273
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:08,479
bullied

3274
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:11,039
bullies that are

3275
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:12,079
two to three years older than than

3276
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:13,760
yourself

3277
01:54:12,079 --> 01:54:16,479
it's not the same thing than when you're

3278
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:21,199
25 and the guy is 28 so there is a big

3279
01:54:16,479 --> 01:54:21,198
discrepancy in terms of maturity

3280
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:26,000
so my dad taught me introduced me to

3281
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:28,320
karate

3282
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,560
danny i didn't he didn't have time to

3283
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:34,319
teach me then he put me

3284
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:35,039
in a school with an a teacher that said

3285
01:54:34,319 --> 01:54:38,639
it was

3286
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:40,238
jean kutzer and i grew up with a lot of

3287
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:43,118
anger

3288
01:54:40,238 --> 01:54:44,959
and uh there were two person that was

3289
01:54:43,118 --> 01:54:47,519
afraid growing up

3290
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:49,118
it was my dad my dad was very severe

3291
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:52,320
very strict with me

3292
01:54:49,118 --> 01:54:53,679
and i'm glad he was because i i could

3293
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:55,759
have become very bad

3294
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:56,880
i could have become chosen on a

3295
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:58,719
different path

3296
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:00,639
people see me as a nice guy and i'm

3297
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:01,760
gonna i am a nice guy i try to be a good

3298
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:04,800
role model

3299
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:06,560
but i could easily have turned

3300
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,840
towards our around there there's

3301
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,080
darkness somewhere in there

3302
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:10,880
yes they are a lot and a lot of my

3303
01:55:10,079 --> 01:55:14,000
friends have chosen

3304
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:14,639
that pat and unfortunately you know they

3305
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,679
they

3306
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:19,199

3309
01:55:21,599 --> 01:55:24,880

3310
01:55:22,479 --> 01:55:26,718
country in the world like i said it's

3311
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:28,159
even if you live in the nice country not

01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:31,039
always nice thing it depend

3313
01:55:28,158 --> 01:55:31,598
of the situation but that's what my dad

3314
01:55:31,039 --> 01:55:35,599
taught me

3315
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:38,800
you know and he gave me that

3316
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:39,520
to to because i i'm very good at

3317
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:41,679
learning

3318
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:42,560
by observing people and by observing him

3319
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:45,118
i i see

3320
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:46,400
the the struggle he had with alcoholism

3321
01:55:45,118 --> 01:55:49,359
and what he did the the

3322
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:49,920
the pain sometimes that even flick to to

3323
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:53,198
to us

3324
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:57,199
to my family but how he

3325
01:55:53,198 --> 01:55:59,919
turned he did that 180 degree

3326
01:55:57,198 --> 01:56:00,799
and i really admire that and i know it

3327
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,639
was uh

3328
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,480
very very hard for him and he did it you

3329
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:07,760
know and for me uh

3330
01:56:04,479 --> 01:56:10,158
that's a great role model for me so

3331
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:11,440
with your dad being an engine of

3332
01:56:10,158 --> 01:56:13,920
basically hard work

3333
01:56:11,439 --> 01:56:15,598
and you finding a balance of being able

3334
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:17,359
to work your ass off

3335
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:18,960
but also to be able to enjoy a piece of

3336
01:56:17,359 --> 01:56:22,238
chocolate

3337
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:26,079

3340
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:32,319
very productive but also want to

3341
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,359
make you sit back and enjoy and say that

3342
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:35,039

competition it was not

3389
01:58:10,158 --> 01:58:14,319

3391
01:58:14,319 --> 01:58:19,198

3392
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:21,039
very competitive and when

3393
01:58:19,198 --> 01:58:22,638
that day you used to get out of the

3394
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:23,760
training session with a bad performance

3395
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:26,159

3397
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:28,960
week

01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:32,079
perform better

3400
01:58:30,238 --> 01:58:34,319
with the guy that i had the most trouble

3401
01:58:32,079 --> 01:58:36,238

you know like um i

3419
01:59:14,079 --> 01:59:17,920
i am not the same person i used to be

3420
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:19,840
when i went on my knees and begged the

3421
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:24,239

3423
01:59:24,238 --> 01:59:27,919
i'm healthy most importantly that's the

3424
01:59:26,399 --> 01:59:31,118
most important thing

3425
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:34,079
and as man i'm going to tell you the

3426
01:59:31,118 --> 01:59:38,000
truth as good as my career was

3427
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:41,198
man my private life man is a million

3428
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,158
times better man i i and and people ask

3429
01:59:41,198 --> 01:59:45,039
me sometime they

3430
01:59:42,158 --> 01:59:46,799
always wonder they they try to ask me

3431
01:59:45,039 --> 01:59:49,679
and it's normal it's a lot of people is

3432
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:53,920
curious and they're the reporter

3433
01:59:49,679 --> 01:59:56,880
and in the sport of mixed martial art

3434
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:58,719
we say we play basketball we play soccer

3435
01:59:56,880 --> 02:00:02,000
but you don't play fighting

3436
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:03,679
so when you expose your private life

3437
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,479
we've seen that happen in the fight week

3438
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:09,199
sometime conor mcgregor and khabib

3439
02:00:06,479 --> 02:00:10,879
your competitor knows that he cannot get

3440
02:00:09,198 --> 02:00:12,000
to use what he will do he will try to

3441
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:15,279
get to someone that you

3442
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:17,279
love so may i never expose

3443
02:00:15,279 --> 02:00:18,399
my my private life i never post

3444
02:00:17,279 --> 02:00:21,599
instagram

3445
02:00:18,399 --> 02:00:22,319
of my family of my stuff that's the

3446
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:24,840
reason why

3447
02:00:22,319 --> 02:00:26,158
because i mean i'm in a business of

3448
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:28,159
fighting

3449
02:00:26,158 --> 02:00:29,519
and people know that they cannot get to

3450
02:00:28,158 --> 02:00:33,759
me

3451
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:36,400
and i believe because i was bullied when

3452
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:38,800
i was young

3453
02:00:36,399 --> 02:00:40,000
i didn't realize that when i was young

3454
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:43,199
but it helps

3455
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,520
me deal with the mental warfare that i

3456
02:00:43,198 --> 02:00:45,198
need

3457
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,880
that i had to face later on in my life

3458
02:00:45,198 --> 02:00:48,319
in mixed martial art because it's a very

3459
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:52,840
egotistic sport

3460
02:00:48,319 --> 02:00:55,439
and there's a lot of a lot and a lot of

3461
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:57,520
intimidation and i was used to i've been

3462
02:00:55,439 --> 02:00:59,598
used to this thing when i was young so

3463
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:03,520
it does not get to me

3464
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:06,639
however the good way to get to me

3465
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:07,360
go go go go try to get to someone i i

3466
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:10,000
love

3467
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:11,039
now man i'm gonna go crazy you know what

3468
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,880
i mean

3469
02:01:11,039 --> 02:01:14,479
and i'm aware of that so in order to

3470
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:17,199
protect myself

3471
02:01:14,479 --> 02:01:18,559
i always because i'm aware i'm a public

3472
02:01:17,198 --> 02:01:21,359
person

3473
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:24,000
so i try to always keep my surrounding

3474
02:01:21,359 --> 02:01:26,719
like in a private

3475
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,760
yeah one of the ways that like uh your

3476
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:31,279
your friend of mine

3477
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:32,320
joe rogan has been an inspiration that

3478
02:01:31,279 --> 02:01:34,639
he he's got like

3479
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:36,238
an incredible family and he for the most

3480
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:37,279
part is starting to change recently

3481
02:01:36,238 --> 02:01:38,879
actually it's kind of interesting but

3482
02:01:37,279 --> 02:01:39,519
for the most part throughout his life he

3483
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:41,760
kept it

3484
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:43,440
pretty secret doesn't talk about it and

3485
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:44,880
he's common he's a comedian comedians

3486
02:01:43,439 --> 02:01:46,238
talk about everything he doesn't really

3487
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:48,480
talk about it

3488
02:01:46,238 --> 02:01:50,079
and there's something to that it like

3489
02:01:48,479 --> 02:01:52,319
preserves the magic of this

3490
02:01:50,079 --> 02:01:54,238
the silence of the private life and i

3491
02:01:52,319 --> 02:01:57,439
think it can affect the

3492
02:01:54,238 --> 02:02:01,759
the development of the kid if

3493
02:01:57,439 --> 02:02:04,158
the kid grew up being oh he's the son of

3494
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:05,679
that guy instead of being his own person

3495
02:02:04,158 --> 02:02:08,879
you know what i mean

3496
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:12,000
so so for me it's very important like

3497
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:13,599
my parents are older it's fine but it

3498
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,520
taught me a big lesson

3499
02:02:13,599 --> 02:02:16,960
when i'm with my friend at the dinner or

3500
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:19,040
anything i talk with

3501
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,639
person always share a thing but when i'm

3502
02:02:19,039 --> 02:02:23,840
talking i'm aware of

3503
02:02:20,639 --> 02:02:25,440
of the audience who i'm in front yeah

3504
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,319
and i mean but oftentimes those people

3505
02:02:25,439 --> 02:02:29,759
are just incredible

3506
02:02:26,319 --> 02:02:30,880
it kind of makes me sad that uh

3507
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:32,239
you know there's a lot of people that

3508
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:33,679
love you right and they're a lot of

3509
02:02:32,238 --> 02:02:35,039
really incredible people

3510
02:02:33,679 --> 02:02:37,118
and you'll never get to really know

3511
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:38,560
their story that's right i mean i don't

3512
02:02:37,118 --> 02:02:40,158
know for me it makes me sad

3513
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:41,679
you see them like at airports and stuff

3514
02:02:40,158 --> 02:02:43,839
people will tell me they listen to this

3515
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:45,199
podcast or something like that

3516
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,719
and they're i could tell they're

3517
02:02:45,198 --> 02:02:48,479
incredible people and it makes me it's

3518
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:51,198
like a little goodbye

3519
02:02:48,479 --> 02:02:52,399
of of a possible friend i don't know it

3520
02:02:51,198 --> 02:02:55,678
makes me sad it's right

3521
02:02:52,399 --> 02:02:56,719
it makes me it's lonely it's almost like

3522
02:02:55,679 --> 02:02:58,560
celebrity

3523
02:02:56,719 --> 02:03:01,198
is a lonely thing so the higher the

3524
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:02,960
celebrity the more lonely you become

3525
02:03:01,198 --> 02:03:05,359
in some kind of way but of course you

3526
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:07,679
have that little gem of a private life

3527
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:10,639
where you can personally i believe every

3528
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:13,440
relationship i i

3529
02:03:10,639 --> 02:03:14,079
like i don't like to use this term but

3530
02:03:13,439 --> 02:03:17,118
it's always

3531
02:03:14,079 --> 02:03:19,279
a give and take relationship you know

3532
02:03:17,118 --> 02:03:20,639
like you can gain something and the

3533
02:03:19,279 --> 02:03:22,399
person like it

3534
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:24,480
it could be something like not material

3535
02:03:22,399 --> 02:03:25,198
is materialistic like something oh he's

3536
02:03:24,479 --> 02:03:27,359
a good

3537
02:03:25,198 --> 02:03:30,399
confidant like you someone that they can

3538
02:03:27,359 --> 02:03:32,479
give me good advice or or

3539
02:03:30,399 --> 02:03:34,559
it's a word i would say like extensional

3540
02:03:32,479 --> 02:03:37,039
like if a pilot as a co-pilot

3541
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:38,880
is the co-pilot is extend as a

3542
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:40,639
extensional relationship with him you

3543
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:41,359
know so he knows if he gets sick or he

3544
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:43,599
faint

3545
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:45,118
he's there to make sure you know he is

3546
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:47,440
there to help

3547
02:03:45,118 --> 02:03:48,920
and i think in every relation it's about

3548
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:50,158
compatibility but it's about

3549
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:53,199
extensionality

3550
02:03:50,158 --> 02:03:55,920
right in a way that if that person is

3551
02:03:53,198 --> 02:03:56,319
extensional and sometimes we talk about

3552
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:58,960
about

3553
02:03:56,319 --> 02:03:59,519
love you know like sometimes i think is

3554
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:02,719
is it

3555
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:04,000
is it a bs word or not because i myself

3556
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:06,319
sometimes look at

3557
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,599
i look at myself in the mirror and when

3558
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:10,238
i do s

3559
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:11,920
stupid thing sometimes i love myself a

3560
02:04:10,238 --> 02:04:14,238
lot and sometimes i don't

3561
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:15,359
you know what i mean because i'm angry

3562
02:04:14,238 --> 02:04:18,000
at myself i've done

3563
02:04:15,359 --> 02:04:18,559
stupid thing so that means sometimes you

3564
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,399
could

3565
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,400
love could be fluctuating you know what

3566
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:23,359
i mean how about in relationships

3567
02:04:22,399 --> 02:04:25,039
sometimes you

3568
02:04:23,359 --> 02:04:26,960
people they say oh they love each other

3569
02:04:25,039 --> 02:04:29,039
but then when they divorce they go

3570
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:30,319
oh i want the house and the dog and the

3571
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:33,519
kids stay with me and

3572
02:04:30,319 --> 02:04:35,359
you know what i mean if you love if by

3573
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:38,960
definition if you really love

3574
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:40,880
someone and let's say you're an old man

3575
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:42,639
and you love a woman and she decided to

3576
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:44,960
leave you for a younger man if you

3577
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:47,440
really love her

3578
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:48,800
you're gonna help her pack and leave but

3579
02:04:47,439 --> 02:04:52,000
in our society sometimes

3580
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:55,279
we want to hone something to me

3581
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,359
love includes the missing somebody

3582
02:04:55,279 --> 02:04:59,118
losing somebody the anger at somebody

3583
02:04:57,359 --> 02:05:00,078
it's all the passion feelings towards

3584
02:04:59,118 --> 02:05:02,559
somebody

3585
02:05:00,078 --> 02:05:05,198
that's all love okay i you know it's all

3586
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:07,599
part of the thing it's the ups and downs

3587
02:05:05,198 --> 02:05:08,238
it's uh the sad thing is when the

3588
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:10,480
feelings

3589
02:05:08,238 --> 02:05:12,238
towards the person the ups and downs go

3590
02:05:10,479 --> 02:05:14,000
away they're forgetting

3591
02:05:12,238 --> 02:05:15,279
yeah that's that's the opposite of love

3592
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,279
so the opposite of love isn't

3593
02:05:15,279 --> 02:05:18,880
hate the to me the opposite of love is

3594
02:05:17,279 --> 02:05:20,800
forgetting

3595
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:22,400
and and that's that's a much bigger

3596
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:23,440
that's like the depth of human

3597
02:05:22,399 --> 02:05:25,439
connection that's

3598
02:05:23,439 --> 02:05:27,439
how i see love so sometimes i try to

3599
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:30,479
stay positive and

3600
02:05:27,439 --> 02:05:31,919
i've been asked how i try to because i

3601
02:05:30,479 --> 02:05:33,919
have the image of

3602
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:36,000
someone who's positive but i go to my

3603
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:39,118
own demon as well sometime

3604
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:42,000
however we talk about love

3605
02:05:39,118 --> 02:05:42,000
when i was young

3606
02:05:42,158 --> 02:05:48,000
you know like like i didn't love

3607
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,039
who i was at first that's how i love i

3608
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:52,319
learned to kind of

3609
02:05:49,039 --> 02:05:53,920
love myself like i didn't and then when

3610
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:56,238
i was going

3611
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:57,679
to to bullying i was i believe i was

3612
02:05:56,238 --> 02:06:00,238
bullied because i didn't love

3613
02:05:57,679 --> 02:06:01,359
myself i i because i project a very bad

3614
02:06:00,238 --> 02:06:04,399
image

3615
02:06:01,359 --> 02:06:06,000
of what i think of myself i was

3616
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:08,238
a kid that lacked a lot of confidence i

3617
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,800
was looking down when i was walking

3618
02:06:08,238 --> 02:06:12,238
i shrugged my shoulder when someone was

3619
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:16,320
talking to me i was avoiding

3620
02:06:12,238 --> 02:06:19,439
eye contact so i was a very easy target

3621
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:22,000
for the bullies and i think

3622
02:06:19,439 --> 02:06:22,559
bullies are like in predatory animal in

3623
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,520
nature

3624
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:27,280
they will hunt the the easier prey they

3625
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:28,079
would don't they don't go the lion don't

3626
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:30,479
go

3627
02:06:28,078 --> 02:06:31,118
for the the alpha bull they go for the

3628
02:06:30,479 --> 02:06:33,598
one who's

3629
02:06:31,118 --> 02:06:35,118
old or who's sick the weakest one and

3630
02:06:33,599 --> 02:06:36,400
bullies are the same in society i

3631
02:06:35,118 --> 02:06:39,359
believe

3632
02:06:36,399 --> 02:06:40,638
and i didn't like to be bullied of

3633
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:43,839
course but i didn't like the

3634
02:06:40,639 --> 02:06:46,639
the person that i was but i found out

3635
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:49,920
through martial art

3636
02:06:46,639 --> 02:06:53,039
the respect and

3637
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:54,639
my my coach was extraordinary to me he

3638
02:06:53,039 --> 02:06:57,039
taught me discipline and self

3639
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:57,679
strength self strength and i found out

3640
02:06:57,039 --> 02:07:00,158
that

3641
02:06:57,679 --> 02:07:02,800
i needed to in order to love myself i

3642
02:07:00,158 --> 02:07:04,399
needed to change myself

3643
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:05,920
because i didn't when i looked at my son

3644
02:07:04,399 --> 02:07:09,759
in the mirror i didn't like what i

3645
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:13,359
saw so i decided to become

3646
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:16,800
like someone that i would love so

3647
02:07:13,359 --> 02:07:20,559
i tried to look people straight up

3648
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:23,840
and and trying to showcase

3649
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:25,520
a more confident image that i

3650
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:27,039
had and it was hard in the beginning

3651
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:28,079
because i didn't really believe in it

3652
02:07:27,039 --> 02:07:31,519
but i

3653
02:07:28,078 --> 02:07:34,719
i faked it until kind of i make it

3654
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:36,480
so when i was walking at school

3655
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:38,560
more and more i was learning how to

3656
02:07:36,479 --> 02:07:41,118
become more confident and i was

3657
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:42,239
like taking charge when the teacher was

3658
02:07:41,118 --> 02:07:43,920
asking questions i was

3659
02:07:42,238 --> 02:07:45,759
at first i was never answering was like

3660
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:48,000
this waiting always to be the last

3661
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:49,599
then i was hey i i i know what the

3662
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:55,279
answer this is the answer

3663
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:56,960
i got out of my comfort zone so to speak

3664
02:07:55,279 --> 02:07:59,439
and i wish i would tell you that i got

3665
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:02,158
out of bullying

3666
02:07:59,439 --> 02:08:03,919
because a hollywood story i use martial

3667
02:08:02,158 --> 02:08:06,078
art to beat up all the bullies

3668
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:06,960
but it's not how it happened to me it

3669
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:10,719
happened because i

3670
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:14,000
changed myself from the inside out

3671

and i learned how to

3672
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:17,760
because i didn't love myself in the

3673
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:21,039
beginning i learned

3674
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:23,440
how to become like someone that i love

3675
02:08:21,039 --> 02:08:27,118

shoot i did something stupid i at least

3680
02:08:34,479 --> 02:08:38,158
i can apologize to the person if i

3681
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:40,479
realize and then

3682
02:08:38,158 --> 02:08:41,920
i know that i'm not the person i was in

3683
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:45,439
the past

3684
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:46,719
i'm the person that i am right now so i

3685
02:08:45,439 --> 02:08:49,359
can learn

3686
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:50,239
and become that image of the person that

3687
02:08:49,359 --> 02:08:52,799
i love so

3688
02:08:50,238 --> 02:08:54,000
in in a way the reason i'm trying to be

3689
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:55,679
positive and i and i

3690
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:58,560
am able to stay positive sometime in

3691
02:08:55,679 --> 02:09:02,000
life is because i'm always

3692
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:03,920
trying to be like that person

3693
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,359
that i love yeah and i think if you

3694
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:06,000
don't look yourself in the mirror and

3695
02:09:05,359 --> 02:09:08,479
don't

3696
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:10,078
love yourself or don't see any positive

3697
02:09:08,479 --> 02:09:11,598
future for yourself

3698
02:09:10,078 --> 02:09:13,118
how can you change your environment if

3699
02:09:11,599 --> 02:09:15,039
you cannot change yourself

3700
02:09:13,118 --> 02:09:16,719
you know what i mean you would never be

3701
02:09:15,039 --> 02:09:18,800
happy if you're not happy

3702
02:09:16,719 --> 02:09:20,639
when you look at yourself in the mirror

3703
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:21,199
so change yourself first then change

3704
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:22,400
your

3705
02:09:21,198 --> 02:09:24,238
you know it's not the environment you're

3706
02:09:22,399 --> 02:09:26,158
gonna change for yourself it's you have

3707
02:09:24,238 --> 02:09:30,479
to go from the inside out

3708
02:09:26,158 --> 02:09:32,000
you know this this i learned to martial

3709
02:09:30,479 --> 02:09:34,078
art i have a

3710
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:36,800
i had a coach who was incredible used to

3711
02:09:34,078 --> 02:09:38,639
drill these ideas in my head and

3712
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:40,079

02:09:40,078 --> 02:09:44,000
these beautiful things about myself and

3715
02:09:43,118 --> 02:09:46,238
how i

3716
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,439
he's dead now unfortunately peace peace

3717
02:09:46,238 --> 02:09:50,000
to him but uh

3718
02:09:47,439 --> 02:09:51,519
he was incredible incredible he was very

3719
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:53,520
very strict i was afraid of him i was

3720
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:56,079
afraid of my dad and afraid of him

3721
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:57,520
he couldn't teach nowadays like he used

3722
02:09:56,078 --> 02:10:00,238
to teach me because he would be in

3723
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:02,320
probably in jail you know but i'm glad

3724
02:10:00,238 --> 02:10:05,198
he did it because for that time being

3725
02:10:02,319 --> 02:10:07,279
that's what i needed it and i would

3726
02:10:05,198 --> 02:10:10,479
never have had that the career

3727
02:10:07,279 --> 02:10:12,078
i had in mixed martial art without this

3728
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:14,158
because i would i would never have got

3729
02:10:12,078 --> 02:10:15,118
out of my comfort zone would have been

3730
02:10:14,158 --> 02:10:17,598
impossible

3731
02:10:15,118 --> 02:10:19,279
and in order to improve in life you need

3732
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:22,480
to get out of your comfort zone

3733
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:24,000
it's hard it's very hard to do and and

3734
02:10:22,479 --> 02:10:24,399
strive to be the person that you can

3735
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,118
love

3736
02:10:24,399 --> 02:10:29,198
i i does that's that's beautifully put

3737
02:10:27,118 --> 02:10:31,198
george if you were to give advice to a

3738
02:10:29,198 --> 02:10:34,319
young person today about life

3739
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:38,078
what would you tell him

3740
02:10:34,319 --> 02:10:42,238
if he takes

3741
02:10:38,078 --> 02:10:45,679
life with the same mentality

3742
02:10:42,238 --> 02:10:50,078
that i do if he has the same

3743
02:10:45,679 --> 02:10:53,118
taste of things that i have

3744
02:10:50,078 --> 02:10:56,000
i would tell him you know for for

3745
02:10:53,118 --> 02:10:57,439
for sport for life in general i would

3746
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,479
say

3747
02:10:57,439 --> 02:11:03,279
if you will have a dream

3748
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:03,279
you know like

3749
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:10,800
make everything in your power and work

3750

very hard you know never take no for an

3751
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:17,119
answer and go through hell

3752
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:17,118
in order to achieve it

3753
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:24,719
don't work hard only but work

3754
02:11:21,198 --> 02:11:25,439
smart that's i think the problems with a

3755
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:27,359
lot of

3756
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:28,799
people they work hard they can work hard

3757
02:11:27,359 --> 02:11:30,078
they burn themselves they don't work

3758
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:34,239
smart

3759
02:11:30,078 --> 02:11:37,359
whether it is in in science and business

3760
02:11:34,238 --> 02:11:38,479
they make bad choices or they are badly

3761
02:11:37,359 --> 02:11:41,598
informed

3762
02:11:38,479 --> 02:11:43,759
in sport how many guys i've seen ruin

3763
02:11:41,599 --> 02:11:46,560
their career in the gyms

3764
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:48,079
they they spar so hard they they ruined

3765
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:50,719
themselves in the gyms they leave their

3766
02:11:48,078 --> 02:11:52,479
career in the gyms

3767
02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:54,078
what i would say to for example because

3768
02:11:52,479 --> 02:11:57,359
my field of expertise and

3769
02:11:54,078 --> 02:12:00,399
it's in sport of mixed martial art

3770
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:04,158
i would say to you

3771
02:12:00,399 --> 02:12:08,479
young kid make your training

3772
02:12:04,158 --> 02:12:10,879
playful you know when you get ready for

3773
02:12:08,479 --> 02:12:13,198
for competition you need to trying to

3774
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:16,400
recreate those

3775
02:12:13,198 --> 02:12:17,839
elements that makes you go outside of

3776
02:12:16,399 --> 02:12:21,118
your comfort zone

3777
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:23,520
but in every days life in general

3778
02:12:21,118 --> 02:12:24,880
make your training playful don't makes

3779
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:27,360
it like a

3780
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:29,199
hardcore competition about who's who's

3781
02:12:27,359 --> 02:12:29,759
winning who's losing make make it

3782
02:12:29,198 --> 02:12:33,118
playful

3783
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:35,199
so it will increase

3784
02:12:33,118 --> 02:12:36,158
because your know you will not be afraid

3785
02:12:35,198 --> 02:12:39,359
of

3786
02:12:36,158 --> 02:12:43,519
getting hurt or losing

3787
02:12:39,359 --> 02:12:46,319
you will be tent to trying more things

3788
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:49,280
and be you it will make you become more

3789
02:12:46,319 --> 02:12:51,759
creative creative

3790
02:12:49,279 --> 02:12:53,039
you know that brings up another question

3791
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:56,239
about learning

3792
02:12:53,039 --> 02:12:59,920
so you you value knowledge and you're

3793
02:12:56,238 --> 02:13:00,559
exceptional at basically being very good

3794
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:03,118
at learning

3795
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:04,639
and figuring stuff out new things or

3796
02:13:03,118 --> 02:13:05,279
going deeper on the things you already

3797
02:13:04,639 --> 02:13:07,840
know

3798
02:13:05,279 --> 02:13:09,039
so what advice would you have for how to

3799
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:11,760
learn

3800
02:13:09,039 --> 02:13:13,198
effectively how you know you say work

3801
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:16,239
smart

3802
02:13:13,198 --> 02:13:16,719
how do you figure this game out i

3803
02:13:16,238 --> 02:13:20,078
believe

3804
02:13:16,719 --> 02:13:21,569
the best way to learn is learning from

3805
02:13:20,078 --> 02:13:24,639
other people's mistake

3806
02:13:21,569 --> 02:13:28,639
[Laughter]

3807
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:31,199
however i'm not perfect and i've learned

3808
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:35,199
from my mistakes as well and sometimes

3809
02:13:31,198 --> 02:13:38,479
i've i it took it took me a few mistakes

3810
02:13:35,198 --> 02:13:40,238
to learn the same thing but

3811
02:13:38,479 --> 02:13:42,799
especially in the sport of mixed martial

3812
02:13:40,238 --> 02:13:46,238
art because we're talking about

3813
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:49,440
the the failure could have very serious

3814
02:13:46,238 --> 02:13:53,759
uh outcome on someone's life

3815
02:13:49,439 --> 02:13:55,198
and well-being so it's crucial

3816
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:57,599
to trying to learn from other people's

3817
02:13:55,198 --> 02:14:01,439
mistakes do you study others

3818
02:13:57,599 --> 02:14:03,360
do every every fight i'm studying my

3819
02:14:01,439 --> 02:14:07,439
opponent and i've studied myself

3820
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:10,880
as well to know what

3821
02:14:07,439 --> 02:14:14,559
how my strength mix versus

3822
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:17,599
my opponent weaknesses and how can i

3823
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:19,599
make the fight go in a way that

3824
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:21,760
i'm taking my opponent outside of his

3825
02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:24,239
comfort zone

3826
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:25,679
very often people are good at studying

3827
02:14:24,238 --> 02:14:27,118
their opponent but they're not good at

3828
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:29,199
looking at themselves in the mirror and

3829
02:14:27,118 --> 02:14:32,319
knowing what they should do in order to

3830
02:14:29,198 --> 02:14:34,078
to maximize their their odds of success

3831
02:14:32,319 --> 02:14:37,599
right

3832
02:14:34,078 --> 02:14:40,238
that's why i always thought for me

3833
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:41,920
it was important to not be the best at

3834
02:14:40,238 --> 02:14:46,799
one thing

3835
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:50,319
but be very good at everything

3836
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:52,880
that's why i always seek advice

3837
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:53,679
advices from the best in every

3838
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:56,960
discipline

3839
02:14:53,679 --> 02:14:59,760
like i wrestle with the best wrestler i

3840
02:14:56,960 --> 02:15:00,639
i could be with i box with the best

3841
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:03,599

3842
02:15:00,639 --> 02:15:04,239
i practice karate with the best karate

3843
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:06,239
fighters

3844

uh same thing in jiu-jitsu i trained jiu

3845
02:15:06,238 --> 02:15:12,078
jitsu with the best

3846
02:15:07,599 --> 02:15:15,360
best jiu-jitsu guys however when i mix

3847
02:15:12,078 --> 02:15:17,759
everything and mix martial art

3848
02:15:15,359 --> 02:15:19,039
if i if i'm because i'm very confident

3849
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:22,159
in every areas

3850
02:15:19,039 --> 02:15:22,719
so when i'm fighting someone i'm very

3851
02:15:22,158 --> 02:15:26,078
good at

3852
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:27,520
and that the identifying where is the

3853
02:15:26,078 --> 02:15:29,679
less competent

3854
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:31,599
and i know for a fact that because i'm

3855
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:33,599
competent everywhere i can

3856
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:35,039
if i can bring the fight where he's

3857
02:15:33,599 --> 02:15:36,960
outside of his comfort zone

3858
02:15:35,039 --> 02:15:38,319
it increased my odds of winning there is

3859
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,639
no certainty

3860
02:15:38,319 --> 02:15:41,519
it's all about odds i believe because

3861
02:15:40,639 --> 02:15:43,760
there is always

3862
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:45,040
x factor that you do not control yeah

3863
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:45,679
it's fascinating to see you actually

3864
02:15:45,039 --> 02:15:48,719
because you've

3865
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:51,199
been a student of movement uh

3866
02:15:48,719 --> 02:15:52,960
you've been exploring all kinds i mean

3867
02:15:51,198 --> 02:15:55,919
gymnastics all that kind of stuff there

3868
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:58,239
there's something reminiscent to um

3869
02:15:55,920 --> 02:16:00,000
like uh conor mcgregor is one other

3870
02:15:58,238 --> 02:16:00,559
martial artist that's kind of explored

3871
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,439
movement

3872
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:05,119
been a scholar of movement um at least

3873
02:16:03,439 --> 02:16:07,198
from my perspective it's very sort of

3874
02:16:05,118 --> 02:16:09,679
bruce lee like

3875
02:16:07,198 --> 02:16:10,399
it's almost making a study of the human

3876
02:16:09,679 --> 02:16:12,239
body

3877
02:16:10,399 --> 02:16:13,679
and all the possible things you can do

3878
02:16:12,238 --> 02:16:15,598
is there a philosophy behind that that

3879
02:16:13,679 --> 02:16:19,118
you have

3880
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:19,119
you talk about bruce lee man

3881
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:25,440
he changes my my life too he was ahead

3882
02:16:24,078 --> 02:16:27,359
of his time

3883
02:16:25,439 --> 02:16:29,118
yeah incredible a lot of people talked

3884
02:16:27,359 --> 02:16:32,959
to me and asked me hey is brucy

3885
02:16:29,118 --> 02:16:35,279
would have been able to fight in ufc i

3886
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:36,318
look i don't think so you know i don't

3887
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:38,079
know

3888
02:16:36,318 --> 02:16:39,519
i think he was a you know he was a

3889
02:16:38,079 --> 02:16:40,638
martial artist he could have defended

3890
02:16:39,519 --> 02:16:42,318
himself but

3891
02:16:40,638 --> 02:16:43,679
to say that he could have compete in

3892
02:16:42,318 --> 02:16:46,239
amongst the elite

3893
02:16:43,679 --> 02:16:48,239
of the elite fighter perhaps in his time

3894
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:49,920
but if for sure if you put him in ufc

3895
02:16:48,239 --> 02:16:52,638
right now

3896
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:53,760
you know the sport hasn't improved

3897
02:16:52,638 --> 02:16:57,119
incredibly

3898
02:16:53,760 --> 02:17:00,159
since then but in terms of

3899
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:01,040
philosophy yeah bruce was amazing like

3900
02:17:00,159 --> 02:17:02,478
one thing that

3901
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:04,639
just to prove that he was ahead of his

3902
02:17:02,478 --> 02:17:06,638
time he was talking about using your

3903
02:17:04,638 --> 02:17:09,199
longest weapon against your opponent

3904
02:17:06,638 --> 02:17:09,759
nearest point and we see that that that

3905
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:14,000
kick that

3906
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:14,960
um it it got popular popularized by jon

3907
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,200
jones you know the

3908
02:17:14,959 --> 02:17:18,879
the sidekick to the time it's longest

3909
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:20,079
weapon against your nearest point in

3910
02:17:18,879 --> 02:17:22,558
boxing is the jab

3911
02:17:20,079 --> 02:17:23,120
but in mma when you can use it all your

3912
02:17:22,558 --> 02:17:26,398
weapon

3913
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:29,840
that's the kick to the tie

3914
02:17:26,398 --> 02:17:30,239
and there is i feel there is like kind

3915
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:32,639
of

3916
02:17:30,239 --> 02:17:34,718
three dimension in martial art there is

3917
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:37,279
the philosopher like bruce lee

3918
02:17:34,718 --> 02:17:38,558
there is the choreography the

3919
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:40,479
choreograph

3920
02:17:38,558 --> 02:17:42,000
people like for example you see in

3921
02:17:40,478 --> 02:17:44,079
movies the stunned people

3922
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:46,398
they're incredible like or the one that

3923
02:17:44,079 --> 02:17:48,478
does like forms and karate like

3924
02:17:46,398 --> 02:17:49,599
jumping spin kick bad kick like

3925
02:17:48,478 --> 02:17:52,159
acrobatic stuff

3926
02:17:49,599 --> 02:17:54,079
mixed martial art they are unbelievable

3927
02:17:52,159 --> 02:17:56,959
and there's also the the

3928
02:17:54,079 --> 02:17:58,799
the one that compete in in fighting like

3929
02:17:56,959 --> 02:18:01,759
that's what i do that i

3930
02:17:58,799 --> 02:18:03,039
personally specialize in well you also

3931
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:04,559
do the philosophy

3932
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:06,960
i do a little bit of philosophy but

3933
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:10,398
that's you know consequences

3934
02:18:06,959 --> 02:18:12,239
we are all i guess we are all ever like

3935
02:18:10,398 --> 02:18:14,558
we all practice the three dimension

3936
02:18:12,239 --> 02:18:17,359
because martial art is

3937
02:18:14,558 --> 02:18:18,879
i would say it's it whether you want it

3938
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:20,079
or not you have to touch these three

3939
02:18:18,879 --> 02:18:22,000
dimensions

3940
02:18:20,079 --> 02:18:24,159
but you will specialize in one i

3941
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:26,159
specialize to my life in

3942
02:18:24,159 --> 02:18:28,159
fighting like the real thing in terms of

3943
02:18:26,159 --> 02:18:30,159
fighting competition

3944
02:18:28,159 --> 02:18:31,519
and of course if you do martial art

3945
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:32,079
you'll be able to defend yourself

3946
02:18:31,519 --> 02:18:34,159
because

3947
02:18:32,079 --> 02:18:35,120
it's a self-defense however you might

3948
02:18:34,159 --> 02:18:37,519
not be able to fight

3949
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:39,040
as an elite and the most prestigious

3950
02:18:37,519 --> 02:18:41,280
organization

3951
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:42,719
and you might not be able to perform the

3952
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:45,519
stunt that

3953
02:18:42,718 --> 02:18:45,839
for example the stuntmen have done in in

3954
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:48,079
the

3955
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:49,200
the syriza was playing in the falcon and

3956
02:18:48,079 --> 02:18:51,039
winter soldier

3957
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:52,639
these guys are incredible they're like

3958
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:56,319
real life superhero

3959
02:18:52,638 --> 02:18:58,959
things they do it's to me like it's

3960
02:18:56,318 --> 02:19:01,039
it's fascinating it's amazing and also

3961
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:04,159
bruce lee the philosophy

3962
02:19:01,040 --> 02:19:07,120
how many hours he he

3963
02:19:04,159 --> 02:19:08,879
took like thinking about this stuff you

3964
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:09,120
know i'm sure he did not just came out

3965
02:19:08,879 --> 02:19:11,199
of

3966
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:12,559
out of nowhere you know like he was

3967
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:15,920
thinking like that's mean he

3968
02:19:12,558 --> 02:19:18,079
slept on on this he

3969
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:19,519
how many hours it's just unbelievable

3970
02:19:18,079 --> 02:19:21,039
he's like water my friend

3971
02:19:19,519 --> 02:19:22,719
exactly how many times has he thought

3972
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:25,040
about water going to bed

3973
02:19:22,718 --> 02:19:26,799
yeah before he said that uh well let me

3974
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:28,160
ask a very important fundamental

3975
02:19:26,799 --> 02:19:28,638
question about martial arts we're both

3976
02:19:28,159 --> 02:19:31,920
wearing

3977
02:19:28,638 --> 02:19:34,879
a suit and tie uh joe rogan thinks that

3978
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:37,200
wearing a tie is a huge disadvantage

3979
02:19:34,879 --> 02:19:39,679
is it a clip-on or is it an actual tie

3980
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:42,159
are you controlled by another one

3981
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:43,599
so do you agree or disagree with joe

3982
02:19:42,159 --> 02:19:47,039
rogan that wearing a tie

3983
02:19:43,599 --> 02:19:48,960
is a is a martial art

3984
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:51,520
significant disadvantage in terms of

3985
02:19:48,959 --> 02:19:53,039
combat in a combat scenario

3986
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:54,960
in a fight i think it would be a

3987
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:57,920
dissonant disadvantage

3988
02:19:54,959 --> 02:19:58,559
yes okay but i i work as a as a security

3989
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:01,120
bouncer

3990
02:19:58,559 --> 02:20:01,680
in nightclubs and event when i was 18

3991
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:04,720
years old

3992
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:06,800
yes and um

3993
02:20:04,719 --> 02:20:09,279
sometime i had to work in certain event

3994
02:20:06,799 --> 02:20:13,358
that i was in suit and tie

3995
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:15,359
i never had to use

3996
02:20:13,359 --> 02:20:16,880
my force to take someone out when i

3997
02:20:15,359 --> 02:20:19,680
wasn't super untie

3998
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:20,959
but if i would have had to before going

3999
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:22,960
to the table to

4000
02:20:20,959 --> 02:20:24,478
physically take that out i would have

4001
02:20:22,959 --> 02:20:26,239
removed my tie

4002
02:20:24,478 --> 02:20:27,840
and i would have removed my vest for

4003
02:20:26,239 --> 02:20:30,159
sure and i would have called back

4004
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:32,799
up for sure and i would have probably

4005
02:20:30,159 --> 02:20:36,000
used the element of surprise to

4006
02:20:32,799 --> 02:20:38,000
be first on the guy yes uh

4007
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,520
when you're in a bar same thing you call

4008
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:41,520
back up first

4009
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:43,439
and and and you make sure you ask the

4010
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:44,079
way the waitress before to clean the

4011
02:20:43,439 --> 02:20:47,120
table

4012
02:20:44,079 --> 02:20:48,959
before you go yeah and when you go

4013
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:51,280
you have to use the element of surprise

4014
02:20:48,959 --> 02:20:52,799
yeah because fighting

4015
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:55,760
fighting that makes martial and fighting

4016
02:20:52,799 --> 02:20:59,039
in the street it's two different things

4017
02:20:55,760 --> 02:21:00,800
and yes i'm a mix i'm a mixed martial

4018
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:02,560
art competitor that's what i've done all

4019
02:21:00,799 --> 02:21:03,358
my life but i had a lot of street fight

4020
02:21:02,559 --> 02:21:04,799
in my life

4021
02:21:03,359 --> 02:21:06,479
a lot when i wasn't what's the

4022
02:21:04,799 --> 02:21:06,879
difference what's like the oh my god

4023
02:21:06,478 --> 02:21:10,398
it's

4024
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:13,519
a huge difference there is guys that

4025
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:14,159
if i would have a choice you know to

4026
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:16,560
fight

4027
02:21:14,159 --> 02:21:18,398
like for example certain guys and you

4028
02:21:16,559 --> 02:21:20,159
have seen a street fight and fight

4029
02:21:18,398 --> 02:21:21,760
like other guys that are not in ufc i

4030
02:21:20,159 --> 02:21:23,520
would maybe sometimes

4031
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:25,520
pick guys that are not in ufc not

4032
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:27,120
necessarily because in in

4033
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:29,040
in a street fight there's no referee

4034
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:30,800
that says go it's the element of

4035
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:32,880
surprise and when you're a nice guy

4036
02:21:30,799 --> 02:21:35,119
you're not the aggressor

4037
02:21:32,879 --> 02:21:37,119
you always have the element of surprise

4038
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:40,640
that's what it taught me oh interesting

4039
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:43,280
yes because if aggression in your second

4040
02:21:40,639 --> 02:21:44,559
person will not come punch you without

4041
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:46,640
warning it needs

4042
02:21:44,559 --> 02:21:48,000
to it needs to trigger some it's

4043
02:21:46,639 --> 02:21:51,279
something need to be triggered

4044
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:53,040
before so if someone comes because it's

4045
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:54,479
looking for trouble

4046
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:56,880
there's a sign that is looking for

4047
02:21:54,478 --> 02:21:58,879
trouble so i was

4048
02:21:56,879 --> 02:22:00,799
just talking with fast food on this

4049
02:21:58,879 --> 02:22:04,159
weekend about it and i saw that

4050
02:22:00,799 --> 02:22:05,679
every every martial art yeah comes from

4051
02:22:04,159 --> 02:22:08,318
like some martial arts are from

4052
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:11,280
exclusive week for competition yes

4053
02:22:08,318 --> 02:22:12,398
like sport karate uh like certain

4054
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:15,439
martial art

4055
02:22:12,398 --> 02:22:16,000
but traditional martial art are for the

4056
02:22:15,439 --> 02:22:18,559
street

4057
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:20,478
are for self defense and i start my

4058
02:22:18,559 --> 02:22:22,559
background in kyokushin karate so it's

4059
02:22:20,478 --> 02:22:25,438
for and and i did japanese jiu jitsu so

4060
02:22:22,559 --> 02:22:26,719
my background before i even start

4061
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:29,760
training for mixed martial art my

4062
02:22:26,719 --> 02:22:31,358
background is in self defense

4063
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:32,800
and it's very important to understand

4064
02:22:31,359 --> 02:22:34,559
that in a street fight

4065
02:22:32,799 --> 02:22:36,559
the element of surprise is everything

4066
02:22:34,559 --> 02:22:39,199
and there are no rules you can go for

4067
02:22:36,559 --> 02:22:42,478
the eyes the next the the

4068
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:43,600
surprises everything total ball game you

4069
02:22:42,478 --> 02:22:46,559
know what i mean you have the

4070
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:46,960
the chair the beard there's so much more

4071
02:22:46,559 --> 02:22:50,239
thing

4072
02:22:46,959 --> 02:22:52,159
going on so the idea of because

4073
02:22:50,239 --> 02:22:53,280
you are a ufc fighter you think you're

4074
02:22:52,159 --> 02:22:57,039
invincible this is

4075
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:58,479
bs anybody can come like if if a big guy

4076
02:22:57,040 --> 02:23:00,000
who punched very hard

4077
02:22:58,478 --> 02:23:01,119
most people don't know how to punch by

4078
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,639
the way they don't know how to make a

4079
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:03,200
fist and throw it in a forward direction

4080
02:23:02,639 --> 02:23:05,680
but if

4081
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:06,960
someone knows how to do it i don't care

4082
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:08,880
who you are if you could be

4083
02:23:06,959 --> 02:23:10,239
francis and genu someone come behind

4084
02:23:08,879 --> 02:23:13,279
your head and

4085
02:23:10,239 --> 02:23:14,478
whang or there's an argument and you get

4086
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:16,159
surprised by a punch

4087
02:23:14,478 --> 02:23:17,519
you can beat you up and lose a fight

4088
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:19,520
that doesn't matter

4089
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:21,200
yeah the element of surprise is

4090
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:22,640
everything so you were saying remove

4091
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:24,960
all the sources of the elements the

4092
02:23:22,639 --> 02:23:26,879
surprise all the clear the bar

4093
02:23:24,959 --> 02:23:29,919
remove the tie i still disagree with you

4094
02:23:26,879 --> 02:23:29,920
about the tablet and

4095
02:23:30,478 --> 02:23:34,239
just for your information if someone

4096
02:23:32,879 --> 02:23:36,079
comes

4097
02:23:34,239 --> 02:23:38,079
looking for trouble and you see me do

4098
02:23:36,079 --> 02:23:40,478
this

4099
02:23:38,079 --> 02:23:41,200
and and going sideways yeah that's my

4100
02:23:40,478 --> 02:23:42,959
position

4101
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:44,399
that i'm i'm thinking there you go maybe

4102
02:23:42,959 --> 02:23:46,959
something will happen and i'm

4103
02:23:44,398 --> 02:23:46,959
about that's

4104
02:23:52,159 --> 02:23:55,600
see to flip the table on you then

4105
02:23:54,159 --> 02:23:58,478
wearing a tie

4106
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:58,800
is communicating the nice guy image so

4107
02:23:58,478 --> 02:24:00,639
it

4108
02:23:58,799 --> 02:24:02,000
actually gives you the freedom for more

4109
02:24:00,639 --> 02:24:04,318
elements of surprise

4110
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,840
by wearing the tie if you take it off

4111
02:24:04,318 --> 02:24:08,079
that's more

4112
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:09,520
you're limiting your options because

4113
02:24:08,079 --> 02:24:10,959
nobody's going to expect the guy in the

4114
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:14,079
tie to do anything

4115
02:24:10,959 --> 02:24:15,199
i'm a big believer that sometimes it's

4116
02:24:14,079 --> 02:24:18,239
not only

4117
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:21,120
materialism it's what you project

4118
02:24:18,239 --> 02:24:23,439
that's true like i had troubles in a bar

4119
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:25,120
and i was able to deflect

4120
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:27,040
the guy was looking for trouble talking

4121
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:29,359
to me and i was able to deflect his

4122
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:30,880
whole aggressivity by saying like

4123
02:24:29,359 --> 02:24:33,280
hey man that's a nice shirt where did

4124
02:24:30,879 --> 02:24:34,000
you get it like saying like something

4125
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:36,800
was

4126
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:37,280
stupid like this then it it kind of

4127
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:39,519
break

4128
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:40,880
break the momentum and he you know but

4129
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:42,960
the guy was looking for trouble

4130
02:24:40,879 --> 02:24:45,920
i don't want to fight you i don't want

4131
02:24:42,959 --> 02:24:48,719
to fight you but i'm not going to wait

4132
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:49,920
until you pull you make the first move

4133
02:24:48,719 --> 02:24:52,079
because the first

4134
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:54,398
the minute you you touch me you push me

4135
02:24:52,079 --> 02:24:56,879
or you you touch me you declare war and

4136
02:24:54,398 --> 02:24:58,639
the war is unleashed my friend and i'm

4137
02:24:56,879 --> 02:25:01,279
i'm taking you out of order

4138
02:24:58,639 --> 02:25:02,799
with the necessary force of course you

4139
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:05,439
know i mean that's

4140
02:25:02,799 --> 02:25:07,438
the thing with martial art if you use

4141
02:25:05,439 --> 02:25:08,479
the necessary force to take out a

4142
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:11,280
problem

4143
02:25:08,478 --> 02:25:12,879
it's okay but if you you know you you

4144
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:15,040
take advantage of it that's when it's

4145
02:25:12,879 --> 02:25:17,759
not all right because it's a weapon

4146
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:18,479
so if someone comes up to me that's my

4147
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:21,200
position and

4148
02:25:18,478 --> 02:25:22,239
now i'm i'm assessing the situation you

4149
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:24,000
know

4150
02:25:22,239 --> 02:25:26,318
that's that's how they teach in self

4151
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:29,600
defense here never put your hands down

4152
02:25:26,318 --> 02:25:30,719
i wasn't there because i'm brown or boom

4153
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:33,359
like like what

4154
02:25:30,719 --> 02:25:34,398
this is this is very important and you

4155
02:25:33,359 --> 02:25:36,159
never

4156
02:25:34,398 --> 02:25:38,079
you always your center line on the side

4157
02:25:36,159 --> 02:25:40,719
ah yeah like this

4158
02:25:38,079 --> 02:25:42,079
if someone knows martial art he will

4159
02:25:40,719 --> 02:25:43,679
recognize that pattern

4160
02:25:42,079 --> 02:25:45,280
but if you go like if someone talk to

4161
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:47,280
you and you go like this

4162
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:48,399
that's mean you're telling the guy that

4163
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:49,680
you want to fight you don't want to do

4164
02:25:48,398 --> 02:25:52,719
that you don't want to oh yeah

4165
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:53,120
um that's that's interesting you know

4166
02:25:52,719 --> 02:25:55,039
that's

4167
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:56,880
that's the position because your hands

4168
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:57,600
are here you know whatever you can do

4169
02:25:56,879 --> 02:26:01,039
you're here

4170
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:02,800
well also your ear tells the story

4171
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:04,160
it's not everybody that knows that

4172
02:26:02,799 --> 02:26:06,000
however it some people

4173
02:26:04,159 --> 02:26:07,439
might think that it's my mom grabbed me

4174
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:09,280
by the air and pulled me because i

4175
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:11,280
didn't listen to her you know

4176
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:12,479
a real fight in the stream and a fight

4177
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:15,120
in in mixed martial

4178
02:26:12,478 --> 02:26:16,239
is a different ball game what do you

4179
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:18,079
think is the best

4180
02:26:16,239 --> 02:26:19,920
martial art to prepare you for street

4181
02:26:18,079 --> 02:26:21,920
fighting you know people often kind of

4182
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:24,239
have this discussion of jiu jitsu maybe

4183
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:26,159
boxing maybe wrestling

4184
02:26:24,239 --> 02:26:27,920
do you think when you talk about a young

4185
02:26:26,159 --> 02:26:28,879
person studying martial arts to prepare

4186
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:32,159
themselves

4187
02:26:28,879 --> 02:26:33,679
for um a street fight it's often

4188
02:26:32,159 --> 02:26:35,920
much different than a mixed martial art

4189
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:37,760
fight and

4190
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:39,840
i know there's a lot of bs in the world

4191
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:40,159
of martial art like self defense stuff

4192
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:44,639
that

4193
02:26:40,159 --> 02:26:47,280
like but i believe

4194
02:26:44,639 --> 02:26:48,398
self defense is is very important in a

4195
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:52,560
way to understand

4196
02:26:48,398 --> 02:26:52,559
the the situation to understand those

4197
02:26:52,879 --> 02:26:57,599
those situations that might accurate how

4198
02:26:56,719 --> 02:27:00,879
to deal with it

4199
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:02,800
because not necessarily the the

4200
02:27:00,879 --> 02:27:05,199
we talk about the technicality we talk

4201
02:27:02,799 --> 02:27:07,039
about the tacticality the tactics

4202
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:08,960
you know like when i'm talking to you

4203
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:10,479
about the element of surprise it's

4204
02:27:08,959 --> 02:27:12,719
important this is not technique a

4205
02:27:10,478 --> 02:27:15,679
technique is a punch or or

4206
02:27:12,719 --> 02:27:16,318
techniques that i physically will use to

4207
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:19,840
enable

4208
02:27:16,318 --> 02:27:21,600
my my my opponent my my aggressor

4209
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:23,359
tactic is the tactic i'm telling you

4210
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:25,040
about is in a street fight

4211
02:27:23,359 --> 02:27:27,680
if someone is looking for trouble and i

4212
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:29,200
feel the heat rising as the conversation

4213
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:30,398
goes that's the position i'm gonna take

4214
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:33,600
and

4215
02:27:30,398 --> 02:27:36,079
i have to be first i cannot let him

4216
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:37,680
go first so i have to strike first or do

4217
02:27:36,079 --> 02:27:41,600
something this is the first thing

4218
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:44,720
that generally and i have to to

4219
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:46,559
to agree on um

4220
02:27:44,719 --> 02:27:48,079
after that of course there is the the

4221
02:27:46,559 --> 02:27:48,559
knowledge if you're a professional

4222
02:27:48,079 --> 02:27:52,079
fighter

4223
02:27:48,559 --> 02:27:54,239
you have a huge advantage once the fight

4224
02:27:52,079 --> 02:27:58,079
is started the war is declared now it's

4225
02:27:54,239 --> 02:27:59,760
everything goes but generally speaking

4226
02:27:58,079 --> 02:28:01,439
the person that will

4227
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:02,880
intervene physically that will have the

4228
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:05,920
first blower the first

4229
02:28:02,879 --> 02:28:08,478
you know the first punch will

4230
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:10,398
have a huge this use advantage it's like

4231
02:28:08,478 --> 02:28:11,039
doing a 100 meter raise and having a

4232
02:28:10,398 --> 02:28:12,639
head start

4233
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:14,800
you know and and that you don't you

4234
02:28:12,639 --> 02:28:16,398
can't prepare for with any martial arts

4235
02:28:14,799 --> 02:28:19,279
yeah and if i'm a smart guy

4236
02:28:16,398 --> 02:28:21,279
i know how to fight if a guy like an

4237
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:24,399
heavyweight champion comes to me or

4238
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:27,359
like like like a you know i know i know

4239
02:28:24,398 --> 02:28:27,920
what to do to this this ebola like boom

4240
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:30,800
or

4241
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:31,920
hair and or the neck you know like and

4242
02:28:30,799 --> 02:28:33,599
if you

4243
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:35,520
if you blind them what is it going to do

4244
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:37,920
you know what i mean so so

4245
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:39,280
or a bottle you know what i mean so so

4246
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:41,520
the element of surprise

4247
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:43,200
is it's everything so that's why it's

4248
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:44,800
always

4249
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:46,000
always good to be the nice guy and not

4250
02:28:44,799 --> 02:28:47,358
looking for trouble because if you're

4251
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,639
not looking for trouble

4252
02:28:47,359 --> 02:28:50,399
you have the head start you have the

4253
02:28:48,639 --> 02:28:51,920
option of having a head start

4254
02:28:50,398 --> 02:28:53,358
so what you're saying is being a nice

4255
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:54,079
guy is the is the best form of

4256
02:28:53,359 --> 02:28:57,200
self-defense

4257
02:28:54,079 --> 02:28:58,318
maybe a little humor yeah you know

4258
02:28:57,200 --> 02:29:01,520
i have learned that i've learned that

4259
02:28:58,318 --> 02:29:05,039
when i was a kid yeah i was about

4260
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:06,479
maybe seven six six years old we used to

4261
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:08,080
to play in montreal there's a lot of

4262
02:29:06,478 --> 02:29:09,519
snow we used to play king of the

4263
02:29:08,079 --> 02:29:11,520
mountain yeah

4264
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:13,359
that's the first combat lesson that i've

4265
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:15,040
learned in my life

4266
02:29:13,359 --> 02:29:16,800
and i managed somehow it was a lot of

4267
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:18,240
kid i managed to get on the top of the

4268
02:29:16,799 --> 02:29:20,239
mountain and uh

4269
02:29:18,239 --> 02:29:22,799
another guy came come in on top of the

4270
02:29:20,239 --> 02:29:25,119
mountain and he was angry that before

4271
02:29:22,799 --> 02:29:26,159
i was there before him when you played

4272
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:29,120
king of the

4273
02:29:26,159 --> 02:29:30,799
mountain it was a mountain of snow you

4274
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:32,800
don't strike each other we just

4275
02:29:30,799 --> 02:29:35,119
wrestle and push and i managed to be

4276
02:29:32,799 --> 02:29:37,840
first and when he came

4277
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:38,720
he says to me say okay you wanna you

4278
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:40,478
wanna fight

4279
02:29:38,719 --> 02:29:42,159
and i said yeah i don't know what it

4280
02:29:40,478 --> 02:29:43,599
means like i wanna fight you wanna

4281
02:29:42,159 --> 02:29:46,799
wrestle you say i i say

4282
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:49,520
yes he punched me right in the face

4283
02:29:46,799 --> 02:29:51,119
boom and then i and then i fall on on

4284
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:53,920
the bottom of the mountain but

4285
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:55,920
then i when i fall down i remember that

4286
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:58,239
vision in my life because it it it's

4287
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:59,280
it's i will remember that for the rest

4288
02:29:58,239 --> 02:30:01,520
of my life

4289
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:03,359
i'm about to stand up and i see the

4290
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:06,640
blood coming out of my nose see the the

4291
02:30:03,359 --> 02:30:09,359
snow is red because my nose is bleeding

4292
02:30:06,639 --> 02:30:10,239
now i i remember the element of

4293
02:30:09,359 --> 02:30:13,040
surprises

4294
02:30:10,239 --> 02:30:13,600
everything my first street fight i've

4295
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:15,680
lost

4296
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:18,079
i got i didn't get knocked out but i i

4297
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:20,559
got dropped on the bottom of the

4298
02:30:18,079 --> 02:30:21,120
snow mountain and i was like uh he got

4299
02:30:20,559 --> 02:30:23,119
me because

4300
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:24,880
i was not expecting my hand i was not

4301
02:30:23,120 --> 02:30:27,840
expecting a punch

4302
02:30:24,879 --> 02:30:28,478
so from there when i felt the the the

4303
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:30,719
eat

4304
02:30:28,478 --> 02:30:33,199
of an in during an argument or something

4305
02:30:30,719 --> 02:30:34,959
was not right i always stroke first

4306
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:36,319
i didn't win all my fight because

4307
02:30:34,959 --> 02:30:40,318
sometimes there were more than

4308
02:30:36,318 --> 02:30:43,119
one guys on on me you know but

4309
02:30:40,318 --> 02:30:44,959
i think it's important to not be the

4310
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:45,680
aggressor so you have the element of

4311
02:30:44,959 --> 02:30:47,438
surprise

4312
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:49,040
and i always use that in your favor

4313
02:30:47,439 --> 02:30:51,280
that's so brilliant

4314
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:52,560
let me uh go from the very practical to

4315
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:54,560
the the most

4316
02:30:52,559 --> 02:30:55,840
impractically huge question about the

4317
02:30:54,559 --> 02:30:59,600
meaning of life

4318
02:30:55,840 --> 02:31:02,239
you said that uh when great depths

4319
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:04,720
of unrelenting sorrow punctuated by

4320
02:31:02,239 --> 02:31:08,639
great peaks of joy and liberation

4321
02:31:04,719 --> 02:31:09,920
the result is delicious so uh

4322
02:31:08,639 --> 02:31:12,398
what do you think is the meaning of this

4323
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:16,239
whole journey that we're on

4324
02:31:12,398 --> 02:31:19,439
this life what makes life delicious

4325
02:31:16,239 --> 02:31:22,799
to me you know

4326
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:26,239
satisfaction is the end for me

4327
02:31:22,799 --> 02:31:28,398
like like i always if i'm satisfied

4328
02:31:26,239 --> 02:31:29,359
that's mean i have no nothing to live

4329
02:31:28,398 --> 02:31:31,199
for

4330
02:31:29,359 --> 02:31:33,200
i'm talking i'm not talking only about

4331
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:33,520
my career about talking about my life

4332
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:35,200
what

4333
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:36,880
what do you want in your life you want

4334
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:38,399
you want kids you want a family

4335
02:31:36,879 --> 02:31:40,159
you want to be champion what do you want

4336
02:31:38,398 --> 02:31:40,559
in your life you have like a long-term

4337
02:31:40,159 --> 02:31:43,840
goal

4338
02:31:40,559 --> 02:31:43,840
short-term goal

4339
02:31:44,799 --> 02:31:48,398
in mixed martial art i achieved what i

4340
02:31:46,639 --> 02:31:51,279
needed to achieve

4341
02:31:48,398 --> 02:31:53,039
i'm sad cespar i'm no longer the same

4342
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:55,680
josh schneider than when i was on

4343
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:59,200
begging for a title shot on my knees

4344
02:31:55,680 --> 02:32:02,239
i move on for it from it

4345
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:06,800
now i had a chance to go into movies

4346
02:32:02,239 --> 02:32:12,079
now that same insane

4347
02:32:06,799 --> 02:32:13,679
that same insane drive that i had to be

4348
02:32:12,079 --> 02:32:15,840
the champion in the world now i put it

4349
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:17,280
into acting like i'm having a lot of

4350
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:20,559
acting class now and

4351
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:20,880
luckily for me the timing was amazing i

4352
02:32:20,559 --> 02:32:23,279
got

4353
02:32:20,879 --> 02:32:24,079
i got casper the the falcon and the

4354
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:27,200
winter soldier

4355
02:32:24,079 --> 02:32:30,719
was that is on disney plus channel

4356
02:32:27,200 --> 02:32:33,840
it's a huge huge project to be part of

4357
02:32:30,719 --> 02:32:35,438
for me because it's like

4358
02:32:33,840 --> 02:32:37,680
you play basketball you have a chance to

4359
02:32:35,439 --> 02:32:38,639
go for the nba right away i was very

4360
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:42,318
lucky

4361
02:32:38,639 --> 02:32:45,519
the timing was just too perfect and so

4362
02:32:42,318 --> 02:32:48,000
you need to constantly challenging

4363
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:50,239
yourself and having goals to achieve

4364
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:51,200
you know like that keep your brain

4365
02:32:50,239 --> 02:32:54,799
activated

4366
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:55,600
i keep working and the proof of that is

4367
02:32:54,799 --> 02:32:58,879
that

4368
02:32:55,600 --> 02:33:01,359
you see sometimes some old people

4369
02:32:58,879 --> 02:33:02,959
like when they retire very often

4370
02:33:01,359 --> 02:33:03,520
sometimes you see that they they got

4371
02:33:02,959 --> 02:33:07,199
sick and

4372
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:08,960
they die or because they they

4373
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:11,520
it's either because sometimes we think

4374
02:33:08,959 --> 02:33:11,519
we we

4375
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:18,079
we certainly make benefits we do

4376
02:33:14,799 --> 02:33:20,000
something good for them by

4377
02:33:18,079 --> 02:33:21,600
making not work and giving them a break

4378
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:23,680
so in our mind we're like oh it's gonna

4379
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:26,159
be able to relax

4380
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:27,600
but in their mind it's not good because

4381
02:33:26,159 --> 02:33:28,239
they're not busy they have nothing to

4382
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:30,880
live for like

4383
02:33:28,239 --> 02:33:33,199
like my dad is used to work all the time

4384
02:33:30,879 --> 02:33:36,879
and he has always something to do

4385
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:39,280
is retire now i myself now

4386
02:33:36,879 --> 02:33:40,719
call him by force to find him some job

4387
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:43,359
hey dad okay

4388
02:33:40,719 --> 02:33:44,959
can you come in my house have this thing

4389
02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:45,920
to repair i don't know how to do it so

4390
02:33:44,959 --> 02:33:48,959
he gives him

4391
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:50,398
it gives him a reason not not to live on

4392
02:33:48,959 --> 02:33:51,358
because he has other things to do but

4393
02:33:50,398 --> 02:33:54,398
but

4394
02:33:51,359 --> 02:33:54,880
what i mean is also in life i think you

4395
02:33:54,398 --> 02:33:58,159
always

4396
02:33:54,879 --> 02:34:00,879
don't be afraid to aim high don't

4397
02:33:58,159 --> 02:34:01,680
don't be afraid to fix your objective

4398
02:34:00,879 --> 02:34:04,478
very high

4399
02:34:01,680 --> 02:34:06,000
and never be able to reach it be afraid

4400
02:34:04,478 --> 02:34:07,679
of reaching your goals essentially i

4401
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:10,239
mean you always have to keep moving it

4402
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:11,920
out you think there's a it's an

4403
02:34:10,239 --> 02:34:14,639
interesting question because you've been

4404
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:16,239
acting in some really exciting things do

4405
02:34:14,639 --> 02:34:19,920
you think there's a

4406
02:34:16,239 --> 02:34:22,478
a dramatic role where it's basically

4407
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:23,280
you know you go full robert de niro and

4408
02:34:22,478 --> 02:34:25,358
taxi

4409
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:27,680
uh driver is do you think there'll be a

4410
02:34:25,359 --> 02:34:31,280
full length feature film with george st

4411
02:34:27,680 --> 02:34:31,680
pierre i liken there's level to this

4412
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:34,159
thing

4413
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:35,520
i'm aware that i have to restart as a

4414
02:34:34,159 --> 02:34:37,039
white belt

4415
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:40,000
and for some people it could be

4416
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:40,880
discouraging but for me man it's great i

4417
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:43,040
love it

4418
02:34:40,879 --> 02:34:44,478
i freaking love it i embrace it because

4419
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:46,160
everybody told me like

4420
02:34:44,478 --> 02:34:49,119
i would never be able to do it and it's

4421
02:34:46,159 --> 02:34:52,318
fine but

4422
02:34:49,120 --> 02:34:54,479
the and also the outcome of a failure

4423
02:34:52,318 --> 02:34:55,600
in the sport of mixed martial art is

4424
02:34:54,478 --> 02:34:59,039
much more

4425
02:34:55,600 --> 02:35:00,479
serious than the outcome of a failure

4426
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:02,560
for a movie for example

4427
02:35:00,478 --> 02:35:04,318
for for if you zig when you shoot zag in

4428
02:35:02,559 --> 02:35:06,079
a fight you get knocked out if you zig

4429
02:35:04,318 --> 02:35:09,920
when you shoot zagging on set

4430
02:35:06,079 --> 02:35:14,079
oh cut we'll do it again and

4431
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:17,600
i know that i will be most likely

4432
02:35:14,079 --> 02:35:19,840
be choosing for action martial art

4433
02:35:17,600 --> 02:35:21,920
roles because that's my background there

4434
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:23,760
is this new trend in hollywood now when

4435
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:25,200
they want someone to play

4436
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:27,760
an italian guy they're going gonna

4437
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:29,359
choose a real italian person

4438
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:31,200
when they want someone to play a russian

4439
02:35:29,359 --> 02:35:31,600
guy they're gonna choose someone who has

4440
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:34,800
a real

4441
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:37,680
russian background now they want a real

4442
02:35:34,799 --> 02:35:39,199
martial art fighter i've done fighting

4443
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:41,200
all my life i just need to improve my

4444
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:44,640
acting skill

4445
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:47,120
but when i train in acting i get myself

4446
02:35:44,639 --> 02:35:48,799
out of my comfort zone i'm not playing a

4447
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:50,160
role of a martial argument i'm playing

4448
02:35:48,799 --> 02:35:54,000
like romance

4449
02:35:50,159 --> 02:35:57,280
comedy drama so when i go on set and

4450
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:59,680
playing the role of uh

4451
02:35:57,280 --> 02:36:00,640
of a badass martial art guy it's it's

4452
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:02,880
easier so

4453
02:36:00,639 --> 02:36:03,760
like in training for a fight i always

4454
02:36:02,879 --> 02:36:08,000
make my

4455
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:10,159
preparation harder than the actual

4456
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:11,680
task i would love to see where i don't

4457
02:36:10,159 --> 02:36:13,039
know if you've seen the wrestler with uh

4458
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:15,280
mickey work

4459
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:16,479
oh yeah those types of films i would

4460
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:18,399
love to uh

4461
02:36:16,478 --> 02:36:20,159
i would love to you do something like

4462
02:36:18,398 --> 02:36:22,639
that if not now

4463
02:36:20,159 --> 02:36:23,920
then in 10 20 years i could see that

4464
02:36:22,639 --> 02:36:25,599
that would be amazing

4465
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:27,040
there's levels to the game right yes

4466
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:29,120
it's gradual and i don't

4467
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:30,800
and i'm aware that i i don't want to

4468
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:32,399
take something on my shoulder that i

4469
02:36:30,799 --> 02:36:33,920
won't be able to deliver

4470
02:36:32,398 --> 02:36:36,318
it's like a fighter wants to go for a

4471
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:38,799
title shot right away could it could

4472
02:36:36,318 --> 02:36:40,079
very well break him you know what i'm

4473
02:36:38,799 --> 02:36:41,199
and i don't want to do that because i

4474
02:36:40,079 --> 02:36:43,680
know

4475
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:46,159
i've done some gigs in the past but i

4476
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:49,040
was not focusing on it because i was

4477
02:36:46,159 --> 02:36:50,719
focusing on competing as a martial art

4478
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:53,520
martial artist and competition

4479
02:36:50,719 --> 02:36:54,719
in mma but now i take it very seriously

4480
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:56,239
so i cannot

4481
02:36:54,719 --> 02:36:57,760
do the same mistake again because i've

4482
02:36:56,239 --> 02:36:58,959
done some stuff i've done it for the

4483
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:02,000
money and it was

4484
02:36:58,959 --> 02:37:03,839
good it was fun to to to be beat up by

4485
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:06,478
jacob van damme

4486
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:08,478
and everything but but my acting was not

4487
02:37:06,478 --> 02:37:10,318
on point you know at that time

4488
02:37:08,478 --> 02:37:12,239
so if i ever every time i'm gonna come

4489
02:37:10,318 --> 02:37:15,359
back from now on on

4490
02:37:12,239 --> 02:37:17,119
on screen you need to be sharp because

4491
02:37:15,359 --> 02:37:19,439
you cannot mess it up if you mess it up

4492
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:21,280
it's like a loss on your record you're

4493
02:37:19,439 --> 02:37:25,200
not taken seriously

4494
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:25,200
so so that's how i see it and

4495
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:29,439
it's very fun because i i had a chance

4496
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:31,359
to talk to a lot of guys and on top of

4497
02:37:29,439 --> 02:37:34,079
all the class that i'm having

4498
02:37:31,359 --> 02:37:35,840
like a few days ago i was with danny

4499
02:37:34,079 --> 02:37:38,639
trujo

4500
02:37:35,840 --> 02:37:39,120
and i i always seek the advice of actors

4501
02:37:38,639 --> 02:37:40,799
when i

4502
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:42,800
when i see some of them that because i

4503
02:37:40,799 --> 02:37:44,478
really admire how they do you know how

4504
02:37:42,799 --> 02:37:46,159
they project their emotion and i asked

4505
02:37:44,478 --> 02:37:48,478
him danny true i said

4506
02:37:46,159 --> 02:37:50,239
i said to him he is an amazing guy by

4507
02:37:48,478 --> 02:37:53,199
the way very nice guy

4508
02:37:50,239 --> 02:37:55,119
and i asked him i say him how how do you

4509
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:57,680
do to be

4510
02:37:55,120 --> 02:37:58,880
because you scared the hell out of me

4511
02:37:57,680 --> 02:38:02,800
how do you do

4512
02:37:58,879 --> 02:38:04,318
to be so scary like what is your trick

4513
02:38:02,799 --> 02:38:07,840
and he tells me he's like george if

4514
02:38:04,318 --> 02:38:10,719
you're threatening if you threat someone

4515
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:12,159
and you scream at him i'm gonna kill you

4516
02:38:10,719 --> 02:38:14,879
wherever

4517
02:38:12,159 --> 02:38:16,639
it's not as scary if you're smiling and

4518
02:38:14,879 --> 02:38:20,159
you say

4519
02:38:16,639 --> 02:38:20,959
i'm gonna kill you like and he says also

4520
02:38:20,159 --> 02:38:23,119
to me that

4521
02:38:20,959 --> 02:38:25,039
another advice he gave me is like when

4522
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:28,319
you say this

4523
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:29,840
think about you killing him for real

4524
02:38:28,318 --> 02:38:31,519
that how you hate him and how you're

4525
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:34,880
gonna kill him so the

4526
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:36,880
camera will take the emotion out

4527
02:38:34,879 --> 02:38:38,719
don't try physically to do that that's

4528
02:38:36,879 --> 02:38:40,799
the mistake i used to do before

4529
02:38:38,719 --> 02:38:42,799
i used to physically show that i'm

4530
02:38:40,799 --> 02:38:46,398
strong and angry and and to be

4531
02:38:42,799 --> 02:38:47,039
mean so these are the just an example of

4532
02:38:46,398 --> 02:38:49,599
tricks

4533
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:51,359
that i learned sometimes when i met an

4534
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:53,359
actor i always try to learn from

4535
02:38:51,359 --> 02:38:54,640
everybody that i met in my life it's a

4536
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:56,399
difficult journey because then you have

4537
02:38:54,639 --> 02:38:57,840
to go to some dark places

4538
02:38:56,398 --> 02:39:00,239
as a person because you really have to

4539
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:03,120
imagine imagine some dark

4540
02:39:00,239 --> 02:39:06,079
things that's fascinating actually i i

4541
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:08,240
think a lot of the actors they have

4542
02:39:06,079 --> 02:39:10,478
sometimes problems because of that beca

4543
02:39:08,239 --> 02:39:13,199
because now i understand why it's like

4544
02:39:10,478 --> 02:39:14,639
if you work on your bicep your by itself

4545
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:17,520
will grow right it's a

4546
02:39:14,639 --> 02:39:18,398
it because it it it's that stress that

4547
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:21,680
you put on it

4548
02:39:18,398 --> 02:39:23,760
that will make it grow right emotions

4549
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:28,239
are i believe are the same way if you're

4550
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:31,600
used to dig inside of you down deep to

4551
02:39:28,239 --> 02:39:34,398
to to to make your negative emotion

4552
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:35,760
depressive emotion comes out if

4553
02:39:34,398 --> 02:39:38,159
something

4554
02:39:35,760 --> 02:39:40,239
bad in your life happen you will fall

4555
02:39:38,159 --> 02:39:40,879
into those emotions much more rapidly

4556
02:39:40,239 --> 02:39:43,359
that's

4557
02:39:40,879 --> 02:39:44,478
someone who does not that every day you

4558
02:39:43,359 --> 02:39:46,559
know what i mean because it will

4559
02:39:44,478 --> 02:39:48,559
it's like a muscle memory like if you

4560
02:39:46,559 --> 02:39:49,119
program yourself to react a certain way

4561
02:39:48,559 --> 02:39:51,760
you will

4562
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:52,960
reach that point very often so that's

4563
02:39:51,760 --> 02:39:56,478
why sometimes you see some

4564
02:39:52,959 --> 02:39:57,519
some guys they we often blame it on

4565
02:39:56,478 --> 02:39:59,279
drugs but i think it's

4566
02:39:57,520 --> 02:40:00,960
also because of the acting they are used

4567
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:02,800
to be so

4568
02:40:00,959 --> 02:40:04,079
on the hopped up and sometimes they go

4569
02:40:02,799 --> 02:40:06,639
to the down deep

4570
02:40:04,079 --> 02:40:08,398
so they they they they're they they're

4571
02:40:06,639 --> 02:40:10,239
both extreme you know you got to be

4572
02:40:08,398 --> 02:40:12,318
psychologically tough and that's life

4573
02:40:10,239 --> 02:40:14,000
this is so exciting to see you challenge

4574
02:40:12,318 --> 02:40:16,159
yourself in that direction

4575
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:18,000
that's one thing that i'm a little bit

4576
02:40:16,159 --> 02:40:20,559
afraid

4577
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:21,760
that happened to me i i i really hope

4578
02:40:20,559 --> 02:40:24,799
i'll i'll always

4579
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:26,478
be uh you know like a problem

4580
02:40:24,799 --> 02:40:28,959
having a problem to control my emotion

4581
02:40:26,478 --> 02:40:31,438
be oh yeah much extreme

4582
02:40:28,959 --> 02:40:32,159
i hope it does not happen to me and and

4583
02:40:31,439 --> 02:40:36,000
if

4584
02:40:32,159 --> 02:40:39,119
i feel that i'm going towards that

4585
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:41,439
i'm going to you know give up on on

4586
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:43,520
my new objective and find something else

4587
02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:45,120
to to achieve

4588
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:47,040
but in your personal life you want to be

4589
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:47,520
real with your emotions you don't want

4590
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:49,439
to

4591
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:51,040
it doesn't you know you're just just

4592
02:40:49,439 --> 02:40:52,000
like with biceps you don't want biceps

4593
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:55,760
that are too big

4594
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:59,120
you you you are real but you are extreme

4595
02:40:55,760 --> 02:41:00,639
really and and that's that that's the

4596
02:40:59,120 --> 02:41:02,640
that's what i think something that could

4597
02:41:00,639 --> 02:41:04,559
happen to actors sometimes when they go

4598
02:41:02,639 --> 02:41:06,000
too much into their emotion like we talk

4599
02:41:04,559 --> 02:41:09,199
about like sometimes guys that

4600
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:09,600
that that commit commit suicide perhaps

4601
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:11,439
you know

4602
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:13,439
i don't know it's because i don't know

4603
02:41:11,439 --> 02:41:15,920
their real life but it could be

4604
02:41:13,439 --> 02:41:17,040
something that they get so much into

4605
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:19,279
their character

4606
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:21,359
i didn't understand it at first because

4607
02:41:19,279 --> 02:41:22,000
i never had acting class but after a

4608
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:23,359
while

4609
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:25,279
that you have acting class now you start

4610
02:41:23,359 --> 02:41:25,680
to realize that yeah okay you understand

4611
02:41:25,279 --> 02:41:28,079
why

4612
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:29,840
some actors get caught up in their

4613
02:41:28,079 --> 02:41:32,959
emotion because

4614
02:41:29,840 --> 02:41:36,239
that can have an influence on their life

4615
02:41:32,959 --> 02:41:38,318
right you're on a fascinating journey

4616
02:41:36,239 --> 02:41:40,478
