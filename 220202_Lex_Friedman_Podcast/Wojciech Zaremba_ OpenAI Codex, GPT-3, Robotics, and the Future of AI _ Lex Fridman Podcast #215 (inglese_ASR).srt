00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,679
wojciech zaramba co-founder of openai

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,920
which is one of the top organizations in

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,399
the world doing artificial intelligence

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:15,199
research and development

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,760
wojciech is the head of language and

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,600
cogeneration teams building and doing

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,359
research on github copilot openai codex

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,118
and gpt

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,400
three and who knows

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:27,359
four five

12
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,038
six

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,160
n and

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,719
n plus one and he also previously led

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,959
openai's robotic efforts

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,840
these are incredibly exciting projects

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,320
to me that deeply challenge and expand

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,600
our understanding of the structure and

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,399
nature of intelligence the 21st century

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,439
i think may very well be remembered for

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,120
a handful of revolutionary ai systems

22
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,320
and their implementations

23
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:58,399
gpt codex and applications of language

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,520
models and transformers in general

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,320
to the language and visual domains may

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,600
very well be at the core of these ai

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,839
systems

this is a lex friedman podcast and here

32
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:21,118
is my conversation with wachek zaremba

33
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:24,079
you mentioned that sam altman asked

34
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:26,400
about the fermi paradox

35
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,560
and the people at open ai had really

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,159
sophisticated interesting answers so

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,560
that's when you knew this is the right

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,640
team to be working with so let me ask

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,879
you about the fermi paradox about aliens

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,359
why have we not found overwhelming

41
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,959
evidence for aliens visiting earth

42
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,879
i don't have a conviction in the answer

43
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,039
but rather kind of probabilistic

44
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,719
perspective on what might be a let's say

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,840
possible answers it's also interesting

46
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,239
that the question itself even

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,759
can't touch on the you know your typical

48
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,599
question of what's the meaning of life

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,040
because like if you assume that like we

50
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:03,280
don't see aliens because they destroy

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,960
themselves that kind of upwards their

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,080
focus on making sure that we won't

53
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,359
destroy ourselves yeah and at the moment

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,360
the

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,040
place where i am actually with my belief

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,080
and these things also change over the

57
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,039
time

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,599
is i think that we might be alone in the

59
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,840
universe which actually makes

60
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,479
life more or less a consciousness life

61
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,400
more kind of valuable and that means

62
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,159
that we should more appreciate it

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,159
have you always been alone so what's

64
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,159
your intuition about our galaxy our

65
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,639
universe is it just

66
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:38,000
sprinkled with graveyards of intelligent

67
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,079
civilizations or are we truly is is life

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
intelligent life truly unique

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
at the moment my belief that it is

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,800
unique but i would say i could also

71
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,919
you know there was like some footage

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,120
released with ufo objects which makes me

73
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,119
actually doubt my own belief yes

74
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,519
yeah i can tell you one crazy answer

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,800
that i have heard yes

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,719
so

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,560
apparently when you look actually at the

78
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,199
limits of computation

79
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,759
you can compute more

80
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,679
if the temperature of the universe would

81
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,000
drop down

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,080
so one of the things that

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,080
aliens might want to do if they are

84
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,319
truly optimizing to maximize amount of

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,440
compute which you know maybe can lead to

86
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:23,839
or let's say simulations or so it's

87
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,439
instead of wasting current entropy of

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,759
the universe because you know we by

89
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,799
living we are actually somewhat wasting

90
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,719
entropy

91
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,400
then you can wait for the universe to

92
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,158
cool down such that you have more

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
computation that's kind of a funny

94
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,079
answer i'm not sure if i believe in it

95
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,599
but that would be one of the reasons why

96
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,000
you don't see aliens it's also possible

97
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,679
see some people say that maybe there is

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,120
not that much point in actually going to

99
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,360
other galaxies

100
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,920
if you can go inwards

101
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,280
so there is no limits of what could be

102
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,919
an experience

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,199
if we could you know connect machines to

104
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,719
our brains

105
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,399
while there are still some limits if we

106
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,560
want to explore universe yeah there

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,879
could be a lot of

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,039
ways to go inwards too

109
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,120
once you figure out some aspect of

110
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,959
physics we haven't figured out yet maybe

111
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,840
you can travel to different dimensions i

112
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,160
mean

113
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,120
travel in three-dimensional space may

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,959
not be the most fun kind of travel there

115
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,800
may be like just a huge amount of

116
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,199
different ways to travel and it doesn't

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,960
require a spaceship going

118
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,040
slowly in 3d space space time it also

119
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,758
feels you know one of the problems is

120
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,000
that speed of light is low and universe

121
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,000
is vast yeah and um

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,839
it seems that actually most likely if we

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,160
want to travel very far

124
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:46,560
then then we would instead of actually

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,919
sending spaceships with humans that wait

126
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,759
a lot we would

127
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,079
send something similar to what yuri

128
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,720
miller is working on these are like a

129
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,039
huge uh sail which is at first powered

130
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,919
power there is a shot of laser from an

131
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,439
earth and it can propel it to a quarter

132
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,719
of speed of light and uh sail itself

133
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,839
contains a

134
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,400
few grams of equipment and that might be

135
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,399
the way to actually

136
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,159
transport matter through universe but

137
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,839
then when you think what would it mean

138
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,360
for humans it means that

139
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,079
we would need to actually put their 3d

140
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,000
printer and you know 3d print a human on

141
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,399
other planet i don't know play them

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,079
youtube or let's say or like a pre 3d

143
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,038
print like a huge human right away or

144
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,879
maybe a womb or so um yeah

145
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,560
with our current techniques of

146
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,439
archaeology

147
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,720
if

148
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,959
a civilization was born and died

149
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,360
long long enough ago on earth we

150
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,198
wouldn't be able to tell and so that

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,199
makes me really sad

152
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,400
and so i think about earth in that same

153
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,639
way how can we leave some remnants if we

154
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,719
do destroy ourselves how can we leave

155
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,000
remnants for aliens in the future to

156
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,400
discover

157
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,879
like here's some nice stuff we've done

158
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,599
like wikipedia and youtube do we have it

159
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,000
like

160
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,439
in a satellite orbiting earth

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,079
with a hard drive like how how do we say

162
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,319
how do we back up human civilization

163
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:12,000
uh for the good parts or

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,439
all of it is good parts

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,279
so that uh

166
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,360
it can be preserved longer than our

167
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,198
bodies can that's a

168
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,639
that's kind of a

169
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,038
it's a difficult question it also

170
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,680
requires the difficult acceptance of the

171
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,478
fact that we may die and if we die we

172
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,360
may

173
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,680
die suddenly as a civilization

174
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,080
so let's see i think it kind of depends

175
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,478
on the cataclysm we have observed in

176
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,719
other parts of the universe that births

177
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,758
of gamma rays

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
these are

179
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,280
high energy

180
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,560
rays of light that actually can

181
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,478
apparently kill entire galaxy

182
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,199
so there might be actually nothing even

183
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,519
to

184
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,038
nothing to protect us from it i'm also

185
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,839
when i'm looking actually at the past

186
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,000
civilization so it's like aztecs or so

187
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,879
they disappear from the

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,399
surface of the earth and one can ask

189
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,399
why is it the case

190
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,719
and

191
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,719
the way i'm thinking about it is

192
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,880
you know that definitely they had some

193
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,039
problem that they couldn't solve

194
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,800
and maybe there was a flat and all of a

195
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,360
sudden they couldn't drink there was no

196
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,280
potable water and they all died

197
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,199
and

198
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,959
i think that

199
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,160
so far

200
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:28,478
the best solution to such a problems is

201
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,479
i guess technology so i mean if they

202
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,560
would know that you can just boil water

203
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,959
and then drink it after then that would

204
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,800
save their civilization and even now

205
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,279
when we look actually at the current

206
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,680
pandemic it seems that once again

207
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:44,000
actually science comes to rescue and

208
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,478
somehow science increases size of the

209
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,279
action space and i think that's a good

210
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,199
thing

211
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,799
yeah but nature

212
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,639
has a vastly larger action space but

213
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,000
still it might be a good thing for us to

214
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,000
keep on increasing action space

215
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,759
okay

216
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,239
looking at past civilizations yes

217
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,759
but looking at the destruction of human

218
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,478
civilization

219
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,639
perhaps expanding the action space will

220
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,199
add

221
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,240
actions that are easily

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,919
acted upon easily executed and as a

223
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,879
result destroy

224
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:20,240
us

225
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,400
so let's see

226
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,160
i was pondering

227
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,399
why actually even

228
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,960
we have negative impact on the

229
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,038
globe because you know if you ask every

230
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,639
single individual they would like to

231
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,080
have clean air

232
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,479
they would like healthy planet but

233
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,560
somehow it actually is not the case that

234
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,080
as a collective we are not going this

235
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,559
direction

236
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
i think that there exists very powerful

237
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,639
system to describe what we value that's

238
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,278
capitalism it assigns actually monetary

239
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,679
values to various activities at the

240
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,278
moment the problem in the current system

241
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,239
is that there are some things which we

242
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:58,958
value there is no cost assigned to it so

243
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,039
even though we value clean air or maybe

244
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,479
we also

245
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,799
value

246
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,720
lack of destruction on the internet or

247
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,799
so at the moment

248
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,278
these quantities you know companies

249
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,719
corporations can pollute them uh for

250
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:16,080
free

251
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
so in some sense

252
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,919
i wish

253
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,399
or like and that's i guess purpose of

254
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,479
politics to

255
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,159
align the incentive systems and we are

256
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,000
kind of maybe even moving in this

257
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,559
direction the first issue is even to be

258
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,720
able to measure the things that we value

259
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,159
then we can actually assign the monetary

260
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,800
value to them

261
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,919
yeah and that's so it's getting the data

262
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,079
and also

263
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,000
probably through technology enabling

264
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,120
people to vote

265
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,679
and to

266
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,759
move money around in a way that is

267
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,199
aligned with their values and that's

268
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,679
very much a technology question so like

269
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,120
having one president

270
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,359
and congress

271
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,879
and voting that happens every four years

272
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
or something like that

273
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,559
that's a very outdated idea there could

274
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,399
be some technological improvements to

275
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,000
that kind of idea so

276
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,839
i'm thinking from time to time about

277
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,240
these topics but it also feels to me

278
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,760
that it's it's a little bit like a

279
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,120
it's hard for me to actually make

280
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,600
correct predictions what is the

281
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,278
appropriate thing to do i extremely

282
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,560
trust uh sam altman our ceo

283
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:24,879
on these topics he um okay i'm more on

284
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:28,159
the side of being i guess

285
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,838
naive hippie that

286
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,639
yeah

287
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,959
that's your life philosophy um

288
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,799
well like i think self-doubt

289
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:40,078
and uh

290
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,838
i think hippie implies optimism those

291
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,120
those two things are pretty pretty good

292
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,800
way to operate

293
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,120
i mean still it is

294
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,838
hard for me to actually

295
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,000
understand how the politics works or

296
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,800
like uh how this like

297
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,600
exactly how the things would play out

298
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,199
and sam is a really excellent with it

299
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,920
what do you think is rarest in the

300
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,759
universe you said we might be alone

301
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,838
what's hardest to build is another

302
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,799
engineering way to ask that

303
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,519
life

304
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:12,240
intelligence or consciousness so like

305
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,399
you said that we might be alone

306
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,120
which is the thing that's hardest to get

307
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,519
to

308
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,240
is it just the origin of life is it the

309
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,639
origin of intelligence is it the origin

310
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,680
of consciousness

311
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,240
so

312
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,078
um let me at first explain you my kind

313
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,240
of mental model what i think is needed

314
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,199
for life to appear

315
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,079
um

316
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,839
so

317
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,679
i imagine that at some point there was

318
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,360
this primordial

319
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,239
zoop of

320
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,278
amino acids and maybe some proteins in

321
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,680
the ocean

322
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,120
and you know some proteins were turning

323
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,239
into some other proteins through

324
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,440
reaction

325
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,240
and you can almost think about this

326
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,160
uh cycle of what turns into what as

327
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,240
there is a graph essentially describing

328
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,480
which substance turns into some other

329
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,480
substance and essentially life means

330
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,959
that all the sudden in the graph has

331
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,879
been created a cycle such that the same

332
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,799
thing keeps on happening over and over

333
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,320
again that's what is needed for life to

334
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,039
happen and in some sense you can think

335
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,360
almost that you have this gigantic graph

336
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:17,278
and it needs like a sufficient number of

337
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,919
edges for the cycle to appear

338
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,519
then um from perspective of intelligence

339
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,000
and consciousness

340
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,879
my current intuition is that they might

341
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,120
be

342
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,799
quite intertwined first of all it might

343
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,919
not be that it's like a binary thing

344
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,919
that you have intelligence or

345
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,879
consciousness it seems to be a

346
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,519
more a

347
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,559
continuous component let's see if we

348
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,120
look for instance on the even networks

349
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,359
recognizing images and people are able

350
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,560
to show that the activations of these

351
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,440
networks correlate very strongly

352
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,838
with activations in visual cortex

353
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,560
of some monkeys the same seems to be

354
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,320
true about language models

355
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,439
also if you for instance

356
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,839
look

357
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,800
if you train agent in a 3d world

358
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,800
at first you know it it it it barely

359
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,879
recognizes what is going on over the

360
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,120
time it kind of recognizes foreground

361
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,120
from a background over the time it kind

362
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,440
of knows where there is a foot

363
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,440
and it just follows it

364
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,000
over the time it actually starts having

365
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,160
a 3d perception so it is possible for

366
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,480
instance to look inside of the head of

367
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:30,639
an agent and ask what would it see if it

368
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,879
looks to the right and the crazy thing

369
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,039
is you know initially when the agents

370
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,879
are very trained these predictions are

371
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,039
pretty bad over the time they they

372
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,159
become better and better you can still

373
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,799
see

374
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,519
that if you ask what happens when the

375
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,599
head is turned by 360 degrees for some

376
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,919
time they think that the different thing

377
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,360
appears and then at some stage they

378
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,198
understand actually that the same

379
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,680
thing's supposed to appear so they get

380
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,838
like a understanding of 3d structure

381
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:59,838
it's also you know very likely that they

382
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,800
have inside some

383
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,880
level of and of like a symbolic

384
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,599
reasoning like they're particularly

385
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,799
symbols for other agents so when you

386
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,040
look at dota agents they collaborate

387
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,759
together and uh

388
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,439
and

389
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,078
now they they they have some

390
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,399
anticipation of uh if if they would win

391
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,799
battle they have some some expectations

392
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,958
with respect to other agents i might be

393
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,599
you know too much anthropomorphizing

394
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:30,559
um the the how the things look

395
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,360
look for me but then the fact that they

396
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,359
have a symbol for other agents

397
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,399
and makes me believe that

398
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,320
at some stage as the uh you know as they

399
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,839
are optimizing for skills they would

400
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,278
have also symbol to describe

401
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,600
themselves this is like a very useful

402
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:49,679
symbol to have and this particularity i

403
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,000
would call it like a self-consciousness

404
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,399
or self-awareness

405
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,440
and still it might be different from the

406
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,078
consciousness so i guess the the way how

407
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,920
i'm understanding the word consciousness

408
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,599
let's say the experience of drinking a

409
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,039
coffee or let's say experience of being

410
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,159
a butt

411
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,439
that's the meaning of the word

412
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,759
consciousness it doesn't mean to be

413
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
awake

414
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,278
yeah it feels

415
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,720
it might be also somewhat related to

416
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,320
memory and recurrent connections so um

417
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,759
it's kind of okay if you look at

418
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,879
anesthetic drugs they might be

419
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:27,039
uh like they essentially

420
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,879
they disturb

421
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,079
brain waste

422
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,519
such that

423
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,000
[Music]

424
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,320
maybe memory is not not formed

425
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,399
so there's a lessening of consciousness

426
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,120
when you do that correct and so that's

427
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,078
one way to intuit what is consciousness

428
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,120
there's also kind of another

429
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:49,439
element here it could be that it's

430
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,240
you know this kind of self-awareness

431
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,519
module that you described

432
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,799
plus the actual subjective experience

433
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:03,120
is a storytelling module

434
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:05,198
that tells us a story about uh

435
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,159
what we're experiencing

436
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,919
the

437
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,319
crazy thing so let's say i mean in

438
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,719
meditation they teach people

439
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,240
not to speak story inside of the head

440
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,440
and there is also some fraction of

441
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,079
population

442
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,160
who doesn't have actually narrator i

443
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:22,559
know people who don't have a right

444
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,679
narrator and you know they have to use

445
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,799
external people in order to

446
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,278
kind of

447
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,719
solve tasks that require internal

448
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,439
narrator

449
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,360
so

450
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,440
it seems that it's possible to have the

451
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,199
experience without the talk

452
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,360
what are we talking about when we talk

453
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,799
about the internal narrator is that the

454
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,399
voice when you're like yeah i thought

455
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:48,000
that that that's what you are referring

456
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,958
to well i was referring more on the like

457
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,480
not an actual voice

458
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,479
i meant like

459
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,959
there's some kind of

460
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,920
like subjective experience

461
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,919
feels like it's

462
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,400
it's fundamentally about storytelling to

463
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,279
ourselves

464
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,000
it feels like

465
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,879
like the feeling is a story

466
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,880
that is much

467
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,279
much simpler abstraction than the raw

468
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,519
sensory information

469
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,959
so it feels like it's a very high level

470
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,240
abstraction

471
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,919
that

472
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,599
is useful

473
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,759
for me to feel like

474
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,879
entity in this world

475
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,480
most

476
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,120
useful aspect of it is that

477
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,880
because i'm conscious

478
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,239
i think there's an intricate connection

479
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,640
to me not one

480
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,599
wanting to die

481
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
so like

482
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,959
it's a useful hack to really

483
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,798
prioritize not dying

484
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,279
like those seem to be somehow connected

485
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:54,000
so i'm telling the story of like it's

486
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,399
richly feels like something to be me and

487
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
the fact that me exists in this world i

488
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,559
want to preserve me

489
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,359
and so that makes it a useful agent hack

490
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,839
so i will just refer maybe to the first

491
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:08,959
part as you said about the kind of story

492
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:08,959
of describing who you are

493
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,120
i was

494
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,359
thinking about that even so you know

495
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,839
obviously i'm i'm i

496
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,759
like thinking about consciousness uh i

497
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,839
like thinking about the ai as well and

498
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,558
i'm trying to see analogies of these

499
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:28,279
things in ai what would it correspond to

500
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,279
so um

501
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,640
you know openly i trained a

502
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,960
a

503
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,840
model called gpt

504
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,600
which

505
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,839
can generate a

506
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,798
pretty amusing text on arbitrary topic

507
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,759
and um

508
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:49,200
and one way to control gpd

509
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,359
is uh by putting into prefix at the

510
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,679
beginning of the text some information

511
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,798
what would be the story about

512
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,038
you can have even chat with uh

513
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,759
you know with gpt by saying that the

514
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:04,240
chat is with lex or elon musk or so

515
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,279
and gpt would just

516
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,120
pretend to be you or elon musk or so

517
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:11,678
and

518
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,639
it almost feels that this uh

519
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,798
story that we give ourselves to describe

520
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,880
our life it's almost like a

521
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,599
things that you put into context of gpt

522
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,559
yeah the primary it's the and but the

523
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,759
the context we provide to gpt

524
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,639
is uh

525
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:31,759
is multimodal it's so gpt itself is

526
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,840
multimodal gpt itself uh hasn't learned

527
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,240
actually from experience of single human

528
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,159
but from the experience of humanity it's

529
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,038
a chameleon you can turn it into

530
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,120
anything and in some sense by providing

531
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,400
context uh

532
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,239
it you know

533
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,360
behaves as the thing that you wanted it

534
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,120
to be and it's interesting that the

535
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,159
you know people have a stories of who

536
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:57,199
they are and as i said these stories

537
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,000
they help them to operate in the world

538
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,759
but it's also you know interesting

539
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,480
i guess various people find it out

540
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,079
through meditation or so that

541
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,360
there might be some patterns that you

542
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,879
have learned

543
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,719
when you were a kid that actually are

544
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,120
not serving you anymore

545
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,720
and you also might be thinking that

546
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,279
that's who you are and that's actually

547
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,120
just the story

548
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,960
yeah so it's a useful hack but sometimes

549
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,038
it gets us into trouble it's a local

550
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,120
optima

551
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,759
you wrote that stephen hawking he

552
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:30,798
tweeted stephen hawking asked what

553
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,798
breathes fire into equations which meant

554
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:36,000
what makes given mathematical equations

555
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,279
realize the physics of a universe

556
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,119
similarly

557
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,158
i wonder what breathes fire into

558
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,439
computation what makes given computation

559
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,200
conscious

560
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,200
okay so how do we engineer consciousness

561
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,840
how do you breathe fire

562
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,960
and magic into the machine

563
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,918
so

564
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,240
it seems clear to me that not every

565
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,559
computation is conscious i mean you can

566
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,880
let's say just keep on multiplying one

567
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,720
matrix over and over again and my

568
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,400
gigantic matrix you can put a lot of

569
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,400
computation i don't think it would be

570
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,600
conscious so in some sense the question

571
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,960
is

572
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,079
what are the computations which could be

573
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,038
conscious

574
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:18,399
uh i mean so one assumption is

575
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:20,000
that it has to do purely with

576
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,720
computation that you can abstract away

577
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,319
matter and other possibilities that it's

578
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,558
very important was the realization of

579
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,599
computation that it has to do with some

580
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,678
uh uh force fields or so and they bring

581
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,279
consciousness at the moment my intuition

582
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,519
is that it can be fully abstracted that

583
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,519
way so in case of computation you can

584
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,319
ask yourself what are the

585
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:44,240
mathematical objects or so that could

586
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:45,839
bring such a properties so for instance

587
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,000
if we think about the

588
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,439
models uh ai models then what they truly

589
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,240
try to do

590
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,240
or like models like gpt is uh

591
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:02,000
you know they try to predict a next word

592
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,400
or so and this turns out to be

593
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,839
equivalent to

594
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,200
compressing

595
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,759
text

596
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
and because in some sense compression

597
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:12,960
means that

598
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,120
you learn the model of reality and you

599
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,038
have just to uh

600
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,199
remember where are your mistakes the

601
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,079
better you are in predicting the

602
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,840
and

603
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,439
and in some sense when we look at our

604
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,119
experience also when you look for

605
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,720
instance the car driving you know in

606
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,759
which direction it will go you are good

607
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,279
like a in prediction and um

608
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,640
you know it might be the case that the

609
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,200
consciousness

610
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,038
is intertwined with compression it might

611
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,720
be also the case that self-consciousness

612
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,640
has to do with compressor trying to

613
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,519
compress itself so

614
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,600
um

615
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:48,158
okay i was just wondering what are the

616
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,639
objects in you know mathematics or

617
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,360
computer science which are mysterious

618
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,880
that could uh that that could have to do

619
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:59,839
with consciousness and then i thought um

620
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,240
you know you you see in uh mathematics

621
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:04,240
there is something called cadal theorem

622
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,640
which means okay you have if you have

623
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,960
sufficiently complicated mathematical

624
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,440
system it is possible to point the

625
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,519
mathematical system back on itself in

626
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,679
computer sense there is uh something

627
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,918
called helping problem it's it's

628
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,640
somewhat similar construction so i

629
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,120
thought that you know if we believe that

630
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,720
that the that

631
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,199
under assumption that consciousness has

632
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,480
to do with uh with compression

633
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,600
uh

634
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,599
then you could imagine that the the as

635
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,519
you keep on compressing things then at

636
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,439
some point it actually makes sense

637
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,918
for the compressor to compress itself

638
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,440
metacompression yeah consciousness is

639
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,038
metacompression

640
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,798
that's uh that's and i and an idea

641
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:47,599
and in some sense you know the creation

642
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,679
of it

643
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,439
thank you so uh

644
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,278
but do you think if we think of a

645
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,240
touring machine a universal touring

646
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:55,759
machine

647
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,200
can that achieve

648
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,960
consciousness

649
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,519
so is there some

650
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,319
thing beyond our traditional definition

651
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,839
of computation that's required so it's a

652
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,480
specific computation and i said this

653
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:09,599
computation has to do with compression

654
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,679
and

655
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,000
the compression itself maybe other way

656
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,159
of putting it is like you are internally

657
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,319
creating the model of reality

658
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,480
in order like a it's like a you try

659
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,399
inside to simplify reality in order to

660
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,200
predict what's going to happen

661
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
and

662
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,840
that also feels somewhat similar to how

663
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:29,678
i think actually about my own conscious

664
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,000
experience so clearly i don't have

665
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,000
access to reality the only access to

666
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,480
reality is through you know cable going

667
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,640
to my brain and my brain is creating a

668
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,640
simulation of reality and i have access

669
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,840
to the simulation of reality

670
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,480
are you by any chance uh aware of uh

671
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:49,278
the harder prize marcus hutter

672
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,880
he he made this prize

673
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,359
for compression

674
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,320
of wikipedia pages

675
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:56,399
and

676
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,759
there's a few qualities to it

677
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,759
one i think has to be perfect

678
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,400
compression which makes

679
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,558
i think that little quirk makes it much

680
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,320
less um

681
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,759
applicable to the general task of

682
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,639
intelligence because it feels like

683
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,519
intelligence is always going to be messy

684
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,440
uh

685
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:17,278
like perfect compression is feels like

686
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,360
it's not the right goal but it's

687
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,558
nevertheless a very interesting goal so

688
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,599
for him intelligence equals compression

689
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,000
and so

690
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:28,959
the smaller you make the file

691
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,640
given a large wikipedia page

692
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,558
the more intelligent the system has to

693
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,799
be yeah that makes sense so you can make

694
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,319
perfect compression if you store errors

695
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,558
and i think that actually what he meant

696
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:43,038
is you have algorithm plus errors and by

697
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:46,079
the way hooter hatter is a he was pa uh

698
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,879
phd advisor of shenleck who is the mind

699
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,519
uh

700
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,960
uh deep mind co-founder yeah yeah so

701
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,599
there's an interesting

702
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,840
and now he's a deep mind there's an

703
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,918
interesting uh network of people he's

704
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,439
one of the people that

705
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,120
i think

706
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,000
seriously took on the task of what would

707
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:08,719
an agi system look like

708
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,038
i think for a longest time

709
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,720
the question of agi was not

710
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:15,519
taken

711
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,120
seriously or rather rigorously

712
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:20,960
and he did just that like mathematically

713
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,399
speaking what would the model look like

714
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,200
if you remove the constraints of it

715
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,200
having to be

716
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,440
having to have a

717
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:34,400
reasonable amount of memory reasonable

718
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,960
amount of running time complexity uh

719
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,360
computation time what would it look like

720
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,679
and essentially it's it's a

721
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:44,079
half math half philosophical discussion

722
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,559
of uh how would like a reinforcement

723
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:49,439
learning type of framework look like for

724
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:51,519
an agi yeah so he developed a framework

725
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,360
even to describe what's optimal with

726
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,960
respect to reinforcement learning like

727
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,240
there is a theoretical framework which

728
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,600
is as you said

729
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,919
under assumption there is infinite

730
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:02,480
amount of memory and compute and there

731
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,360
was actually one person before his name

732
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,679
is solomonov hutter extended

733
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:10,240
amount of work to reinforcement learning

734
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,880
but there exists a

735
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,038
theoretical algorithm which is optimal

736
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,880
algorithm to build intelligence and i

737
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,319
can actually explain you the algorithm

738
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,080
yes

739
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:23,119
let's go let's go so the task itself can

740
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:24,079
i just

741
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,759
pause

742
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,960
how absurd it is

743
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,798
for brain in a skull trying to explain

744
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,880
the algorithm for intelligence just go

745
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,480
ahead it is pretty crazy it is pretty

746
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,720
crazy that you know the brain itself is

747
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,720
actually so small and it can ponder

748
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,679
how to design algorithms that optimally

749
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,759
solve the problem of intelligence okay

750
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,000
all right so what's the algorithm so

751
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,119
let's see so first of all the task

752
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,798
itself is

753
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,879
described as

754
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:53,759
you have infinite sequence of zeros and

755
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,120
ones

756
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,038
okay you read n bits and you are about

757
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,959
to predict n plus one bit

758
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,599
so that's the task and you could imagine

759
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,159
that every task could be casted as such

760
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,158
a task so if for instance you have

761
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,000
images and labels you can just turn

762
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,720
every image into sequence of zeros and

763
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,278
ones then label you concatenate labels

764
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,960
and you and that that's actually the the

765
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,440
and you could you could start by having

766
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,120
training data first and then afterwards

767
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,519
you have test data

768
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,398
so theoretically any problem could be

769
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:31,278
casted as a problem of predicting zeros

770
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:34,398
and ones on this infinite type so um

771
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,960
so let's say you read already n bits and

772
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:40,158
you want to predict n plus one bit

773
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,720
and i will ask you to write

774
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,520
every possible program that generates

775
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,679
these end bits okay so

776
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,440
and you can have you you choose

777
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,559
programming language it can be in python

778
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,080
or c

779
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:53,359
and the difference between programming

780
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:54,960
languages

781
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,000
might be there is a difference by

782
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,079
constant

783
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
asymptotically your predictions will be

784
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,960
equivalent

785
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,519
so you you read and beats you enumerate

786
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,519
all the programs that produce these and

787
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,918
end bits in their output

788
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,720
and then in order to predict n plus one

789
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,320
bit you actually weight

790
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,480
the programs according to their length

791
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:22,000
and there is like some specific formula

792
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,960
how you weight them and then the n plus

793
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,960
one bit prediction is the prediction uh

794
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,480
from each of this program according to

795
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,640
that weight

796
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,798
like statistically you statistically

797
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,520
pick so the smaller the program the more

798
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,879
likely you you are to pick the its

799
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,879
output

800
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,559
so uh that's that algorithm is grounded

801
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,640
in the hope

802
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,278
or the intuition that the simple answer

803
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,759
is the right one it's a formalization of

804
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,759
it yeah um it also

805
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:52,798
means like if you would ask the question

806
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,398
after

807
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:55,759
how many years

808
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,079
would you know

809
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,200
sun explode

810
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,119
you can say

811
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,038
it's more likely the answer is

812
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:04,000
to some power because it's a shorter

813
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:04,798
program

814
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,480
yeah

815
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,440
and then other

816
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,038
well i don't have a good intuition about

817
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,519
how different the space of short

818
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,640
programs are from the space of large

819
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,679
programs

820
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,278
like

821
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,720
what is the universe where short

822
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:21,440
programs

823
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,000
uh like run things

824
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,558
uh so as i said the things have to agree

825
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,880
with end beats so even if you have

826
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,720
you you need to start okay if if you

827
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,278
have very short program and they're like

828
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,880
uh still some as if it's not perfect

829
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,200
with prediction of n bits you have to

830
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,799
start errors what are the errors and

831
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,880
that gives you the full program that

832
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,038
agrees on end beats

833
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,720
oh so you don't agree perfectly with the

834
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,480
end bits and you store

835
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,240
that's like a longer a longer program

836
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,159
slightly longer program

837
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,480
because it contains these extra bits of

838
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,159
errors that's fascinating what's what's

839
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,278
your intuition

840
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,919
about

841
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,759
the the programs

842
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,320
that are able to do cool stuff like

843
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,759
intelligence and consciousness are they

844
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,038
uh

845
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:09,200
perfectly like is is it uh

846
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:10,720
is there if then statements in them so

847
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,519
like is there a lot of exceptions that

848
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,200
they're storing so um you could imagine

849
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,200
if there would be tremendous amount of

850
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,759
if statements yeah then they wouldn't be

851
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,600
that short in case of neural networks

852
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,558
you could imagine that

853
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,678
what happens is uh

854
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:27,599
they

855
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,120
when you start with an uninitialized

856
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:33,599
neural network uh it stores internally

857
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,079
many possibilities how the

858
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:38,879
how the problem can be solved and sgd is

859
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,079
kind of magnifying some some

860
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,200
some

861
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:44,639
paths which are slightly

862
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,880
similar to the correct answer so it's

863
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,759
kind of magnifying correct programs and

864
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,679
in some sense hdd is a search algorithm

865
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:55,200
in the program space and the program

866
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,120
space is represented by uh you know kind

867
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,798
of the wiring inside of the neural

868
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:01,119
network and there's like an insane

869
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,558
number of ways how that features can be

870
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,558
computed

871
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:07,200
let me ask you the high level basic

872
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,918
question that's not so basic

873
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,159
what is deep learning

874
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,000
is there a way you'd like to think of it

875
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,919
that is different than like a generic

876
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,839
textbook definition

877
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,640
the thing that i hinted just a second

878
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,319
ago is maybe the uh closest to how i'm

879
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,120
thinking these days about um deep

880
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,839
learning so

881
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,079
now the statement is

882
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:31,678
uh neural networks can represent some

883
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,678
programs

884
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,080
uh it seems that various modules that we

885
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,159
are actually adding up to are like a you

886
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,879
know we we want networks to be deep

887
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,720
because we we want multiple steps of the

888
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,960
computation

889
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,360
and

890
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,200
and deep learning provides the way to

891
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,839
represent space of programs which is

892
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,759
searchable and it's searchable with

893
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:57,119
stochastic gradient descent so we have

894
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:58,480
an algorithm to search over a humongous

895
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,798
number of programs

896
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,599
and gradient descent kind of bubbles up

897
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,119
the things that are tend to give correct

898
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:06,879
answers so

899
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:10,479
a neural network

900
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,720
with a with fixed weights that's

901
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,319
optimized do you think of that as a

902
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,759
single program um so there is a

903
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,839
work by christopher olach where he

904
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:25,038
so he works on interpretability of

905
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,839
neural networks and he was able to

906
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,240
uh

907
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:31,359
to identify inside of the neural network

908
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,839
for instance a detector of a wheel for a

909
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,519
car or the detector of a mask for a car

910
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:39,278
and then he was able to separate them

911
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:42,000
out and assemble them uh together using

912
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:44,720
a simple program uh for the detector for

913
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,960
a car detector that's like uh if you

914
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,120
think of traditionally defined programs

915
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,880
that's like a function within a program

916
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,759
that this particular neural network was

917
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,278
able to find and you can tear that out

918
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,720
just like you can copy and paste from

919
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:58,798
stack overflow

920
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,519
that

921
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,200
so uh any program is a composition of

922
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,038
smaller programs

923
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,360
yeah i mean the nice thing about the

924
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,280
neural networks is that it allows the

925
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,319
things to be more fuzzy than in case of

926
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,480
programs

927
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,800
in case of programs you have this like a

928
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,039
branching this way or that way and the

929
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,000
neural networks they they have an easier

930
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,480
way to

931
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,398
to be somewhere in between or to share

932
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,000
things

933
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,480
what to use the most beautiful or

934
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,639
surprising idea in deep learning

935
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,639
in the utilization of these neural

936
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,159
networks which by the way for people who

937
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,960
are not familiar

938
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,039
neural networks is a bunch of uh

939
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,800
what would you say it's inspired by the

940
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,878
human brain there's neurons there's

941
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,119
connection between those neurons there's

942
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,440
inputs and there's outputs and there's

943
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,159
millions or billions of those neurons

944
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,599
and

945
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,200
the learning

946
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,320
happens

947
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,559
uh by adjusting the weights on the edges

948
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,240
that connect these neurons thank you for

949
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,159
giving definition that

950
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,559
i supposed to do it but i guess you have

951
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:03,039
enough empathy to listeners to actually

952
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:04,078
know that that might be useful no that's

953
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,559
like

954
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,440
so i'm asking plato of like what is the

955
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:11,199
meaning of life he's not going to answer

956
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,200
you're being philosophical and deep and

957
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,039
quite profound talking about the space

958
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:17,039
of programs which is just very

959
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:18,880
interesting but also for people who are

960
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,239
just not familiar with the hell we're

961
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,480
talking about when we talk about deep

962
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,598
learning anyway sorry what is the most

963
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,960
beautiful

964
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,079
or surprising idea to you in in um in

965
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,000
all the time you've worked at deep

966
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,160
learning and you worked on a lot of

967
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,119
fascinating projects

968
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,799
applications of neural networks

969
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,280
it doesn't have to be big and profound

970
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,200
it can be a cool trick yeah i mean i'm

971
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,079
thinking about the trick but like it's

972
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:46,480
still amusing to me that it works at all

973
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,160
yeah that let's say that the extremely

974
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,079
simple algorithm stochastic gradient

975
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,799
descent which is something that i would

976
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,000
be able you know to derive on the piece

977
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,280
of paper to high school student uh when

978
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,358
put at the

979
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,119
ins at the scale of you know thousands

980
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,799
of machines actually

981
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,838
uh can create

982
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,240
the

983
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:07,920
behaviors we which we called kind of

984
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,439
human like behaviors

985
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,200
so in general

986
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,440
any applications to cast a gradient

987
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:16,159
descent to neural networks is

988
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,159
is amazing to you so that or is there a

989
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,159
particular application

990
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:22,799
in natural language

991
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,920
reinforcement learning

992
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,760
uh

993
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,200
and also would you attribute

994
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,880
that success too is it just scale

995
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:35,279
what profound insight can we take from

996
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,800
the fact that

997
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,160
the thing works for

998
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,720
gigantic

999
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:42,159
uh sets of variables

1000
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:43,679
i mean the interesting thing is these

1001
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,319
algorithms they were

1002
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,118
invented uh decades ago

1003
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,280
and

1004
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:53,039
people actually

1005
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,200
gave up on the idea yeah and um

1006
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:58,000
you know back then they thought that we

1007
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,838
need profoundly different algorithms and

1008
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,480
they spent a lot of cycles on very

1009
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:04,880
different algorithms and i believe that

1010
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,800
you know we have seen that various

1011
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,880
various innovations that say like

1012
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:14,160
transformer or or dropout or so they can

1013
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,720
uh you know pass the help but it's also

1014
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,559
remarkable to me that this algorithm

1015
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,559
from 60s or so

1016
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,199
or i mean you can even say that the

1017
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,679
gradient descent was invented by leibniz

1018
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,559
in i guess 18th century or so that

1019
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,519
actually

1020
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,440
is the

1021
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,440
core of learning

1022
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,480
in the past people are

1023
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,800
it's almost like a out of the maybe an

1024
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,280
ego people are saying that it cannot be

1025
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,720
the case that such a simple algorithm is

1026
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,079
there you know

1027
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,719
uh

1028
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,440
could solve complicated problems

1029
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,598
so they were in search for the

1030
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,119
other algorithms and as i'm saying like

1031
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,039
i believe that actually we are in the

1032
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,519
game where there is there are actually

1033
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,759
frankly three levels there is compute

1034
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,759
there are algorithms and there is data

1035
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,200
and if we want to build intelligent

1036
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,599
systems we have to

1037
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,239
pull all three levers

1038
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,400
and they are actually multiplicative

1039
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,559
and it's also interesting so you ask is

1040
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,880
it only compute

1041
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,119
people internally they did the studies

1042
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,838
to determine how much gains they were

1043
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,760
coming from different levels and so far

1044
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,759
we have seen that more gains came from

1045
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,760
compute than algorithms but also we are

1046
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,599
in the world that in case of compute

1047
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,680
there is a kind of you know exponential

1048
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,200
increase in funding and at some point

1049
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,799
it's impossible to

1050
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,399
invest more it's impossible to you know

1051
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,640
invest 10 trillion dollars

1052
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,440
because we are speaking about that

1053
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:40,000
let's say all taxes in u.s

1054
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,838
uh but you're talking about money there

1055
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,679
could be innovation

1056
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:44,799
in the compute that's that's true as

1057
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,639
well

1058
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,880
so i mean they're like a few pieces so

1059
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,489
one piece is human brain is an

1060
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,599
incredible super computer

1061
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:54,799
[Music]

1062
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,800
and they're like a

1063
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,280
it

1064
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,838
it has

1065
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,920
100 trillion

1066
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:03,358
parameters or like a if you try to count

1067
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,320
various quantities in the brain there

1068
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,598
are like a neurons synapses that small

1069
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,400
number of neurons there is a lot of

1070
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,519
synapses yeah it's unclear even how to

1071
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,880
map

1072
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,920
synapses

1073
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,320
to

1074
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,680
two parameters of neural networks but

1075
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,599
it's clear that there are many more yeah

1076
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:25,199
so it might be the case that our

1077
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,640
networks are still somewhat small

1078
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,078
it also might be the case that they are

1079
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,960
more efficient than brain or less

1080
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,760
efficient by some by some huge factor

1081
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,119
i also believe that there will be like a

1082
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,359
you know at the moment we are at the

1083
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,960
stage that the these neural networks

1084
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:43,679
they require 1000x or like a huge factor

1085
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,320
of more data than humans do and it will

1086
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,879
be a matter of

1087
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,880
there will be algorithms that

1088
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,119
vastly decrease sample complexity i

1089
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,920
believe so but the place where we are

1090
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,000
heading today is dark domains which

1091
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,720
contains million x

1092
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,280
more

1093
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:03,118
data and even though computers might be

1094
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,760
1 000 times slower than humans in

1095
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,039
learning that's not the problem okay for

1096
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,480
instance

1097
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,599
i believe that

1098
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,199
it should be possible to create super

1099
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,960
human therapies

1100
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,199
uh by uh

1101
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,318
and and then they're like even simple

1102
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:22,480
steps of of doing what of of doing it

1103
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:25,119
and you know that the core reason is

1104
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,400
there is just machine will be able to

1105
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,318
read way more

1106
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,079
transcripts of therapies and then it

1107
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:31,679
should be able to speak simultaneously

1108
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,318
with many more people and it should be

1109
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,440
possible to optimize it uh all in

1110
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:37,838
parallel

1111
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,838
and well there's now you're touching on

1112
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,159
something i deeply care about and think

1113
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:43,279
is way harder than we imagined

1114
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,440
um

1115
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,519
what's the goal of a therapist what's it

1116
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,838
called therapies

1117
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,440
so okay so one goal now this is

1118
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:53,920
terrifying to me

1119
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,760
but there's a lot of people that

1120
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,318
contemplate suicide suffer from

1121
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,319
depression

1122
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,559
and they could significantly be helped

1123
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:05,759
with therapy

1124
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:08,078
and the idea that an ai algorithm might

1125
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,480
be in charge of that

1126
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,160
it's like a life and death task

1127
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,920
it's uh

1128
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,039
the stakes are high

1129
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,680
so one

1130
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:22,480
goal for a therapist whether human or ai

1131
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:25,759
is to prevent suicide ideation to

1132
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,559
prevent suicide how do you achieve that

1133
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
so

1134
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,960
let's see

1135
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,560
so

1136
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,960
to be clear i don't think that the

1137
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,960
current models are good enough for such

1138
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,960
a task because it requires insane amount

1139
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,480
of understanding and patty and the

1140
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,240
models are far from this place but it's

1141
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,760
but do you think that understanding

1142
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:47,279
empathy that signal is in the data um i

1143
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,880
think there is some signal in the data

1144
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,880
yes i mean there are plenty of

1145
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,519
transcripts of conversations

1146
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,358
and it is possible to

1147
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,920
it is possible from it to understand

1148
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:01,039
personalities it is possible from it to

1149
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,480
understand uh if conversation is

1150
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,880
a friendly

1151
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,440
uh amicable uh

1152
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,680
antagonistic it is i believe that the

1153
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,358
you know given the fact that the models

1154
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,759
that we train now

1155
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:13,759
they can

1156
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,039
they can have

1157
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,199
they are chameleons that they can have

1158
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,199
any personality they might turn out to

1159
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,199
be better in understanding

1160
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,759
uh personality of other people than

1161
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,519
anyone else and they feel pathetic to be

1162
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,359
empathetic yeah

1163
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:32,960
interesting uh but i wonder if there's

1164
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,400
some level

1165
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,599
of

1166
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,280
multiple modalities required

1167
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,920
to be able to

1168
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,920
be empathetic of the human experience

1169
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,159
whether language is not enough to

1170
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,920
understand death to understand fear to

1171
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:50,799
understand

1172
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,559
uh childhood trauma

1173
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,240
to understand uh wit and humor required

1174
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,799
when you're dancing with the person who

1175
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:01,358
might be depressed or suffering

1176
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,800
both humor and hope and love and all

1177
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:04,960
those kinds of things

1178
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,519
so there's another underlying question

1179
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,519
which is self-supervised versus

1180
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,838
supervised

1181
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:14,639
so can you get

1182
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:17,039
that from the data by just reading

1183
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:19,039
a huge number of transcripts i actually

1184
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,440
so i think that reading huge number of

1185
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:24,318
transcripts is a step one it's like the

1186
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,559
same way as you cannot learn to dance if

1187
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:28,318
just from youtube by watching it you

1188
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:30,639
have to actually try it out yourself

1189
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:33,199
yeah and so i think that here that's a

1190
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:35,598
similar situation i also wouldn't deploy

1191
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:38,318
the system in the high-stakes situations

1192
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,200
right away but kind of see gradually

1193
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:40,880
where

1194
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,879
it goes and

1195
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,200
obviously initially

1196
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,358
it would have to go hand with a hand in

1197
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:48,879
hand with humans but

1198
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,239
at the moment we are in the situation

1199
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,318
that actually

1200
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,879
there is many more people who actually

1201
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:56,559
would like to have a therapy or

1202
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,880
or speak with with someone then there

1203
00:43:56,559 --> 00:43:59,920
are therapies out there okay you know i

1204
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,960
was

1205
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,960
so so

1206
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,880
fundamentally i was thinking what are

1207
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,559
the things that

1208
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,318
can vastly increase people well-being

1209
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,559
therapy is one of them i think

1210
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:14,480
meditation is other one i guess maybe

1211
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,279
human connection is a third one and i

1212
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,280
guess

1213
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,119
pharmacologically it's also possible

1214
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,640
maybe direct brain stimulation or

1215
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,559
something like that but these are pretty

1216
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:24,960
much options out there then let's say

1217
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,960
the way i'm thinking about the agi

1218
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,800
endeavor is by default that's an

1219
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,039
endeavor to

1220
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,880
increase amount of wealth and i believe

1221
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,759
that we can vastly increase amount of

1222
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,720
wealth

1223
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,800
for everyone and simultaneously so i

1224
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:41,279
mean they're like two endeavors that

1225
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,359
make sense to me one is like essentially

1226
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,960
increase amount of wealth and second one

1227
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:48,880
is uh increase overall human well-being

1228
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,039
and those are coupled together and they

1229
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,318
they can okay i would say these are

1230
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:57,039
different topics one can help another

1231
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:59,440
and uh you know therapist is a funny

1232
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:02,239
word because i see friendship and love

1233
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,358
as therapy i mean so therapist broadly

1234
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,919
defined as just friendship as a friend

1235
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:10,559
so like therapist is has a very kind of

1236
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,960
clinical sense to it but

1237
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,599
what is human connection

1238
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,000
you're like uh

1239
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,160
not to get all camus and dostoyevsky on

1240
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,239
you but you know life is suffering and

1241
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,039
we draw

1242
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:26,639
we

1243
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:28,559
seek connection with other humans as we

1244
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:29,519
desperately try to make sense of this

1245
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,920
world

1246
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,039
in the deep overwhelming loneliness that

1247
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,480
we feel

1248
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,400
inside

1249
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,760
so i think connection has to do with

1250
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,920
understanding

1251
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,520
and i think that almost like a lack of

1252
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,519
understanding causes suffering if you

1253
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,318
speak with someone and you

1254
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:48,639
do you feel ignored that actually causes

1255
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:50,880
pain if you are feeling deeply

1256
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:52,719
understood that actually

1257
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,039
they they might not even tell you what

1258
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:57,439
to do in life but like a pure

1259
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:59,199
understanding or just being heard

1260
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,679
understanding is a kind of

1261
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:03,679
it's a lot you know just being heard

1262
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,199
feel like you're being heard

1263
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,399
like somehow

1264
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,679
that's uh alleviation temporarily of the

1265
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,000
loneliness

1266
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:14,480
that if somebody

1267
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,480
knows you're here

1268
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,240
with their body language with the way

1269
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,079
they are with the way they look at you

1270
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:23,679
with the way they talk

1271
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:26,079
you feel less alone for a brief moment

1272
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,960
yeah very very much agree so i thought

1273
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,519
in the past about uh somewhat similar

1274
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:35,199
question to yours which is what is love

1275
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:37,039
uh rather what is connection yes and um

1276
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,199
and obviously i think about these things

1277
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:40,079
from ai perspective what would it mean

1278
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,199
um

1279
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,200
so i said that the you know intelligence

1280
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,960
has to do with some compression which is

1281
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:49,279
more or less like i can say almost

1282
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,079
understanding of what is going around it

1283
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,400
seems to me that uh other aspect is

1284
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,839
there seem to be reward functions and

1285
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:01,039
you can have a you know reward for

1286
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:03,119
uh food for maybe human connection for

1287
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:03,920
uh let's say warmth

1288
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,760
uh

1289
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,240
sex and so on

1290
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,800
and um

1291
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,719
and it turns out that the various people

1292
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,318
might be optimizing slightly different

1293
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,318
reward functions they essentially might

1294
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:18,400
care about different things

1295
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:19,920
and um

1296
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,760
in case of

1297
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,880
love at least the love between two

1298
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,480
people you can say that the um you know

1299
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,838
boundary between people dissolves to

1300
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,920
such extent that

1301
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:32,318
they end up optimizing each other reward

1302
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,318
functions

1303
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,838
yeah

1304
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,159
oh that's interesting um

1305
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:41,838
the success of each other yeah in some

1306
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:42,799
sense i would say love means

1307
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:45,119
uh

1308
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,559
helping others to optimize their uh

1309
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,000
reward functions not your reward

1310
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,680
functions not the things that you think

1311
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,119
are important but the things that the

1312
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:56,639
person cares about you try to help them

1313
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:58,720
to optimize it so love is uh

1314
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,639
if you think of two reward functions you

1315
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,239
just it's a condition yeah you combine

1316
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,318
them together yeah pretty much maybe

1317
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:06,399
like with a weight and it depends like

1318
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:07,679
the dynamic of the relationship yeah i

1319
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,760
mean you could imagine that if you are

1320
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,598
fully uh optimizing someone's reward

1321
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,200
function without yours then yeah then

1322
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,200
maybe are creating code dependency or

1323
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:16,558
something like that yeah

1324
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:18,399
i'm not sure what's the appropriate

1325
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,200
weight but the interesting thing is i

1326
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,358
even

1327
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,399
i even think that the

1328
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:24,400
individual person

1329
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,400
we ourselves we are actually

1330
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,558
less of a

1331
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,960
unified insight so for instance if you

1332
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,960
look at the donut on the one level you

1333
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,800
might think oh this like it looks tasty

1334
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,559
i would like to eat it on another level

1335
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,920
you might tell yourself i shouldn't be

1336
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,200
doing it because

1337
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,960
i want to gain muscles so and you know

1338
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:47,439
you might do it regardless kind of

1339
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,280
against yourself so it seems that even

1340
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,760
within ourselves they're almost like a

1341
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,880
kind of intertwined personas

1342
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,119
and

1343
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,400
i believe that the self-love

1344
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,800
means that

1345
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,880
the love between all these persons which

1346
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,960
also means being able to

1347
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,519
love love

1348
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,440
yourself when we are angry or stressed

1349
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,119
or so combining all those reward

1350
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,039
functions of the different selves you

1351
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,960
have yeah and accepting that they are

1352
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:15,358
there okay you know often people they

1353
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,599
have a negative self-talk or they say i

1354
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:19,519
don't like when i'm angry and like i try

1355
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,318
to imagine

1356
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,519
try to imagine if there would be

1357
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:26,400
like a

1358
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:29,280
small baby alex like a five years old

1359
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,960
who's angry angry and then you're like

1360
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,200
you shouldn't be angry like stop being

1361
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,519
angry yeah but like instead actually you

1362
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,239
want the legs to come over give him a

1363
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,239
hug and he's like i say it's fine okay

1364
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:42,318
you can't be angry as long as you want

1365
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,199
yeah then he would stop

1366
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:45,199
or

1367
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,199
or maybe not or maybe not but you cannot

1368
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,199
expect it even yeah

1369
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:51,279
but still that doesn't explain the why

1370
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:53,679
of love like why is love part of the

1371
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,640
human condition why is it useful

1372
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:58,399
to combine the reward functions

1373
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:00,078
it seems like

1374
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,440
that doesn't i mean

1375
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,000
i don't think reinforcement learning

1376
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,240
frameworks can give us answers to why

1377
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,400
even even the hudder

1378
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:12,078
framework has an objective function

1379
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,480
that's static so we came to existence as

1380
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,160
a consequence of evolutionary process

1381
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,960
and in some sense the purpose of

1382
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,920
evolution is survival and then the

1383
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,480
this

1384
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,200
complicated optimization objective

1385
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,800
baked into us let's say compression

1386
00:50:25,199 --> 00:50:28,480
which might help us

1387
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,960
operate in the real world and it bake

1388
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,199
into us various reward functions yeah

1389
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,440
and then to be clear at the moment we

1390
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,960
are operating in the regime which is

1391
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,200
somewhat out of distribution where the

1392
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,440
event evolution optimized us it's almost

1393
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,439
like love is a consequence of

1394
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,240
cooperation that we've discovered is

1395
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,318
useful correct in some way it's even the

1396
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:51,199
case if you i just love the idea that

1397
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:52,558
love is like the out of distribution

1398
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:54,078
or it's not out of distribution it's

1399
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,359
like as you that it evolved for

1400
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,839
cooperation

1401
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,519
yes and i believe that the cop like a in

1402
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,358
some sense cooperation ends up helping

1403
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:04,079
each of us individually so it makes

1404
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:06,400
sense evolutionary and there is a in

1405
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,318
some sense and you know love means there

1406
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,880
is this dissolution of boundaries that

1407
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:12,960
you have a shared reward function and we

1408
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,400
evolve to actually identify ourselves

1409
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,720
with larger groups so we we can identify

1410
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,720
ourselves you know with a family we can

1411
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:22,399
identify ourselves with a country to

1412
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,339
such an extent that people are willing

1413
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,440
to give away their life for country

1414
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,160
[Music]

1415
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,039
so there is we are wired actually even

1416
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,399
uh

1417
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:34,480
for love and at the moment i guess

1418
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,358
the

1419
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,280
maybe

1420
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,519
it would be somewhat more beneficial if

1421
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,079
you will if we would identify ourselves

1422
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:43,838
with all the humanity as a whole so so

1423
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,440
you can clearly see when people travel

1424
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:48,000
around the world when they run into

1425
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,838
person from the same country they say oh

1426
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
which ctr and all this like all of a

1427
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:54,639
sudden they find all these similarities

1428
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,039
they they they find some they befriend

1429
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,558
those folks earlier than others so there

1430
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:00,558
is like a sense some sense of the

1431
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,200
belonging and i would say i think it

1432
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,480
would be overall good thing to the word

1433
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:05,279
for people

1434
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,039
to

1435
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,400
move towards

1436
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,838
i think it's even called open

1437
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:14,559
individualism and move toward the

1438
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:16,400
mindset of a larger and larger groups so

1439
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:18,319
the challenge there

1440
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,200
that's a beautiful vision and i share it

1441
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:23,039
to expand that circle of empathy that

1442
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,358
circle of love towards the entirety of

1443
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,279
humanity but then you start to ask well

1444
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:29,279
where do you draw the line

1445
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,319
because why not expand it to other

1446
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,240
conscious beings and then at the finally

1447
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,838
for our discussion

1448
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:39,358
something i think about

1449
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:41,519
is why not expand it to ai systems

1450
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:44,078
like we we start respecting each other

1451
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:45,679
when the other the person the entity on

1452
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,920
the other side

1453
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:50,639
has the capacity to suffer because then

1454
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,318
we develop a capacity to sort of

1455
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:53,279
empathize

1456
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:54,960
and so

1457
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,880
i could see ai systems that are

1458
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,159
interacting with humans

1459
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,358
more and more having conscious like

1460
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:03,519
displays

1461
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:05,759
so like they display consciousness

1462
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:08,159
through language and through other means

1463
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,760
and so then the question is like well is

1464
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,920
that consciousness

1465
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,200
because they're acting conscious

1466
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,358
and so

1467
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,838
you know the reason we don't like

1468
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:19,199
torturing animals

1469
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:20,719
is because

1470
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:22,399
they look like they're suffering when

1471
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:26,558
they're tortured

1472
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:29,200
and if ai looks like it's suffering

1473
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,160
when it's tortured

1474
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:32,159
how is that not

1475
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:37,279
requiring of the same kind of empathy

1476
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,280
from us and respect and rights

1477
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,200
that animals do and other humans do i

1478
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,400
think it requires empathy as well i mean

1479
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:44,879
i would like

1480
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,559
i guess us or humanity or so make a

1481
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,079
progress in

1482
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,000
understanding what consciousness is

1483
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,160
because i don't want just to be speaking

1484
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,280
about that the philosophy but rather

1485
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:57,039
actually make a scientific uh to have a

1486
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,400
like a you know there was a time that

1487
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,159
people thought that

1488
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,200
there is a force

1489
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:02,399
of life

1490
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:03,118
and

1491
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,119
the

1492
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,960
things that have this force they are

1493
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,160
alive

1494
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,480
and

1495
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:13,679
i think that there is actually a path to

1496
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,280
understand exactly what consciousness is

1497
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:18,078
and

1498
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,319
um in some sense it might require

1499
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,760
essentially putting probes inside of a

1500
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:23,199
human brain

1501
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,960
what neuralink

1502
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:26,480
does so the goal there i mean there's

1503
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,280
several things with consciousness that

1504
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,318
make it a real discipline which is one

1505
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,920
is rigorous measurement of consciousness

1506
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:35,599
and then the other is the engineering of

1507
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,159
consciousness which may or may not be

1508
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,318
related i mean you could also run into

1509
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,358
trouble like for example in the united

1510
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,679
states

1511
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:46,078
for the department d.o.t department of

1512
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:48,558
transportation and a lot of different

1513
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,160
places put a value on human life

1514
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,480
i think dot's

1515
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,159
uh values nine million dollars per

1516
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,838
person

1517
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:57,759
sort of in that same way you can get

1518
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,838
into trouble

1519
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,960
if you put a number on how conscious a

1520
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,358
being is

1521
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,280
because then you can start making policy

1522
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:08,000
if a cow

1523
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,920
is uh 0.1

1524
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,639
or like um

1525
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,559
10 as conscious as a human then you can

1526
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,000
start making calculations and might get

1527
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,798
you into trouble but then again that

1528
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,719
might be a very good way to do it

1529
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:22,639
i would like uh

1530
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:23,919
to move to that place that actually we

1531
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:25,920
have scientific understanding what

1532
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,838
consciousness is yeah and then we'll be

1533
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,079
able to actually assign value and i

1534
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:35,358
believe that there is even the path for

1535
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:37,920
the experimentation in it so uh you know

1536
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:39,759
we said that you know you could put the

1537
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,159
probes inside of the brain there is

1538
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,799
actually few other things that you could

1539
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:46,719
do with devices like neuralink so you

1540
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:49,440
could imagine that the way even to

1541
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:51,679
measure if ai system is conscious

1542
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,960
is by literally just plugging into the

1543
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:54,399
brain

1544
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,880
and i mean that that seems that's kind

1545
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,639
of easy but the plugging into the brain

1546
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,880
and asking person if they feel that

1547
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:02,960
their consciousness expanded

1548
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,640
this direction of course has some issues

1549
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,400
you can say you know if someone takes a

1550
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:08,480
psychedelic drug they might feel that

1551
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,039
their consciousness expanded even though

1552
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,199
that drug itself is not conscious

1553
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,920
right so like you can't fully trust the

1554
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:20,078
self-report of a person saying their

1555
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,079
their consciousness is expanded or not

1556
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,358
let me ask you a little bit about

1557
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:25,440
psychedelics because uh there's been a

1558
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:28,078
lot of excellent research on uh

1559
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,559
different psychedelics psilocybin mdma

1560
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,359
yeah even dmt

1561
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:35,599
drugs in general marijuana too

1562
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:38,480
uh what do you think psychedelics do to

1563
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,318
the human mind it seems they take

1564
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,838
the human mind to some interesting

1565
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:44,480
places

1566
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:46,078
is that just a little uh hack

1567
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,079
a visual hack

1568
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,359
or is there some profound expansion of

1569
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,240
the mind

1570
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:55,440
so let's see i i don't believe in magic

1571
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:57,279
i believe in that i believe in

1572
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,760
in science in

1573
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,000
in causality

1574
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,880
still let's say and then as i said like

1575
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,119
i think that the brain

1576
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,079
that the our subjective experience of

1577
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:12,240
reality is uh

1578
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,318
we live in the simulation run by our

1579
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:15,199
brain and the simulation that our brain

1580
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:17,279
runs

1581
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,118
they can be very pleasant or very

1582
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,280
hellish

1583
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,440
drugs they are changing some hyper

1584
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,440
parameters of the simulation it is

1585
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,318
possible thanks to change of these hyper

1586
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,400
parameters to actually look back on your

1587
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:33,759
experience and even see that the given

1588
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,440
things that we took for granted they are

1589
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,760
changeable

1590
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,480
so they allow to have a

1591
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,960
amazing perspective there is also

1592
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,960
for instance the fact that after dmt

1593
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,599
people can see the

1594
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,480
full movie inside of their head

1595
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:52,400
gives me further belief

1596
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,519
that the brain can generate that full

1597
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,760
movie that the brain is actually

1598
00:57:55,519 --> 00:57:59,440
learning the model of reality to such

1599
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,200
extent that it tries to predict what's

1600
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,358
going to happen next yeah very high

1601
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:06,078
resolution so it can replay realities

1602
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:08,400
actually extremely high resolution

1603
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,640
and it's also kind of interesting to me

1604
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,440
that somehow there seems to be some

1605
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:16,960
similarity between

1606
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:19,119
these uh drugs and meditation itself and

1607
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:22,240
i actually started even these days to

1608
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:24,480
think about meditation as a psychedelic

1609
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:27,279
and do you practice meditation

1610
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,798
i i practice meditation i mean i once

1611
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,920
few times on the

1612
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:36,440
retreats and it feels after like after

1613
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,440
second or third day of meditation

1614
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:41,679
there is a there is almost like a sense

1615
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:44,719
of you know tripping

1616
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:46,000
what does the meditation retreat entail

1617
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:48,399
so

1618
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,880
i mean you you wake up early in the

1619
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,400
morning and you meditate for extended

1620
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,400
period of time

1621
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,480
and alone

1622
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,039
yeah so it's optimized even though there

1623
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,358
are other people it's optimized for

1624
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:02,719
isolation so you don't speak with anyone

1625
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:04,558
you don't actually look into other

1626
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:05,759
people's eyes

1627
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,960
and

1628
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:12,079
you know you sit on the chair and

1629
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:15,679
say the passage meditation tells you uh

1630
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:19,039
to focus on the breath so you try to put

1631
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:20,879
all the all attention into breathing and

1632
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:21,759
breathing in and breathing out

1633
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,039
and the

1634
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:26,559
crazy thing is that as you focus

1635
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:28,480
attention like that

1636
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,559
after some time

1637
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,679
their stamps starts coming back like

1638
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,400
some

1639
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:37,358
memories that you completely forgotten

1640
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:39,519
it almost feels like um that you have a

1641
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:41,679
mailbox and then you

1642
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:43,599
you know you are just like a archiving

1643
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:45,838
email one by one

1644
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:47,119
and at some point at some point there is

1645
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:48,480
like a

1646
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,559
amazing feeling

1647
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,599
of getting to mailbox zero

1648
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:56,079
zero emails and uh it's very pleasant

1649
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:57,359
it's it's kind of it's it's

1650
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,798
it's

1651
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:00,159
crazy to me

1652
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:02,639
that

1653
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:04,558
that once

1654
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:08,078
you resolve these

1655
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:10,400
inner stories or like inner traumas

1656
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,920
then once there is nothing

1657
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,440
uh left

1658
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,599
the default state of human mind is

1659
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:22,240
extremely peaceful and happy extreme

1660
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,240
like some sense it it feels that

1661
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:26,798
it feels

1662
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,599
at least to me in the way how when i was

1663
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:30,000
a

1664
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,079
child that i can look at any object and

1665
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:34,559
it's very beautiful i have a lot of

1666
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:37,839
curiosity about the simple things and

1667
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,880
that's where usually meditation takes me

1668
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:40,960
are you

1669
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,599
what are you experiencing are you just

1670
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:46,000
taking in simple sensory

1671
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:48,559
information and they're just enjoying

1672
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,239
the rawness of that sensory information

1673
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,079
so there's no

1674
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:54,318
there's no memories all that kind of

1675
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,440
stuff you're just enjoying

1676
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,719
being

1677
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,798
yeah pretty much i mean still there is a

1678
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:04,399
there it's it's thoughts are slowing

1679
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:06,318
down sometimes they pop up but it's also

1680
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,240
somehow the extended meditation takes

1681
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:10,880
you to the space that they are

1682
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:13,118
way more friendly you know way more

1683
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:16,880
positive um

1684
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:18,240
there is also this uh this thing that

1685
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,519
we've actually

1686
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,519
it almost feels that the

1687
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:26,719
it almost feels that the we are

1688
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,559
constantly getting a little bit of a

1689
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:30,159
reward function and we are just

1690
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,920
spreading this reward function on

1691
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:35,440
various activities but if you stay still

1692
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,519
for extended period of time it kind of

1693
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,880
accumulates accumulates accumulates

1694
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:41,440
and

1695
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:43,440
there is a there is a sense there is a

1696
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,119
sense that at some point it passes some

1697
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:49,838
threshold and it feels as

1698
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,760
drop is falling into kind of ocean of

1699
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:53,358
love and bliss and that's like a

1700
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,039
this is like a very pleasant and as i'm

1701
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:56,880
saying okay

1702
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,079
that corresponds to the subjective

1703
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,200
experience

1704
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:03,280
some people

1705
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:05,759
uh i guess in spiritual community they

1706
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,359
describe it that that's the reality and

1707
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,359
i would say i believe that they're like

1708
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:11,920
all sorts of subjective experience that

1709
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,920
one can have and

1710
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,440
i believe that for instance meditation

1711
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,880
might take you to the subjective

1712
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,280
experiences which are very pleasant

1713
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:22,640
collaborative and i would like a word to

1714
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,640
move toward a more collaborative uh

1715
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:26,558
place

1716
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:29,358
yeah i would say that's very pleasant

1717
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,839
that i enjoy doing stuff like that i i

1718
01:02:29,358 --> 01:02:34,719
i wonder how that maps to your uh

1719
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:36,558
mathematical model of love with the

1720
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:37,838
the reward function combining a bunch of

1721
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:41,200
things

1722
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:43,440
it seems like our life

1723
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:45,519
then is we're just we have this reward

1724
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,039
function and we're accumulating a bunch

1725
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:48,960
of stuff in it

1726
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,960
with weights

1727
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,039
it's like um

1728
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,000
like multi-objective

1729
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,559
and

1730
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,639
what meditation is is you just remove

1731
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:03,680
them remove them until the weight on one

1732
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:06,318
or just a few is is very high and that's

1733
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:07,919
where the pleasure comes from yeah so

1734
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:11,358
something similar how i'm thinking about

1735
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:14,000
this so i told you that there is like a

1736
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:16,318
there is a story of who you are

1737
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,318
and i think almost about it as a you

1738
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:21,838
know text prepended to gpt

1739
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:24,639
yeah and

1740
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:26,318
some people refer to it as ego okay it's

1741
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:28,798
like a story

1742
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:31,759
who who you are okay so ego is the

1743
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:33,440
prompt for gpt three gpg yes yes and

1744
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,280
that's description of you and then with

1745
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,519
meditation you can get to the point that

1746
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,280
actually you experience things without

1747
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:41,759
the prompt

1748
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,440
and you experience things like as they

1749
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,599
are you are not biased over the

1750
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,480
description how they supposed to be

1751
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,000
uh

1752
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,400
that's very pleasant and then with

1753
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,079
respect to the reward function uh it's

1754
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,760
possible to

1755
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,359
get to the point that the there is

1756
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,119
dissolution of self

1757
01:03:55,358 --> 01:03:59,440
and therefore you can say that they are

1758
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,519
you you're having a you're or like your

1759
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,280
brain attempts to simulate the reward

1760
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:05,358
function of everyone else or like

1761
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,119
everything that's there is this like a

1762
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:08,639
love which feels like a oneness with

1763
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,720
everything

1764
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:13,118
and that's also you know very beautiful

1765
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:14,798
very pleasant at some point

1766
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,880
you might have a lot of altruistic

1767
01:04:14,798 --> 01:04:19,440
thoughts during that moment and then

1768
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,798
the self uh always comes back how would

1769
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,798
you recommend

1770
01:04:20,798 --> 01:04:25,358
if somebody is interested in meditation

1771
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:27,280
like a big thing to take on as a project

1772
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:29,199
would you recommend a meditation retreat

1773
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,200
how many days what kind of thing would

1774
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:34,239
you recommend i think that actually

1775
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:36,480
retreat is the way to go and it almost

1776
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:38,318
feels that

1777
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,240
as i said like a meditation is a

1778
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:42,239
psychedelic but

1779
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:44,239
when you take it in the small dose you

1780
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:47,038
might barely feel it once you get the

1781
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:48,479
high dose actually you're gonna feel it

1782
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,000
um

1783
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,519
so even cold turkey if you haven't

1784
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,440
really seriously meditated for a

1785
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:55,920
prolonged period of time just go to a

1786
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,159
retreat yeah how many days how many days

1787
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,519
start the weekend one weekend so like

1788
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:01,679
two three days

1789
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:04,639
and it's like it's interesting that

1790
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:07,358
first or second day it's hard and at

1791
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:09,598
some point it becomes easy

1792
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:11,598
there's a lot of seconds in a day how

1793
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,838
hard is the meditation retreat just

1794
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:17,039
sitting there in a chair

1795
01:05:13,838 --> 01:05:20,719
so the thing is actually

1796
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:22,960
it literally just depends on your uh

1797
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,959
on death your own framing like if you

1798
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,519
are in the mindset that you are waiting

1799
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,679
for it to be over or you are waiting for

1800
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:31,679
nirvana to happen it will be very

1801
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,399
unpleasant yeah and in some sense even

1802
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:34,838
the

1803
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,280
difficulty it's not even in

1804
01:05:34,838 --> 01:05:38,400
the lack of being able to speak with

1805
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,000
others like

1806
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,559
you are sitting there your

1807
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,559
legs will hurt from sitting

1808
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:46,880
in terms of like the practical things do

1809
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:49,119
you experience kind of discomfort like

1810
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,000
physical discomfort of just sitting like

1811
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:54,160
your your butt being numb your

1812
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,880
legs being sore all that kind of stuff

1813
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:58,960
yes you experience it and then the

1814
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,039
they teach you to observe it

1815
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,838
rather and it's like a the crazy thing

1816
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,760
is

1817
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:06,078
you at first might have a feeling toward

1818
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,599
trying to escape it yeah and that

1819
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,480
becomes very apparent that that's

1820
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:12,798
extremely unpleasant and then you just

1821
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,358
just observe it and

1822
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:17,038
at some point it it just becomes uh it

1823
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:19,920
just is

1824
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:22,079
it's like a i remember with ilya told me

1825
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,639
some time ago that uh you know he takes

1826
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,960
a cold shower and his mindset of taking

1827
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:29,838
a court cold shower was to

1828
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,838
embrace suffering yeah excellent i do

1829
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:32,798
the same there's the art style yes my

1830
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:34,159
style

1831
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:37,519
i like this

1832
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:40,639
so my style is actually i also sometimes

1833
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:42,639
take cold showers it is purely observing

1834
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:44,159
how the water goes through my body like

1835
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:47,358
a purely being present not trying to

1836
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:51,279
escape from there yeah and i would say

1837
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:51,279
then it actually becomes pleasant

1838
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,880
it's not like ah well that that's

1839
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:59,119
interesting um

1840
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,400
i i'm also that mean that's that's the

1841
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,680
way to deal with anything really

1842
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,880
difficult especially in the physical

1843
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:04,480
space is

1844
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:07,838
to observe it

1845
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,838
to say it's pleasant

1846
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,240
it's a i would use a different word

1847
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:16,319
your uh

1848
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:20,318
you're accepting of the full beauty of

1849
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:22,079
reality i would say because say pleasant

1850
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:23,679
but yeah i mean in some sense it is

1851
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,599
pleasant that's the only way to deal

1852
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:29,358
with a cold shower

1853
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:31,599
is to to become an observer and to find

1854
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:33,759
joy in it

1855
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:36,400
same with like really difficult physical

1856
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:38,400
uh exercise or like running for a really

1857
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,000
long time endurance events

1858
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,318
just anytime you're exhausted any kind

1859
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,480
of pain i think the only way to survive

1860
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:46,000
it is not to resist it just to observe

1861
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,880
it

1862
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,679
you mentioned ilya elias discover

1863
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,760
he's very he's our chief scientist but

1864
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:57,199
also he's very close friend of mine he

1865
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:59,200
co-founded open air with you i've spoken

1866
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:02,399
with him a few times he's brilliant i

1867
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:02,399
really enjoy talking to him

1868
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,960
his mind just like yours works in

1869
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,880
fascinating ways

1870
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,760
now both of you are not able to define

1871
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,640
deep learning simply

1872
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,079
uh what's it like having him

1873
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:17,519
as somebody you have technical

1874
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:20,079
discussions with

1875
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:23,359
on in space machine learning

1876
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:27,759
deep learning ai but also life

1877
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:30,239
what's it like when these two uh agents

1878
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:32,319
get into a self-play situation in in a

1879
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,039
room what's it like collaborating with

1880
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,279
him

1881
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:38,880
so i believe that we have

1882
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:39,920
extreme uh respect to each other so

1883
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,719
um

1884
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,119
i mean

1885
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:49,600
i love ilia's insight both like uh

1886
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:52,079
i guess about consciousness uh life ai

1887
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,199
but uh in terms of the it's interesting

1888
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:54,000
to me because

1889
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:55,838
you're

1890
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,600
a brilliant

1891
01:08:55,838 --> 01:08:59,119
uh

1892
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,520
thinker in the space of machine learning

1893
01:08:59,119 --> 01:09:03,759
like intuition like digging deep

1894
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,480
in what works

1895
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:09,198
what doesn't why it works why it doesn't

1896
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:10,639
and so is ilia i'm wondering if there's

1897
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:12,399
interesting

1898
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,400
deep discussions you've had with him in

1899
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:17,358
the past or disagreements that were very

1900
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:19,599
productive so i can say

1901
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,400
i also understood over the time where

1902
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,159
are

1903
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:25,439
my strengths so obviously we have plenty

1904
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:26,719
of ai discussions and

1905
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,479
um

1906
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:31,679
and you know i myself have plenty of

1907
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:34,158
ideas but like i consider ilya

1908
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,679
one of the most prolific ai scientists

1909
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,479
in the entire world

1910
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:37,679
and

1911
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:41,278
i think that

1912
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:42,560
um i realized that maybe my super skill

1913
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,000
is

1914
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,679
being able to bring people to

1915
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,640
collaborate together that i have some

1916
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:51,039
level of empathy that is unique in ai

1917
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,520
world and that might come you know from

1918
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:55,198
either meditation psychedelics or let's

1919
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,440
say i read just hundreds of books on

1920
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:59,839
this topic so and i also went through a

1921
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:03,119
journey of you know i develop all sorts

1922
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:04,880
of algorithms so i think that

1923
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:06,319
maybe i can

1924
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,640
that's my

1925
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:10,079
super human skill uh

1926
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,039
ilia is

1927
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:15,679
one of the best ai scientists but then

1928
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:17,679
i'm pretty good in assembling teams and

1929
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,279
i'm also not holding two people like i'm

1930
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:21,520
growing people and then people become

1931
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:23,599
managers that open yeah there's room any

1932
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,080
of them like a research manager

1933
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,000
so you you find

1934
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:30,880
you find places where you're excellent

1935
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,439
and and he finds like his his deep

1936
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,119
scientific insights is where he is and

1937
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:36,960
you find ways you can

1938
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:38,719
the puzzle pieces fit together correct

1939
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,920
okay you know ultimately for instance

1940
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:43,600
let's say ilia he doesn't manage people

1941
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:46,158
uh that's not

1942
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,719
what he likes or so um

1943
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:50,479
i i like i like hanging out with people

1944
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:53,198
by default i'm an extrovert and i care

1945
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:55,678
about people oh interesting okay

1946
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:58,158
okay cool so that that fits perfectly

1947
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:59,760
together but i i mean uh i also just

1948
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:01,599
like your intuition about various

1949
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:04,480
problems in machine learning

1950
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,199
he's definitely one i really enjoy

1951
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:09,678
i remember talking to him

1952
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:11,279
about something i was struggling with

1953
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,800
which is

1954
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:14,639
coming up with a good model for

1955
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,880
pedestrians

1956
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,760
for human beings across the street in

1957
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,560
the context of autonomous vehicles

1958
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:24,400
and he immediately started to like

1959
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,440
formulate a framework within which you

1960
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:28,960
can evolve a model for pedestrians like

1961
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:31,119
through self-play all that kind of

1962
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,760
mechanisms

1963
01:11:31,119 --> 01:11:35,279
the depth of thought on a particular

1964
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,640
problem especially problems he doesn't

1965
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:38,479
know anything about

1966
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:42,320
is fascinating to watch

1967
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:42,319
it makes you realize like um

1968
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,719
yeah the the limits of the

1969
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:48,238
that the human intellect might be

1970
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,319
limitless

1971
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:52,639
or it's just impressive to see a descent

1972
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:55,359
on the vape come up with clever ideas

1973
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:57,360
yeah i mean so even in the space of deep

1974
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:59,759
learning when you look at various people

1975
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,359
there are people you know who

1976
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,000
invented

1977
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:05,759
some breakthroughs once but there are

1978
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,279
very few people who did it multiple

1979
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,719
times and you can think if someone

1980
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:11,599
invented it once

1981
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:13,520
that might be just a shared luck

1982
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,120
and if someone invented it multiple

1983
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,360
times you know if a probability of

1984
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:19,039
inventing it once is one over a million

1985
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:20,158
then probability of inventing it twice

1986
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:21,359
or three times would be one over a

1987
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:23,119
million square

1988
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:25,359
or to the power of three

1989
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:28,719
which which would be just impossible so

1990
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:31,679
it literally means that it's it's given

1991
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:35,279
that uh it's not the luck yeah and ilea

1992
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:37,679
is one of these few people who um

1993
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:40,719
who have uh a lot of these inventions in

1994
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:42,480
his arsenal it also feels that the

1995
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:44,560
now for instance if you think about

1996
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:46,399
folks like gauss or euler

1997
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,120
and you know

1998
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:51,519
at first they read a lot of books

1999
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:53,840
and then they did thinking and then they

2000
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,400
figure out math

2001
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:58,079
and that's how it feels with ilya yeah

2002
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:00,960
you know at first he read stuff and then

2003
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:02,719
like he spent his thinking cycles

2004
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,600
and

2005
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:07,250
that's a really good way to put it

2006
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,560
when i talk to him

2007
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,679
[Music]

2008
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,239
i

2009
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:14,319
i see thinking

2010
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:16,079
he's actually thinking

2011
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:18,158
like he makes me realize that there's

2012
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,880
like deep thinking that the human mind

2013
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:22,399
can do like most of us are not thinking

2014
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,079
deeply

2015
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:26,479
like you really have to put a lot of

2016
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:28,960
effort to think deeply like i have to

2017
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:30,799
really put myself in a place where i

2018
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,119
think deeply about a problem it takes a

2019
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,640
lot of effort it's like a it's like an

2020
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:37,359
airplane taking off or something you

2021
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,480
have to achieve deep focus he he's just

2022
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:40,000
uh

2023
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:43,439
he's what is it

2024
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,920
his brain is like a vertical takeoff

2025
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:47,678
in terms of airplane analogy so it's

2026
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,600
interesting but

2027
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:51,840
it i mean cal newport talks about this

2028
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,400
as ideas of deep work

2029
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,480
it's you know most of us don't work much

2030
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:58,559
at all in terms of like

2031
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,879
like deeply think about particular

2032
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,960
problems whether it's math engineering

2033
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:05,119
all that kind of stuff

2034
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,600
you want to go to that place often and

2035
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:09,679
that's real hard work and some of us are

2036
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,840
better than others at that so i think

2037
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,679
that the big piece has to do with

2038
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,840
actually even engineering your

2039
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,000
environment such that it's conducive to

2040
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:21,440
that yeah so um

2041
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,520
see both ilia and i uh on the frequent

2042
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:25,919
basis we kind of disconnect ourselves

2043
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,560
from the world in order to be able to do

2044
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:30,000
extensive amount of thinking yes so ilia

2045
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,600
usually

2046
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,198
he just

2047
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,159
leaves ipad

2048
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:37,599
at hand he loves his ipad

2049
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:39,198
and

2050
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,640
for me i'm even

2051
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:43,519
sometimes you know just going for a few

2052
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:45,280
days to different location to airbnb i'm

2053
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,000
turning off my phone

2054
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:48,960
and there is no access to me yeah

2055
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,439
and

2056
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,600
that's extremely important for me to be

2057
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:55,919
able to actually just formulate new

2058
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:59,199
thoughts to do deep work rather than to

2059
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:01,840
be reactive and the the older i am the

2060
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:03,279
more of these like random tasks are at

2061
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,840
hand

2062
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:06,880
before i go on to that uh thread let me

2063
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,199
return

2064
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,119
to our friend gpt

2065
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:12,238
let me ask you another ridiculously big

2066
01:15:11,119 --> 01:15:14,800
question

2067
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:15,759
can you give an overview of what gpt 3

2068
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,159
is

2069
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:20,320
or like you say in your twitter bio gpt

2070
01:15:18,158 --> 01:15:21,599
n plus one

2071
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:26,960
how it works

2072
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:29,440
and why it works so um gpt 3 is a

2073
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,880
humongous neural network and let's

2074
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,279
assume that we know what is neural

2075
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:36,400
network okay by the definition

2076
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:38,719
and it is trained on the entire internet

2077
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:41,119
and just to predict

2078
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:44,719
next word so let's say it sees part of

2079
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:46,880
the uh article and it the only task that

2080
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:48,880
it has at hand it is to say what would

2081
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,079
be the next word uh what would be the

2082
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,560
next word

2083
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:54,238
and it becomes uh

2084
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,480
really exceptional at the task of

2085
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:57,519
figuring out what's the next word so you

2086
01:15:56,479 --> 01:16:01,599
might ask

2087
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:03,440
why would this be an important task why

2088
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,880
would it be important to predict what's

2089
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:07,678
the next word

2090
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,840
and it turns out that a lot of problems

2091
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,640
uh can be formulated

2092
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,520
uh

2093
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:16,480
as a text completion problem so gpt is

2094
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:18,080
purely uh learning to complete the text

2095
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:20,879
and you could imagine for instance if

2096
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:22,800
you are asking a question who is a

2097
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,840
president of united states

2098
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:28,000
then gpt can give you an answer to it

2099
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,400
it turns out that many more things can

2100
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,279
be formulated this way you can format

2101
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:32,960
text

2102
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:34,479
in the way that you have sentence in

2103
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,319
english

2104
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:38,799
you make it even look like a some

2105
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:40,238
content of a website uh elsewhere which

2106
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,079
would be teaching people how to

2107
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:44,238
translate things between languages so it

2108
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:48,719
would be en colon

2109
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:50,479
text in english fr colon and then you uh

2110
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:52,800
and then you ask people and then you ask

2111
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:55,198
model to to continue and it turns out

2112
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:57,440
that the such a model is predicting

2113
01:16:55,198 --> 01:17:00,319
translation from english to french the

2114
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:01,599
crazy thing is that

2115
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:03,920
this model

2116
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:06,400
can be used for way more sophisticated

2117
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:08,239
tasks so you can format text such that

2118
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:10,719
it looks like a conversation between two

2119
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:13,198
people and that might be a conversation

2120
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:15,679
between you and elon musk and because

2121
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:16,639
the model read all the texts about elon

2122
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,800
musk

2123
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,560
it will be able to predict elon musk

2124
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,800
words as it would be elon musk it will

2125
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,760
speak about colonization of

2126
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,960
mars

2127
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:30,239
about sustainable future and so on and

2128
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:32,480
it's also possible to

2129
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:34,238
to even give arbitrary personality to

2130
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:37,839
the model you can say here is a

2131
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:41,279
conversation with a friendly ai bot

2132
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:45,679
and the model uh will complete the text

2133
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:47,519
as a friendly ai bot so i mean

2134
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:49,679
how do i express how

2135
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:51,679
amazing this is so

2136
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:54,079
just to clarify

2137
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:56,000
a conversation generating a conversation

2138
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:59,519
between me and elon musk

2139
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:01,840
it wouldn't just generate good

2140
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,320
examples of what elon would say

2141
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,719
it would get the syntax all correct so

2142
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:09,759
like interview style you would say like

2143
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:11,679
elon colon and lex con like it it's not

2144
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,640
just like uh

2145
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:16,239
inklings of

2146
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,520
semantic

2147
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:21,119
correctness

2148
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,800
it's like the whole thing grammatical

2149
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:24,479
syntactic

2150
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,199
semantic

2151
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:29,839
it's just really really impressive

2152
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:32,079
uh generalization

2153
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,560
yeah i mean i also want to you know

2154
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:36,800
provide some caveats so it can generate

2155
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:40,080
few paragraphs of coherent text but as

2156
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:42,320
you go to uh longer pieces it actually

2157
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:44,800
goes off the rails okay if you would uh

2158
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:47,039
try to write a book it won't work out uh

2159
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,560
this way what way does it go off the

2160
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,279
rails by the way is there interesting

2161
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:54,880
ways in which it goes off the rails like

2162
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:57,840
what falls apart first so the model is

2163
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:00,159
trained on the all the existing data

2164
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,560
that is out there which means that it is

2165
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:05,198
not trained on its own mistakes so for

2166
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:08,239
instance if it would make a mistake then

2167
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:11,198
uh i kept so to give give you an example

2168
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:12,000
so let's say i have a conversation with

2169
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:14,479
a

2170
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,600
model pretending that is elon musk

2171
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:19,839
and then i start putting some i'm start

2172
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:21,440
actually making up things which are not

2173
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,800
factual

2174
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:24,799
um i would say like twitter

2175
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:30,640
but i gotcha sorry yeah um okay

2176
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:32,079
i don't know i would say that elon is my

2177
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,840
wife

2178
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:36,238
and the model will just

2179
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,119
keep on carrying it on and as if it's

2180
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:39,519
true

2181
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:41,920
yes and in some sense if you would have

2182
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,199
a normal conversation with elon he would

2183
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,920
be what the [ __ ]

2184
01:19:43,198 --> 01:19:48,158
yeah there would be some feedback

2185
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,560
between so the the model is trained on

2186
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:52,238
things that humans have written but

2187
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,199
through the generation process there's

2188
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:57,279
no human in the loop feedback correct

2189
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:59,039
that's fascinating makes sense so it's

2190
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:01,920
magnified it's like the errors get

2191
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:04,800
magnified and magnified right and it's a

2192
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:06,399
it's also interesting

2193
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,400
i mean first of all humans have the same

2194
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:10,479
problem it's just that we

2195
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:13,039
uh we make

2196
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:15,119
fewer errors and magnify the errors

2197
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:17,119
slower i think that actually what

2198
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,760
happens with humans is if you have a

2199
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:21,599
wrong belief about the world as a kid

2200
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,360
then very quickly you will learn that

2201
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,280
it's not correct because you are

2202
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:27,519
grounded in reality and you are learning

2203
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:29,599
from your new experience yes

2204
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,440
but do you think the model can correct

2205
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,960
itself too

2206
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:34,799
it through the power of the

2207
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,039
representation

2208
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,760
and so the absence

2209
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:39,760
of

2210
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,840
elon musk being your wife

2211
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,760
information on the internet want to

2212
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,920
correct itself

2213
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,400
there won't be examples like that so the

2214
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:51,600
errors would be subtle at first

2215
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:53,439
saddle at first and in some sense

2216
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,199
you can also say that the data that is

2217
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:57,839
not out there is the data which would

2218
01:20:55,198 --> 01:21:00,719
represent how the human learns

2219
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,560
that's an a and and maybe model would be

2220
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:06,000
trained on such a data then it would be

2221
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:07,679
better off how intelligent is gpt 3 do

2222
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,840
you think like when you think about the

2223
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:12,840
nature of intelligence

2224
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,480
it seems exceptionally

2225
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,480
impressive

2226
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:19,279
but then if you think about the big agi

2227
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:20,879
problem is this footsteps along the way

2228
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:21,840
to agi

2229
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,920
so

2230
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:27,760
let's see seems that intelligence itself

2231
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:30,800
is there are multiple axis of it and

2232
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:32,880
i would expect that the

2233
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,199
the systems that we are building they

2234
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,319
may end up being super human on some

2235
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:38,079
axis

2236
01:21:36,319 --> 01:21:40,238
and sub human on some other axis it

2237
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:41,439
would be surprising to me on all axis

2238
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:43,678
simultaneously they would become

2239
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:45,599
superhuman

2240
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:48,239
of course people ask this question is

2241
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,560
gpt a spaceship that

2242
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:52,799
that would take us to moon or are we

2243
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,159
putting a building a ladder to heaven

2244
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,039
that we are just building bigger and

2245
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:57,839
bigger ladder and we don't know in some

2246
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:00,560
sense

2247
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,880
uh which one of these two which one is

2248
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,880
better

2249
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,480
i'm trying to i like stairway to heaven

2250
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,079
that's a good song so i'm not exactly

2251
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:09,678
sure which one is better but you're

2252
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:11,439
saying like the the spaceship to the

2253
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:14,800
moon is actually effective

2254
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:17,678
correct so people who criticize gpt yeah

2255
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,960
they say jarga is just

2256
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,480
building a

2257
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,198
taller a ladder

2258
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:24,959
and it will never reach the moon

2259
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:27,039
and

2260
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,560
at the moment i would say the way i'm

2261
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:29,439
thinking is this like a scientific

2262
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,800
question

2263
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:35,198
and i'm also in heart i'm a builder

2264
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:38,960
creator and like i'm thinking let's try

2265
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:40,960
out let's see how far it goes and so far

2266
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,639
we see constantly that there is a

2267
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,560
progress yeah

2268
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:47,359
so what do you think

2269
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:51,199
gpt4

2270
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:52,880
gpt5 gpt n plus one

2271
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:54,479
will uh

2272
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:57,039
there'll be a phase shift like a

2273
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:58,879
transition to a to a place where

2274
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:01,119
we'll be truly surprised then again like

2275
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:03,199
gpt3 is already very like truly

2276
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:06,079
surprising the people that criticize

2277
01:23:03,198 --> 01:23:07,519
gpg3 as it's there as a what is it

2278
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:09,519
ladder to heaven

2279
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,840
i think too quickly get accustomed to

2280
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:14,560
how impressive it is that the prediction

2281
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:17,600
of the next word can achieve such

2282
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:20,560
depth of semantics accuracy of syntax

2283
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:23,199
grammar and semantics

2284
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:25,760
um do you do you think

2285
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:28,079
gpt four and five and six will continue

2286
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,760
to surprise us

2287
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:31,679
i mean definitely there will be more

2288
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,800
impressive models there is a question of

2289
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:37,039
course if there will be a phase shift

2290
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,039
and

2291
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:41,919
the also even the way i'm thinking about

2292
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,840
the about these models is that

2293
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:45,520
when we build these models

2294
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,520
you know we see some level of the

2295
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,679
capabilities but we don't even fully

2296
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,600
understand everything that the model can

2297
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,520
do and actually one of the best things

2298
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:56,239
to do is to

2299
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:58,800
allow other people to probe the model to

2300
01:23:56,238 --> 01:24:00,158
even see what is possible

2301
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:03,679
hence the

2302
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:05,599
using gpg as an api

2303
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:07,440
and opening it up to the world yeah i

2304
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,440
mean so when i'm thinking from

2305
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:11,198
perspective of

2306
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:13,359
there like a obviously various people

2307
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:15,599
are that have concerns about agi

2308
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:16,639
including myself

2309
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,880
and then when i'm thinking from

2310
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:20,800
perspective what's the strategy even to

2311
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,600
deploy these things to the world

2312
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,840
the

2313
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:25,679
the one strategy that i have seen many

2314
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:28,319
times working is the iterative

2315
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:30,719
deployment that you deploy

2316
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:32,719
um slightly better versions and you

2317
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:35,279
allow other people to criticize you so

2318
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:37,679
you actually are tried out you see where

2319
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:39,599
are their fundamental issues and it's

2320
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:44,158
almost you don't want to be in that

2321
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:45,840
situation that you are holding into

2322
01:24:44,158 --> 01:24:48,559
powerful system and there's like a huge

2323
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:50,800
overhang then you deploy it and it might

2324
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,560
have a random chaotic impact on the

2325
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,560
world so you actually want to be in the

2326
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:56,560
situation that they are gradually

2327
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,639
deploying systems

2328
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,679
i asked this question of ilio let me ask

2329
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,440
you

2330
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:03,119
you this question

2331
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:07,279
i've been reading a lot

2332
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:07,279
about stalin and power

2333
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:13,359
if you're in possession of a system

2334
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,198
that's

2335
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:20,000
like agi that's exceptionally powerful

2336
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:21,678
do you think your character integrity

2337
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,439
might become corrupted

2338
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:25,760
like famously power corrupts and

2339
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:27,519
absolute power corrupts absolutely

2340
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:30,159
so i believe that

2341
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:32,880
you want at some point to

2342
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:34,158
work toward distributing the power

2343
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,079
i think that

2344
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:38,719
you want to be in the situation

2345
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:40,639
that actually agi is not controlled by a

2346
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,600
small number of people

2347
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:43,279
but

2348
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,920
essentially

2349
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:48,559
by a larger collective so the thing is

2350
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:50,719
that requires a george washington style

2351
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:53,520
move

2352
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:56,399
in the ascent to power there's always a

2353
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:59,199
moment when somebody gets a lot of power

2354
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:02,000
and they have to have the integrity

2355
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:03,439
and uh the moral compass to give away

2356
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,359
that power

2357
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:07,519
that humans have been

2358
01:26:05,359 --> 01:26:10,000
good and bad throughout history at this

2359
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:12,880
particular step and i wonder

2360
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,238
i wonder we like blind ourselves in uh

2361
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,880
for example

2362
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:19,279
between nations a race

2363
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:22,000
uh towards uh

2364
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:24,238
yeah ai race between nations we might

2365
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,158
blind ourselves and justify to ourselves

2366
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:28,158
the development of ai without

2367
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:29,599
distributing the power

2368
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:32,000
because we want to defend ourselves

2369
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:34,079
against china against russia that kind

2370
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,439
of that kind of logic

2371
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:36,960
and

2372
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:38,719
i wonder

2373
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,439
how we um

2374
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:44,079
how we design governance mechanisms that

2375
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:46,238
um prevent us from

2376
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:48,238
becoming power hungry and in the process

2377
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:50,399
destroying ourselves

2378
01:26:48,238 --> 01:26:52,479
so let's see i have been thinking about

2379
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:53,839
this topic quite a bit but i also want

2380
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:56,000
to admit that

2381
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:58,800
uh once again i actually want to rely

2382
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,198
way more on sam outman on it hero than a

2383
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:04,719
heroed an excellent block

2384
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:07,839
on how even to distribute wealth

2385
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:09,520
and his proper he proposed in his block

2386
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:11,840
to tax

2387
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,320
equity of the companies rather than

2388
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:17,039
profit and to distribute it and this is

2389
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:20,399
this is an example of

2390
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:20,399
uh washington move

2391
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,639
i guess i personally have insane trust

2392
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:27,759
in some

2393
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,719
he already spent plenty of money running

2394
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,560
a

2395
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:31,679
universal basic income

2396
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,080
project

2397
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:36,239
that like gives me i guess

2398
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:38,000
maybe some level of trust to him but i

2399
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:39,919
also

2400
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,238
i guess

2401
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,399
love him as a friend yeah

2402
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:47,599
i wonder because we're sort of summoning

2403
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:50,000
a new set of technologies

2404
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:52,400
i wonder if we'll be

2405
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,960
cognizant like you're describing the

2406
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:56,719
process of open ai but it could also be

2407
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,439
at other places like in the us

2408
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:02,880
government right

2409
01:27:59,439 --> 01:28:04,960
both china and the us are now

2410
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,039
full steam ahead on autonomous weapons

2411
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:10,719
systems development

2412
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:13,359
and that's really worrying to me because

2413
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:16,000
in the framework of something being

2414
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:18,719
a national security danger or military

2415
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,920
danger you can do a lot of pretty dark

2416
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:23,279
things

2417
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,960
that blind our moral compass

2418
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:26,479
and i think ai will be one of those

2419
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,960
things

2420
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:31,439
in some sense the the mission

2421
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:33,600
and the work you're doing at openai

2422
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:36,079
is like the counterbalance to that so

2423
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:39,199
you want to have more open ai and less

2424
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:40,800
autonomous weapon systems i i i like

2425
01:28:39,198 --> 01:28:42,479
these statements like to be clear like

2426
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:44,800
this interesting and i'm thinking about

2427
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:47,359
it myself but uh

2428
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,440
this is a place that i i okay

2429
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:51,359
i put my trust actually

2430
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:53,839
in some hence because it's extremely

2431
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:56,079
hard for me to reason about it yeah i

2432
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,199
mean one important statement to make is

2433
01:28:56,079 --> 01:28:59,600
um

2434
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:01,519
it's good to think about this yeah no

2435
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:03,039
question about right no question even

2436
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:06,159
like

2437
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:08,719
low-level quote-unquote engineer

2438
01:29:06,158 --> 01:29:11,759
like there's such a

2439
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:14,399
i remember i i programmed a car uh our

2440
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,400
rc car

2441
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:18,319
they went really fast like 30 40 miles

2442
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:20,880
an hour

2443
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,559
and i remember i was like sleep deprived

2444
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:25,119
so i programmed it

2445
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:26,880
pretty crappily and it like uh

2446
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:28,880
the the code froze so it's doing some

2447
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,880
basic computer vision and it's going

2448
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,400
around on track but it's going full

2449
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:35,359
speed

2450
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:36,839
and uh there's a bug in the code that uh

2451
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:40,000
the car just

2452
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:42,480
went it didn't turn it went straight

2453
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,399
full speed and smashed into the wall i

2454
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:48,479
remember thinking

2455
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:50,238
the seriousness with which you need to

2456
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:52,399
approach the design of artificial

2457
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:55,198
intelligence systems and the programming

2458
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:57,279
of artificial intelligence systems

2459
01:29:55,198 --> 01:29:59,678
is high because the consequences are

2460
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:00,719
high like that little car smashing it to

2461
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:02,480
the wall

2462
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,719
for some reason i immediately thought of

2463
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:05,759
like an algorithm that controls nuclear

2464
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,079
weapons

2465
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,719
having the same kind of bug and so like

2466
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:12,319
the lowest level engineer and the ceo of

2467
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:13,920
a company all need to have the

2468
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:15,359
seriousness

2469
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,600
in approaching this problem and thinking

2470
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:20,479
about the worst case consequences so i

2471
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:23,600
think that is true i mean the

2472
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:25,839
what i also recognize in myself and

2473
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,920
others even asking this question is that

2474
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:30,319
it evokes a lot of fear

2475
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:32,239
and fear itself ends up being actually

2476
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:37,279
quite debilitating

2477
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:40,158
the place where i arrived at the moment

2478
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:41,920
might sound cheesy or so but it's almost

2479
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:43,920
to

2480
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,679
build things out of love rather than

2481
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,880
fear yeah

2482
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:52,079
i can focus on how

2483
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:54,239
i can you know maximize the value how

2484
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:55,119
the systems that i'm building might be

2485
01:30:54,238 --> 01:30:56,879
uh

2486
01:30:55,119 --> 01:30:58,960
useful

2487
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:01,279
i'm not saying that the fear doesn't

2488
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,039
exist out there and like it totally

2489
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:05,279
makes sense to minimize it

2490
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:08,000
but i don't want to be working because

2491
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:11,519
uh i'm scared i want to be working out

2492
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,359
of passion out of curiosity out of the

2493
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,800
you know looking forward for the

2494
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:16,399
positive future

2495
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:18,960
with uh

2496
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:21,439
the definition of love arising from a

2497
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,520
rigorous practice of empathy so not just

2498
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:25,359
like your own conception of what is good

2499
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,320
for the world but uh always listening to

2500
01:31:25,359 --> 01:31:28,000
others

2501
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:30,479
correct like at the love where i'm

2502
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,920
considering reward functions of others

2503
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:34,638
others

2504
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:36,880
to infil limit to infinity is like a sum

2505
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:38,239
like one to n where n is uh seven

2506
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:40,159
billion or whatever it is not not

2507
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:41,678
projecting my reward functions on others

2508
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:42,638
yeah exactly

2509
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:44,079
okay

2510
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:46,400
can we just take a step back to

2511
01:31:44,079 --> 01:31:48,399
something else super cool which is uh

2512
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:49,839
opening up codex

2513
01:31:48,399 --> 01:31:53,439
can you give an overview of what

2514
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,880
open-air codecs and github co-pilot is

2515
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:56,839
how it works

2516
01:31:54,880 --> 01:32:01,119
and why the hell it works so

2517
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:02,079
well so with gpd3 we noticed that the

2518
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:04,158
system

2519
01:32:02,079 --> 01:32:06,238
um you know that system training all the

2520
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:08,719
language out there started having some

2521
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:11,678
rudimentary coding capabilities so we're

2522
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:13,760
able to ask it you know to

2523
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:16,239
implement addition function between two

2524
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:18,480
numbers and indeed it can write python

2525
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:21,678
or javascript code for that and then we

2526
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:24,158
thought um we might as well just go full

2527
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:25,679
steam ahead and try to create a system

2528
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:28,479
that is actually good

2529
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:30,239
at what we are doing every day ourselves

2530
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:32,399
which is programming

2531
01:32:30,238 --> 01:32:35,119
we optimize models

2532
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:38,319
for proficiency in coding we actually

2533
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:41,599
even created models that both have a

2534
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:45,759
comprehension of language and code

2535
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:48,480
and codex is api for these models so

2536
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:50,400
it's first pre-trained on language

2537
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:52,718
and then

2538
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:54,479
i don't know if you can say fine-tuned

2539
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:56,800
because there's a lot of code

2540
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:58,158
but it's language and code it's language

2541
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,079
and code

2542
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:02,479
it's also optimized for various things

2543
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:05,840
like let's say low latency and so on

2544
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:07,039
codex is the api that's similar to gpd3

2545
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,679
we expect that there will be

2546
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,679
proliferation of the potential products

2547
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:12,560
that can use coding capabilities and i

2548
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:14,800
can

2549
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,880
i can speak about it in a second

2550
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:19,119
compiled is the first product

2551
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,359
and developed by github so as we're

2552
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:23,519
building uh models we wanted to make

2553
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:25,439
sure that these models are useful

2554
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:28,000
and we work together with github on

2555
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:31,039
building the first product co-pilot is

2556
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,359
actually as you code it suggests you

2557
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:35,198
code completions and we have seen in the

2558
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:38,880
past they're like a various tools that

2559
01:33:35,198 --> 01:33:41,759
can suggest how to like a few characters

2560
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:43,679
of the code or the line of code the the

2561
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:46,000
thing about copilot is it can generate

2562
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:48,239
10 lines of code you

2563
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,319
it's often the way how it works is you

2564
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:51,599
often write in the comment what you want

2565
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:53,198
to happen because

2566
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,120
people in comments they describe what

2567
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:57,279
happens next so

2568
01:33:55,119 --> 01:34:00,158
um these days when i code instead of

2569
01:33:57,279 --> 01:34:02,000
going to google to search

2570
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:06,079
for the appropriate code to solve my

2571
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:08,560
problem i say oh for this array could

2572
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:10,319
you smooth it and then you know it

2573
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:13,039
imports some appropriate libraries and

2574
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:14,960
say it uses numpy convolution or so i

2575
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:16,960
that i was not even aware that exists

2576
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:20,560
and it does the appropriate thing

2577
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:22,239
um so you you write a comment maybe the

2578
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,360
header of a function and it completes

2579
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:25,039
the function

2580
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:27,039
of course you don't know what is the

2581
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:29,198
space of all the possible

2582
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:31,119
small programs it can generate

2583
01:34:29,198 --> 01:34:33,359
what are the failure cases how many edge

2584
01:34:31,119 --> 01:34:35,039
cases how many subtle

2585
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:36,880
errors there are how many big errors

2586
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:38,960
there are it's hard to know but the fact

2587
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:41,600
that it works at all on in a large

2588
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,399
number of cases is incredible it's like

2589
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:45,199
a

2590
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:46,719
it's a kind of search engine

2591
01:34:45,198 --> 01:34:47,839
into code that's been written on the

2592
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:49,760
internet

2593
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,920
correct so for instance

2594
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,920
when you search things online then

2595
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:55,520
usually you get to the

2596
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,679
some particular

2597
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:00,080
case like if you go to stack overflow

2598
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:02,719
people describe that one particular

2599
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:05,519
situation uh and then they seek for a

2600
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:08,158
solution but in case of uh co-pilot it's

2601
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:10,000
aware of your entire context and in

2602
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:12,319
contexts oh these are the libraries that

2603
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,880
they are using that's the set of the

2604
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:17,359
variables that is initialized and on the

2605
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,199
spot it can actually tell you what to do

2606
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:21,359
so the interesting thing is

2607
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:24,000
and we think that the copilot is one

2608
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:26,000
possible product using codex but there

2609
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,158
is a place for many more so

2610
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,560
internally we tried out you know to

2611
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:33,198
create other fun products so it turns

2612
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:35,199
out that a lot of tools out there

2613
01:35:33,198 --> 01:35:36,399
let's say google calendar or microsoft

2614
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:39,279
word or so

2615
01:35:36,399 --> 01:35:41,359
they all have uh internal api to build

2616
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:44,158
plugins around them

2617
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:46,880
so there is a way in the sophisticated

2618
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:49,279
way to control calendar or microsoft

2619
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:50,960
word today if you want

2620
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:52,639
if you want more complicated behaviors

2621
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:55,198
from these programs you have to add a

2622
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:58,079
new button for every behavior

2623
01:35:55,198 --> 01:36:00,960
but it is possible to use codex and

2624
01:35:58,079 --> 01:36:03,359
tell for instance to calendar

2625
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,319
could you schedule an appointment with

2626
01:36:03,359 --> 01:36:07,118
blacks

2627
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:09,519
next week after 2 pm and either writes

2628
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:11,039
corresponding piece of code

2629
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:13,119
and that's the thing that actually you

2630
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:14,560
want so interesting so

2631
01:36:13,118 --> 01:36:16,319
what you figure out is there's a lot of

2632
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,600
programs with which you can interact

2633
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:21,118
through code

2634
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:22,960
and so there you can generate that code

2635
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:24,799
from natural language

2636
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,960
that's fascinating and that's somewhat

2637
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,600
like also closest to

2638
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:31,439
uh what was the promise of siri or alexa

2639
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,560
yeah so previously all these behaviors

2640
01:36:31,439 --> 01:36:35,599
they were had

2641
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:38,800
hard coded yeah and it seems that codex

2642
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:41,199
on the fly can pick up the api of let's

2643
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:43,360
say given software yeah and then it can

2644
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:45,519
turn the language into use of this api

2645
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:48,158
without hard coding you can find it can

2646
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:49,840
translate to machine language correct it

2647
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:53,198
to uh so for example this would be

2648
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:55,360
really exciting for me like for um adobe

2649
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:58,000
products like photoshop

2650
01:36:55,359 --> 01:36:59,279
uh which is the i think actionscript i

2651
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,479
think there's a scripting language that

2652
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:01,439
communicates with them same with

2653
01:37:00,479 --> 01:37:03,198
premiere

2654
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:04,479
and you could imagine that that allows

2655
01:37:03,198 --> 01:37:07,519
event to

2656
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:10,158
do coding by voice on your phone

2657
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:13,360
so for instance in the past okay as of

2658
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:15,519
today i'm not editing word documents on

2659
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:17,519
my phone because it's just the keyboard

2660
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,040
is too small but if i would be able to

2661
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,840
tell

2662
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:24,000
to my phone you know uh make the header

2663
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:26,800
large and then move the paragraphs

2664
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,800
around and it does actually what i want

2665
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:31,679
so i can tell you one more cool thing or

2666
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:34,320
even how i'm thinking about codex

2667
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,600
so if you look actually at the evolution

2668
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:37,118
of

2669
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,600
of computers

2670
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:41,439
we started with very primitive

2671
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,440
interfaces which is a punch card and

2672
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:45,759
punch card essentially

2673
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:47,519
you make a holes in the

2674
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:48,960
in the plastic card to indicate zeros

2675
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,159
and ones

2676
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,520
and

2677
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:53,118
during that time there was a small

2678
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,280
number of specialists who were able to

2679
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:57,118
use computers and by the way people even

2680
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:59,759
suspected that there is no need for many

2681
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:03,039
more people to use computers

2682
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:05,360
but then we moved from punch cards to

2683
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:07,600
at first assembly then c

2684
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:10,000
and these programming languages they

2685
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:13,119
were slightly higher level they allowed

2686
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:15,039
many more people to code and they also

2687
01:38:13,118 --> 01:38:17,439
led to more of a proliferation of

2688
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:19,679
technology and

2689
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:22,238
you know further on there was a jump to

2690
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:24,319
say from c plus plus to java and python

2691
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:26,559
and every time it has happened

2692
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:29,359
more people are able to code and we

2693
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:30,800
build more technology and it's even you

2694
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:32,479
know

2695
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:34,719
hard to imagine now if someone will tell

2696
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:37,118
you that you should write code in

2697
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:37,840
assembly instead of let's say python or

2698
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:40,880
or

2699
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:42,719
or java or javascript and codex is yet

2700
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,359
another step toward kind of bringing

2701
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:47,520
computers closer to humans such that you

2702
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:49,198
communicate with a computer

2703
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,440
with your own language

2704
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:52,479
rather than with a specialized language

2705
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:54,960
and

2706
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:56,799
i think that it will lead to

2707
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,760
an increase of number of people who can

2708
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,880
code

2709
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:00,639
yeah and then and the kind of

2710
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,000
technologies that those people will

2711
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:04,000
create is

2712
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,600
like it's innumerable it could you know

2713
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,158
it could be a huge number of

2714
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,079
technologies we're not predicting at all

2715
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:11,118
because that's less and less requirement

2716
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:13,118
of uh

2717
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:15,279
having a technical mind

2718
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:17,359
a programming mind you're not opening it

2719
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:18,719
to the world of

2720
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:20,399
um

2721
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:22,319
other kinds of minds creative minds

2722
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:23,839
artistic minds all that kind of stuff i

2723
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:26,559
would like for instance biologists who

2724
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:28,880
work on dna to be able to program and

2725
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:30,480
not to need to spend a lot of time uh

2726
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,239
learning it and i i believe that's a

2727
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:35,039
good thing to the word and i would

2728
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:37,359
actually add out that so at the moment

2729
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:39,198
i'm a managing codex team and also

2730
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:41,519
language team and i believe that there

2731
01:39:39,198 --> 01:39:42,319
is like a plenty of brilliant people out

2732
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,239
there

2733
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:46,319
and they should apply

2734
01:39:44,238 --> 01:39:47,919
oh okay yeah awesome so what's the

2735
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:48,960
language in the codexes so those are

2736
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,960
kind of

2737
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:54,560
they're overlapping teams so it's like

2738
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:57,039
gpt the raw language and then the codex

2739
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:59,920
is like applied to programming

2740
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:01,439
correct and they are quite intertwined

2741
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:03,359
there are many more teams involved

2742
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:04,399
making these uh

2743
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:06,639
models

2744
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:07,759
extremely efficient and deployable for

2745
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:09,920
instance there are people who are

2746
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:12,480
working to you know

2747
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:14,639
make our data centers uh amazing or

2748
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:16,479
there are people who work on pro putting

2749
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:17,520
these models into production

2750
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:19,599
or uh

2751
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:21,600
or even pushing it at the very limit of

2752
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:23,360
the scale

2753
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,039
so all aspects from from the

2754
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:26,000
infrastructure to the actual machine

2755
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:28,238
learning so i'm just saying that

2756
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,079
multiple teams while the

2757
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:32,559
and the team working on codex and

2758
01:40:30,079 --> 01:40:34,479
language uh i guess i'm i'm directly

2759
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:36,560
managing them i would like i would love

2760
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:38,000
to hire yeah if you're interested in

2761
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:39,199
machine learning

2762
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,560
this is probably one of the most

2763
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:45,198
exciting uh problems and like systems to

2764
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:47,679
be working on because it's actually it's

2765
01:40:45,198 --> 01:40:49,359
it's pretty cool like what what uh the

2766
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:51,359
program synthesis like generating of

2767
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:55,039
programs is very interesting very

2768
01:40:51,359 --> 01:40:57,599
interesting problem that has echoes of

2769
01:40:55,039 --> 01:40:59,118
reasoning and intelligence in it

2770
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,199
it and i think there's a lot of

2771
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:03,439
fundamental questions that you might be

2772
01:41:01,198 --> 01:41:06,399
able to sneak

2773
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:08,399
sneak up to by generating programs yeah

2774
01:41:06,399 --> 01:41:11,118
the one more exciting thing about the

2775
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:13,439
programs is that so i said that the

2776
01:41:11,118 --> 01:41:15,439
um you know the in case of language that

2777
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:17,279
one of the troubles is even evaluating

2778
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:20,158
language so when the things are made up

2779
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:21,519
you you need somehow

2780
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:23,920
either a human

2781
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:26,080
to say that this doesn't make sense or

2782
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,840
so in case of program there is one extra

2783
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:30,319
level that we can actually execute

2784
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:34,159
programs and see what they evaluate to

2785
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:36,639
so that process might be somewhat

2786
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:39,279
more automated in in order to improve

2787
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:41,840
the uh qualities of generations and

2788
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:44,158
that's not saying so like the wow that's

2789
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:46,480
really interesting so for the language

2790
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:49,279
that you know the simulation to actually

2791
01:41:46,479 --> 01:41:52,079
execute it as a human mind yeah for

2792
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:54,719
programs there is a there is a computer

2793
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:55,760
on which you can evaluate it

2794
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:56,719
wow

2795
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,840
that's a

2796
01:41:56,719 --> 01:42:02,560
brilliant little

2797
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:03,920
insight that the thing compiles and runs

2798
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:07,039
that's first

2799
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:09,359
and second you can evaluate on a like do

2800
01:42:07,039 --> 01:42:10,800
automated unit testing

2801
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:12,559
and in some sense

2802
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,719
it seems to me that we will be able to

2803
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:17,280
make a tremendous progress you know

2804
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:20,319
we are in the paradigm that there is

2805
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:23,359
way more data and there is like a

2806
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:25,519
transcription of millions of uh of uh

2807
01:42:23,359 --> 01:42:27,198
software engineers yeah

2808
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:28,159
yeah

2809
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:29,678
so

2810
01:42:28,158 --> 01:42:31,839
i mean you just me because i was going

2811
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:33,760
to ask you about reliability the thing

2812
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:36,159
about programs is you don't know if

2813
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:38,159
they're going to

2814
01:42:36,158 --> 01:42:40,399
like a program that's controlling a

2815
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:43,039
nuclear power plant has to be very

2816
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:44,879
reliable so i i wouldn't start with

2817
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:46,880
controlling nuclear power plant can i be

2818
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:48,800
one day but that that's not actually

2819
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:51,840
that's not on the current roadmap that's

2820
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,440
not that's step one and you know it's

2821
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:55,199
the russian thing you just want to go to

2822
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:56,399
the most powerful destructive thing

2823
01:42:55,198 --> 01:42:58,559
right away

2824
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:00,479
run by javascript but i got you so it's

2825
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,920
a lower impact but nevertheless what

2826
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:03,678
you're making me realize

2827
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:06,480
it is possible to achieve some levels of

2828
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:07,920
reliability by doing testing

2829
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:09,759
and i thought you could imagine that

2830
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:10,880
them you know maybe there are ways for a

2831
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,880
model to

2832
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,840
write even code for testing itself and

2833
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:16,239
so on

2834
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,560
and there exists a ways to create the

2835
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:21,118
feedback loops that the model could keep

2836
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,119
on improving

2837
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:26,960
by writing programs that generate tests

2838
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:28,880
for the instance for instance

2839
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:30,800
and that's how we get consciousness

2840
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:32,000
because it's meta compression that's

2841
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:33,679
what you're going to write that's the

2842
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,880
comment that's the prompt that generates

2843
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:37,199
consciousness

2844
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:38,400
compressor of compressors you just write

2845
01:43:37,198 --> 01:43:40,000
that

2846
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:42,399
do you think the code that generates

2847
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,600
consciousness would be simple

2848
01:43:42,399 --> 01:43:46,238
so

2849
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:48,480
let's see i mean ultimately the core

2850
01:43:46,238 --> 01:43:50,000
idea behind will be simple but there

2851
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:52,479
will be also decent amount of

2852
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,479
engineering

2853
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:58,238
involved like in some sense

2854
01:43:56,079 --> 01:44:00,639
it seems that you know spreading these

2855
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:03,359
models on many machines

2856
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:06,239
and it's not that trivial yeah and

2857
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:08,559
we find all sorts of innovations that

2858
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:10,158
make our models more efficient

2859
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:12,159
i believe that

2860
01:44:10,158 --> 01:44:13,759
first models

2861
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:15,839
that i guess are conscious are like a

2862
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,800
truly intelligent they will have all

2863
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,960
sorts of

2864
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,960
tricks

2865
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:23,760
but then again there's uh

2866
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:25,760
which is certain argument that maybe

2867
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:27,119
the tricks are temporary thing yeah they

2868
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:29,520
might be temporary things and in some

2869
01:44:27,118 --> 01:44:31,519
sense it's also even important

2870
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,320
to um

2871
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,239
to

2872
01:44:32,319 --> 01:44:36,639
know that even the cost of a trick so

2873
01:44:34,238 --> 01:44:37,519
sometimes people are eager to put the

2874
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:40,079
trick

2875
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,199
while forgetting that there is a cost of

2876
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:43,679
maintenance

2877
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:46,799
or like a long-term cost long-term cost

2878
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:48,480
or maintenance or maybe even

2879
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,159
flexibility of code to actually

2880
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:52,319
implement new ideas so even if you have

2881
01:44:50,158 --> 01:44:55,118
something that gives you 2x but it

2882
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:57,198
requires you know 1000 lines of code i'm

2883
01:44:55,118 --> 01:44:59,439
not sure if it's actually worth it so in

2884
01:44:57,198 --> 01:45:02,638
some sense you know if it's five lines

2885
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:05,599
of code and 2x i would take it

2886
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:07,840
and and we we we see many of this but

2887
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:09,280
also you know that requires some level

2888
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:11,840
of

2889
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:15,679
i guess lack of attachment to code that

2890
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:18,880
we are willing to remove it yeah

2891
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:20,800
so you led the open ai robotics team can

2892
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:22,319
you give an overview of of the cool

2893
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,920
things you're able to accomplish what

2894
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:25,759
are you most proud of

2895
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:27,279
so when we started robotics we knew that

2896
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:29,119
actually reinforcement learning works

2897
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:31,359
and it is possible to

2898
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:33,519
solve very complicated problems

2899
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:36,319
like for instance alphago is an evidence

2900
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:40,159
that it is possible to to build

2901
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:42,639
superhuman and gold players dota 2 is a

2902
01:45:40,158 --> 01:45:45,439
an evidence that is possible to

2903
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:48,000
build superhuman uh

2904
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:50,000
agents playing dota so i asked myself a

2905
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,880
question you know what about robots out

2906
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:55,520
there could we train machines to solve

2907
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:58,319
arbitrary tasks in the physical world

2908
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:00,800
our approach was i guess let's pick a

2909
01:45:58,319 --> 01:46:02,799
complicated problem that

2910
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:05,440
if we would solve it that means that we

2911
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:07,279
made some uh significant progress in the

2912
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:08,238
domain and then we went after the

2913
01:46:07,279 --> 01:46:11,599
problem

2914
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:13,359
so um we noticed that actually the

2915
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,360
robots out there they are kind of at the

2916
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:17,839
moment optimized per task so you can

2917
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:20,000
have a robot that it's like if you have

2918
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:21,920
a robot opening a battle it's very

2919
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,000
likely that the end factor is a battle

2920
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:24,960
opener

2921
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,719
and

2922
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:28,639
and in some sense that's a hack to be

2923
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:32,000
able to solve a task which makes any

2924
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:33,760
task easier and um ask myself so what

2925
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,800
would be a robot that can actually solve

2926
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:37,920
many tasks yeah and we conclude that

2927
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:41,119
that

2928
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:44,079
like a human hands have such a quality

2929
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:47,118
that indeed they are you know you have

2930
01:46:44,079 --> 01:46:49,760
five kind of tiny arms attached

2931
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:52,158
individually they can manipulate

2932
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:55,039
pretty broad spectrum of objects so we

2933
01:46:52,158 --> 01:46:57,439
went after a single hand like a trying

2934
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:59,359
to solve rubik's cube single-handed we

2935
01:46:57,439 --> 01:47:00,960
picked this task because we thought that

2936
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:03,118
there is no way to

2937
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,880
harcode it and it's also we picked the

2938
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:06,639
robot on which it would be hard to

2939
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:09,440
hardcode it and

2940
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:11,359
we went after the solution such that

2941
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:13,599
it could generalize to other problems

2942
01:47:11,359 --> 01:47:15,759
and just to clarify it's

2943
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:18,079
one robotic hand solving the rubik's

2944
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:20,480
cube the hard part isn't the solution to

2945
01:47:18,079 --> 01:47:23,279
the rubik's cube is the manipulation of

2946
01:47:20,479 --> 01:47:25,039
the uh of like having it not fall out of

2947
01:47:23,279 --> 01:47:26,559
the hand having it

2948
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:28,639
use the uh

2949
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:30,800
five baby arms

2950
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:32,719
to uh what is it like rotate different

2951
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:36,239
parts of the rubik's cube to achieve the

2952
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:38,560
solution correct yeah so what uh what

2953
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:40,479
was the hardest part about that

2954
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,320
what was the approach taken there what

2955
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:44,158
are you most proud of obviously we have

2956
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:45,198
like a strong belief in reinforcement

2957
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:46,719
learning

2958
01:47:45,198 --> 01:47:48,559
and uh

2959
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:50,960
you know one path it is to do

2960
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:52,880
reinforcement learning the real world

2961
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:55,600
other path is to

2962
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:57,600
the simulation in some sense the

2963
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:59,760
tricky part about the real world is at

2964
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:02,840
the moment our models they require a lot

2965
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:06,000
of data there is essentially no data

2966
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:08,000
and i did we decided to go through the

2967
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,079
path of the simulation and in simulation

2968
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,840
you can have infinite amount of data the

2969
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:14,719
tricky part is the fidelity of the

2970
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,400
simulation and also can you in

2971
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:19,039
simulation represent everything that you

2972
01:48:16,399 --> 01:48:21,839
represent otherwise in the real world

2973
01:48:19,039 --> 01:48:23,359
and you know it turned out that uh

2974
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:26,960
that you know because there is lack of

2975
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:28,079
fidelity it is possible to that what we

2976
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:30,399
what we

2977
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:32,639
arrived at is training a model that

2978
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:34,238
doesn't solve one simulation but it

2979
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:36,639
actually solves the

2980
01:48:34,238 --> 01:48:39,839
entire range of simulations which uh

2981
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:42,319
vary uh in terms of like uh what's the

2982
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,600
exactly the friction of that cube or the

2983
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:44,639
weight or so

2984
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,880
and the

2985
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:49,279
single ai that can solve all of them

2986
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,560
ends up working well with the reality

2987
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:52,399
how do you generate the different

2988
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,920
simulations so

2989
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:57,198
you know there's plenty of parameters

2990
01:48:53,920 --> 01:49:00,079
out there we just pick them randomly and

2991
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:02,238
and in simulation model just goes for

2992
01:49:00,079 --> 01:49:04,079
thousands of years and keeps on solving

2993
01:49:02,238 --> 01:49:06,959
rubik's cube in each of them and the

2994
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:09,359
thing is the neural network that we used

2995
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:12,560
it has a memory

2996
01:49:09,359 --> 01:49:16,079
and as it presses for instance the side

2997
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:18,239
of the of the cube it can sense oh

2998
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:20,639
that's actually this side was

2999
01:49:18,238 --> 01:49:23,118
uh difficult to press i should press it

3000
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:24,239
stronger and throughout this process

3001
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:26,079
kind of

3002
01:49:24,238 --> 01:49:28,000
learns even how to

3003
01:49:26,079 --> 01:49:30,000
how to solve this particular instance of

3004
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,279
the rubik's cube back even mass it's

3005
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,198
kind of like a

3006
01:49:31,279 --> 01:49:36,238
you know sometimes when you

3007
01:49:33,198 --> 01:49:38,719
go to a gym and after

3008
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:41,839
after bench press you

3009
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:45,118
try to lift the

3010
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:47,279
and you kind of forgot uh and and your

3011
01:49:45,118 --> 01:49:49,679
hand goes like yeah right away because

3012
01:49:47,279 --> 01:49:51,439
kind of you got this to maybe different

3013
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:52,960
weight yeah and it takes a second to

3014
01:49:51,439 --> 01:49:55,759
adjust yeah

3015
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:57,359
and this kind of of a memory that model

3016
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:58,560
gained through the process of

3017
01:49:57,359 --> 01:49:59,839
interacting with the cube in the

3018
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,599
simulation

3019
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:03,279
i appreciate you speaking to the

3020
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:04,960
audience with the bench press all the

3021
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:06,399
bros in the audience

3022
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:07,760
probably working out right now there's

3023
01:50:06,399 --> 01:50:10,079
probably somebody listening to this

3024
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,440
actually doing bench press

3025
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:13,198
so maybe

3026
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:15,678
uh put the bar down and pick up the

3027
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:18,559
water bottle and you'll know exactly

3028
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:22,000
what uh what check is talking about okay

3029
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:22,000
so what uh

3030
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:25,839
what was the hardest part of getting the

3031
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:27,360
whole thing to work so the hardest part

3032
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:29,599
is

3033
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:31,279
at the moment when it comes to a

3034
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:33,440
physical world

3035
01:50:31,279 --> 01:50:36,000
when it comes to robots

3036
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:38,799
they require maintenance it's hard to

3037
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:41,039
replicate a million times it's

3038
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,079
it's also it's hard to replay things

3039
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:45,198
exactly

3040
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:46,319
i remember this situation that

3041
01:50:45,198 --> 01:50:48,960
one guy

3042
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:51,599
at our company he had like a model that

3043
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:54,000
performs way better than other models in

3044
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:56,159
solving rubik's cube and

3045
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,359
you know we kind of didn't know what's

3046
01:50:56,158 --> 01:50:58,879
going on

3047
01:50:57,359 --> 01:51:00,479
why it's that

3048
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:02,079
and

3049
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:04,479
it turned out

3050
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:06,479
that you know he was running it from his

3051
01:51:04,479 --> 01:51:07,359
laptop that had better cpu

3052
01:51:06,479 --> 01:51:10,399
or

3053
01:51:07,359 --> 01:51:12,719
uh or better or maybe local gpu as well

3054
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:15,598
and uh because of that there was less of

3055
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:17,359
a latency and the model was the same

3056
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:19,520
and that actually

3057
01:51:17,359 --> 01:51:21,359
made solving rubik's cube more reliable

3058
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:23,520
so in some sense there might be some

3059
01:51:21,359 --> 01:51:25,439
saddlebacks like that when it comes to

3060
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:27,520
running things in the real world

3061
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:29,279
even hinting on that

3062
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:30,960
you could imagine that the initial

3063
01:51:29,279 --> 01:51:33,519
models you would like to have models

3064
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:35,920
which are insanely huge neural networks

3065
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:37,679
and you would like to give them even

3066
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,679
more time for thinking

3067
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:41,440
and when you have these real-time

3068
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:42,239
systems

3069
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:44,000
then

3070
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:45,919
you might be constrained actually by the

3071
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,118
amount of latency

3072
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,639
and

3073
01:51:47,118 --> 01:51:50,479
ultimately i would like to build the

3074
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:52,880
system that it is

3075
01:51:50,479 --> 01:51:54,959
worth for you to wait five minutes

3076
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:56,719
because it gives you the answer

3077
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:59,359
that you are willing to wait for five

3078
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:01,840
minutes so latency is a very unpleasant

3079
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:03,759
constraint underwish to operate correct

3080
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:06,480
and also there is actually one more

3081
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:08,239
thing which is tricky about robots

3082
01:52:06,479 --> 01:52:10,718
there is actually

3083
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:14,399
no not much data so the data that i'm

3084
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:16,880
speaking about would be a data of

3085
01:52:14,399 --> 01:52:19,039
first person experience from the robot

3086
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:20,960
and like a gigabytes of data like that

3087
01:52:19,039 --> 01:52:23,279
if we would have gigabytes of data like

3088
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:25,279
that of robot solving various problems

3089
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:27,679
it would be very easy to make a progress

3090
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:30,319
on robotics and you can see that in case

3091
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:32,639
of text or code there is a lot of data

3092
01:52:30,319 --> 01:52:34,719
like a first person perspective data on

3093
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:36,480
the writing code

3094
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:38,158
yeah so you had this

3095
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:39,759
you mentioned this really interesting

3096
01:52:38,158 --> 01:52:41,839
idea that

3097
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:44,480
if you were to build like a successful

3098
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:46,239
robotics company so open as mission is

3099
01:52:44,479 --> 01:52:47,039
much bigger than robotics this is one of

3100
01:52:46,238 --> 01:52:48,959
the

3101
01:52:47,039 --> 01:52:51,519
one of the things you've worked on

3102
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:53,359
but if it was a robotics company they

3103
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:55,760
you wouldn't so quickly dismiss

3104
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:58,639
supervised learning i correct that you

3105
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,840
would build a robot

3106
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:02,239
that

3107
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:04,880
was perhaps one like

3108
01:53:02,238 --> 01:53:07,598
um an empty shell like dumb and they

3109
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:09,520
would operate under tele operation

3110
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:11,840
so you would invest

3111
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:14,159
that's just one way to do it invest in

3112
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:16,719
human super like direct human control of

3113
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:19,279
the robots as it's learning and over

3114
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:21,359
time add more and more automation

3115
01:53:19,279 --> 01:53:23,679
that's correct so let's say that's how i

3116
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:24,960
would build a robotics company today

3117
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:26,480
if i would be building a robotics

3118
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,639
company which is you know spent 10

3119
01:53:26,479 --> 01:53:31,118
million dollars or so

3120
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:34,400
recording human trajectories controlling

3121
01:53:31,118 --> 01:53:36,559
a robot after you find

3122
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:38,719
a thing that the robot should be doing

3123
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,000
that there's a market fit for like that

3124
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:42,079
you can make a lot of money with that

3125
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,118
product correct correct yeah

3126
01:53:42,079 --> 01:53:44,800
so

3127
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:46,960
i would record data and then i would

3128
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:48,159
essentially train supervised learning

3129
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,319
model on it

3130
01:53:48,158 --> 01:53:52,238
that might be the path today

3131
01:53:50,319 --> 01:53:56,319
long term i think that actually what is

3132
01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:57,519
needed is to train powerful models over

3133
01:53:56,319 --> 01:53:58,399
video

3134
01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:01,199
so

3135
01:53:58,399 --> 01:54:03,839
um you have seen maybe a models that can

3136
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:05,839
generate images like dali

3137
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:08,319
and people are looking into models

3138
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:10,480
generating videos they're like various

3139
01:54:08,319 --> 01:54:11,920
algorithmic questions even how to do it

3140
01:54:10,479 --> 01:54:13,678
and it's unclear if there is enough

3141
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:14,639
compute for this purpose

3142
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:17,679
but

3143
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:19,599
i i suspect that the models that which

3144
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:22,319
would have a

3145
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:24,079
level of understanding of video same as

3146
01:54:22,319 --> 01:54:25,039
gpt has the level of understanding of

3147
01:54:24,079 --> 01:54:27,279
text

3148
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:29,439
could be used

3149
01:54:27,279 --> 01:54:32,559
to train robots to solve tasks they

3150
01:54:29,439 --> 01:54:33,839
would have a lot of common sense

3151
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,520
if one day

3152
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:38,319
i'm pretty sure one day

3153
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:40,560
there will be a robotics company

3154
01:54:38,319 --> 01:54:44,639
by robotics company i mean the primary

3155
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:46,239
source of income is is from robots

3156
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:48,719
that is worth over

3157
01:54:46,238 --> 01:54:50,799
1 trillion dollars

3158
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:53,118
what do you think that company will do i

3159
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:55,119
think self-driving cars no

3160
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:57,759
it's interesting because my mind went to

3161
01:54:55,118 --> 01:54:59,519
personal robotics robots in the home

3162
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:00,880
it seems like there's much more market

3163
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:04,960
opportunity there

3164
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:06,880
i think it's very difficult to achieve

3165
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:08,960
i mean this this

3166
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,880
this might speak to something important

3167
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,399
which is i understand self-driving much

3168
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:14,800
better than understand robotics in the

3169
01:55:12,399 --> 01:55:17,679
home so i understand how difficult it is

3170
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:20,239
to actually solve self-driving

3171
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:22,239
to uh to a level not just the actual

3172
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:24,319
computer vision and the control problem

3173
01:55:22,238 --> 01:55:25,039
and just the basic problem self-driving

3174
01:55:24,319 --> 01:55:26,880
but

3175
01:55:25,039 --> 01:55:29,198
creating a product

3176
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:30,800
that would undeniably

3177
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:32,638
be um

3178
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:33,920
that will cost less money like it will

3179
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:35,920
save you a lot of money like orders the

3180
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:38,399
magnitude less money that could replace

3181
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:40,719
uber drivers for example so car sharing

3182
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:43,598
that's autonomous that creates

3183
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:46,000
a similar or better experience in terms

3184
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:48,079
of how quickly you get from a to b or

3185
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,359
just whatever the the pleasantness of

3186
01:55:48,079 --> 01:55:51,039
the experience

3187
01:55:49,359 --> 01:55:52,960
the efficiency of the experience the

3188
01:55:51,039 --> 01:55:56,319
value of the experience and at the same

3189
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:58,399
time the car itself costs cheaper

3190
01:55:56,319 --> 01:56:01,039
i think that's very difficult to achieve

3191
01:55:58,399 --> 01:56:04,799
i think there's a lot more

3192
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:07,118
um low hanging fruit in the home

3193
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,719
that that could be i also want to give

3194
01:56:07,118 --> 01:56:11,279
you perspective on

3195
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:13,599
like how challenging it would be at home

3196
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:15,920
or like it maybe kind of depends on the

3197
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:18,400
exact problem that you'd be solving okay

3198
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:19,440
if we are speaking about these robotic

3199
01:56:18,399 --> 01:56:20,799
arms

3200
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:22,799
and hence

3201
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:25,760
these things they cost tens of thousands

3202
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:28,159
of dollars or maybe 100k

3203
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:30,079
and

3204
01:56:28,158 --> 01:56:31,598
you know maybe obviously maybe there

3205
01:56:30,079 --> 01:56:33,039
would be economy of scale these things

3206
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:35,679
would be cheaper

3207
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:37,599
but actually for any household to buy

3208
01:56:35,679 --> 01:56:39,039
the price would have to go down to maybe

3209
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:41,279
thousand bucks

3210
01:56:39,039 --> 01:56:42,960
yeah i personally think

3211
01:56:41,279 --> 01:56:44,960
that uh

3212
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:48,000
so self-driving car it provides a clear

3213
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:49,520
service i don't think robots in the home

3214
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
they'll be a trillion dollar company

3215
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:54,400
will just be all about service

3216
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,719
meaning it will not necessarily be about

3217
01:56:54,399 --> 01:57:00,158
like a robotic arm that

3218
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:02,960
helps you i don't know open a bottle

3219
01:57:00,158 --> 01:57:04,559
or wash the dishes or

3220
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:06,480
any of that kind of stuff it has to be

3221
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:08,400
able to take care of that whole the

3222
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:11,198
therapist thing you mentioned

3223
01:57:08,399 --> 01:57:13,439
i i think that's um of course there's a

3224
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:14,238
line between what is a robot and what is

3225
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:16,238
not

3226
01:57:14,238 --> 01:57:17,839
like doesn't really need a body but you

3227
01:57:16,238 --> 01:57:20,638
know some

3228
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:21,760
uh ai system with some embodiment i

3229
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:23,359
think

3230
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,599
so the tricky part when you think

3231
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:26,719
actually what's the difficult part is

3232
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:28,800
um

3233
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:30,560
when the robot has

3234
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:32,159
like when there is a diversity of the

3235
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,159
environment with which the robot has to

3236
01:57:32,158 --> 01:57:36,319
interact that becomes hard so you know

3237
01:57:34,158 --> 01:57:38,799
on one spectrum you have

3238
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:41,198
industrial robots as they are doing over

3239
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:42,960
and over the same thing it is possible

3240
01:57:41,198 --> 01:57:45,439
to some extent to prescribe the

3241
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:48,319
movements and with very small amount of

3242
01:57:45,439 --> 01:57:51,678
intelligence the the movement can be

3243
01:57:48,319 --> 01:57:53,198
repeated millions of times um the it

3244
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:54,800
there are also you know various pieces

3245
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:57,198
of industrial robots where it becomes

3246
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:59,679
harder and harder like for instance in

3247
01:57:57,198 --> 01:58:02,799
case of tesla it might be a matter of

3248
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:04,800
putting a a rack inside of a car

3249
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:07,039
and you know because the rack kind of

3250
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:09,679
moves around it's it's not that easy

3251
01:58:07,039 --> 01:58:10,960
it's not exactly the same every time it

3252
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:13,118
ends up being the case that you need

3253
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:15,439
actually humans to do it

3254
01:58:13,118 --> 01:58:17,679
and while you know welding cars together

3255
01:58:15,439 --> 01:58:21,919
it's a very repetitive process

3256
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:24,880
and then in case of self-driving itself

3257
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:27,118
the difficulty has to do with the

3258
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:29,679
diversity of the environment but still

3259
01:58:27,118 --> 01:58:31,359
the car itself and the problem that you

3260
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:33,679
are solving is

3261
01:58:31,359 --> 01:58:35,598
you try to avoid even interacting with

3262
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:37,920
things you are not touching anything

3263
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:40,159
around because touching itself is hard

3264
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:42,560
and then if you would have in the home

3265
01:58:40,158 --> 01:58:44,079
uh robot that you know has to touch

3266
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:45,840
things and like if these things they

3267
01:58:44,079 --> 01:58:47,679
change the shape if there is a huge

3268
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:49,279
variety of things to be touched then

3269
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:51,118
that's difficult if you are speaking

3270
01:58:49,279 --> 01:58:53,439
about the robot which there is you know

3271
01:58:51,118 --> 01:58:55,759
head that is smiling in some way with

3272
01:58:53,439 --> 01:58:58,719
cameras that it doesn't you know touch

3273
01:58:55,760 --> 01:59:00,159
things that's relatively simple

3274
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:02,800
okay so

3275
01:59:00,158 --> 01:59:06,000
to both agree and to push back

3276
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:09,440
so you're referring to touch like

3277
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,719
soft robotics like the actual touch

3278
01:59:09,439 --> 01:59:12,960
but

3279
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:14,840
i would argue that you could formulate

3280
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:18,319
just basic interaction

3281
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:20,560
between um like non-contact interaction

3282
01:59:18,319 --> 01:59:22,079
is also a kind of touch and that might

3283
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:24,480
be very difficult to solve that's the

3284
01:59:22,079 --> 01:59:26,639
basic this not disagreement but that's

3285
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:28,638
the basic open question to me

3286
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:31,920
with self-driving cars and disagreement

3287
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:34,000
with elon which is how much interaction

3288
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:37,520
is required to solve self-driving cars

3289
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:40,158
how much touch is required you said that

3290
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:42,560
in your intuition touch is not required

3291
01:59:40,158 --> 01:59:44,719
and my intuition to create a product

3292
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:46,239
that's compelling to use you're going to

3293
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:48,800
have to uh

3294
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:51,519
interact with pedestrians not just avoid

3295
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:54,239
pedestrians but interact with them

3296
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:56,000
when we drive around in major cities

3297
01:59:54,238 --> 01:59:59,198
we're constantly threatening everybody's

3298
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,880
life with our movements

3299
01:59:59,198 --> 02:00:02,079
and that's how they respect us there's a

3300
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:03,520
game theoretically going on with

3301
02:00:02,079 --> 02:00:04,319
pedestrians

3302
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:06,560
and

3303
02:00:04,319 --> 02:00:07,840
i am afraid you can't just

3304
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:10,239
formulate

3305
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:13,199
autonomous driving as a collision

3306
02:00:10,238 --> 02:00:15,198
avoidance problem so i i think it goes

3307
02:00:13,198 --> 02:00:17,439
beyond like a collision avoidance is the

3308
02:00:15,198 --> 02:00:20,238
first order approximation

3309
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:22,238
but then at least in case of tesla they

3310
02:00:20,238 --> 02:00:23,439
are gathering data from people driving

3311
02:00:22,238 --> 02:00:25,118
their cars

3312
02:00:23,439 --> 02:00:26,799
and i believe that's an example of

3313
02:00:25,118 --> 02:00:29,679
supervised learning data that they can

3314
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:31,279
train their models uh on and they are

3315
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:33,520
doing it

3316
02:00:31,279 --> 02:00:34,399
which you know can give the model this

3317
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:36,480
like

3318
02:00:34,399 --> 02:00:39,598
another level of

3319
02:00:36,479 --> 02:00:41,439
of a behavior that is needed to actually

3320
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:43,520
interact with the real world yeah it's

3321
02:00:41,439 --> 02:00:46,399
interesting how much data

3322
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:47,440
is required to achieve that

3323
02:00:46,399 --> 02:00:48,799
um

3324
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:50,638
what do you think of the whole tesla

3325
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:53,199
autopilot approach the computer vision

3326
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:55,359
based approach with multiple cameras and

3327
02:00:53,198 --> 02:00:57,519
there's a data engine it's a multi-task

3328
02:00:55,359 --> 02:01:00,479
multi-headed neural network and it's

3329
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:02,000
this fascinating process of uh similar

3330
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:04,799
to what you're talking about

3331
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:06,960
with the the robotics approach

3332
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:09,039
uh which is you know you deploy neural

3333
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,760
network and then there's humans that use

3334
02:01:09,039 --> 02:01:11,760
it

3335
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:13,840
and then it runs into trouble in a bunch

3336
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:15,360
of places and that stuff is sent back so

3337
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:17,440
like

3338
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:19,839
the deployment discovers a bunch of edge

3339
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:22,238
cases and those edge cases are sent back

3340
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:23,679
for supervised annotation thereby

3341
02:01:22,238 --> 02:01:25,118
improving the neural network and that's

3342
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:27,679
deployed again

3343
02:01:25,118 --> 02:01:29,920
it goes over and over until the the

3344
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:32,319
network becomes really good at the task

3345
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:34,319
of driving becomes safer and safer what

3346
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:36,719
do you think of that kind of approach to

3347
02:01:34,319 --> 02:01:38,799
robotics i believe that's the way to go

3348
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:40,560
so in some sense even when i was

3349
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:42,639
speaking about you know collecting

3350
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:44,320
trajectories from humans that's like a

3351
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:46,239
first step and then you deploy the

3352
02:01:44,319 --> 02:01:46,960
system and then you have humans revising

3353
02:01:46,238 --> 02:01:49,678
the

3354
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,920
all the issues and in some sense

3355
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:53,679
like this approach converges to system

3356
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:55,279
that doesn't make mistakes because for

3357
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:57,359
the cases where there are mistakes you

3358
02:01:55,279 --> 02:01:59,519
got their data how to fix them and the

3359
02:01:57,359 --> 02:02:00,639
system will keep on improving so there's

3360
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:02,480
a very

3361
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:04,560
to me difficult question of how hard

3362
02:02:02,479 --> 02:02:06,718
that you know how long that converging

3363
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:08,800
takes how hard it is

3364
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:10,880
uh the other aspect of autonomous

3365
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:12,960
vehicles this probably applies to

3366
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:16,639
certain robotics applications

3367
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:18,719
is society right they put

3368
02:02:16,639 --> 02:02:20,239
as as the quality of the system

3369
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:21,679
converges

3370
02:02:20,238 --> 02:02:23,598
so one there's a human factors

3371
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:25,840
perspective of psychology of humans

3372
02:02:23,599 --> 02:02:28,000
being able to supervise those uh even

3373
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:31,199
with teleoperation those robots and the

3374
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:32,880
other society willing to accept robots

3375
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:34,638
currently society is much harsher on

3376
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:36,800
self-driving cars than it is on human

3377
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:39,679
driven cars in terms of the expectation

3378
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:42,320
of safety so the bar is set much higher

3379
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:44,639
than for humans and we're so if there's

3380
02:02:42,319 --> 02:02:47,840
a death in an autonomous vehicle that's

3381
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:47,840
seen as much more

3382
02:02:49,359 --> 02:02:52,960
much more dramatic than a death in a

3383
02:02:51,279 --> 02:02:54,559
human driven vehicle

3384
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:56,880
part of the success of deployment of

3385
02:02:54,560 --> 02:03:00,239
robots is figuring out how to make

3386
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:03,039
robots part of society both on the just

3387
02:03:00,238 --> 02:03:05,039
the human side on the media journalist

3388
02:03:03,039 --> 02:03:07,439
side and also on the policy government

3389
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:08,719
side and that seems to be uh

3390
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:10,799
maybe you can put that into the

3391
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:15,039
objective function to optimize

3392
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:17,119
but that is that is definitely um

3393
02:03:15,039 --> 02:03:18,399
a tricky one and i wonder if that is

3394
02:03:17,118 --> 02:03:20,399
actually the trickiest part for

3395
02:03:18,399 --> 02:03:22,319
self-driving cars or any system that's

3396
02:03:20,399 --> 02:03:24,879
safety critical

3397
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:27,279
it's not the algorithm it's the society

3398
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:29,199
accepting it

3399
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:31,118
yeah i i would say

3400
02:03:29,198 --> 02:03:33,198
i believe that

3401
02:03:31,118 --> 02:03:35,439
the part of the process of deployment is

3402
02:03:33,198 --> 02:03:38,799
actually showing people that the given

3403
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:40,839
things can be trusted yeah and you know

3404
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:44,159
trust is also like a glass that is

3405
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:47,199
actually really easy to crack it yeah

3406
02:03:44,158 --> 02:03:48,879
and damage it and

3407
02:03:47,198 --> 02:03:52,399
i think that's actually

3408
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:52,400
very common with uh

3409
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:56,079
with innovation

3410
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,880
that there is some resistance toward it

3411
02:03:56,078 --> 02:03:57,679
yeah

3412
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:59,440
and

3413
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:01,440
it's just the natural progression so in

3414
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:03,759
some sense people will have to keep on

3415
02:04:01,439 --> 02:04:06,799
proving that indeed these systems are

3416
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:08,960
worth being used and i would say

3417
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:11,760
i also found out that

3418
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:14,399
often the best way to convince people

3419
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:15,920
is by letting them experience it yeah

3420
02:04:14,399 --> 02:04:17,598
absolutely that's the case for tesla

3421
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:19,840
autopilot for example

3422
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:21,840
that's the case with uh yeah with

3423
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:23,760
basically robots in general it's it's

3424
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:25,119
kind of funny to hear people talk about

3425
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:27,199
robots like

3426
02:04:25,118 --> 02:04:29,759
there's a lot of fear

3427
02:04:27,198 --> 02:04:32,319
even like legged robots but when they

3428
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:33,760
actually interact with them

3429
02:04:32,319 --> 02:04:35,359
there's joy

3430
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,800
i love interacting with them and the

3431
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:38,639
same with the car

3432
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:40,880
with the robot

3433
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:42,880
if it starts being useful

3434
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:44,880
i think people immediately understand

3435
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:46,800
and if the product is designed well they

3436
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:48,319
fall in love you're right

3437
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:50,480
it's actually even similar when i'm

3438
02:04:48,319 --> 02:04:52,158
thinking about co-pilot the github

3439
02:04:50,479 --> 02:04:55,198
co-pilot there was a spectrum of

3440
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:56,479
responses that people had and uh

3441
02:04:55,198 --> 02:04:57,279
ultimately

3442
02:04:56,479 --> 02:04:59,198
uh

3443
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:01,759
the important piece was to let people

3444
02:04:59,198 --> 02:05:03,759
try it out and then many people just

3445
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:06,000
loved it especially like

3446
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:07,440
programmers yeah programmers but like

3447
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,238
some of them you know they came with a

3448
02:05:07,439 --> 02:05:10,078
fear

3449
02:05:08,238 --> 02:05:12,000
yeah but then you try it out and you

3450
02:05:10,078 --> 02:05:13,599
think actually that's cool okay and you

3451
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,319
know you can try to resist the same way

3452
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:18,800
as you know you could resist moving from

3453
02:05:16,319 --> 02:05:20,799
punch cards to let's say

3454
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:21,520
c plus or so

3455
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:23,920
and

3456
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:26,400
it's a little bit futile

3457
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:29,359
so we talked about generation program

3458
02:05:26,399 --> 02:05:30,479
generation of language

3459
02:05:29,359 --> 02:05:32,158
even

3460
02:05:30,479 --> 02:05:33,678
self-supervised learning in the visual

3461
02:05:32,158 --> 02:05:35,679
space for robotics and then

3462
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:37,679
reinforcement learning what do you and

3463
02:05:35,679 --> 02:05:40,000
like this whole beautiful

3464
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:41,599
spectrum of ai

3465
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:45,920
do you think is a good

3466
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:48,400
benchmark a good test to strive for

3467
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:50,399
to achieve intelligence that's a strong

3468
02:05:48,399 --> 02:05:53,198
test of intelligence you know it started

3469
02:05:50,399 --> 02:05:55,039
with alan turing and the touring test

3470
02:05:53,198 --> 02:05:57,118
maybe you think natural language

3471
02:05:55,039 --> 02:05:59,118
conversation is a good test

3472
02:05:57,118 --> 02:06:01,598
so you know it would be nice if for

3473
02:05:59,118 --> 02:06:04,399
instance machine would be able to solve

3474
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:06,800
riemann hypothesis in math

3475
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:09,198
that would be i think that would be very

3476
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:11,679
impressive so theorem proving

3477
02:06:09,198 --> 02:06:12,399
is that to you proving theorems is a

3478
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:14,480
good

3479
02:06:12,399 --> 02:06:16,559
oh oh like one thing that the machine

3480
02:06:14,479 --> 02:06:18,479
did you would say damn

3481
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:19,520
exactly

3482
02:06:18,479 --> 02:06:21,039
okay

3483
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:23,760
that would be quite

3484
02:06:21,039 --> 02:06:26,078
quite impressive i mean the the tricky

3485
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,599
part about the benchmarks is

3486
02:06:26,078 --> 02:06:28,880
um you know as we are getting closer

3487
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:30,480
with them we have to invent new

3488
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:33,118
benchmarks there is actually no ultimate

3489
02:06:30,479 --> 02:06:35,519
benchmark out there yeah see my thought

3490
02:06:33,118 --> 02:06:37,839
with the riemann hypothesis would be

3491
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:40,960
the moment the machine proves it would

3492
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:43,199
say okay well then the problem was easy

3493
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:45,599
that's what happens and i mean in some

3494
02:06:43,198 --> 02:06:48,078
sense um that's actually what happens

3495
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:50,480
over the years in ai that like uh

3496
02:06:48,078 --> 02:06:52,399
we get used to things very quickly you

3497
02:06:50,479 --> 02:06:54,479
know something i talked to rodney brooks

3498
02:06:52,399 --> 02:06:57,118
i don't know if you know that is

3499
02:06:54,479 --> 02:06:58,559
he called alpha zero homework problem

3500
02:06:57,118 --> 02:07:00,479
because he was saying like there's

3501
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:02,560
nothing special about it it's not a big

3502
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:04,638
leap and i i didn't

3503
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:07,039
well he's coming from one of the aspects

3504
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:09,679
that we referred to as he was part of uh

3505
02:07:07,039 --> 02:07:11,279
the founding of irobot which deployed

3506
02:07:09,679 --> 02:07:12,880
now tens of millions of robot in the

3507
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:15,840
home so

3508
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:18,078
if you see robots

3509
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:19,920
that are actually in the homes of people

3510
02:07:18,078 --> 02:07:21,759
as the legitimate

3511
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:24,158
instantiation of artificial intelligence

3512
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:25,920
then yes maybe an ai that plays a silly

3513
02:07:24,158 --> 02:07:28,158
game like going chess is not a real

3514
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:30,078
accomplishment but to me it's it's a

3515
02:07:28,158 --> 02:07:32,479
fundamental leap but i think we as

3516
02:07:30,078 --> 02:07:34,799
humans then say okay well then

3517
02:07:32,479 --> 02:07:37,039
that uh that game of chess or go wasn't

3518
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:38,960
that difficult compared to the thing

3519
02:07:37,039 --> 02:07:40,880
that's currently unsolved so my

3520
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:44,158
intuition is that

3521
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:46,639
from perspective of the evolution of

3522
02:07:44,158 --> 02:07:49,118
you know these ai systems we'll at first

3523
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:51,118
see the tremendous progress in digital

3524
02:07:49,118 --> 02:07:53,279
space and the you know the main thing

3525
02:07:51,118 --> 02:07:55,039
about digital space is also that you can

3526
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:57,840
everything is that there is a lot of

3527
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:59,920
recorded data plus you can very rapidly

3528
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:03,360
deploy things to billions of people

3529
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:05,679
while in case of uh physical space the

3530
02:08:03,359 --> 02:08:08,719
deployment part takes multiple years you

3531
02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:11,039
have to manufacture things and

3532
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:13,599
you know delivering it to actual people

3533
02:08:11,039 --> 02:08:17,679
it's very hard

3534
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:19,760
so i'm expecting that the first and the

3535
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:22,960
prices in digital space

3536
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:25,039
of goods they would go you know down to

3537
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:26,639
the let's say marginal costs are to zero

3538
02:08:25,039 --> 02:08:29,198
and also the question is how much of our

3539
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:31,118
life will be in digital because it seems

3540
02:08:29,198 --> 02:08:33,279
like we're heading towards more and more

3541
02:08:31,118 --> 02:08:34,559
of our lives being in the digital space

3542
02:08:33,279 --> 02:08:36,238
so like

3543
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:38,400
innovation in the physical space might

3544
02:08:36,238 --> 02:08:40,959
become less and less significant like

3545
02:08:38,399 --> 02:08:43,118
why do you need to drive anywhere

3546
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:46,399
if most of your life is spent in virtual

3547
02:08:43,118 --> 02:08:48,158
reality i still would like you know to

3548
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:50,000
at least at the moment my impression is

3549
02:08:48,158 --> 02:08:51,279
that i would like to have a physical

3550
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:53,520
contact with other people and that's

3551
02:08:51,279 --> 02:08:55,279
very important to me and we don't have a

3552
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:56,800
way to replicate it in the computer it

3553
02:08:55,279 --> 02:08:58,078
might be the case that over the time it

3554
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:00,560
will change

3555
02:08:58,078 --> 02:09:02,479
like in 10 years from now why not have

3556
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:04,320
like an arbitrary infinite number of

3557
02:09:02,479 --> 02:09:06,718
people you can interact with some of

3558
02:09:04,319 --> 02:09:09,679
them are real some are not

3559
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:11,760
with uh arbitrary characteristics that

3560
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:13,760
you can define based on your own

3561
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:15,760
preferences i think that's maybe where

3562
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:18,239
we are heading and maybe i'm resisting

3563
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:20,159
the future yeah

3564
02:09:18,238 --> 02:09:23,359
i'm telling you

3565
02:09:20,158 --> 02:09:26,719
i if i got to choose

3566
02:09:23,359 --> 02:09:29,279
if i could live in elder scrolls skyrim

3567
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:31,439
versus the real world i'm not so sure i

3568
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:34,238
would stay with the real world

3569
02:09:31,439 --> 02:09:36,479
yeah i mean the question is so will vr

3570
02:09:34,238 --> 02:09:38,479
be sufficient to get us there or do do

3571
02:09:36,479 --> 02:09:40,158
you need to you know plug electrodes in

3572
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:42,479
the brain

3573
02:09:40,158 --> 02:09:45,039
and it would be nice if these electrodes

3574
02:09:42,479 --> 02:09:46,479
wouldn't be invasive yeah

3575
02:09:45,039 --> 02:09:48,960
or at least like provably

3576
02:09:46,479 --> 02:09:51,839
non-destructive

3577
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:53,439
but in in the digital space do you do

3578
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:55,279
you think we'll be able to solve the

3579
02:09:53,439 --> 02:09:57,279
touring test the spirit of the touring

3580
02:09:55,279 --> 02:09:58,840
test which is do you think we'll be able

3581
02:09:57,279 --> 02:10:01,439
to

3582
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:03,679
achieve compelling natural language

3583
02:10:01,439 --> 02:10:05,839
conversation between people like have

3584
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:07,039
friends that are ai systems on the

3585
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:08,960
internet

3586
02:10:07,039 --> 02:10:11,679
i thought i think it's doable do you

3587
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:13,679
think the current approach of gbt

3588
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:16,158
will take us there so there is you know

3589
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:18,078
the the part of at first learning all

3590
02:10:16,158 --> 02:10:20,000
the content out there and i i think that

3591
02:10:18,078 --> 02:10:22,319
steel system should keep on learning as

3592
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,078
it speaks with you yeah

3593
02:10:22,319 --> 02:10:25,840
and i think that should work the

3594
02:10:24,078 --> 02:10:27,439
question is how exactly to do it and you

3595
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:29,760
know obviously

3596
02:10:27,439 --> 02:10:31,039
we have people at open air asking these

3597
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:34,159
questions

3598
02:10:31,039 --> 02:10:36,560
and kind of at first pre-training on all

3599
02:10:34,158 --> 02:10:39,359
existing content is like a backbone and

3600
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:41,039
it's a decent backbone

3601
02:10:39,359 --> 02:10:42,799
do you think ai

3602
02:10:41,039 --> 02:10:45,198
needs a body

3603
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:47,679
connecting to our robotics question

3604
02:10:45,198 --> 02:10:49,118
to uh truly connect with humans or can

3605
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:50,399
can most of the connection be in the

3606
02:10:49,118 --> 02:10:52,319
digital space

3607
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:54,479
so let's see

3608
02:10:52,319 --> 02:10:57,759
we know that there are people who met

3609
02:10:54,479 --> 02:10:58,638
each other online and they felt in love

3610
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:01,760
yeah

3611
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:05,199
so it seems that it's conceivable to

3612
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:06,960
establish connection which is purely

3613
02:11:05,198 --> 02:11:08,559
through internet

3614
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:12,239
and of course it might be more

3615
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:13,840
compelling than more modalities you add

3616
02:11:12,238 --> 02:11:16,319
so it would be like you're proposing

3617
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:18,078
like a tinder but for ai

3618
02:11:16,319 --> 02:11:20,238
are you like swipe right and left and

3619
02:11:18,078 --> 02:11:21,118
half the systems are ai and the other is

3620
02:11:20,238 --> 02:11:24,399
uh

3621
02:11:21,118 --> 02:11:26,000
humans and you don't know which is which

3622
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:28,158
that would be ours that would be our

3623
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:31,439
formulation of touring test the the

3624
02:11:28,158 --> 02:11:33,118
moment ai is able to achieve more swipe

3625
02:11:31,439 --> 02:11:34,719
right or left whatever

3626
02:11:33,118 --> 02:11:36,799
the the moment is able to be more

3627
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:38,480
attractive than other humans

3628
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:39,599
it passes the torrent test then you

3629
02:11:38,479 --> 02:11:41,759
would pass the turing test in

3630
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:44,078
attractiveness that's right well no like

3631
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:46,079
attractiveness just declare conversation

3632
02:11:44,078 --> 02:11:47,519
not just visual right it's also

3633
02:11:46,078 --> 02:11:50,960
attractiveness

3634
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:52,719
with wit and humor and uh whatever

3635
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:55,359
whatever makes conversations pleasant

3636
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:55,359
for humans

3637
02:11:56,078 --> 02:12:01,279
okay all right um

3638
02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:02,960
so so you're saying uh it's possible to

3639
02:12:01,279 --> 02:12:05,118
achieve in the digital space in some

3640
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:07,198
sense i would almost ask that question

3641
02:12:05,118 --> 02:12:08,000
why wouldn't that be possible

3642
02:12:07,198 --> 02:12:08,960
right

3643
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,800
well

3644
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:13,118
i have this argument with my dad all the

3645
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:14,400
time he thinks that touch and smell are

3646
02:12:13,118 --> 02:12:17,118
really important

3647
02:12:14,399 --> 02:12:18,879
so they can be very important and i'm

3648
02:12:17,118 --> 02:12:20,399
saying the initial systems they won't

3649
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:23,760
have it

3650
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:24,559
still i wouldn't like their people being

3651
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:26,480
born

3652
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:27,440
without these senses

3653
02:12:26,479 --> 02:12:29,279
and

3654
02:12:27,439 --> 02:12:32,158
you know i believe that they can still

3655
02:12:29,279 --> 02:12:35,519
fall in love and have meaningful life

3656
02:12:32,158 --> 02:12:37,920
yeah i wonder if it's uh possible to go

3657
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:40,400
close to all the way by just training on

3658
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:42,639
transcripts of conversations

3659
02:12:40,399 --> 02:12:44,319
like i wonder how far that takes us so i

3660
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:46,639
i think that actually still you want

3661
02:12:44,319 --> 02:12:49,039
images like i would like so i don't have

3662
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:52,400
kids but like i could imagine the

3663
02:12:49,039 --> 02:12:53,519
having ai tutor it has to see you know

3664
02:12:52,399 --> 02:12:55,679
kids

3665
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:57,760
drawing some pictures on their paper

3666
02:12:55,679 --> 02:13:00,078
and and also facial expressions and all

3667
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:02,400
that kind of stuff we use uh dogs and

3668
02:13:00,078 --> 02:13:04,158
humans use their eyes and

3669
02:13:02,399 --> 02:13:06,000
uh to communicate with each other i

3670
02:13:04,158 --> 02:13:07,839
think this that's that's a really

3671
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,039
powerful mechanism of communication body

3672
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:11,920
language too

3673
02:13:09,039 --> 02:13:13,840
that uh words are much uh lower

3674
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:15,599
bandwidth and for body language we still

3675
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:17,279
you know we kind of have a system that

3676
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:18,960
displays an image

3677
02:13:17,279 --> 02:13:21,198
of its or facial expression on the

3678
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:24,239
computer it doesn't have to move you

3679
02:13:21,198 --> 02:13:26,719
know mechanical pieces or so so i think

3680
02:13:24,238 --> 02:13:28,959
that uh you know there is like kind of a

3681
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:31,679
progression you can imagine that text

3682
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:32,880
might be the simplest to tackle

3683
02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:35,118
but

3684
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:37,920
this is not a complete

3685
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:39,039
human experience at all you expand it to

3686
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:41,520
let's say

3687
02:13:39,039 --> 02:13:44,560
images both for input and output and

3688
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:47,199
what you describe is actually the final

3689
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:48,960
i guess frontier what makes us human the

3690
02:13:47,198 --> 02:13:51,759
fact that we can touch each other or

3691
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:54,158
smell or so and it's the hardest from

3692
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:54,880
perspective of data and deployment

3693
02:13:54,158 --> 02:13:57,359
and

3694
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:59,599
i okay i believe that these things might

3695
02:13:57,359 --> 02:14:01,519
happen gradually

3696
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:04,239
are you excited by that possibility this

3697
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:06,320
particular application of

3698
02:14:04,238 --> 02:14:09,678
human to ai

3699
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:11,198
friendship and interaction so let's see

3700
02:14:09,679 --> 02:14:13,359
like would you uh do you look forward to

3701
02:14:11,198 --> 02:14:14,719
a world you you said you're living with

3702
02:14:13,359 --> 02:14:16,078
a few folks and you're very close

3703
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:17,679
friends with them

3704
02:14:16,078 --> 02:14:19,599
do you look forward to a day where one

3705
02:14:17,679 --> 02:14:22,480
or two of those friends are ai systems

3706
02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:23,520
so if the system would be truly wishing

3707
02:14:22,479 --> 02:14:25,439
me well

3708
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:27,760
rather than being in the situation that

3709
02:14:25,439 --> 02:14:29,359
it optimizes for my time to interact

3710
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:30,480
with the system

3711
02:14:29,359 --> 02:14:33,118
the line

3712
02:14:30,479 --> 02:14:36,000
between those is it's a gray

3713
02:14:33,118 --> 02:14:37,920
it's a gray area i i think that's the

3714
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:41,198
distinction between

3715
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:43,199
love and possession and these things

3716
02:14:41,198 --> 02:14:46,559
they might be often correlated for

3717
02:14:43,198 --> 02:14:47,919
humans but it's it like like a you you

3718
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:50,480
might find that there like some friends

3719
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:52,158
with whom you haven't spoken for months

3720
02:14:50,479 --> 02:14:55,598
yeah and then you know you pick up the

3721
02:14:52,158 --> 02:14:57,759
phone it's as the time hasn't passed

3722
02:14:55,599 --> 02:14:59,599
they are not holding to you

3723
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:02,000
and i will i wouldn't like to have ai

3724
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:03,039
system that you know it's

3725
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,880
it's

3726
02:15:03,039 --> 02:15:08,560
trying to convince me to spend time with

3727
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:11,359
it i would like the system to optimize

3728
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:14,079
for what i care about and help me

3729
02:15:11,359 --> 02:15:17,039
in achieving my own goals

3730
02:15:14,078 --> 02:15:18,799
but there's some i mean i don't know

3731
02:15:17,039 --> 02:15:21,039
there's some manipulation there's some

3732
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:22,960
possessiveness there's some insecurities

3733
02:15:21,039 --> 02:15:24,238
this fragility all those things are

3734
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:26,639
necessary

3735
02:15:24,238 --> 02:15:29,118
to form a close friendship over time to

3736
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:32,000
go through some dark [ __ ] together some

3737
02:15:29,118 --> 02:15:34,078
bliss and happiness together i feel like

3738
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:36,800
there's a lot of greedy self-centered

3739
02:15:34,078 --> 02:15:39,039
behavior within that process

3740
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:40,400
my intuition but i might be wrong is

3741
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:42,880
that

3742
02:15:40,399 --> 02:15:45,118
human computer interaction doesn't have

3743
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:47,679
to go through uh

3744
02:15:45,118 --> 02:15:50,799
computer being greedy possessive and so

3745
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:53,520
on it is possible to train systems maybe

3746
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:55,520
that they actually

3747
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:57,440
you know they are i guess prompted or

3748
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:59,520
fine-tuned or so

3749
02:15:57,439 --> 02:16:01,279
to truly optimize for what you care

3750
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:02,480
about and you could imagine that you

3751
02:16:01,279 --> 02:16:04,238
know

3752
02:16:02,479 --> 02:16:07,519
that the way how the process would look

3753
02:16:04,238 --> 02:16:07,519
like is at some point

3754
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:11,440
we as a human as we look at the

3755
02:16:09,039 --> 02:16:13,920
transcript of the conversation or like

3756
02:16:11,439 --> 02:16:16,238
an entire interaction and we say

3757
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:19,199
actually here there was more loving way

3758
02:16:16,238 --> 02:16:21,359
to go about it and we supervise system

3759
02:16:19,198 --> 02:16:23,759
toward being more loving

3760
02:16:21,359 --> 02:16:25,279
or maybe we train the system such that

3761
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:27,679
it has a reward function toward being

3762
02:16:25,279 --> 02:16:29,439
more loving yeah or maybe the

3763
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:30,880
possibility of the system being an

3764
02:16:29,439 --> 02:16:33,199
[ __ ]

3765
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:36,558
and manipulative and possessive every

3766
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:39,359
once in a while is a feature not a bug

3767
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:42,000
because some of the

3768
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:43,840
happiness that we experience when two

3769
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:46,398
souls meet each other when two humans

3770
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:48,318
meet each other is a kind of break from

3771
02:16:46,398 --> 02:16:52,000
the [ __ ] in the world

3772
02:16:48,318 --> 02:16:53,279
and so you need [ __ ] and ai as well

3773
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,040
because like

3774
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:57,519
it'll be like a breath of fresh air to

3775
02:16:55,040 --> 02:17:00,160
discover an ai that

3776
02:16:57,519 --> 02:17:01,200
the three previous ais you had are too

3777
02:17:00,159 --> 02:17:04,478
friendly

3778
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:06,000
or no no or or cruel or whatever it's

3779
02:17:04,478 --> 02:17:08,318
like some kind of mix

3780
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:10,318
and then this one is just right but you

3781
02:17:08,318 --> 02:17:12,000
need to experience the full spectrum

3782
02:17:10,318 --> 02:17:17,119
like i think you need to be able to

3783
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:19,920
engineer [ __ ] so let's see

3784
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:22,240
because there's some level to us of

3785
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:24,000
being appreciate to appreciate the human

3786
02:17:22,239 --> 02:17:26,159
experience

3787
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:29,359
we need the dark

3788
02:17:26,159 --> 02:17:32,159
and the light so that kind of reminds me

3789
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:34,159
um i met a while ago at the meditation

3790
02:17:32,159 --> 02:17:36,718
retreat uh

3791
02:17:34,159 --> 02:17:39,119
one woman and

3792
02:17:36,718 --> 02:17:42,159
um you know beautiful beautiful woman

3793
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:45,120
and she had a she had a crutch okay she

3794
02:17:42,159 --> 02:17:47,359
had the trouble uh walking on one deck i

3795
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:48,240
asked her what has happened

3796
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:51,679
and

3797
02:17:48,239 --> 02:17:53,359
she said that five years ago she was in

3798
02:17:51,679 --> 02:17:56,079
maui hawaii

3799
02:17:53,359 --> 02:17:58,800
and she was eating a salad and some

3800
02:17:56,079 --> 02:18:00,959
snail fell into the salad and apparently

3801
02:17:58,799 --> 02:18:03,518
there are neurotoxic

3802
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:05,759
snails over there and she got into coma

3803
02:18:03,519 --> 02:18:07,200
for a year okay oh wow

3804
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:08,719
and

3805
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:10,319
apparently there is you know high chance

3806
02:18:08,718 --> 02:18:12,558
of even just dying but she was in the

3807
02:18:10,318 --> 02:18:15,119
coma at some point

3808
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:18,318
she regained partially consciousness she

3809
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:21,120
was able to hear people in the room

3810
02:18:18,318 --> 02:18:23,519
people behave as she wouldn't be there

3811
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:25,599
you know at some point she started being

3812
02:18:23,519 --> 02:18:28,719
able to speak but she was mumbling like

3813
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:31,280
a barely able to to express herself and

3814
02:18:28,718 --> 02:18:33,518
at some point she got into wheelchair

3815
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:36,319
then at some point she actually noticed

3816
02:18:33,519 --> 02:18:37,679
that she can move her uh

3817
02:18:36,318 --> 02:18:39,359
a toe

3818
02:18:37,679 --> 02:18:40,799
and then she knew that she will be able

3819
02:18:39,359 --> 02:18:42,318
to walk

3820
02:18:40,799 --> 02:18:44,718
and then you know that's where she was

3821
02:18:42,318 --> 02:18:46,799
five years after and she said that since

3822
02:18:44,718 --> 02:18:48,959
then she appreciates the fact that she

3823
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:50,799
can move her toe

3824
02:18:48,959 --> 02:18:52,879
and i was thinking

3825
02:18:50,799 --> 02:18:55,039
do i need to go through such experience

3826
02:18:52,879 --> 02:18:57,358
to appreciate that i have i can move my

3827
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:59,760
toe well that's really good story a

3828
02:18:57,359 --> 02:19:02,000
really deep example yeah

3829
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:04,239
and in some sense it might be the case

3830
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,558
that we don't see

3831
02:19:04,239 --> 02:19:08,718
light if we haven't went through the

3832
02:19:06,558 --> 02:19:10,000
darkness but i wouldn't say that we

3833
02:19:08,718 --> 02:19:11,598
should

3834
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,478
we shouldn't assume that that's the case

3835
02:19:11,599 --> 02:19:15,519
which

3836
02:19:12,478 --> 02:19:17,279
may we maybe will do engineer shortcuts

3837
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:20,000
yeah ilia had

3838
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:22,639
this you know belief that maybe one has

3839
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:25,599
to go for a week or six months

3840
02:19:22,638 --> 02:19:28,318
to some challenging camp yeah

3841
02:19:25,599 --> 02:19:30,159
to just experience you know a lot of

3842
02:19:28,318 --> 02:19:31,039
difficulties and then comes back and

3843
02:19:30,159 --> 02:19:32,959
actually

3844
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:34,960
everything is bright everything is

3845
02:19:32,959 --> 02:19:36,398
beautiful i'm with iliana it must be a

3846
02:19:34,959 --> 02:19:39,678
russian thing where are you from

3847
02:19:36,398 --> 02:19:41,519
originally i'm i'm polish polish

3848
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:43,519
okay

3849
02:19:41,519 --> 02:19:45,439
i'm tempted to say that explains a lot

3850
02:19:43,519 --> 02:19:47,920
but uh yeah there's something about the

3851
02:19:45,439 --> 02:19:50,398
russian the necessity of suffering i

3852
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:53,359
believe i believe suffering or rather

3853
02:19:50,398 --> 02:19:54,959
struggle is necessary i believe that

3854
02:19:53,359 --> 02:19:55,840
struggle is necessary i mean in some

3855
02:19:54,959 --> 02:19:56,719
sense

3856
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:59,600
you

3857
02:19:56,719 --> 02:20:01,358
even look at the story of any superhero

3858
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:03,600
in that movie it's not that it was like

3859
02:20:01,359 --> 02:20:06,399
everything like it goes easy easy i like

3860
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:08,720
how that's your ground truth

3861
02:20:06,398 --> 02:20:10,799
it's the story of superheroes okay

3862
02:20:08,719 --> 02:20:12,799
uh you mentioned that you used to do

3863
02:20:10,799 --> 02:20:15,119
research at night and go to bed at like

3864
02:20:12,799 --> 02:20:16,879
6 a.m or 7 a.m

3865
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:17,920
i still do that

3866
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:18,879
often

3867
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:21,200
um

3868
02:20:18,879 --> 02:20:23,119
what uh sleep schedules have you tried

3869
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:24,560
to make for a productive and happy life

3870
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:27,040
like is there

3871
02:20:24,559 --> 02:20:29,359
um is there some interesting wild

3872
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:31,439
sleeping patterns that you engaged that

3873
02:20:29,359 --> 02:20:33,040
you found that works really well for you

3874
02:20:31,439 --> 02:20:34,880
i tried at some point

3875
02:20:33,040 --> 02:20:36,080
decreasing number of hours of sleep like

3876
02:20:34,879 --> 02:20:39,119
gradually

3877
02:20:36,079 --> 02:20:42,000
like a half an hour every few days less

3878
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:43,840
you know i was hoping to just save time

3879
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:45,920
that clearly didn't work for me like at

3880
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:46,880
some point there's like a phase shift

3881
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:48,879
and

3882
02:20:46,879 --> 02:20:50,318
i felt tired all the time

3883
02:20:48,879 --> 02:20:52,239
uh

3884
02:20:50,318 --> 02:20:54,639
you know there was a time that i used to

3885
02:20:52,239 --> 02:20:56,879
work during the nights the nice thing

3886
02:20:54,639 --> 02:20:57,680
about the nights is that no one disturbs

3887
02:20:56,879 --> 02:20:58,478
you

3888
02:20:57,680 --> 02:20:59,920
and

3889
02:20:58,478 --> 02:21:01,279
even i remember

3890
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:03,760
when i was

3891
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:06,880
meeting for the first time with greg

3892
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:09,600
brookman his cto and chairman of openai

3893
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:12,559
our meeting was scheduled to 5 pm

3894
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:14,559
and i overstepped for the meeting

3895
02:21:12,559 --> 02:21:16,559
over slept for the meeting yeah 5 p.m

3896
02:21:14,559 --> 02:21:19,600
yeah now you sound like me that's

3897
02:21:16,559 --> 02:21:21,600
hilarious okay yeah and uh at the moment

3898
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:24,000
in some sense uh

3899
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:25,600
my sleeping schedule also has to do with

3900
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,359
the fact that i'm

3901
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:29,280
interacting with people

3902
02:21:27,359 --> 02:21:30,800
i sleep without an alarm

3903
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:33,200
so

3904
02:21:30,799 --> 02:21:35,039
so yeah the the team thing you mentioned

3905
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:37,760
extrovert thing because

3906
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:39,200
most humans operate during a certain set

3907
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:41,120
of hours

3908
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:42,800
you're forced to then operate at the

3909
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:44,960
same set of hours

3910
02:21:42,799 --> 02:21:46,959
but

3911
02:21:44,959 --> 02:21:49,199
i'm not quite there yet

3912
02:21:46,959 --> 02:21:50,879
i found a lot of joy just like you said

3913
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:52,479
working through the night

3914
02:21:50,879 --> 02:21:54,239
because it's quiet

3915
02:21:52,478 --> 02:21:56,079
because the world doesn't disturb you

3916
02:21:54,239 --> 02:21:58,079
and there's some aspect

3917
02:21:56,079 --> 02:22:00,318
counter to everything you're saying

3918
02:21:58,079 --> 02:22:02,639
there's some joyful aspect to sleeping

3919
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:04,719
through the mess of the day

3920
02:22:02,639 --> 02:22:06,959
because uh people are having meetings

3921
02:22:04,719 --> 02:22:09,279
and sending emails and there's drama

3922
02:22:06,959 --> 02:22:11,199
meetings i can sleep through all the

3923
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:13,200
meetings you know i have meetings every

3924
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:15,120
day and they prevent me from having

3925
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:16,800
sufficient amount of time for

3926
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:18,880
focus work

3927
02:22:16,799 --> 02:22:19,759
and

3928
02:22:18,879 --> 02:22:22,159
then

3929
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:24,079
i modified my calendar and i said that

3930
02:22:22,159 --> 02:22:26,398
i'm out of office wednesday thursday and

3931
02:22:24,079 --> 02:22:28,159
friday every day and i'm having meetings

3932
02:22:26,398 --> 02:22:30,079
only monday and tuesday

3933
02:22:28,159 --> 02:22:32,000
and that vastly

3934
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:34,000
positively influenced my mood that i

3935
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:36,879
have literally like had three days for

3936
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:39,120
fully focused work yeah so there's

3937
02:22:36,879 --> 02:22:41,839
better solutions to this problem than

3938
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:43,680
staying awake all night okay

3939
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:45,200
you've been part of development of some

3940
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:47,120
of the greatest ideas in artificial

3941
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:50,399
intelligence what would you say is your

3942
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:52,160
process for developing good novel ideas

3943
02:22:50,398 --> 02:22:53,760
you have to be aware that

3944
02:22:52,159 --> 02:22:55,280
clearly there are many other brilliant

3945
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:56,318
people around

3946
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:58,800
so

3947
02:22:56,318 --> 02:23:02,079
you have to ask yourself a question

3948
02:22:58,799 --> 02:23:04,799
why the given idea

3949
02:23:02,079 --> 02:23:06,159
let's say wasn't uh tried by someone

3950
02:23:04,799 --> 02:23:08,639
else

3951
02:23:06,159 --> 02:23:09,920
and in some sense it has to

3952
02:23:08,639 --> 02:23:12,079
do with

3953
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:13,760
you know kind of simple it might sound

3954
02:23:12,079 --> 02:23:16,159
simple but like i'm thinking outside of

3955
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:18,559
the box and what do i mean here

3956
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:22,079
so for instance for a while

3957
02:23:18,559 --> 02:23:23,119
people in academia they assumed

3958
02:23:22,079 --> 02:23:25,439
that

3959
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:28,479
you have a fixed data set

3960
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:31,520
and then you optimize the algorithms

3961
02:23:28,478 --> 02:23:32,799
in order to get the best performance

3962
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:35,359
and

3963
02:23:32,799 --> 02:23:37,679
that was so in great assumption

3964
02:23:35,359 --> 02:23:41,280
that no one thought about

3965
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:43,760
training models on anti-internet

3966
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:47,359
or like that that maybe some people

3967
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:49,680
thought about it but if it felt too too

3968
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:52,239
many as unfair

3969
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:53,920
and in some sense that's almost like a

3970
02:23:52,239 --> 02:23:56,879
it's not my idea or so but that's an

3971
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:59,200
example of breaking a typical assumption

3972
02:23:56,879 --> 02:24:01,679
so you want to be in the paradigm that

3973
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:05,439
you are breaking a typical assumption

3974
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:07,920
in the context of the ai community

3975
02:24:05,439 --> 02:24:10,398
getting to pick your dataset as cheating

3976
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:12,079
correct and in some sense so that was a

3977
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:13,279
that was assumption that many people had

3978
02:24:12,079 --> 02:24:16,239
out there

3979
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:17,520
and then if you free yourself from

3980
02:24:16,239 --> 02:24:18,719
assumptions

3981
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:19,920
then

3982
02:24:18,719 --> 02:24:21,679
they are

3983
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:23,280
likely to achieve something that others

3984
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:25,280
cannot do and in some sense if you are

3985
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:26,239
trying to do exactly the same things as

3986
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:27,760
others

3987
02:24:26,239 --> 02:24:30,239
it's very likely that you're gonna have

3988
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:31,920
the same results yeah i

3989
02:24:30,239 --> 02:24:33,280
but there's also that kind of tension

3990
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:36,079
which is uh

3991
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:38,399
asking yourself the question why

3992
02:24:36,079 --> 02:24:41,120
haven't others done this

3993
02:24:38,398 --> 02:24:44,000
because um

3994
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:47,120
i mean i get a lot of good ideas

3995
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:48,879
but i think probably most of them suck

3996
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:51,439
when they meet reality

3997
02:24:48,879 --> 02:24:52,559
so so actually i think the other big

3998
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:53,439
piece

3999
02:24:52,559 --> 02:24:55,760
is

4000
02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:57,280
uh getting into habit of generating

4001
02:24:55,760 --> 02:25:01,200
ideas training your brain toward

4002
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:04,000
generating ideas and not even

4003
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:07,040
suspending judgment of the ideas

4004
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:08,879
so in some sense i noticed myself that

4005
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:11,840
even if i'm in the process of generating

4006
02:25:08,879 --> 02:25:13,119
ideas if i tell myself oh that was a bad

4007
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:15,600
idea

4008
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:18,079
then that actually interrupts the

4009
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:19,600
process and i cannot generate more ideas

4010
02:25:18,079 --> 02:25:22,239
because i'm actually focused on the

4011
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:23,280
negative part why it won't work yes

4012
02:25:22,239 --> 02:25:25,199
but

4013
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:27,760
i created also environment in the way

4014
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:30,800
that it's very easy for me to to store

4015
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:31,920
new ideas so for instance next to my bed

4016
02:25:30,799 --> 02:25:33,599
i have a

4017
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:36,079
voice recorder

4018
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:37,680
and it happens to me often like i wake

4019
02:25:36,079 --> 02:25:40,079
up in that during the night and i have

4020
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:42,000
some idea in the past i was

4021
02:25:40,079 --> 02:25:43,760
writing them down on my phone but that

4022
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,000
means you know turning off this turning

4023
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:48,398
on the screen and that wakes me up or

4024
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:50,398
like pulling a paper which requires you

4025
02:25:48,398 --> 02:25:52,879
know turning on the

4026
02:25:50,398 --> 02:25:53,760
light these days i just start recording

4027
02:25:52,879 --> 02:25:55,039
it

4028
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:57,840
what do you think i don't know if you

4029
02:25:55,040 --> 02:26:00,800
know who jim keller is i know team color

4030
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:03,359
he's a big proponent of thinking hard on

4031
02:26:00,799 --> 02:26:05,599
a problem right before sleep so that he

4032
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:06,399
can sleep through it and solve it in a

4033
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:08,559
sleep

4034
02:26:06,398 --> 02:26:10,478
or like come up with radical stuff in

4035
02:26:08,559 --> 02:26:12,079
his sleep he was trying to get me to do

4036
02:26:10,478 --> 02:26:14,559
this so

4037
02:26:12,079 --> 02:26:16,959
it happened from

4038
02:26:14,559 --> 02:26:19,359
my experience perspective it happened to

4039
02:26:16,959 --> 02:26:22,239
me many times during the high school

4040
02:26:19,359 --> 02:26:24,640
days when i was doing mathematics

4041
02:26:22,239 --> 02:26:27,280
that i had the solution to my problem as

4042
02:26:24,639 --> 02:26:27,279
i woke up

4043
02:26:27,359 --> 02:26:32,479
at the moment regarding thinking hard

4044
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,920
about the given problem is

4045
02:26:32,478 --> 02:26:35,679
i'm trying to actually devote

4046
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:37,520
substantial amount of time to think

4047
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:38,960
about important problems not just before

4048
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:41,520
the sleep

4049
02:26:38,959 --> 02:26:43,199
like i'm organizing amount of the huge

4050
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:44,880
chunks of time such that i'm not

4051
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:46,560
constantly working on the urgent

4052
02:26:44,879 --> 02:26:48,799
problems but i actually have time to

4053
02:26:46,559 --> 02:26:51,359
think about the important one so you do

4054
02:26:48,799 --> 02:26:52,398
it naturally but his idea is that you

4055
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:54,239
kind of

4056
02:26:52,398 --> 02:26:55,920
prime your brain

4057
02:26:54,239 --> 02:26:57,359
to make sure that that's the focus you

4058
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:58,960
know oftentimes people have other

4059
02:26:57,359 --> 02:27:01,200
worries in their life that's not

4060
02:26:58,959 --> 02:27:04,559
fundamentally deep problems like i don't

4061
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:06,880
know uh just stupid drama in your life

4062
02:27:04,559 --> 02:27:08,398
and even at work all that kind of stuff

4063
02:27:06,879 --> 02:27:10,799
he wants to kind of

4064
02:27:08,398 --> 02:27:13,039
pick the most important problem

4065
02:27:10,799 --> 02:27:15,438
that you're thinking about and go to bed

4066
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:17,200
on that i think that's why i mean the

4067
02:27:15,439 --> 02:27:19,439
other thing that comes to my mind is

4068
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:20,399
also i feel the most fresh in the

4069
02:27:19,439 --> 02:27:22,398
morning

4070
02:27:20,398 --> 02:27:25,199
so during the morning i try to work on

4071
02:27:22,398 --> 02:27:27,358
the most important things rather than

4072
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:29,760
i'm just being pulled by urgent things

4073
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:31,359
or checking email or so

4074
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:33,840
what do you do with the cause i've been

4075
02:27:31,359 --> 02:27:35,760
doing the voice recorder thing too but i

4076
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:37,280
end up recording so many messages it's

4077
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:39,520
hard to organize

4078
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:40,319
i have the same problem now i have heard

4079
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:42,079
that

4080
02:27:40,318 --> 02:27:44,478
google pixel is really good in

4081
02:27:42,079 --> 02:27:46,079
transcribing text and i might get a

4082
02:27:44,478 --> 02:27:47,840
google pixel just for the sake of

4083
02:27:46,079 --> 02:27:49,280
transcribing text yeah people listening

4084
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:50,960
to this if you have a good voice

4085
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:52,239
recorder suggestion that transcribed

4086
02:27:50,959 --> 02:27:54,559
please let me know

4087
02:27:52,239 --> 02:27:55,760
i it's some of it is uh this has to do

4088
02:27:54,559 --> 02:27:59,680
with uh

4089
02:27:55,760 --> 02:28:01,920
uh open ai codex too like some of it is

4090
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:03,840
simply like the friction

4091
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:05,920
i need uh

4092
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:06,960
apps that remove that friction between

4093
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:08,960
voice

4094
02:28:06,959 --> 02:28:11,279
and the organization of the resulting

4095
02:28:08,959 --> 02:28:13,599
transcripts and all that kind of stuff

4096
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:16,720
um but yes you're right absolutely like

4097
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:19,920
during uh for me it's walking sleep too

4098
02:28:16,719 --> 02:28:21,438
but walking and running

4099
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:23,120
especially running

4100
02:28:21,439 --> 02:28:24,318
get a lot of thoughts during running and

4101
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:26,240
there's there's no

4102
02:28:24,318 --> 02:28:28,719
good mechanism for recording thoughts so

4103
02:28:26,239 --> 02:28:30,079
one more thing that i do i have a

4104
02:28:28,719 --> 02:28:31,519
separate phone

4105
02:28:30,079 --> 02:28:33,520
uh which i

4106
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:35,280
which has no apps

4107
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:37,680
and maybe it has like a

4108
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:39,040
audible or let's say kindle no one has

4109
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:41,520
this phone number this kind of my

4110
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:43,280
meditation phone yeah and

4111
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:44,960
i try to

4112
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:47,760
expand the amount of time that that's

4113
02:28:44,959 --> 02:28:49,839
the phone that i'm having i it has also

4114
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:51,760
google maps if i need to go somewhere

4115
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:52,880
and i also use this phone to write down

4116
02:28:51,760 --> 02:28:55,680
ideas

4117
02:28:52,879 --> 02:28:57,679
ah that's really good idea

4118
02:28:55,680 --> 02:29:00,159
that's a really good idea often actually

4119
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:01,760
what i end up doing is even sending a

4120
02:29:00,159 --> 02:29:03,600
message from that phone to the other

4121
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:06,079
phone so that's actually my way of

4122
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:08,559
recording messages or i just put them

4123
02:29:06,079 --> 02:29:10,799
into notes i love it

4124
02:29:08,559 --> 02:29:13,119
what advice would you give to a young

4125
02:29:10,799 --> 02:29:14,639
person high school

4126
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:17,680
college

4127
02:29:14,639 --> 02:29:19,279
about how to be successful you've done a

4128
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:20,479
lot of incredible things in the past

4129
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:22,479
decade

4130
02:29:20,478 --> 02:29:24,000
so maybe maybe of some

4131
02:29:22,478 --> 02:29:26,398
something there might be something there

4132
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:27,359
might be something

4133
02:29:26,398 --> 02:29:29,119
i mean

4134
02:29:27,359 --> 02:29:31,280
might sound like a

4135
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:33,760
simplistic or so but i would say

4136
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:35,520
literally just

4137
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:36,800
follow your passion double down on it

4138
02:29:35,520 --> 02:29:39,520
and if you don't know what's your

4139
02:29:36,799 --> 02:29:41,358
passion just figure out what could be a

4140
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:43,520
what could be a passion so this that

4141
02:29:41,359 --> 02:29:46,318
might be an exploration

4142
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:47,840
when i was in elementary school was math

4143
02:29:46,318 --> 02:29:49,199
and chemistry

4144
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:52,079
and i remember

4145
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:54,319
for some time i gave up on math because

4146
02:29:52,079 --> 02:29:56,398
my school teacher she told me that i'm

4147
02:29:54,318 --> 02:29:59,680
dumb

4148
02:29:56,398 --> 02:30:02,000
and i i i guess maybe an advice would be

4149
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:03,040
just ignore people if they tell you that

4150
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,799
you're dumb

4151
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:06,960
you mentioned something offline about

4152
02:30:04,799 --> 02:30:08,559
chemistry and explosives

4153
02:30:06,959 --> 02:30:11,839
um

4154
02:30:08,559 --> 02:30:15,920
what was that about so let's see

4155
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:15,920
so a story goes like that i can

4156
02:30:16,879 --> 02:30:22,079
i got into chemistry maybe i was like a

4157
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:23,280
second grade of my elementary school

4158
02:30:22,079 --> 02:30:26,559
third grade

4159
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:27,760
uh i started going to chemistry classes

4160
02:30:26,559 --> 02:30:31,039
uh

4161
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:32,159
i i really love building stuff

4162
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:33,520
and

4163
02:30:32,159 --> 02:30:36,239
i did all the experiments that they

4164
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:39,439
described in the book okay you know how

4165
02:30:36,239 --> 02:30:41,680
to create oxygen with vinegar and

4166
02:30:39,439 --> 02:30:44,079
and baking soda so okay

4167
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:46,159
so i did all the experiments

4168
02:30:44,079 --> 02:30:48,318
and at some point i was you know so

4169
02:30:46,159 --> 02:30:49,840
what's next what can i do

4170
02:30:48,318 --> 02:30:52,000
and uh

4171
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:54,079
explosives they also it's like a you

4172
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:56,478
have a clear reward signal you know if

4173
02:30:54,079 --> 02:30:59,039
the thing worked or not

4174
02:30:56,478 --> 02:31:02,079
so i remember

4175
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:04,000
at first i got i got interested in

4176
02:31:02,079 --> 02:31:05,680
producing hydrogen that was kind of

4177
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:08,398
funny experiment from school you can

4178
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:10,960
just burn it and then i moved to

4179
02:31:08,398 --> 02:31:13,439
uh nitroglycerin so that's also

4180
02:31:10,959 --> 02:31:15,919
relatively easy to synthesize

4181
02:31:13,439 --> 02:31:18,239
i started producing essentially

4182
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:20,159
dynamite and detonating with it with my

4183
02:31:18,239 --> 02:31:21,920
friend i remember there was a you know

4184
02:31:20,159 --> 02:31:23,600
there was at first like maybe

4185
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:25,920
two attempts that i went with a friend

4186
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:27,840
to detonate what we built

4187
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:30,079
and it didn't work out and like a third

4188
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:32,318
time he was like ah it won't work like

4189
02:31:30,079 --> 02:31:35,359
uh let's don't waste time

4190
02:31:32,318 --> 02:31:37,840
and um now we were

4191
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:39,040
i was carrying this uh

4192
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:40,960
this

4193
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:42,560
you know that tube with dynamite i don't

4194
02:31:40,959 --> 02:31:45,438
know pound or so

4195
02:31:42,559 --> 02:31:47,949
dynamite in my backpack or like riding

4196
02:31:45,439 --> 02:31:50,479
on the bike to the edges of the city

4197
02:31:47,950 --> 02:31:52,159
[Laughter]

4198
02:31:50,478 --> 02:31:54,079
yeah and

4199
02:31:52,159 --> 02:31:56,398
attempt number three

4200
02:31:54,079 --> 02:31:57,520
this would be to number three attempt

4201
02:31:56,398 --> 02:31:58,719
number three

4202
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:00,880
and uh

4203
02:31:58,719 --> 02:32:04,000
now we we dig a hole to

4204
02:32:00,879 --> 02:32:06,959
uh put it inside it actually had the uh

4205
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:10,398
you know electrical detonator

4206
02:32:06,959 --> 02:32:12,879
we we draw a cable behind the tree

4207
02:32:10,398 --> 02:32:15,279
i even i never had i haven't ever seen

4208
02:32:12,879 --> 02:32:17,759
like a explosion before so i thought

4209
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:19,600
that there will be a lot of sound

4210
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:21,439
and but you know we're like laying down

4211
02:32:19,600 --> 02:32:23,439
and i'm holding the cable and the

4212
02:32:21,439 --> 02:32:25,200
battery at some point you know it kind

4213
02:32:23,439 --> 02:32:26,398
of like a three to one

4214
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:28,960
and uh

4215
02:32:26,398 --> 02:32:31,279
i just connected it and it felt like at

4216
02:32:28,959 --> 02:32:32,559
the ground shake it was like a more like

4217
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:33,920
a

4218
02:32:32,559 --> 02:32:36,478
sound and then

4219
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:38,398
the soil started kind of lifting up and

4220
02:32:36,478 --> 02:32:40,478
started falling on us yeah

4221
02:32:38,398 --> 02:32:42,318
wow and then uh

4222
02:32:40,478 --> 02:32:45,599
now the friends said let's let's make

4223
02:32:42,318 --> 02:32:47,279
sure next time we have helmets

4224
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:49,120
but also you know

4225
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:51,120
i'm happy that nothing happened to me it

4226
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:56,000
could have been the case that i i lost

4227
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:56,000
the limb or so yeah but that's childhood

4228
02:32:56,719 --> 02:33:01,599
of an engineering mind

4229
02:32:58,959 --> 02:33:03,679
with a strong reward signal

4230
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:05,439
of an explosion

4231
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:07,840
i love it

4232
02:33:05,439 --> 02:33:10,639
my there's some aspect of uh chemists

4233
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:12,478
the the the chemist i know like my dad

4234
02:33:10,639 --> 02:33:15,039
with plasma chemistry plasma physics he

4235
02:33:12,478 --> 02:33:16,799
was very much into explosives too it's a

4236
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:18,560
worrying quality of

4237
02:33:16,799 --> 02:33:22,079
people that work in chemistry that they

4238
02:33:18,559 --> 02:33:24,719
love i think it is that exactly is the

4239
02:33:22,079 --> 02:33:26,639
the strong signal that the thing worked

4240
02:33:24,719 --> 02:33:28,639
there is no doubt there's no doubt

4241
02:33:26,639 --> 02:33:31,119
there's some magic it's almost like a

4242
02:33:28,639 --> 02:33:33,680
reminder that physics works that

4243
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:36,560
chemistry works it's cool it's almost

4244
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:39,120
like a little glimpse at nature that you

4245
02:33:36,559 --> 02:33:40,879
yourself engineer i that's why i really

4246
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:44,079
like artificial intelligence especially

4247
02:33:40,879 --> 02:33:46,239
robotics is you create

4248
02:33:44,079 --> 02:33:47,840
a little piece of nature

4249
02:33:46,239 --> 02:33:50,159
and in some sense even for me with

4250
02:33:47,840 --> 02:33:52,799
explosives the motivation was creation

4251
02:33:50,159 --> 02:33:55,840
rather than distraction yes exactly

4252
02:33:52,799 --> 02:33:57,599
in terms of advice i forgot to ask

4253
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:59,920
about just machine learning and deep

4254
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:01,359
learning for people who are specifically

4255
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:02,960
interested in

4256
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:04,479
machine learning how would you recommend

4257
02:34:02,959 --> 02:34:07,438
they get into the field

4258
02:34:04,478 --> 02:34:09,679
so um i would say implement everything

4259
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:12,318
and also there is plenty of courses

4260
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:14,079
so like from scratch um so on different

4261
02:34:12,318 --> 02:34:15,680
levels of abstraction in some sense but

4262
02:34:14,079 --> 02:34:17,680
i would say brain or implement something

4263
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:20,000
from scratch or implement something from

4264
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:22,318
a paper or implement something you know

4265
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:24,159
from podcasts that you have heard about

4266
02:34:22,318 --> 02:34:26,000
i would say that's a powerful way to

4267
02:34:24,159 --> 02:34:28,398
understand things so it's often the case

4268
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:31,280
that you read the description and you

4269
02:34:28,398 --> 02:34:33,358
think you understand but you truly

4270
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:35,600
understand once you build it

4271
02:34:33,359 --> 02:34:37,200
then you actually know what really meant

4272
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:39,439
that in the description

4273
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:40,560
is there particular topics that you find

4274
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:45,200
people just

4275
02:34:40,559 --> 02:34:47,519
fall in love with so i i've seen

4276
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:48,800
i tend to uh really enjoy reinforcement

4277
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:51,280
learning

4278
02:34:48,799 --> 02:34:54,079
because it's it's much more

4279
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:55,439
it's much easier to get to a point where

4280
02:34:54,079 --> 02:34:56,719
you feel like you created something

4281
02:34:55,439 --> 02:34:58,720
special

4282
02:34:56,719 --> 02:35:01,519
like like fun games kind of things that

4283
02:34:58,719 --> 02:35:03,679
are rewarding it's rewarding yeah

4284
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:06,159
uh as opposed to like

4285
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:07,920
uh reimplementing from scratch

4286
02:35:06,159 --> 02:35:12,639
more like supervised learning kind of

4287
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:14,559
things it's it's yeah so you know if if

4288
02:35:12,639 --> 02:35:16,478
someone would optimize for things to be

4289
02:35:14,559 --> 02:35:18,398
rewarding then it feels that the things

4290
02:35:16,478 --> 02:35:20,079
that are somewhat generative they have

4291
02:35:18,398 --> 02:35:22,478
such a property so yes you have for

4292
02:35:20,079 --> 02:35:25,600
instance yes adversarial networks or you

4293
02:35:22,478 --> 02:35:28,318
have just even generated language models

4294
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:30,239
and you could you can even see

4295
02:35:28,318 --> 02:35:33,439
um internally we have seen this thing

4296
02:35:30,239 --> 02:35:35,119
with our releases so we have a we

4297
02:35:33,439 --> 02:35:37,359
released recently two models there is

4298
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:39,520
one model called dali that generates

4299
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:42,079
images and there is other model called

4300
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:43,439
clip that actually uh

4301
02:35:42,079 --> 02:35:45,600
you provide

4302
02:35:43,439 --> 02:35:47,520
various possibilities what could be the

4303
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:48,880
answer to what is on the picture and it

4304
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:50,560
can tell you which one is the most

4305
02:35:48,879 --> 02:35:53,119
likely okay

4306
02:35:50,559 --> 02:35:54,639
and in some sense in case of the

4307
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:57,359
first one dali

4308
02:35:54,639 --> 02:36:00,639
it is very easy for you to understand

4309
02:35:57,359 --> 02:36:02,559
that actually there is magic going on uh

4310
02:36:00,639 --> 02:36:04,959
and in the in case of the second one

4311
02:36:02,559 --> 02:36:07,760
even though it is insanely powerful and

4312
02:36:04,959 --> 02:36:09,919
you know people from a vision community

4313
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:13,439
they as they started probing it inside

4314
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:13,439
they actually understood

4315
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:19,120
how far it goes it's difficult for

4316
02:36:16,159 --> 02:36:21,520
person at first to see

4317
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:23,120
how well it works

4318
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:25,040
and that's the same as you said that in

4319
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:26,880
case of supervised learning models you

4320
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:28,319
might not kind of see

4321
02:36:26,879 --> 02:36:31,199
or it's not that easy for you to

4322
02:36:28,318 --> 02:36:32,959
understand the the strength

4323
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:35,040
even though you don't believe in magic

4324
02:36:32,959 --> 02:36:36,879
to see the magic let's say that magic

4325
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:39,600
it's a generative that's really

4326
02:36:36,879 --> 02:36:41,438
brilliant so anything that's generative

4327
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:43,359
because then you are

4328
02:36:41,439 --> 02:36:45,280
at the core of the creation you get to

4329
02:36:43,359 --> 02:36:47,280
experience creation

4330
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:50,079
without much effort unless you have to

4331
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:52,479
do it from scratch but and it feels that

4332
02:36:50,079 --> 02:36:55,920
you know humans are wired there is some

4333
02:36:52,478 --> 02:36:57,679
level of reward for creating stuff yeah

4334
02:36:55,920 --> 02:37:00,478
like of course different people have a

4335
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:02,159
different weight on this reward yeah

4336
02:37:00,478 --> 02:37:03,199
in the big objective function in the big

4337
02:37:02,159 --> 02:37:06,478
objective

4338
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:08,560
of a person of a person uh you wrote

4339
02:37:06,478 --> 02:37:11,760
that beautiful

4340
02:37:08,559 --> 02:37:13,680
is what you intensely pay attention to

4341
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:15,920
even a cockroach is beautiful if you

4342
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:18,559
look very closely

4343
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:19,680
can you expand on this what is

4344
02:37:18,559 --> 02:37:21,279
beauty

4345
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:23,120
so

4346
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:25,280
what i'm i wrote here actually

4347
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:26,319
corresponds to my subjective experience

4348
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:29,359
that i had

4349
02:37:26,318 --> 02:37:32,398
through extended periods of meditation

4350
02:37:29,359 --> 02:37:34,640
it's it's pretty crazy that at some

4351
02:37:32,398 --> 02:37:37,279
point the meditation gets you to the

4352
02:37:34,639 --> 02:37:40,959
place that you have really

4353
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:43,040
increased uh focus increase attention

4354
02:37:40,959 --> 02:37:44,879
and then you look at the very simple

4355
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:47,359
objects that were all the time around

4356
02:37:44,879 --> 02:37:49,279
you can look at the table or on the pen

4357
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:50,479
or at that nature

4358
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:53,439
and

4359
02:37:50,478 --> 02:37:55,438
you notice more and more details

4360
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:56,800
and it becomes very pleasant to look at

4361
02:37:55,439 --> 02:37:58,960
it

4362
02:37:56,799 --> 02:38:00,559
and it once again it kind of reminds me

4363
02:37:58,959 --> 02:38:03,358
my childhood

4364
02:38:00,559 --> 02:38:04,719
uh like i just pure joy

4365
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:07,840
of being

4366
02:38:04,719 --> 02:38:09,358
it's also i have seen even the reverse

4367
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:12,559
effect that

4368
02:38:09,359 --> 02:38:15,200
by default regardless of what we possess

4369
02:38:12,559 --> 02:38:17,199
we very quickly get used to it

4370
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:18,640
and you know you can have a very

4371
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:19,840
beautiful house

4372
02:38:18,639 --> 02:38:22,318
and

4373
02:38:19,840 --> 02:38:24,478
if you don't put sufficient effort

4374
02:38:22,318 --> 02:38:26,239
you're just gonna get used to it

4375
02:38:24,478 --> 02:38:29,199
and it doesn't bring any more joy

4376
02:38:26,239 --> 02:38:31,920
regardless of what you have yeah

4377
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:31,920
well i actually

4378
02:38:32,639 --> 02:38:37,680
i find that material possessions

4379
02:38:35,920 --> 02:38:39,760
get in the way of that experience of

4380
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:43,840
pure joy

4381
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:43,840
so i've always i've been very fortunate

4382
02:38:44,239 --> 02:38:48,799
to just find joy in simple things just

4383
02:38:46,799 --> 02:38:50,559
just like you're saying

4384
02:38:48,799 --> 02:38:53,119
just like i don't know objects in my

4385
02:38:50,559 --> 02:38:56,000
life just stupid objects like this cup

4386
02:38:53,120 --> 02:38:57,760
like thing you know just objects sounds

4387
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:00,719
okay i'm not being eloquent but

4388
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:02,239
literally objects in the world

4389
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:03,039
they're just full of joy because it's

4390
02:39:02,239 --> 02:39:04,559
like

4391
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:06,880
i can't believe

4392
02:39:04,559 --> 02:39:08,398
one i can't believe that i'm

4393
02:39:06,879 --> 02:39:11,279
fortunate enough to be alive to

4394
02:39:08,398 --> 02:39:12,639
experience these objects and then two i

4395
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:14,239
can't believe

4396
02:39:12,639 --> 02:39:15,920
humans are clever enough to have built

4397
02:39:14,239 --> 02:39:18,559
these objects

4398
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:21,200
the the hierarchy of pleasure that that

4399
02:39:18,559 --> 02:39:23,199
uh provides is infinite i mean even if

4400
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:25,120
you look at the cup of water so you know

4401
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:27,439
you see first like a level of like a

4402
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:29,120
reflection of light but then you think

4403
02:39:27,439 --> 02:39:31,520
you know man there's like a trillions

4404
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:34,800
upon of trillions of particles bouncing

4405
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:37,359
uh against each other there is also uh

4406
02:39:34,799 --> 02:39:39,759
the tension on the surface that you know

4407
02:39:37,359 --> 02:39:42,239
if the back back could like a stand on

4408
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:44,559
it and move around and you think it also

4409
02:39:42,239 --> 02:39:46,478
has this like a magical property that as

4410
02:39:44,559 --> 02:39:48,639
you decrease temperature

4411
02:39:46,478 --> 02:39:50,478
it actually expands in volume which

4412
02:39:48,639 --> 02:39:52,879
allows for the

4413
02:39:50,478 --> 02:39:54,639
you know legs to freeze on the on the

4414
02:39:52,879 --> 02:39:56,719
surface and then at the bottom to have

4415
02:39:54,639 --> 02:39:58,159
actually uh not freeze which allows for

4416
02:39:56,719 --> 02:40:00,559
life like a

4417
02:39:58,159 --> 02:40:02,239
crazy yeah you look

4418
02:40:00,559 --> 02:40:04,639
in detail at some object and you think

4419
02:40:02,239 --> 02:40:05,840
actually you know this table that was

4420
02:40:04,639 --> 02:40:07,840
just the figment of someone's

4421
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:09,520
imagination at some point and then there

4422
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:11,680
was like thousands of people involved to

4423
02:40:09,520 --> 02:40:14,899
actually manufacture it yeah and put it

4424
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:16,398
here and by default no one cares

4425
02:40:14,899 --> 02:40:17,600
[Laughter]

4426
02:40:16,398 --> 02:40:19,439
and then you can start thinking about

4427
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:20,960
evolution how it all started from single

4428
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:23,680
cell organisms

4429
02:40:20,959 --> 02:40:25,039
that led to this table and and okay

4430
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:27,200
these thoughts they give me life

4431
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:28,880
appreciation yeah and

4432
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:30,479
even lack of those just the pure raw

4433
02:40:28,879 --> 02:40:33,519
signal also gives their life

4434
02:40:30,478 --> 02:40:36,398
appreciation see the thing is

4435
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:38,399
and then that's coupled

4436
02:40:36,398 --> 02:40:40,000
for me with the sadness that the whole

4437
02:40:38,398 --> 02:40:42,719
ride ends

4438
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:44,478
and perhaps is deeply coupled in that

4439
02:40:42,719 --> 02:40:46,000
the fact that this experience this

4440
02:40:44,478 --> 02:40:47,519
moment ends

4441
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,680
gives it

4442
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:51,359
gives it an intensity that i'm not sure

4443
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:53,840
i would otherwise have

4444
02:40:51,359 --> 02:40:56,159
so in that same way i try to meditate on

4445
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:59,200
my own death often

4446
02:40:56,159 --> 02:41:03,000
do you think about your mortality

4447
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:03,000
are you afraid of death

4448
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:06,159
so

4449
02:41:04,079 --> 02:41:09,279
fear of death is like one of the most

4450
02:41:06,159 --> 02:41:11,119
fundamental fears that each of us has we

4451
02:41:09,279 --> 02:41:12,960
might be not even aware of it it

4452
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:14,800
requires to look inside to even

4453
02:41:12,959 --> 02:41:16,879
recognize that it's

4454
02:41:14,799 --> 02:41:18,719
out there and there is still let's say

4455
02:41:16,879 --> 02:41:22,239
this property

4456
02:41:18,719 --> 02:41:24,799
of uh nature that if things would last

4457
02:41:22,239 --> 02:41:26,079
forever then they would be also boring

4458
02:41:24,799 --> 02:41:27,920
to us

4459
02:41:26,079 --> 02:41:29,279
the fact that the things change in some

4460
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:31,680
way

4461
02:41:29,279 --> 02:41:34,479
gives any meaning to them

4462
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:36,960
i also you know found out that

4463
02:41:34,478 --> 02:41:40,398
it seems to be

4464
02:41:36,959 --> 02:41:42,478
very healing to people to

4465
02:41:40,398 --> 02:41:44,879
have

4466
02:41:42,478 --> 02:41:47,920
this short experiences

4467
02:41:44,879 --> 02:41:51,039
uh like i guess psychedelic experiences

4468
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:53,760
in which they experience

4469
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:56,840
death of self

4470
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:59,439
in which they let go of this fear and

4471
02:41:56,840 --> 02:42:02,000
then maybe can even increase the

4472
02:41:59,439 --> 02:42:05,680
appreciation of the moment and it seems

4473
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:07,120
that many people they uh

4474
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:10,159
they

4475
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:13,040
they can easily comprehend fine the fact

4476
02:42:10,159 --> 02:42:15,680
that their money is finite while they

4477
02:42:13,040 --> 02:42:18,000
don't see that time is finite

4478
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:19,680
i have this like a discussion with ilya

4479
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:21,680
from time to time he's saying you know

4480
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:23,760
man like uh

4481
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:26,239
the lack will pass very fast at some

4482
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:27,279
point i will be 40 50 60 70 and then

4483
02:42:26,239 --> 02:42:30,799
it's over

4484
02:42:27,279 --> 02:42:33,040
this is true which also makes me believe

4485
02:42:30,799 --> 02:42:35,759
that you know that every single moment

4486
02:42:33,040 --> 02:42:36,560
it is so unique

4487
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:38,880
that

4488
02:42:36,559 --> 02:42:42,159
should be appreciated and this also

4489
02:42:38,879 --> 02:42:43,519
makes me think that i should be acting

4490
02:42:42,159 --> 02:42:46,318
on my life

4491
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:49,279
because otherwise it will pass

4492
02:42:46,318 --> 02:42:52,799
i also like this framework of thinking

4493
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:54,399
from jeff bezos on regret minimization

4494
02:42:52,799 --> 02:42:56,639
that like i would like

4495
02:42:54,398 --> 02:42:58,159
if i will be at that death bed to look

4496
02:42:56,639 --> 02:43:00,398
back on my life

4497
02:42:58,159 --> 02:43:00,398
and

4498
02:43:00,478 --> 02:43:04,478
and not regret that i haven't

4499
02:43:02,559 --> 02:43:06,959
done something it's usually you might

4500
02:43:04,478 --> 02:43:10,639
regret that you haven't

4501
02:43:06,959 --> 02:43:12,879
tried i'm fine with failing

4502
02:43:10,639 --> 02:43:15,358
i haven't tried

4503
02:43:12,879 --> 02:43:17,599
uh what's the nature eternal occurrence

4504
02:43:15,359 --> 02:43:19,680
tried to live a life that if you had to

4505
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:21,359
live it infinitely many times

4506
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:23,040
that would be the

4507
02:43:21,359 --> 02:43:24,640
you'll be okay with

4508
02:43:23,040 --> 02:43:27,120
that kind of life

4509
02:43:24,639 --> 02:43:29,199
so try to live it optimally

4510
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:32,800
i can say that

4511
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:32,800
it's almost like i'm

4512
02:43:33,359 --> 02:43:37,279
unbelievable to me

4513
02:43:35,279 --> 02:43:39,359
where i am in my life i'm extremely

4514
02:43:37,279 --> 02:43:42,319
grateful for actually people

4515
02:43:39,359 --> 02:43:45,040
whom i met i would say i think that i'm

4516
02:43:42,318 --> 02:43:46,159
decently smart and so on

4517
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:47,920
uh

4518
02:43:46,159 --> 02:43:50,239
but i think that

4519
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:54,318
actually to great extent where i am has

4520
02:43:50,239 --> 02:43:55,760
to do with that people who i met

4521
02:43:54,318 --> 02:43:58,239
would you be okay

4522
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:59,359
if after this conversation you died

4523
02:43:58,239 --> 02:44:01,279
so

4524
02:43:59,359 --> 02:44:03,520
if i'm dead then it kind of

4525
02:44:01,279 --> 02:44:05,040
i don't have a choice anymore

4526
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:06,960
so in some sense there's like plenty of

4527
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:07,810
things that i would like to try out in

4528
02:44:06,959 --> 02:44:08,879
my life

4529
02:44:07,809 --> 02:44:10,879
[Music]

4530
02:44:08,879 --> 02:44:13,519
i feel that you know i'm gradually going

4531
02:44:10,879 --> 02:44:15,199
one by one and i'm just doing them

4532
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:17,279
i think that the list will be always

4533
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:19,760
infinite yeah

4534
02:44:17,279 --> 02:44:22,079
so might as well go today

4535
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:23,600
yeah i mean to be clear i'm not looking

4536
02:44:22,079 --> 02:44:25,680
forward to die

4537
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:27,279
i would say if there is no choice i

4538
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:30,639
would accept it

4539
02:44:27,279 --> 02:44:32,479
but like uh in some sense i'm

4540
02:44:30,639 --> 02:44:34,318
if there would be a choice if there

4541
02:44:32,478 --> 02:44:36,719
would be possibility to live i would

4542
02:44:34,318 --> 02:44:39,359
fight for a living

4543
02:44:36,719 --> 02:44:41,920
i find um

4544
02:44:39,359 --> 02:44:44,318
it's more honest than real to think

4545
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:45,840
about you know dying today at the end of

4546
02:44:44,318 --> 02:44:48,879
the day

4547
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:51,520
that seems to me to at least to my brain

4548
02:44:48,879 --> 02:44:54,559
more honest slap in the face

4549
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:55,920
as opposed to i still have 10 years

4550
02:44:54,559 --> 02:44:57,278
like today

4551
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:59,279
then then i'm much more about

4552
02:44:57,279 --> 02:45:02,800
appreciating the cup and the table and

4553
02:44:59,279 --> 02:45:04,319
so on and less about like silly worldly

4554
02:45:02,799 --> 02:45:06,079
accomplishments and all those kinds of

4555
02:45:04,318 --> 02:45:09,039
things

4556
02:45:06,079 --> 02:45:10,719
we we have in the company a person who

4557
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:13,200
say at some point found out that they

4558
02:45:10,719 --> 02:45:15,119
have cancer and that also gives you know

4559
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:17,760
huge perspective with respect to what

4560
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:19,279
matters now yeah and you know often

4561
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:20,880
people in situations like that they

4562
02:45:19,279 --> 02:45:22,720
conclude that actually what matters is

4563
02:45:20,879 --> 02:45:23,438
human connection

4564
02:45:22,719 --> 02:45:26,639
and

4565
02:45:23,439 --> 02:45:29,600
love and uh that's people conclude also

4566
02:45:26,639 --> 02:45:31,840
if you have kids because kids is family

4567
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:34,000
you uh i think tweeted

4568
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:36,159
we don't assign the minus infinity

4569
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:38,000
reward to our death

4570
02:45:36,159 --> 02:45:40,398
such a reward would prevent us from

4571
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:42,478
taking any risk we wouldn't be able to

4572
02:45:40,398 --> 02:45:44,879
cross the road in fear of being hit by a

4573
02:45:42,478 --> 02:45:46,239
car so in the objective function you

4574
02:45:44,879 --> 02:45:49,199
mentioned fear of death might be

4575
02:45:46,239 --> 02:45:50,000
fundamental to the human condition

4576
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:51,760
so

4577
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:54,159
as i said let's assume that they're like

4578
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:55,840
a reward functions in our brain

4579
02:45:54,159 --> 02:45:58,478
and

4580
02:45:55,840 --> 02:46:01,840
and the interesting thing is

4581
02:45:58,478 --> 02:46:04,879
even realization how different reward

4582
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:06,960
functions can play with your behavior

4583
02:46:04,879 --> 02:46:09,199
as a matter of fact i wouldn't say that

4584
02:46:06,959 --> 02:46:11,839
you should assign infinite

4585
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:13,920
negative reward to anything because that

4586
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:15,520
messes up the math

4587
02:46:13,920 --> 02:46:18,000
the math doesn't work out it doesn't

4588
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:20,000
work out and as you said even you know

4589
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:22,159
uh government or some insurance

4590
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:24,398
companies you said they assign 99

4591
02:46:22,159 --> 02:46:28,239
million dollars to human life yeah and

4592
02:46:24,398 --> 02:46:30,239
i'm just saying it with respect to

4593
02:46:28,239 --> 02:46:32,079
that might be a harsh statement to

4594
02:46:30,239 --> 02:46:35,840
ourselves but in some sense that there

4595
02:46:32,079 --> 02:46:35,840
is a finite value of our own life

4596
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:39,920
i'm trying to put it from perspective of

4597
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:40,880
being

4598
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:43,760
less

4599
02:46:40,879 --> 02:46:47,358
of being more egoless

4600
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:48,239
and realizing fragility of my own life

4601
02:46:47,359 --> 02:46:49,520
and

4602
02:46:48,239 --> 02:46:50,559
in some sense

4603
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:52,640
the

4604
02:46:50,559 --> 02:46:54,799
fear of death

4605
02:46:52,639 --> 02:46:58,478
might prevent you from acting

4606
02:46:54,799 --> 02:47:00,398
because anything can cause death

4607
02:46:58,478 --> 02:47:02,398
yeah and i'm sure actually if you were

4608
02:47:00,398 --> 02:47:05,039
to put death in the objective function

4609
02:47:02,398 --> 02:47:07,278
there's probably so many aspects to

4610
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:10,640
death and fear of death and

4611
02:47:07,279 --> 02:47:12,319
realization of death and mortality

4612
02:47:10,639 --> 02:47:14,159
there's just whole components of

4613
02:47:12,318 --> 02:47:16,478
finiteness

4614
02:47:14,159 --> 02:47:18,799
of not just your life but every

4615
02:47:16,478 --> 02:47:22,559
experience and so on you're gonna have

4616
02:47:18,799 --> 02:47:24,959
to formalize mathematically and also you

4617
02:47:22,559 --> 02:47:26,318
know that might lead to

4618
02:47:24,959 --> 02:47:29,278
um

4619
02:47:26,318 --> 02:47:31,439
you spending a lot of compute cycles

4620
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:34,640
on this like a

4621
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:38,079
and deliberating this terrible future

4622
02:47:34,639 --> 02:47:40,079
instead of experiencing now

4623
02:47:38,079 --> 02:47:41,760
and that in some sense is also kind of

4624
02:47:40,079 --> 02:47:44,398
unpleasant simulation to run in your

4625
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:44,398
head yeah

4626
02:47:44,799 --> 02:47:48,799
do you think there's an objective

4627
02:47:46,159 --> 02:47:50,000
function that describes the entirety of

4628
02:47:48,799 --> 02:47:51,519
uh

4629
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:53,920
human life

4630
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:56,159
so you know usually the way you ask that

4631
02:47:53,920 --> 02:47:57,760
is what is the meaning of life

4632
02:47:56,159 --> 02:47:59,600
is there um

4633
02:47:57,760 --> 02:48:03,680
a universal objective functions that

4634
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:05,200
captures the why of life so yeah i mean

4635
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:06,800
i suspected that they will ask this

4636
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:09,200
question but it's also a question that i

4637
02:48:06,799 --> 02:48:10,639
asked myself many many times

4638
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:12,880
see i can tell you a framework that i

4639
02:48:10,639 --> 02:48:15,519
have these days to think about these

4640
02:48:12,879 --> 02:48:17,438
questions so i think that fundamentally

4641
02:48:15,520 --> 02:48:19,600
meaning of life has to do

4642
02:48:17,439 --> 02:48:21,439
with some of our reward functions that

4643
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:22,559
we have in brain and they might have to

4644
02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:25,279
do with

4645
02:48:22,559 --> 02:48:26,159
let's say for instance curiosity

4646
02:48:25,279 --> 02:48:27,600
or

4647
02:48:26,159 --> 02:48:30,719
human connection which might mean

4648
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:30,720
understanding others

4649
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:35,680
it's also possible for a person to

4650
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:38,000
slightly modify their reward function

4651
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:40,318
usually they mostly stay fixed but it's

4652
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:42,318
possible to modify reward function and

4653
02:48:40,318 --> 02:48:44,239
you can pretty much choose so in some

4654
02:48:42,318 --> 02:48:45,920
sense reward functions optimizing reward

4655
02:48:44,239 --> 02:48:47,680
functions they will give you life

4656
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:49,600
satisfaction

4657
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:50,960
is there some randomness in the function

4658
02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:53,040
i think when you are born there is some

4659
02:48:50,959 --> 02:48:55,199
randomness like you can see that some

4660
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:58,000
people for instance they

4661
02:48:55,200 --> 02:49:00,800
they care more about building stuff some

4662
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:02,000
people care more about caring for others

4663
02:49:00,799 --> 02:49:04,159
some people

4664
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:05,840
that there are all sorts of uh default

4665
02:49:04,159 --> 02:49:09,600
reward functions and then in some sense

4666
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:09,600
you can ask yourself what's this like

4667
02:49:09,680 --> 02:49:14,159
what is the satisfying way for you to go

4668
02:49:12,079 --> 02:49:16,079
after this reward function and you just

4669
02:49:14,159 --> 02:49:18,079
go after this reward function and you

4670
02:49:16,079 --> 02:49:19,840
know some people also ask are these

4671
02:49:18,079 --> 02:49:21,920
reward functions real

4672
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:23,600
i almost think about it

4673
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:24,719
as

4674
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:26,239
let's say

4675
02:49:24,719 --> 02:49:27,519
if you would have to discover

4676
02:49:26,239 --> 02:49:29,760
mathematics

4677
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:32,159
in mathematics you are likely to run

4678
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:33,200
into various objects like a complex

4679
02:49:32,159 --> 02:49:35,680
numbers

4680
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:37,520
or differentiation some other objects

4681
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:40,079
and these are very natural objects that

4682
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:42,159
arise and similarly the reward functions

4683
02:49:40,079 --> 02:49:44,478
that we are having in our brain they are

4684
02:49:42,159 --> 02:49:47,279
somewhat very natural that you know

4685
02:49:44,478 --> 02:49:49,278
there is a reward function for

4686
02:49:47,279 --> 02:49:52,079
for understanding

4687
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:54,079
like a comprehension yeah uh

4688
02:49:52,079 --> 02:49:56,959
curiosity and so on so in some sense

4689
02:49:54,079 --> 02:49:59,120
they are in the same way natural as

4690
02:49:56,959 --> 02:50:00,959
their natural objects in mathematics

4691
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:01,840
interesting so you know there's the uh

4692
02:50:00,959 --> 02:50:04,478
the old

4693
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:06,559
sort of debate is mathematics invented

4694
02:50:04,478 --> 02:50:09,358
or discovered you're saying reward

4695
02:50:06,559 --> 02:50:11,119
functions are discovered so nature so

4696
02:50:09,359 --> 02:50:12,960
nature's provided some you can still

4697
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:14,560
let's say expanded throughout the life

4698
02:50:12,959 --> 02:50:16,559
some of the reward functions they might

4699
02:50:14,559 --> 02:50:19,278
be futile like for instance there might

4700
02:50:16,559 --> 02:50:20,318
be a reward function maximize amount of

4701
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:23,520
wealth

4702
02:50:20,318 --> 02:50:25,278
yeah and this is more like a a learning

4703
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:27,120
reward function

4704
02:50:25,279 --> 02:50:28,720
and but we know also that some reward

4705
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:29,760
functions if you optimize them you won't

4706
02:50:28,719 --> 02:50:32,239
be

4707
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:33,920
quite satisfied

4708
02:50:32,239 --> 02:50:36,398
well i don't know which part of your

4709
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:38,559
reward function resulted in you coming

4710
02:50:36,398 --> 02:50:41,039
today but i am deeply appreciative that

4711
02:50:38,559 --> 02:50:43,920
you did spend your valuable time with me

4712
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:45,680
watching is really fun talking to you

4713
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:47,520
you're you're brilliant you're a good

4714
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:49,120
human being and it's an honor to meet

4715
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:50,720
you and an honor to talk to you thanks

4716
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:52,800
for talking today brother

4717

thank you alex a lot i appreciated your

4718
02:50:52,799 --> 02:50:57,119
questions here

4719
02:50:54,239 --> 02:50:58,159
i had a lot of time being here

4720
02:50:57,120 --> 02:51:00,640
thanks for listening to this

4721
02:50:58,159 --> 02:51:02,799
conversation with welch and ramba to

and now let me leave you some words from

4725
02:51:08,079 --> 02:51:13,760
arthur c clarke who is the author of

4726
02:51:10,799 --> 02:51:17,039
2001 a space odyssey

4727
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:21,359
it may be that our role on this planet

4728
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:22,960
is not to worship god but to create him

4729
02:51:21,359 --> 02:51:26,840
thank you for listening and hope to see

4730
02:51:22,959 --> 02:51:26,839
you next time
