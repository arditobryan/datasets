00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,839
the following is the conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,399
yoshi bach his second time on the

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:09,120
podcast yoshi is one of the most

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,679
fascinating minds in the world exploring

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:14,480
the nature of intelligence cognition

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,480
computation and consciousness

00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:33,280
this is the lex friedman podcast and

12
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:35,600
here is my conversation with yosha bach

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,320
thank you for once again coming on to

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,239
this particular russian program and

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,079
sticking to the theme of a russian

16
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:45,078
program let's start with the darkest of

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,079
topics

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,320
so this is inspired by one of your

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,160
tweets

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,679
you wrote that

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,479
quote when life feels unbearable

22
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,558
i remind myself that i'm not a person

23
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,439
i am a piece of software running on the

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,478
brain of a random ape for a few decades

25
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,679
it's not the worst brain to run on

26
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,760
have you

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,680
experienced low points in your life have

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,280
you experienced depression

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
of course we all experience low points

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,439
in our life and

31
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,559
we get appalled by the things by the

32
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,839
ugliness of stuff around us we might get

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
desperate about our lack of

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,600
self-regulation and

35
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,560
sometimes

36
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:29,199
life is hard and i suspect you don't get

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,719
to your life nobody does to get through

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,680
their life without low points and

39
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,158
without moments where they're despairing

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,720
and i thought that

41
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,200
let's capture this state and

42
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,359
how to deal with that state and i found

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,960
that very often you realize that when

44
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,680
you stop taking things personally when

45
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,959
you realize that this notion of a person

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,799
is a fiction

47
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,640
similar as it is in westworld where the

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,880
robots realize that their memories and

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,439
desires are just stuff that keeps them

50
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,519
in the loop and they don't have to act

51
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,438
on those memories and desires that our

52
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,319
memories and expectations is what make

53
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:06,718
us unhappy and the present rarely does

54
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,118
the day in which we are for the most

55
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,519
part it's okay right when we are right

56
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,959
sitting here right here right now we can

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,599
choose how we feel

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,920
and the thing that affects us is the

59
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,839
expectation that something is going to

60
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,439
be different from what we wanted to be

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,000
or the memory that something was

62
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,199
different from what you wanted it to be

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,199
and

64
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,519
once we basically zoom out from all this

65
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,719
what's left is not a person what's left

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
is

67
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,400
this state of being conscious which is a

68
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,679
software state and software doesn't have

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,760
an identity it's a physical law

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,680
and it's a law that acts in all of us

71
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,039
and it's embedded in a suitable

72
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,599
substrate and we didn't pick that

73
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,079
substrate right we are mostly randomly

74
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,598
instantiated on it and there all these

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,760
individuals and

76
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,839
everybody has to be one of them

77
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,399
and uh eventually you're stuck on one of

78
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,920
them and um have to deal with that so

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,120
you're like a leaf floating down the

80
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,799
river

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,920
you just have to accept that there's a

82
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,920
river and you just

83
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,359
that you are an agent is a construct

84
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,039
right what part of that is actually

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,599
under your control

86
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,840
and i think that our consciousness is

87
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:19,518
largely a control model for our own

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,598
attention so we

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,120
notice where we are looking and we can

90
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,878
influence what we are looking how we are

91
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,560
disambiguating things how we put things

92
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,878
together in our mind

93
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,878
and the whole system that runs us is

94
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,878
this big cybernetic motivational system

95
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,439
so we're basically like a little monkey

96
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,919
sitting on top of an elephant and we can

97
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,158
put this elephant here and there to go

98
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,079
this way or that way and we might have

99
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:43,598
the illusion that we are the elephant or

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
that we are telling it what to do and

101
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,598
sometimes we notice that it walks into a

102
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,079
completely different direction and we

103
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,560
didn't set this thing up it just is the

104
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,239
situation that we find ourselves in

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
how much prodding can we actually do of

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,560
the elephant

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,120
a lot but

108
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,959
i think that our uh consciousness cannot

109
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,640
create the motive force

110
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,959
is the elephant consciousness in this

111
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,559
metaphor no the monkey

112
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,080
is the consciousness the monkey is the

113
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,759
attentional system that is observing

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,519
things there is a large perceptual

115
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,079
system combined with the motivational

116
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,000
system that is actually providing the

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,639
interface to everything and our own

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,399
consciousness i think is a tool that

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,720
directs the attention of that system

120
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,039
which means it singles out features

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,600
and performs conditional operations for

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,680
which it needs an index memory but this

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,199
index memory is what we perceive as our

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,199
stream of consciousness but the

125
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,520
consciousness is not in charge that's an

126
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,319
illusion so everything

127
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,399
outside of that consciousness

128
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,240
is the elephant so it's the physics of

129
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,719
the universe but it's also society

130
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,960
that's outside of europe i would say the

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,280
elephant is the agent so there is an

132
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,680
environment which the agent is stomping

133
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,039
and uh you are influencing a little part

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
of that agent

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,960
so uh can you is the agent a single

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,240
human being

137
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,560
what's what which object has agency

138
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,439
that's an interesting question i think a

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,399
way to think about an agent is that it's

140
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,240
a controller with a set point generator

141
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,120
the notion of a controller comes from

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,478
cybernetics and control theory control

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:22,240
system consists out of a system that is

144
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,159
regulating some value and the deviation

145
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,960
of that value from a set point and it

146
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,880
has a sensor that measures the system's

147
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,680
deviation from that set point

148
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,360
and an effector that can be parametrized

149
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,439
by the controller so the controller

150
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,400
tells the effector to do a certain thing

151
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,918
and the goal is to reduce the distance

152
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,120
between the set point and the current

153
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,198
value of the system and there's

154
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,800
environment which disturbs the regulated

155
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,720
system which brings it away from that

156
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,720
set point so simplest case is the

157
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
thermostat the thermostat is really

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,840
simple because it doesn't have a model

159
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,000
the thermostat is only trying to

160
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,758
minimize the set point deviation in the

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
next moment

162
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,840
and if you want to minimize the set

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,519
point deviation over a longer time span

164
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,000
you need to integrate it you need to

165
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,918
model what is going to happen so for

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,160
instance when you think about that your

167
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,439
set point is to be comfortable in life

168
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,120
maybe you need to make yourself

169
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,800
uncomfortable first

170
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,639
right so you need to make a model of

171
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,960
what's going to happen when and this is

172
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,519
task of the controller is to use its

173
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,478
sensors to measure the state of the

174
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,799
environment

175
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,800
and the system that is being regulated

176
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,000
and figure out what to do

177
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,639
and if the task is complex enough the

178
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,639
set points are complicated enough and if

179
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,600
the controller has enough capacity and

180
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,840
enough

181
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,439
sensor feedback then the task of the

182
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,198
controller is to make a model of the

183
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,879
entire universe that it's in the

184
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
conditions under which it exists and of

185
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,000
itself

186
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,680
and this is a very complex agent and we

187
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,639
are in that category

188
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,720
and

189
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,120
an agent is not necessarily a thing in

190
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,039
the universe it's a class of models that

191
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,478
we use to interpret aspects of the

192
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,199
universe

193
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,120
and

194
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,879
be when we notice the

195
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,160
around us a lot of things only make

196
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,079
sense at the level that you are

197
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,080
entangled with them is we interpret them

198
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,560
as control systems that make models of

199
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,719
the world and try to minimize their own

200
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,399
set points so but the models

201
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,400
are the agents

202
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,079
the agent is a class of model

203
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,318
and we notice that we are an agent

204
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,719
ourself we are the agent that is using

205
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,160
our own control model to perform actions

206
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
we notice we

207
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,759
uh produce a change in the model and

208
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,199
things in the world change and this is

209
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,120
how we discover

210
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,800
the idea that we have a body that we are

211
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,120
situated environment and that we have a

212
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,360
first person perspective

213
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,918
still don't understand

214
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,319
what's the best way to think of which

215
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,758
object has agency with with respect to

216
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,439
human beings

217
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,360
is is it the body

218
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,279
is it the brain

219
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,280
is it the contents of the brain that has

220
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,359
agency like what's the actuators that

221
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,038
you're referring to

222
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,680
what is the controller and where does it

223
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,598
reside or is it these impossible things

224
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,598
like because i keep trying to ground it

225
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,439
to space-time

226
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,519
the three-dimensional space

227
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,478
and the one dimension of time

228
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:07,038
what's the agent in that for humans

229
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,719
there is not just one it depends on the

230
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,639
way in which you're looking at the thing

231
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
in which you're framing it imagine that

232
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,038
you are

233
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,639
say angela merkel and you are acting on

234
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,800
behalf of germany

235
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,598
then you could say that germany is the

236
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,240
agent and in the mind of angela merkel

237
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,478
she is germany to some extent because in

238
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,918
the way in which she acts the destiny of

239
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,598
germany changes

240
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,198
there are things that she can change

241
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,439
that basically

242
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,440
affect the behavior of that nation state

243
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,440
okay so it's hierarchies of to go to

244
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,320
another one of your tweets

245
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,320
with uh i think your uh playfully

246
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,760
mocking jeff hawkins

247
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,920
with saying his brains all the way down

248
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,879
so it's like it's agents all the way

249
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,879
down

250
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,559
it's agents made up of agents made up of

251
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,480
agents like if phanja marco's germany

252
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,799
and germany's made up a bunch of people

253
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,959
and the people are themselves agents

254
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,278
in in some kind of context

255
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,879
and then people are made up of cells

256
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,120
each individual

257
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,080
so is it agents all the way down

258
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,799
i suspect that has to be like this in

259
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,320
a world where things are self-organizing

260
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,519
most of the complexity that we are

261
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,640
looking at

262
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,679
everything in life is about

263
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,120
self-organization yeah so i think up

264
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,958
from the level of

265
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,159
life you have

266
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,958
agents

267
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,439
and

268
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,559
below life you rarely have agents

269
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,160
because

270
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,319
sometimes you have control systems that

271
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,480
emerge randomly in nature and try to

272
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,000
achieve a set point but

273
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
they're not that interesting agents that

274
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
make models and because to make an

275
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,360
interesting model of the world you

276
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,278
typically need a system that is true and

277
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,039
complete can i ask you a personal

278
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,080
question

279
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,838
uh

280
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,399
what's the line between life and

281
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,240
non-life it's personal because you're

282
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,399
a life form

283
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,639
so what do you think in this

284
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,320
emerging complexity at which point does

285
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,080
the thing start being living and have

286
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,519
agency

287
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,480
personally i think that the simplest

288
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,120
answer is that life is sales because

289
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,120
life is what cells cells biological

290
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,799
cells so it's a particular kind of

291
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,159
principle that we have discovered to

292
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,719
exist in nature it's modular stuff that

293
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,719
consists out of

294
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,399
basically this dna tape is a read write

295
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,639
head on top of it

296
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,399
that is able to perform arbitrary

297
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,199
computations and state transitions

298
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,519
within the cell and it's combined with a

299
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,800
membrane that insulates the cell from

300
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,879
its environment

301
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,039
and there are

302
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:37,039
chemical reactions inside of the cell

303
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,439
that are in this equilibrium and the

304
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,919
cell is running in such a way that this

305
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,200
this equilibrium doesn't disappear and

306
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,639
the cell

307
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,480
goes if the cell goes into an

308
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,278
equilibrium state it dies

309
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,360
and it requires something like an neck

310
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,639
entropy extractor to maintain this this

311
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,480
equilibrium so it's able to harvest like

312
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,000
entropy from its environment and keep

313
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,920
itself running

314
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,120
yeah so there's information and there's

315
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:05,039
a wall to protect to to to maintain this

316
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,879
disequilibrium but isn't this very

317
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,039
earth-centric

318
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,200
like what you're referring to as

319
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,039
i'm not making a normative notion uh you

320
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,560
could say that there are probably other

321
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,120
things in the universe that are

322
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,879
cell-like and life-like and you could

323
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,399
also call them life but eventually it's

324
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,399
just a

325
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,000
willingness of to find an agreement of

326
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,000
how to use the terms

327
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,240
i like cells because it's completely

328
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,559
co-extensional with the way that we used

329
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,639
the word even before we knew about cells

330
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,639
so people were pointing at some stuff

331
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,838
and saying this is somehow animate and

332
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,759
this is very different from the

333
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,200
non-animated stuff and what's the

334
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,278
difference between the living and the

335
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,959
dead stuff and it's mostly whether the

336
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,519
cells are working or not

337
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,679
and uh also this boundary of life where

338
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,200
we say that for instance a virus is

339
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,039
basically an information packet that is

340
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,639
subverting the cell and not life by

341
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,958
itself

342
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,399
that makes sense to me and

343
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,879
it's somewhat arbitrary you could of

344
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,639
course say that systems that permanently

345
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:03,439
maintain a disequilibrium and can

346
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,639
self-replicate are always life

347
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,000
and

348
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,919
maybe that's a useful definition too but

349
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
this is eventually just how you want to

350
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,078
use the word is it uh so useful for

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
conversation but

352
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,519
is it uh

353
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,519
somehow fundamental to the universe do

354
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,120
you think there's a actual line to

355
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,879
eventually be drawn between life and

356
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,519
non-life or is it all a kind of

357
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,039
continuum i don't think it's a continuum

358
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,519
but there's nothing magical that is

359
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:31,199
happening um living systems are a

360
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,679
certain type of machine

361
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,079
what about non-living systems is it also

362
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,078
a machine there are non-living machines

363
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,319
but the question is at which point is

364
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,359
the system able to un uh perform

365
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,040
arbitrary state transitions in uh to

366
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,200
make representations

367
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,879
and living things can do this and of

368
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,720
course we can also build non-living

369
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,679
things that can do this but we don't

370
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,639
know anything in nature that is not a

371
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,399
cell

372
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,039
and is not created by the lola life that

373
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,159
is able to do that

374
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,958
not

375
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,480
not only do we not know

376
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,078
i don't think we have the tools to see

377
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,879
otherwise

378
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:11,199
i always worry that we we

379
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,838
look at the world too narrowly

380
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,839
like we have there could be life

381
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,880
of a very different kind right under our

382
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,320
noses

383
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,720
that we're just not

384
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,480
seeing because we're not

385
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,480
either limitations of our cognitive

386
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,039
capacity or

387
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,759
we're just not open-minded enough

388
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,078
either with the tools of science or just

389
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,159
the tools of our own mind

390
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,719
yeah that's possible i find the thought

391
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:39,360
very fascinating and i suspect that many

392
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,879
of us ask ourselves since childhood what

393
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,720
are the things that we are missing what

394
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,759
kind of systems and interconnections

395
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,839
exist

396
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:50,159
that are outside of our

397
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,240
gaze but the um

398
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,278
we are looking for it and physics

399
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,360
doesn't have much room at the moment

400
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,799
for uh

401
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,959
opening up something that would not

402
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,439
violate the conservation of information

403
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,919
as we know it

404
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,720
yeah but i i wonder about time time

405
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:11,120
scale and scale spatial scale whether we

406
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,440
just need to um

407
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,600
open up our idea of what

408
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,680
like how life presents itself it could

409
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,159
be operating in a much slower time scale

410
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,958
yeah a much faster time scale

411
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,198
and

412
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,039
it's almost sad to think that there's

413
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:28,078
all this life around us that we're not

414
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,799
seeing because we're just not

415
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,638
like

416
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,319
thinking in terms of the right of the

417
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,480
right scale

418
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,399
both time and space

419
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,149
what is your definition of life what do

420
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,879
you understand this life

421
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:44,559
[Music]

422
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:47,919
entities of sufficiently high complexity

423
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,919
that are full of surprises

424
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,919
i don't know i don't have a free will so

425
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
that just came out of my mouth i'm not

426
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,319
sure that even makes sense there are

427
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,120
certain characteristics so complexity

428
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,160
seems to be an unnecessary property of

429
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,440
life

430
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,439
and

431
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,279
i almost

432
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,279
want to say it has

433
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:15,039
ability to do something unexpected

434
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,720
it seems to me that life is the main

435
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:21,519
source of complexity on earth

436
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,839
yes and complexity is basically a

437
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,120
bridgehead that order builds into chaos

438
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,959
by modeling

439
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,360
by processing information in such a way

440
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,679
that you can perform reactions that

441
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,278
would not be possible for dump systems

442
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,758
and this means that you can harvest neck

443
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,600
entropy that dump systems cannot harvest

444
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,039
and this is what complexity is mostly

445
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
about

446
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,039
yeah in some sense the purpose of life

447
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,078
is to create complexity

448
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,679
yeah

449
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,919
increasing i mean there there's um

450
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,919
there seems to be some kind of universal

451
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:56,078
drive towards increasing pockets of

452
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,078
complexity

453
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,919
i don't know what that is that seems to

454
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,359
be like a fundamental

455
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,159
i don't know if it's a property of the

456
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,079
universe or it's just the consequence of

457
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,719
the way the universe works but there

458
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,879
seems to be this small pockets of

459
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
emerging complexity that builds on top

460
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,639
of each other and starts

461
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,039
having like greater and greater

462
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,360
complexity by having like a hierarchy of

463
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,519
complexity little organisms building up

464
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,919
a little society that then operates

465
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,639
almost as an individual organism itself

466
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,799
and all of a sudden you have uh germany

467
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,959
and merkel but that's not obvious to me

468
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,159
everything that goes up has to come down

469
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,638
at some point

470
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,958
right so every if you see this

471
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,278
big exponential curve somewhere it's

472
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,719
usually the beginning of an s-curve

473
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,480
where something eventually reaches

474
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,160
saturation and the s-curve is the

475
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,519
beginning of some kind of bump that goes

476
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,480
down again

477
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,519
and

478
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,560
there is

479
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:54,159
just the thing that when you are in

480
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:56,159
sight of an evolution of life you are on

481
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,600
top of a puddle of negentropy that is

482
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,719
being sucked dry

483
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,879
by life and during uh that happening you

484
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,318
see an increase in complexity

485
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,519
because life forms are competing with

486
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:10,240
each other to get more and more and a

487
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,078
finer and finer corner of that like

488
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,160
entropy extraction but that i feel like

489
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,359
that's a gradual beautiful process like

490
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,120
that's almost

491
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,479
you know follows a process akin to

492
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,798
evolution and the way it comes down

493
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,599
is not the same way it came up

494
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,359
the way it comes down is usually harshly

495
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,959
and quickly

496
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,439
so usually there's some kind of

497
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,840
catastrophic event well the roman empire

498
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,720
took a long time

499
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,720
uh

500
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,640
but that's would that be would you

501
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,880
classify this as a decrease in

502
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,880
complexity though yes i think that this

503
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,200
uh size of the cities that could be fed

504
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,039
has decreased dramatically and you could

505
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,919
see that the quality of the art

506
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,720
decreased and it did so gradually

507
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,160
and

508
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,839
maybe

509
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,558
future generations when they look at the

510
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:58,720
history of the united states in the 21st

511
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,160
century will also talk about the gradual

512
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,558
decline not something that suddenly

513
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,558
happens

514
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,079
do you have a sense of where we are

515
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,199
are we on the exponential rise are we at

516
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,199
the peak

517
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,919
or are we the downslope

518
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,840
of the the united states empire it's

519
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,360
very hard to say from a single human

520
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,720
perspective but

521
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:25,279
i it seems to me that we are probably

522
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
at the peak

523
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,599
i think that's probably the definition

524
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,840
of like optimism and cynicism

525
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,639
so my nature of optimism is i think

526
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,639
we're on the rise

527
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,319
but

528
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,720
uh i think it's just all a matter of

529
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,200
perspective nobody knows but i do think

530
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,279
that erroring on the side of optimism

531
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,440
like you need a sufficient number

532
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,599
you need a minimum number of optimists

533
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,880
in order to make that up thing actually

534
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,558
work

535
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,960
and so i tend to be on the side of the

536
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,879
optimists i think that we are basically

537
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,558
a species of grasshoppers that have

538
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,960
turned into locusts

539
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,519
and when you are in that locust mode you

540
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,279
see an amazing rise of population

541
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,279
numbers and of the

542
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,720
complexity of the interactions between

543
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,079
the individuals

544
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,600
but

545
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,960
it's ultimately the question is is it

546
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:17,279
sustainable see i think we're a bunch of

547
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,079
lions and tigers that have become

548
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,839
domesticated cats

549
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,119
to use a different metaphor as i'm not

550
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:25,759
exactly sure

551
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,599
we're so destructive or just softer

552
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,359
and nicer and lazier

553
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,119
but i think we have monkeys and not the

554
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,199
cats and if you look at the monkeys they

555
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,879
are very busy

556
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,200
are the ones that have a lot of sex

557
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,799
those monkeys not just the bonobos i

558
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,480
think that all the monkeys are basically

559
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,558
a discontent species that always needs

560
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,798
to meddle

561
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,160
well the gorillas seem to have a little

562
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,069
bit more of a structure but it's a

563
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,480
different different part of the tree

564
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:52,879
[Laughter]

565
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,599
okay uh you mentioned the elephant and

566
00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:00,240
the the monkey riding the elephant

567
00:19:55,599 --> 00:20:01,759
and uh consciousness is the monkey

568
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,839
and there's some prodding that the

569
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,079
monkey gets to do and sometimes the

570
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,519
elephant listens

571
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,519
i heard you got

572
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,879
into some content maybe you can correct

573
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:13,359
me but i heard you got into some

574
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,280
contentious free will discussions

575
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,639
uh is this with sam harris or something

576
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,480
like that not that i know of

577
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,520
some people on clubhouse told me you

578
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,919
made a a bunch of uh um

579
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,720
big debate points about free will well

580
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,200
let me just then ask you where where

581
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,919
in terms of the monkey and the elephant

582
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,159
uh do you think we land in terms of the

583
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,480
illusion of free will how much control

584
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,640
does the monkey have

585
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,120
we have to think about what the

586
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,960
free will is in the first place

587
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,798
we are not the machine we are not the

588
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,558
thing that is making the decisions we

589
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:51,359
are a model of that decision making

590
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,879
process yeah and there is a difference

591
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,719
between

592
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,400
making your own decisions and predicting

593
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,519
your own decisions yes and that

594
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,759
difference is the first person

595
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,119
perspective

596
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,480
and

597
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,798
what

598
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,640
basically makes decision-making um and

599
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,279
the conditions of free will distinct

600
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,240
from just automatically doing the best

601
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,319
thing is

602
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,400
that uh we often don't know what the

603
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,879
best thing is we make decisions under

604
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,480
uncertainty we make informed bets using

605
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,400
a betting algorithm that we don't yet

606
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,319
understand because we haven't reverse

607
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,080
engineered our own mind sufficiently we

608
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,839
don't know the expected rewards we don't

609
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:28,158
know the mechanism by which we estimate

610
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,959
the rewards and so on but there is

611
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:34,720
we observe ourselves performing where we

612
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,679
see that uh we evade facts and factors

613
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,759
and the future and then

614
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,519
some kind of possibility some motive

615
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:43,200
gets raised to an intention

616
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,400
and that's informed bad that the system

617
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,480
is making

618
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,159
and that making of the open bet the

619
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,360
representation of that is what we call

620
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,919
free will

621
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,599
and it seems to be paradoxical because

622
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,640
we think that's the crucial thing is

623
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,399
about it that it's somehow

624
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,320
indeterministic

625
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,240
and yet if it wasn't deterministic it

626
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,839
would be random

627
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,679
and of course it cannot be random

628
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:05,199
because it was if it was random if just

629
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,960
dice were being thrown in the universe

630
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,360
randomly forces you to do things it

631
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,798
would be meaningless so the important

632
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,558
part of the decisions is always the

633
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,960
deterministic stuff

634
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,119
but it appears to be indeterministic to

635
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,880
you because it's unpredictable because

636
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,279
if it was predictable you wouldn't

637
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,120
experience it as a free will decision

638
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,519
you would experience it as just doing

639
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:28,079
the necessary right thing

640
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,639
and you see this continuum between the

641
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,599
free will and the execution of automatic

642
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,280
behavior

643
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,798
when you're observing other people so

644
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,158
for instance when you are observing your

645
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,558
own children

646
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,799
if you don't understand them you will

647
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:43,759
use this agent model where you have a

648
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,440
agent with a set point generator and uh

649
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,279
the agent is doing the best it can to

650
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,279
minimize the difference to the set point

651
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,440
and it might be confused and uh

652
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,279
sometimes impulsive or whatever but it's

653
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,440
acting on its own free will

654
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,519
and when you understand what happens in

655
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,240
the mind of the child you see that is

656
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,240
automatic and you can outmodel the child

657
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,079
you can build things around the child

658
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,519
that will lead the child to making

659
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,639
exactly the decision that you are

660
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,879
predicting

661
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,559
and in under these circumstances like

662
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,280
when you were a stage magician or

663
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,599
somebody who is dealing uh with people

664
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,359
that this you sell a car to and you

665
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,519
completely understand the psychology and

666
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,038
the impulses and the space of thoughts

667
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,720
that this individual can have at that

668
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,919
moment under these circumstances it

669
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,440
makes no sense to attribute free will

670
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,799
because it's no longer decision making

671
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,400
under uncertainty you are already

672
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,679
certain for them there is uncertainty

673
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,880
but you already know what they are doing

674
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,720
but what about for you so

675
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,440
is this akin to like

676
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,720
systems like cellular automata

677
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,159
where it's

678
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,278
deterministic

679
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,760
but when you

680
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:50,480
squint your eyes a little bit

681
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:53,839
it starts look like there's agents

682
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,440
making decisions at the higher so

683
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,798
when you zoom out and look at the

684
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,360
entities that

685
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,278
are composed by the individual cells

686
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:05,038
even though the there's

687
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:07,359
underlying simple rules that

688
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,919
make the system evolve in deterministic

689
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,558
ways it looks like there's organisms

690
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,120
making decisions is that

691
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:17,359
where the illusion of free will emerges

692
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,519
that jump and scale

693
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,839
it's a particular type of model but this

694
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,599
jump in scale is crucial the jump in

695
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,199
scale happens whenever you have too many

696
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,278
parts to count and you cannot make a

697
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,360
model at that level and you try to find

698
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:31,119
some higher level regularity

699
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,519
and the higher level regularity is a

700
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:36,158
pattern that you project into the world

701
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,599
to make sense of it and agency is one of

702
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,320
these patterns right you have all these

703
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,399
cells that interact with each other and

704
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,918
the cells in our body are set up in such

705
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,320
a way that they benefit if their

706
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,320
behavior is coherent which means that

707
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,599
they act as if they were serving a

708
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,359
common goal

709
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,519
and which that means that they will

710
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,278
evolve regulation mechanisms that

711
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,359
act as if they were serving a common

712
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,278
goal and now you can make sense of these

713
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,399
all these cells by projecting the common

714
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,400
goal into them

715
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,759
right so for you then free will is an

716
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,798
illusion

717
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,400
no it's a model and it's a construct

718
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,158
it's basically a model that the system

719
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,919
is making of its own behavior and it's

720
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,919
the best model that it can come up with

721
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,440
under the circumstances and it can get

722
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,360
replaced by a different model which is

723
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,798
automatic behavior when you fully

724
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,759
understand the mechanism under which you

725
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:24,240
are acting yeah but the another word for

726
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:26,000
model is what story

727
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,319
so it's the story you're telling i mean

728
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,240
you actually have control is there such

729
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,639
a thing as a you

730
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,839
and is there such a thing as you having

731
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,559
control

732
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,879
it's like are you

733
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:39,759
manifesting

734
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,720
your

735
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,720
evolution as an entity in some sense the

736
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,960
u is the model of the system that is in

737
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,278
control it's a story that the system

738
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,319
tells itself about somebody who is in

739
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,400
control

740
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,240
yeah and the contents of that model are

741
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,880
being used to inform the behavior of the

742
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,359
system

743
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,600
okay so the system is completely

744
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,199
mechanical and the system creates that

745
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,439
story like a loom

746
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,400
and then it uses the contents of that

747
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,320
story to inform its actions and writes

748
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,278
the results of that actions into the

749
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:16,079
story so how's that not an illusion

750
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,200
the story is written then

751
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,038
or

752
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,120
or rather we're not the writers of the

753
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:22,839
story

754
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,519
yes but we always knew

755
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,759
that no we we don't know that when did

756
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,918
we know that i think that's mostly a

757
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,319
confusion about concepts the

758
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,480
conceptual illusion in our culture comes

759
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,599
from the idea that we live in physical

760
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,360
reality

761
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:39,359
and that we experience physical reality

762
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,879
and that you have ideas about it

763
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,719
and then you have this dual list

764
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,919
interpretation where you have

765
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,679
two substances res extensor the world

766
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,919
that you can touch and that is made of

767
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,519
extended things and res cognitions which

768
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,038
is the world of ideas

769
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:54,480
and in fact both of them are mental

770
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,480
representations

771
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,319
one is the representations of the world

772
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,679
as a game engine that your mind

773
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,158
generates to make sense of the

774
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,679
perceptual data and the other one

775
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,200
yes that's what we perceive as the

776
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,720
physical world but we already know that

777
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,159
the physical world is nothing like that

778
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,319
right quantum mechanics is very

779
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,480
different from what you and me perceive

780
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,119
as the world the world that you and me

781
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,798
perceive is a game engine yeah and there

782
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,479
are no colors and sounds in the physical

783
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,319
world they only exist in the game engine

784
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,798
generated by your brain and then you

785
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:25,038
have ideas that are not cannot be mapped

786
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:26,960
onto extended regions right so the

787
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,679
objects that have a spatial extension in

788
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,880
the game engine are res extensor and the

789
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,640
objects that don't have a physical

790
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,399
extension in the game

791
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,240
engine our ideas

792
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,599
and they both interact in our mind to

793
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,640
produce models of the world yep but

794
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,398
you know when you play video games

795
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,080
i understand that what's actually

796
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:51,278
happening is zeros and ones inside of uh

797
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:52,798
inside of a computer instead of a cpu

798
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,440
and a gpu

799
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:58,079
but you're still seeing

800
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,640
like uh the rendering of that

801
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,119
and you're still making decisions

802
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,360
whether to shoot to turn left or to turn

803
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,558
right if you're playing a shooter or

804
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,719
every time you start thinking about

805
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,158
skyrim and elder scrolls and walking

806
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,519
around in beautiful nature and swinging

807
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,039
a sword but

808
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,960
it feels like you're making decisions

809
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,398
inside that video game

810
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,919
so even though you don't have direct

811
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,639
access

812
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,120
uh in terms of perception to the

813
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,520
bits to the zeros and ones it still

814
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,918
feels like you're making decisions and

815
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:30,079
your decisions are actually feels like

816
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,000
they're being applied

817
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,678
all the way down to the zeros and ones

818
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,119
yes it feels like you have control even

819
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,440
though you don't direct

820
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,439
access to reality so there is basically

821
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,200
a special character in the video game

822
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,880
that is being created by the video game

823
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,519
engine yeah and this character is

824
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,039
serving the aesthetics of the video game

825
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,960
and that is you

826
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,798
yes but i feel like you have control

827
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,960
inside the video game

828
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,359
like the all those like 12 year olds

829
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,600
that kick my ass on the internet

830
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,798
so uh for when you play the video game

831
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,558
it doesn't really matter that they're

832
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,158
zeros and once right you don't care

833
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,079
about the vids of the bus you don't care

834
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,520
about the nature of the cpu that it runs

835
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,960
on what you care about are the

836
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,879
properties of the game that you're

837
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,000
playing and you hope that the cpu is

838
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,000
good enough

839
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,919
yes and a similar thing happens when we

840
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,919
interact with physics the world that you

841
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,600
and me are in is not the physical world

842
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,520
the world that you and me are in is a

843
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:23,359
dream world

844
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:25,359
how close is it to the real world though

845
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,038
we know that it's not very close but we

846
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:29,038
know that the dynamics of the dream

847
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,960
world match the dynamics of the physical

848
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,158
world to a certain degree of resolution

849
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,120
right the causal structure of the

850
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,840
dreamworld is different

851
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,119
so you see waves crashing on your feet

852
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,959
right but there are no waves in the

853
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,519
ocean there's only water molecules that

854
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,038
have tangents uh between the molecules

855
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,839
that are uh

856
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,798
ex

857
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,480
the result of electrons in the molecules

858
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:53,200
interacting with each other aren't they

859
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,640
like very consistent we're just seeing a

860
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:00,000
very uh crude approximation isn't

861
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,919
our dream world very consistent like to

862
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,159
the point of being mapped directly

863
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,000
one-to-one to the actual physical world

864
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,000
as opposed to

865
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,519
us being completely tricked is this is

866
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,278
like where you have like that it's not a

867
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,359
trick that's that's my point it's not an

868
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,880
illusion it's a form of data compression

869
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,959
yeah it's an attempt to deal with the

870
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,799
dynamics of too many parts to count at

871
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,960
the level at which we're entangled with

872
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,960
the best model that you can find yeah so

873
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,600
we can act in that dream world and our

874
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,759
actions have impact in the in the real

875
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,519
world in the physical world yes to which

876
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,798
we don't have access yes but it's

877
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,480
basically like

878
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,000
accepting the fact that the software

879
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,558
that we live in the dream that we live

880
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,240
in is generated by something outside of

881
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,558
this world that you and me are in so is

882
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,240
the software deterministic and do we not

883
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:43,918
have any control

884
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,759
do we have

885
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,120
so free will

886
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,359
is uh

887
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,519
having a conscious being

888
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,558
the free will is the monkey being able

889
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,558
to steer the elephant

890
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,000
no

891
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:59,599
it's slightly different

892
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,759
basically in the same way as you are

893
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,759
modeling the water molecules in the

894
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,158
ocean that engulf your feet when you are

895
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,480
walking on the beach as waves and there

896
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,320
are no waves uh but only the atoms on

897
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,919
more complicated stuff underneath the

898
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:16,158
atoms and so on and you know that right

899
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,840
you would accept yes there is a certain

900
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,519
abstraction that happens here it's a

901
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:22,319
simplification of what happens in

902
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,159
simplification that is designed in such

903
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,918
a way that your brain can deal with it

904
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,320
temporarily and spatially in terms of

905
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,559
resources and tuned for the predictive

906
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,079
value so you can predict with some

907
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,158
accuracy whether your feet are going to

908
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:36,558
get wet or not but it's a really good

909
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,640
approach it's a really good interface

910
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,240
and approximation yes it's like equals

911
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,720
mg squared is a good

912
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,679
equations are good approximations for

913
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,640
what they're much better approximation

914
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,559
so

915
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,960
to me waves is a really nice

916
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,079
approximation what's all the complexity

917
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,360
that's happening underneath basically

918
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,519
it's a machine learning model that is

919
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:57,918
constantly tuned to minimize surprises

920
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,359
so it basically tries to predict as well

921
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,360
as it can what you're going to perceive

922
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,798
next are we talking about

923
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,678
which is the machine learning our

924
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,278
perception system or the dream world

925
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,600
the machine world is a dream world is

926
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,278
the result of the machine learning

927
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,038
process of the perception system that's

928
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,640
doing the compression yes

929
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:18,879
and uh the model of you as an agent is

930
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,038
not a different type of model or it's a

931
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,080
different type but not uh not different

932
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,158
as in its model like nature from the

933
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,119
model of the ocean right some things are

934
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,120
oceans some things are agents and one of

935
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,879
these agents is using your own control

936
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,959
model the output of your model the

937
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,240
things that you perceive yourself as

938
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,159
doing

939
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,440
and that is you

940
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,799
what about

941
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,919
the fact that like when you're standing

942
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:47,278
um and with the water on your feet and

943
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,440
you're looking out

944
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:52,159
into the vest

945
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,480
like open water of the ocean and then

946
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,480
there's a beautiful sunset

947
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,079
and it well the fact that it's beautiful

948
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,919
and then maybe you have like friends or

949
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,759
a loved one with you and like you feel

950
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,320
love what is that as the dream world

951
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,798
what is that yes it's all uh happening

952
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,278
inside of the dream okay

953
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:11,200
but see the word dream makes it seem

954
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:14,398
like it's not real

955
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,399
yeah of course it's not real

956
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,558
the physical universe is real but the

957
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,079
physical universe is incomprehensible

958
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,158
and it doesn't have any feeling of

959
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:24,000
realness the feeling of realness that

960
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,000
you experience gets attached to certain

961
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,519
representations where your brain

962
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,359
assesses this is the best model of

963
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,519
reality that i have so the only thing

964
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,359
that's real to you is the thing that's

965
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,640
happening at the very

966
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,158
base of reality like

967
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,000
for something to be real it needs to be

968
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,320
implemented

969
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,798
so uh the model that you have of reality

970
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:47,439
is a real in as far as it is a model

971
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,119
right it's an appropriate description of

972
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,440
the world to say that there are models

973
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,798
that are being experienced

974
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,960
but

975
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,798
the world that you experience is not

976
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,278
necessarily implemented

977
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:02,158
there is a difference between a reality

978
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,880
a simulation and a simulacrum

979
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,480
the

980
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,799
reality that we are talking about is

981
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,199
something that fully emerges over a

982
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,199
causally closed lowest layer the idea of

983
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,960
physicalism is that we are in that layer

984
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,039
that basically our world emerges over

985
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,199
that every alternative to physicalism is

986
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,960
a simulation theory which basically says

987
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,559
that we are in some kind of simulation

988
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,320
universe and the real world needs to be

989
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,320
an apparent universe of that where the

990
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,639
actual causal structure is right

991
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,800
and when you look at the ocean and your

992
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,320
own mind you are looking at a simulation

993
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,359
that explains what you're going to see

994
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,039
next

995
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,719
and we are living in a simulation yes

996
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,838
but the simulation generated by our own

997
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,319
brains

998
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,078
yeah and this simulation is different

999
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,919
from the physical reality because the

1000
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,440
causal structure that is being produced

1001
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,039
what you are seeing is different from

1002
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,800
the causal structure of physics but

1003
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,199
consistent

1004
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,119
hopefully if not then you are going to

1005
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,319
end up in some kind of institution where

1006
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,480
people will take care of you because

1007
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,039
your behavior will be inconsistent right

1008
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,039
your uh behavior needs to work in such a

1009
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,960
way that it's interacting with an

1010
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,199
accurately predictive model of reality

1011
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,960
and if your brain is unable to make your

1012
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:07,118
model of reality predictive

1013
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,800
um you will need help so what uh what do

1014
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,320
you think about donald hoffman's

1015
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,720
argument

1016
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,240
that it doesn't have to be consistent

1017
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,000
the dream world

1018
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,279
to the the what he calls like the

1019
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,599
interface

1020
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,040
uh to the actual physical reality where

1021
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,960
there could be evolution i think he

1022
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,800
makes an evolutionary argument

1023
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,358
which is like it could be an

1024
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,960
evolutionary advantage to have the dream

1025
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:32,719
world drift away from physical reality i

1026
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,000
think that only works if you have tenure

1027
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,239
as long as you are still interacting

1028
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,960
with the ground tools your model needs

1029
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,838
to be somewhat predictive

1030
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,760
well

1031
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:45,838
in some sense humans have achieved a

1032
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,599
kind of tenure in the animal kingdom

1033
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:51,039
at some point we became too big to fail

1034
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,039
so we became postmodernist

1035
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:55,039
it all makes sense the version of

1036
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,480
reality that we like

1037
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,358
oh man

1038
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,559
okay

1039
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:00,639
yeah but

1040
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:02,719
basically you can do magic you can

1041
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:04,719
change your assessment of reality but

1042
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,719
eventually uh reality is going to come

1043
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:09,039
bite you in the s if it's not predictive

1044
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,598
do you have a sense

1045
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,559
of what is that base layer physical

1046
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,599
reality

1047
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,599
you have

1048
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,680
like uh so you have these attempts at

1049
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,079
the theories of everything

1050
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,118
the very very small of like strength

1051
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,920
theory

1052
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,240
or what um stephen wolfram talks about

1053
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,480
with a hyper grass these are these tiny

1054
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,319
tiny tiny tiny objects

1055
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,559
and then there is more like

1056
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,160
quantum mechanics

1057
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,078
that's talking about objects that are

1058
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,480
much larger but still very very very

1059
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,599
tiny do you have a sense of where the

1060
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,599
tiniest thing is that is like

1061
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,920
at the lowest level the turtle at the

1062
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,760
very bottom do you have a sense

1063
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,760
i don't think that you can talk about

1064
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,920
where it is because space is emergent

1065
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,839
over the activity of these things so

1066
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,599
space

1067
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:57,358
uh the coordinates only exist in

1068
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,599
relation to the

1069
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,598
things other things and so you could in

1070
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,119
some sense abstract it into locations

1071
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,200
that can hold information and

1072
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,880
trajectories that the information can

1073
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,039
take between the different locations and

1074
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,000
this is how we construct our notion of

1075
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,199
space

1076
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,599
yeah and uh physicists uh usually have a

1077
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:18,239
notion of space that is continuous

1078
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,320
and this is a point where i

1079
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,078
tend to agree with people like stephen

1080
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,680
warfram who are very skeptical of the

1081
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,000
geometric notions

1082
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:29,039
i think that geometry is the dynamics of

1083
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,199
too many parts to count and

1084
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,119
when there are no infinities if there

1085
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,799
were two infinities you would be running

1086
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,400
into contradictions which is in some

1087
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,680
sense what uh google and turing

1088
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,680
discovered

1089
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,598
in response to hilbert's call

1090
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,919
so there are no infinities there are no

1091
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,838
infinities fake there is unboundedness

1092
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,280
but if you have a language that talks

1093
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:49,440
about infinity at some point the

1094
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,599
language is going to contradict itself

1095
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,358
which means it's no longer valid

1096
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,960
in order to deal with infinities and

1097
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:57,838
mathematics you have to postulate the

1098
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,679
existence in uh initially you cannot

1099
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,199
construct the infinities and that's an

1100
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,759
issue right you cannot build up an

1101
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,279
infinity from zero but in practice you

1102
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,720
never do this right when you perform

1103
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,960
calculations you only look at the

1104
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,919
dynamics of too many parts to count

1105
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,760
and

1106
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,680
usually these

1107
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,920
numbers are not that large they're not

1108
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,358
googles or something the big

1109
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,280
the infinities that we are dealing with

1110
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:20,319
in our universe are mathematically

1111
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,119
speaking

1112
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,960
relatively small integers

1113
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,800
and um still

1114
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,838
what we're looking at is dynamics where

1115
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,680
um

1116
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:34,799
a trillion things behave similar to 100

1117
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,799
trillion things or

1118
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,440
something that is very very large

1119
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,520
because they're converging and these

1120
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,480
convergent dynamics these operators this

1121
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,639
is what we

1122
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,400
deal with when we are doing the geometry

1123
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:49,118
right geometry is stuff where we can

1124
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,720
pretend that it's continuous because uh

1125
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,079
as if we subdivide the space

1126
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,000
sufficiently

1127
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,000
fine grained

1128
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
these things approach a certain dynamic

1129
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,400
and this approached dynamic that is what

1130
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,519
we mean by it but i don't think that

1131
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,280
infinity would work so to speak that you

1132
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:07,358
would know the last digit of pi and that

1133
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,359
you have a physical process that rests

1134
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:11,519
on knowing the last digit of pi

1135
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,078
yeah that that could be just a peculiar

1136
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,559
quark of human cognition that we like

1137
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,160
discrete discrete makes sense to us

1138
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,078
infinity doesn't

1139
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,598
so in terms of our intuitions no the

1140
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,920
issue is that uh everything that we

1141
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,480
think about uh needs to be expressed in

1142
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,000
some kind of mental language not not

1143
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,079
necessarily a natural language but some

1144
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,800
kind of mathematical language that your

1145
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,800
neurons can speak that refers to

1146
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,480
something in the world and what we have

1147
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,400
discovered is that

1148
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,679
uh we cannot construct a notion of

1149
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,440
infinity without running into

1150
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,519
contradictions which means that such a

1151
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,440
language is no longer valid

1152
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,358
and i suspect this is what made

1153
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,880
photographers so unhappy when somebody

1154
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,559
came up with the notion of irrational

1155
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,559
numbers before it was time right there's

1156
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,400
this miss that he had this person killed

1157
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,320
when he blapped out the secret that not

1158
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,760
everything can be expressed as a ratio

1159
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,000
between two numbers but there are there

1160
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,440
are numbers between the ratios the world

1161
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,039
was not ready for this and i think he

1162
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,200
was right that has confused

1163
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,199
mathematicians uh

1164
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,439
very seriously because these numbers are

1165
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,960
not values they're functions

1166
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,400
right so you can calculate these

1167
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,240
functions to a certain degree of

1168
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,960
approximation but you cannot pretend

1169
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,039
that pi has actually a value

1170
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,358
pi is a function that would generally

1171
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:23,039
approach this value to some degree

1172
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,519
but nothing in the world rests on

1173
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:25,519
knowing pie

1174
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:29,279
uh how much does how important is this

1175
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,960
distinction between discreet and

1176
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,200
continuous uh

1177
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,960
for you to get to the because there's a

1178
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:37,759
i mean

1179
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,679
in discussion of your favorite flavor of

1180
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,040
the theory of everything there's a few

1181
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,440
on the table

1182
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,119
so there's string theory there's a

1183
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,639
particular

1184
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,680
there's a

1185
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:52,400
loop quantum gravity which focus on one

1186
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,919
particular unification

1187
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,000
uh there's

1188
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,079
there's just a bunch of favorite flavors

1189
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,880
of different people trying to

1190
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,440
uh

1191
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,880
propose a theory of everything uh eric

1192
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,639
weinstein

1193
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,880
and a bunch of people throughout history

1194
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:09,199
and then of course stephen wolfram who i

1195
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,720
think is one of the only people doing a

1196
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,639
discrete

1197
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:16,078
no no there's a bunch of physicists who

1198
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:19,118
do this right now and okay like um

1199
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,640
topholy and tomasello and um

1200
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,240
the

1201
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,318
digital physics is something that is i

1202
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:25,439
think growing in popularity

1203
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:27,679
but uh

1204
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,679
the

1205
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:34,159
main reason why this is interesting is

1206
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
because it uh it's important sometimes

1207
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,759
to settle disagreements i don't think

1208
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,679
that you need infinities as or at all

1209
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,440
and you never needed them

1210
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:42,799
you can always deal with very large

1211
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,639
numbers and you can do it with limits

1212
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,400
right you're fine with doing that you

1213
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,400
don't need any kind of infinity you can

1214
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,480
build your computer algebra systems just

1215
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,720
as well without believing in infinity in

1216
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,719
the first place you're okay with limits

1217
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:57,279
yeah so basically a limit means that

1218
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,318
something is behaving pretty much the

1219
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,319
same

1220
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:01,759
if you make the number larger

1221
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:03,199
right because it's converging to a

1222
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,880
certain value and at some point the

1223
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:06,559
difference becomes measurable and you

1224
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,559
can no longer measure it

1225
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,679
and uh in this sense you have things

1226
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,000
that uh

1227
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,919
yeah if every ngon which is has enough

1228
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,079
corners then it's going to behave like a

1229
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,079
circle at some point right and it's only

1230
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,160
going to be in some kind of esoteric

1231
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,160
thing that cannot exist in the physical

1232
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,719
universe that you would be talking about

1233
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:25,920
this perfect circle and now it turns out

1234
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,759
that it also wouldn't work in

1235
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,920
mathematics because you cannot construct

1236
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,800
mathematics that has infinite resolution

1237
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,960
without running into contradictions

1238
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,400
so that is itself not that important

1239
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,079
because we never did that right it's

1240
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,960
just a thing that some people thought we

1241
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,039
could

1242
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,039
and this leads to confusion so for

1243
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,400
instance roger penrose uses this as an

1244
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:46,318
argument to say

1245
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,639
that there are certain things that

1246
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:50,480
mathematicians can do

1247
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:53,199
dealing with infinities

1248
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,079
and by extension our mind can do

1249
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:58,399
that computers cannot do yeah he he

1250
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,720
talks about that there's the human mind

1251
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,599
can do certain mathematical things

1252
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:06,799
that the computer as defined by

1253
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,800
the universal touring machine cannot yes

1254
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,280
what so that it has to do with infinity

1255
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,119
yes it's one of the things so he is

1256
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,599
basically pointing at the fact that

1257
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,760
there are things that are possible

1258
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,760
in

1259
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,519
the mathematical mind and in pure

1260
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:25,118
mathematics that are not possible in uh

1261
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,039
machines that can be constructed in the

1262
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,599
physical universe

1263
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:31,599
and because he's an honest guy he thinks

1264
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,920
this means that uh present physics

1265
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,800
cannot explain operations that happen in

1266
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,800
our mind do you think he's right and uh

1267
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,800
so let's let's leave his discussion of

1268
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,720
consciousness aside for the moment do

1269
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,560
you think he's right about just

1270
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,078
what he's basically referring to as

1271
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,599
intelligence

1272
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,760
so

1273
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,559
are is the human mind fundamentally more

1274
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,359
capable as a thinking machine than a

1275
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:58,639
universal touring machine no

1276
00:43:55,358 --> 00:44:00,318
but so he's suggesting that right

1277
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,759
so our mind is actually less than a

1278
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:03,599
turing machine there can be no touring

1279
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,119
machine because it's defined as having

1280
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,119
an infinite tape

1281
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,200
and we always only have a finite tape

1282
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,200
but you can perform finally many

1283
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:13,279
operations yes

1284
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,639
it can do the kind of computation the

1285
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,640
yes the touring machine cannot and

1286
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:18,879
that's because he thinks that our minds

1287
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:20,960
can do operations that have infinite

1288
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,440
resolution in some sense

1289
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,280
and i don't think that's the case our

1290
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,280
minds are just able to discover these

1291
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,519
limit operators over too many parts to

1292
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,519
count

1293
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,838
what about his idea that consciousness

1294
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:37,838
is

1295
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:40,159
more uh more than a computation so it's

1296
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:42,000
more than something that uh a touring

1297
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:43,039
machine can can do

1298
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,400
so again

1299
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,880
saying that there's something special

1300
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,519
about our mind they cannot be replicated

1301
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,519
in the machine

1302
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,679
the issue is that i don't even know how

1303
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,400
to construct a language to

1304
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,639
express this statement correctly

1305
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,639
well

1306
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:06,799
the the the basic statement is

1307
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,560
there's a there's a human experience

1308
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,560
that includes intelligence that includes

1309
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:12,880
self-awareness that includes

1310
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,440
the hard problem of consciousness

1311
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,800
and the question is can that be fully

1312
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,880
simulated

1313
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,318
in the computer

1314
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,599
in the mathematical model of the

1315
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:25,838
computer as we understand it today

1316
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,000
rajapanos says no

1317
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,039
so the the

1318
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,119
uh

1319
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,400
universal turing machine cannot simulate

1320
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,400
the universe

1321
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,639
so the interesting question is uh and

1322
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,358
you have to ask him this is why not what

1323
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:40,879
is this specific thing that cannot be

1324
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,400
modeled and

1325
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,720
when i looked at his writings and i

1326
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,559
haven't read all of it but when i read

1327
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,000
for instance um the

1328
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,880
section that he writes in the

1329
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,199
introduction to and wrote to infinity

1330
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,000
the thing that he specifically refers to

1331
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:55,759
is

1332
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,599
the way in which human minds deal with

1333
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,960
infinities

1334
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,039
and

1335
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,960
that itself can i think easily be

1336
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,880
deconstructed

1337
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,639
a lot of uh people feel that our

1338
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,559
experience cannot be explained in a

1339
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:11,039
mechanical way

1340
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,759
and therefore it needs to be different

1341
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:16,559
and i concur our experience is not

1342
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,640
mechanical our experience is simulated

1343
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,239
it exists only in a simulation the only

1344
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:21,679
assimilation can be conscious physical

1345
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:24,159
systems cannot be conscious because

1346
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:26,239
they're only mechanical cells cannot be

1347
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,920
conscious neurons cannot be conscious

1348
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,679
brains cannot be conscious people cannot

1349
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,838
be conscious as far as you if you

1350
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,919
understand them as physical systems

1351
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:36,799
what can be conscious is

1352
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,240
the story of a system in the world where

1353
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,280
you write all these things into the

1354
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,279
story

1355
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,200
you have experiences for the same reason

1356
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,680
that a character novel has experiences

1357
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,759
because it's written into the story

1358
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,440
and now the system is acting on that

1359
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,800
story and it's not a story that is

1360
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,880
written in a natural language it's

1361
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,280
written in a perceptual language in this

1362
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,640
multimedia language of the game engine

1363
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,040
and in there

1364
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,400
you write in what kind of experience you

1365
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:02,000
have and what this means for the

1366
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,838
behavior of the system for your behavior

1367
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,358
tendencies for your focus for your

1368
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,000
attention for your experience of valence

1369
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,679
and so on and this is being used to

1370
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,800
inform the behavior of the system in the

1371
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:15,199
next step and then the

1372
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,960
story updates with the reactions of the

1373
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,199
system and the changes in the world and

1374
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,800
so on and you live inside of that model

1375
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,279
you don't live inside of the physical

1376
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,280
reality

1377
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,440
and

1378
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:30,079
i mean just just to linger on it like

1379
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,079
you see okay yeah it's in the perceptual

1380
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,359
language the multimodal perceptual

1381
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,200
language

1382
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,679
that's the experience that's what

1383
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:40,799
consciousness is within that

1384
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:44,159
within that model within that story

1385
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,599
but do you do you have agency

1386
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:47,440
when you play a video game you can turn

1387
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,519
left and you can turn right

1388
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:53,599
in that story

1389
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:55,679
so in that dream world how much control

1390
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,599
do you is there such a thing as you in

1391
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:58,399
that story

1392
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,800
like

1393
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,720
is it right to say the main character

1394
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,559
you know everybody's npcs and then

1395
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:06,879
there's the main character and you're

1396
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,280
controlling the main character

1397
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,960
or is that an illusion is there a main

1398
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,640
character that you're controlling i'm

1399
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,480
getting to the point of like

1400
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,318
the free will point

1401
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,400
imagine that you are building a robot

1402
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:20,318
that plays soccer yeah and you've been

1403
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,680
to mit computer science you basically

1404
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:24,558
know how to do that

1405
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:26,078
right and so uh you would say the robot

1406
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,599
is an agent that solves the control

1407
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,440
problem

1408
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,800
how to get the ball into the goal and it

1409
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,720
needs to perceive the world and the

1410
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,318
world is disturbing him and trying to do

1411
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,159
this right so he has to control many

1412
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:37,920
variables to make that happen and to

1413
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:40,078
project itself and the ball into the

1414
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,079
future and understand its position on

1415
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,119
the field relative to the ball and so on

1416
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,039
in the uh position of its limbs or in in

1417
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,480
the space around it and so on so it

1418
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:51,279
needs to have an adequate model that

1419
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,559
abstracting reality in a useful way

1420
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,319
and

1421
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,319
you could say that this

1422
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,318
robot does have agency over what it's

1423
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,079
doing in some sense

1424
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,000
and the model is

1425
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,318
going to be a control model and inside

1426
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,159
of that control model you can

1427
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,400
possibly get to a point where this thing

1428
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:10,480
is sufficiently abstract to discover its

1429
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,920
own agency our current robots don't do

1430
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,000
that they don't have a unified model of

1431
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,440
the universe but

1432
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,960
there is not a reason why we shouldn't

1433
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,119
be getting there at some point in the

1434
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,519
not too distant future and once that

1435
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:24,400
happens you will notice that the uh

1436
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,838
robot tells a story about the robot

1437
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,240
playing soccer

1438
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:30,799
so the robot will experience itself

1439
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,719
playing soccer in a simulation of the

1440
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,640
world that it uses to

1441
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:38,078
construct a model of the locations of it

1442
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:39,519
lacks on and limbs in space on the field

1443
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,720
with relationship to the ball and it's

1444
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,079
not going to be at the level of the

1445
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:44,239
molecules

1446
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,680
it will be an abstraction that is

1447
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:47,519
exactly at the level that is most

1448
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:49,519
suitable for past planning of the

1449
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,800
movements of the robot

1450
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,400
right it's going to be a high level

1451
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,280
abstraction but a very useful one that

1452
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,960
is as predictive as we can make it and

1453
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,800
in that side of that story there is a

1454
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,000
model of the agency of that system so

1455
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,640
this model can accurately

1456
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,719
predict that the contents of the model

1457
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,879
are going to be driving the behavior of

1458
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,239
the robot in the immediate future but

1459
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,318
there's the hard problem of

1460
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:14,558
consciousness

1461
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,400
which i would also

1462
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,920
there's a subjective experience of free

1463
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,318
will as well

1464
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:23,039
that i'm not sure where the robot gets

1465
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:25,039
that where that little leap is because

1466
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:26,960
for me right now everything i imagine

1467
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:28,960
with that robot as it gets more and more

1468
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,760
and more sophisticated

1469
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,440
the agency comes from the programmer of

1470
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,760
the robot still

1471
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,200
of what was programmed in

1472
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,440
you could probably do an end-to-end

1473
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,039
learning system you maybe need to give

1474
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,480
it a few prayers so you nudge the

1475
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,119
architecture in the right direction that

1476
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,358
it converges more quickly but ultimately

1477
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,960
uh discovering the suitable hyper

1478
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:50,880
parameters of the architecture is also

1479
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,440
only a search process right and as the

1480
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,599
search process was evolution that has

1481
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,599
informed our brain architecture so we

1482
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:01,039
can converge in a single lifetime on

1483
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:03,599
useful interaction with the world and

1484
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:06,159
if we define hyper parameters broadly so

1485
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,920
it's not just this the uh the parameters

1486
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,078
that control this end-to-end learning

1487
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,400
system but the entirety of the design of

1488
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,359
the robot like the

1489
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,039
there's

1490
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:16,480
you have to remove the human completely

1491
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:18,400
from the picture and then in order to

1492
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,480
build the robot you have to

1493
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,079
create an entire universe because you

1494
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,440
have to go you can't just shortcut

1495
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,559
evolution you have to go from the very

1496
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,159
beginning

1497
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,920
in order for it to have because i feel

1498
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:30,078
like there's always a human

1499
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,519
pulling the strings

1500
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,760
um and that

1501
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:35,759
makes it seem like the robot is cheating

1502
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,960
it's getting a shortcut to consciousness

1503
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,800
when you are looking at the current

1504
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,480
boston dynamics robots it doesn't look

1505
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,839
as if there is somebody pulling the

1506
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,599
strings it doesn't look like cheating

1507
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:44,960
anymore okay so let's go there because i

1508
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,400
gotta talk to you about this so

1509
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,599
obviously with the case of boston

1510
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,680
dynamics

1511
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,559
as you may or may not know

1512
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:51,679
it's

1513
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,920
always

1514
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:56,480
either hard coded or remote controlled

1515
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,680
there's no intelligence i don't know how

1516
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,760
the current generation of boston

1517
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:01,598
dynamics robots works but

1518
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,520
what i've been told about the previous

1519
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,119
ones was that it's basically all

1520
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,119
cybernetic control

1521
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,760
which means you still have uh feedback

1522
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:12,079
mechanisms and so on but it's not uh

1523
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,920
deep learning for the most part as it's

1524
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:15,599
currently done it's

1525
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,720
for the most part just identifying a

1526
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,318
control hierarchy that is congruent to

1527
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,598
the limbs that exist and the parameters

1528
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:22,880
that need to be optimized for the

1529
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,880
movement of these limbs and then there

1530
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,640
is a convergence progress so it's

1531
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,480
basically just regression that you would

1532
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:29,759
need to control this but again i don't

1533
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,358
know whether that's true that's just

1534
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,359
what i've been told about how they work

1535
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:35,838
we have to separate several

1536
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:38,159
levels of discussions here so the only

1537
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,880
thing they do is pretty sophisticated

1538
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:43,118
control no with no machine learning

1539
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,838
in order to be

1540
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:48,318
to maintain balance or to write itself

1541
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:50,880
it's a control problem in terms of using

1542
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:53,599
the actuators to when it's pushed or

1543
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,358
when it steps on a thing that's uneven

1544
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,119
how to always maintain balance yes and

1545
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:58,799
there's a tricky like set of heuristics

1546
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,400
around that but

1547
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,559
uh that's the only goal

1548
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,720
everything you see boston dynamics doing

1549
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,000
in terms of that to us humans is

1550
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,959
compelling

1551
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,639
which is any kind of um higher order

1552
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,400
movement like turning

1553
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:15,519
uh wiggling its butt

1554
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,680
uh like uh you know uh

1555
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:19,920
jumping back on its two feet

1556
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:23,118
dancing the dancing is even worse

1557
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:25,838
because dancing is hard coded in it's um

1558
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,160
it's choreographed by humans there's

1559
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:30,799
choreography software so like there is

1560
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:32,239
no of all that high level movement

1561
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,480
there's no

1562
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:37,759
anything that you can call certainly

1563
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:40,318
can't call ai but there's no uh

1564
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,480
even like basic heuristics it's all hard

1565
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:46,159
coded in and yet

1566
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,480
we humans immediately project

1567
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:51,519
agency onto them which is which is

1568
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,358
fascinating so the gap here is uh it

1569
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,440
doesn't necessarily have agency well it

1570
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,880
has a cybernetic control and the

1571
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,960
cybernetic control means you have a

1572
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,880
hierarchy of feedback loops that keep

1573
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,639
the behavior in certain boundaries so

1574
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,640
the robot doesn't fall over and it's

1575
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,719
able to perform the movements and the

1576
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,719
choreography cannot really happen with

1577
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,159
motion capture because the robot would

1578
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:11,838
fall over because the physics of the

1579
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:13,118
robot the weight distribution and so on

1580
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:15,920
is different from the weight

1581
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:19,039
distribution in the human body so if you

1582
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,720
were using the directly motion captured

1583
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:22,558
movements of the human body to project

1584
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,000
it into this robot it wouldn't work you

1585
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,440
can do this with the computer animation

1586
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,960
it will look a little bit off but who

1587
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,960
cares but

1588
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,440
if you want to correct for the physics

1589
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:34,480
you need to basically tell the robot

1590
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,400
where it should move its limbs and then

1591
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,400
the control algorithm is going to

1592
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,960
approximate a solution that makes it

1593
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,280
possible within the physics of the robot

1594
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,720
and you have to find um the basic

1595
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,079
solution for making that happen and

1596
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:49,039
there's probably going to be some

1597
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,039
regression necessary to get the control

1598
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:52,880
architecture to to make these movements

1599
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:55,440
but those two layers are separate yes

1600
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,599
the the the thing the higher level

1601
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,760
instruction of what how you should move

1602
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,079
and where you should move is that so i

1603
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,839
expect that the control level of these

1604
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,960
robots at some level is dumb this is

1605
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:06,558
just the

1606
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,760
physical control movement the motor

1607
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,760
architecture

1608
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,200
but uh it's a relatively smart motor

1609
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,880
architecture it's just that there is no

1610
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:14,719
high level deliberation about what

1611
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,760
decisions to make necessarily right but

1612
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:19,679
see it doesn't feel like um free will

1613
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:23,200
no that was not where i was trying to

1614
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:25,279
get to i think that in our own uh

1615
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:27,358
body we have that too so we have a

1616
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,680
certain thing that is basically just a

1617
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:31,199
cybernetic control architecture that is

1618
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:32,480
moving our limbs

1619
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,159
and

1620
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,760
deep learning can help in discovering

1621
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:37,118
such an architecture if you don't have

1622
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,720
it in the first place

1623
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,559
if you already know your hardware you

1624
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,000
can maybe handcraft it

1625
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:43,760
but if you don't know your hardware you

1626
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
can search for such an architecture and

1627
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,760
this work already existed in the

1628
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,838
80s and 90s people were starting to

1629
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,319
search for control architectures by

1630
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:53,920
motor babbling and so on and just use

1631
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:55,519
reinforcement learning architectures to

1632
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,559
discover such a thing

1633
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,239
and

1634
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,720
now imagine that you have the cybernetic

1635
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:03,838
control architecture already inside of

1636
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:06,959
you and you extend this a little bit so

1637
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:08,960
you are seeking out food for instance or

1638
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,760
rest or and so on and

1639
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:14,559
you get to have a baby at some point

1640
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:17,119
and now you add more and more control

1641
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,519
layers to this and the system is reverse

1642
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,519
engineering its own control architecture

1643
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:23,920
and builds a high level model to

1644
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:26,239
synchronize the pursuit of very

1645
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,519
different conflicting goals

1646
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:29,439
and this is how i think you get to

1647
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:31,759
purposes purposes are models of your

1648
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,119
goals the goals may be intrinsic as the

1649
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,200
result of the different set point

1650
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,519
violations that you have hunger and

1651
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:39,598
thirst for very different things and

1652
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:41,280
rest and pain avoidance and so on and

1653
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,519
you put all these things together and

1654
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,920
eventually you need to come up with a

1655
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:48,159
strategy to synchronize them all

1656
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,920
and you don't need uh just to do this

1657
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:52,719
alone by yourself because we are state

1658
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,798
building organisms we cannot function in

1659
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:57,679
the isolation the way that homo sapiens

1660
00:56:54,798 --> 00:57:00,318
is set up so our own behavior only makes

1661
00:56:57,679 --> 00:57:03,118
sense when you zoom out very far into a

1662
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:06,079
society or even into ecosystemic

1663
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,838
intelligence on the planet and our place

1664
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,000
in it so the individual behavior only

1665
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:11,759
makes sense in these larger contexts and

1666
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,639
we have a number of priors built into us

1667
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,240
so we are behaving as if we are acting

1668
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,838
on these high level goals pretty much

1669
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:19,759
right from the start

1670
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,920
and eventually in the course of our life

1671
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,599
we can reverse engineer the goals that

1672
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,760
we are acting on what actually are our

1673
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,440
higher level purposes

1674
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,440
and the more we understand that the more

1675
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,599
our behavior makes sense but this is all

1676
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,480
at this point complex stories within

1677
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,640
stories that are driving our behavior

1678
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,719
yeah i just

1679
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:41,358
don't know how big of a leap it is to

1680
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:44,239
start uh create a system that's able to

1681
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:45,838
tell stories within stories

1682
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:48,159
like how big of a leap that is from

1683
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,838
where currently boston dynamics is

1684
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:52,318
or any robot that's operating in the

1685
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:55,838
physical space

1686
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:57,838
that and that leap might be

1687
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,599
big if it requires to solve the hard

1688
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:01,440
problem of consciousness which is

1689
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:04,079
telling a hell of a good story

1690
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,679
i suspect that um consciousness itself

1691
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,119
is relatively simple what's hard is

1692
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:08,798
perception

1693
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,960
and the interface between perception and

1694
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:13,358
reasoning

1695
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,039
that's for instance the idea of

1696
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:17,519
the consciousness prior that would be

1697
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:18,639
built into such a system by uh joshua

1698
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,079
bangio

1699
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:21,679
and uh

1700
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,960
what he describes and i think that's

1701
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:24,318
accurate is

1702
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,318
that

1703
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:27,920
our own

1704
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:28,960
model of the world can be described

1705
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,599
through something like an energy

1706
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,519
function the energy function is modeling

1707
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,200
the contradictions that exist within the

1708
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,719
model at any given point and you try to

1709
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:38,239
minimize these contradictions the

1710
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:40,399
tangents in the model

1711
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:42,318
and to do this you need to sometimes

1712
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,920
test things you need to conditionally

1713
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,798
disambiguate figure and ground you need

1714
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,798
to just

1715
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:48,639
distinguish whether this is true or that

1716
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:50,798
is true and so on eventually you get to

1717
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:52,480
an interpretation but you will need to

1718
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:54,559
manually depress a few points in your

1719
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,798
model to let it snap into a state that

1720
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,240
makes sense and this function that tries

1721
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:00,079
to get the biggest dip in the energy

1722
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:01,598
function in your model according to

1723
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,359
joshua bangio is related to

1724
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,240
consciousness it's a low dimensional

1725
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:09,039
discrete function that tries to

1726
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:11,439
maximize this dip in the energy function

1727
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:13,279
i yeah

1728
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,880
i think i would need to dig into details

1729
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,480
because i think the way he uses the word

1730
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,798
consciousness is more akin to like

1731
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,719
self-awareness like modeling yourself

1732
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:22,559
within the world

1733
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:25,199
as opposed to the subjective experience

1734
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:27,280
the hard problem no it's not even the

1735
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:28,879
self is in the world the self is the

1736
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,960
agent and you don't need to be aware of

1737
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,280
yourself in order to be conscious

1738
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,039
the self is just a particular content

1739
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,839
that you can have but you don't have to

1740
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,239
have

1741
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:40,078
right you can be conscious in uh for

1742
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:41,919
instance a dream at night or during a

1743
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,798
meditation state but you don't have a

1744
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,480
self

1745
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:46,239
right where you're just aware of the

1746
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,480
fact that you are aware and what we mean

1747
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:51,519
by consciousness and

1748
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,679
the colloquial sense is largely this

1749
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:55,280
reflexive self-awareness

1750
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:57,199
that we become aware of the fact that

1751
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,480
you're paying attention

1752
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:00,239
that we are the thing that pays

1753
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,920
attention we are the thing that pays

1754
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,159
attention right

1755
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,680
i don't see where uh

1756
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:09,838
the uh awareness that we're aware

1757
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,078
the the heart problem doesn't feel like

1758
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:13,599
it's solved i mean they they're they're

1759
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,039
it it's called a hard problem for a

1760
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,160
reason

1761
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:18,079
because

1762
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:19,199
it seems like there needs to be a major

1763
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,880
leap

1764
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:23,439
yeah i think the major leap is to

1765
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,119
understand how it is possible that a

1766
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,960
machine can dream

1767
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,519
that the physical system

1768
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,280
is able to create a representation that

1769
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:34,318
the physical system is acting on and

1770
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,000
that is spun force and so on but once

1771
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:38,159
you accept the fact that you are not in

1772
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,639
physics but that you exist inside of the

1773
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:42,000
story i think the mystery disappears

1774
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:43,759
everything is possible in a statement

1775
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,358
exists inside the story okay so your

1776
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,799
consciousness is being written into the

1777
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:49,119
story the fact that you experience

1778
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:51,199
things is written to the story you ask

1779
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,720
yourself is this real what i'm seeing

1780
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:53,759
and your brain writes into the story yes

1781
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:55,598
it's real

1782
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,040
so what about the perception of

1783
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:59,519
consciousness so

1784
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,400
to me you look conscious

1785
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,559
so

1786
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,519
um the illusion of consciousness the

1787
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,640
demonstration of consciousness i ask for

1788
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:08,480
the

1789
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:10,558
the legged robot how do we make this

1790
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,519
legged robot conscious

1791
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,280
so

1792
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:16,318
there's two things and maybe you can

1793
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,798
tell me if they're neighboring ideas

1794
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:20,480
one is actually make it conscious

1795
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:22,559
and the other is make it appear

1796
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,280
conscious to others

1797
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,359
are those related

1798
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,359
uh let's ask from the other direction

1799
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:31,119
what would it take to make you not

1800
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:32,159
conscious

1801
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,680
so

1802
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,118
when you are thinking about how you

1803
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:37,279
perceive the world

1804
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:39,760
can you decide to

1805
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,960
switch from looking at qualia

1806
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:45,200
to looking at representational states

1807
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,440
and it turns out you can yeah there is a

1808
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:49,199
particular way in which you can

1809
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:51,358
look at the world and recognize its

1810
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:53,199
machine nature including your own

1811
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:55,838
and in that state you don't have that

1812
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:57,199
conscious experience in this way anymore

1813
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:00,078
it becomes

1814
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:01,519
apparent as a representation everything

1815
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,440
becomes opaque

1816
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:05,280
and i think this thing that you

1817
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,880
recognize everything as a representation

1818
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,039
this is typically what we mean with

1819
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,280
enlightenment states

1820
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:13,760
and yeah you can't have a motivational

1821
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,440
level but it you can also do this on the

1822
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,599
experiential level and the perceptual

1823
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,318
level see but then i can come back to a

1824
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:23,680
conscious state

1825
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:25,759
okay i particularly

1826
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:28,480
i'm referring to the

1827
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,079
social aspect that the demonstration of

1828
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,240
consciousness

1829
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,960
is a really nice thing at a party when

1830
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:37,439
you're trying to meet a new person

1831
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:40,720
it's it's a nice thing to to to know

1832
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,000
that they're conscious and they can um

1833
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:43,838
how i don't know how fundamental

1834
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
consciousness is in human interaction

1835
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:49,599
but it seems like to be at least

1836
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,679
uh an important part and i i asked that

1837
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,280
in the same kind of way

1838
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:55,358
for robots

1839
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,480
you know in order to create a rich

1840
01:02:55,358 --> 01:03:00,078
compelling human robot interaction it

1841
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,719
feels like there needs to be elements of

1842
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:04,880
consciousness within that interaction

1843
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:05,598
my cat is obviously conscious

1844
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,680
and

1845
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,680
so my cat can do this party trick she

1846
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:11,759
also knows that i am conscious be able

1847
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:13,838
to have feedback about the fact that we

1848
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,640
are both acting on models of our own

1849
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:17,679
awareness the question is how hard is it

1850
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:19,598
for

1851
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:21,358
uh the robot

1852
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,599
artificially created robot to achieve

1853
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:26,239
cat level and

1854
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,160
party tricks yes so the issue for me is

1855
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:30,719
currently not so much on how to build a

1856
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:33,199
system that creates a story about a

1857
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:35,038
robot that lives in the world but to

1858
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:36,480
make an adequate representation of the

1859
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,119
world

1860
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,920
and the model model that you and me have

1861
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:44,160
is a unified one it's verb one where you

1862
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,838
basically make sense of everything that

1863
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,239
you can perceive every feature in the

1864
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:50,480
world that enters your perception can be

1865
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:51,679
relationally mapped to a unified model

1866
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,599
of everything

1867
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:56,159
and we don't have an ai that is able to

1868
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:58,000
construct such a unified model yet

1869
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,719
so you need that unified model to do the

1870
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,559
party trick yes i think that uh you it

1871
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:04,239
doesn't make sense if this thing is

1872
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,760
conscious but not in the same universe

1873
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:06,798
as you because you could not relate to

1874
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,039
each other

1875
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:11,920
so what's the process would you say of

1876
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:14,559
engineering consciousness in the machine

1877
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,880
like what are the ideas here

1878
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:19,119
so uh you probably want to have some

1879
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,200
kind of perceptual system this

1880
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:24,000
perceptual system is a processing agent

1881
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:26,399
that is able to track sensory data and

1882
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,599
predict the next frame and the sensory

1883
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,920
data from the

1884
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,920
previous frames of the sensory data in

1885
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,838
the current state of the system so the

1886
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,838
current state of the system is

1887
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:37,519
perception instrumental to predicting

1888
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:39,119
what happens next

1889
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:40,798
and this means you build lots and lots

1890
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,798
of functions that take all the blips

1891
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:45,519
that you feel on your skin and that you

1892
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:46,239
see on your retina or that you hear

1893
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:48,000
and

1894
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:50,239
puts them into a set of relationships

1895
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,079
that allows you to predict what kind of

1896
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:54,078
sensory data what kind of sensor of

1897
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,240
blips your vector of blips you're going

1898
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,318
to perceive in the next frame right this

1899
01:04:56,239 --> 01:05:00,000
is tuned and it's

1900
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:01,838
constantly tuned until it gets as

1901
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,838
accurate as it can

1902
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:05,119
you build a very accurate prediction

1903
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:08,159
mechanism

1904
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:10,079
that is step one of the perception so

1905
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:11,920
first you predict then you perceive and

1906
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,359
see the error in your prediction and you

1907
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,200
have to do two things to make that

1908
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:17,038
happen one is you have to build a

1909
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:18,399
network of relationships that are

1910
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,520
constraints

1911
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,039
that

1912
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:23,199
take all the variants in the world to

1913
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:26,000
put each of the variances into a

1914
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:28,078
variable variable that is connected with

1915
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,599
relationships to other variables and

1916
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,200
these relationships are computable

1917
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,200
functions that constrain each other so

1918
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:35,118
when you see a nose that points a

1919
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:36,480
certain direction in space you have a

1920
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,960
constraint that says there should be a

1921
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:40,480
face nearby that has the same direction

1922
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,838
right and if that is not the case you

1923
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,280
have some kind of contradiction that you

1924
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:44,639
need to resolve because it's probably

1925
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,880
not a nose what you're looking at it

1926
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:49,199
just looks like one so you have to

1927
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,400
reinterpret the data and until you get

1928
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:54,558
to a point where your model converges

1929
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,798
and this process of making the sensory

1930
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:59,599
data fit into your model structure is

1931
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:02,480
what prg calls

1932
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:04,559
the assimilation and accommodation is

1933
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,920
the change of the models where you

1934
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,079
change your model such a way that you

1935
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,760
can assimilate everything

1936
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,240
so you're you're talking about building

1937
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,079
a hell of an awesome perception system

1938
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:15,919
that's able to do prediction and

1939
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,160
perception and correct and improvement

1940
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,480
wait just uh if you had to wait there's

1941
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:22,078
more yes there's more so the first thing

1942
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,318
that we want to do is we want to

1943
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,400
minimize the contradictions in the model

1944
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:27,519
yes and of course it's very easy to make

1945
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,358
a model in which you minimize the

1946
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:31,280
contradictions just by allowing that it

1947
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:33,358
can be in many many possible states

1948
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,640
right so if you increase degrees of

1949
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:36,639
freedom you will have fewer

1950
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:38,159
contradictions but you also want to

1951
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:40,239
reduce the degrees of freedom because

1952
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:41,838
degrees of freedom mean uncertainty

1953
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:44,318
you want your model to reduce

1954
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:46,719
uncertainty as much as possible

1955
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:48,400
but reducing uncertainty is expensive so

1956
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:51,439
you have to have a trade-off between

1957
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,599
minimizing contradictions and reducing

1958
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:56,480
uncertainty and you have only finite

1959
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:58,000
amount of compute and experimental time

1960
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,400
and effort available to reduce

1961
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,719
uncertainty in the world so you need to

1962
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,240
assign value to what you observe

1963
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:06,798
so you need some kind of motivational

1964
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:08,318
system that is estimating what you

1965
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:09,759
should be looking at and what you should

1966
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:11,519
be thinking about it how you should be

1967
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,720
applying your resources to model what

1968
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:14,798
that is

1969
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:16,480
right so you need to have something like

1970
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:17,759
uh convergence links that tell you how

1971
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,599
to get from the present state of the

1972
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:21,440
model to the next one you need to have

1973
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:23,760
these compatibility links that tell you

1974
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:26,480
which constraints exist and which

1975
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,960
constraint violations exist and you need

1976
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,719
to have some kind of motivational system

1977
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,318
that tells you what to pay attention to

1978
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:33,279
so now we have a second agent next to

1979
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:34,880
the perceptual age we have a

1980
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,039
motivational agent

1981
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,039
this is a cybernetic system that is

1982
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:40,799
modeling what the system needs what's

1983
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:42,319
important for the system and that

1984
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:44,559
interacts with the perceptual system to

1985
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:46,079
maximize the expected reward

1986
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:48,720
and you're saying a motivational system

1987
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:51,039
is some kind of

1988
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:53,038
like what is it a higher level narrative

1989
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:55,039
over some lower level no it's just your

1990
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:57,039
brainstem stuff the limbic system stuff

1991
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,240
that tells you okay now you should get

1992
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,079
something to eat because i've just

1993
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:01,439
measured your dual blood sugar like

1994
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,160
motivational system like the lower

1995
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,000
levels yes like hungry yes but there's

1996
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:07,519
basically a physiological needs and some

1997
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,880
cognitive needs and some social needs

1998
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:10,639
and they all interact and they're all

1999
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,400
implemented at different parts in your

2000
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:13,838
nervous system as the motivational

2001
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,319
system but they're basically cybernetic

2002
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:18,238
feedback loops it's not that complicated

2003
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,759
it's just a lot of code

2004
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:21,358
and

2005
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,198
so you now have a motivational agent

2006
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,838
that makes your robot go for the ball or

2007
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:28,238
that makes your worm go to eat

2008
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:29,920
food and so on and you have the

2009
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:31,599
perceptual system that lets it predict

2010
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,600
that environment so it's able to solve

2011
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,279
that control problem to some degree

2012
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,880
and now what we learned is that it's

2013
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:38,480
very hard to build a machine learning

2014
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,640
system that looks at all the data

2015
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:43,198
simultaneously to see what kind of

2016
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,798
relationships could exist between them

2017
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:47,278
so you need to selectively model the

2018
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:48,798
world you need to figure out where can i

2019
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,960
make the biggest difference if i would

2020
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:52,719
put the following things together

2021
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,480
sometimes you find a gradient for that

2022
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:56,560
right when you have a gradient you don't

2023
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:57,838
need to remember where you came from you

2024
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,000
just follow the gradient until it

2025
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:01,278
doesn't get any better but if you have a

2026
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,039
word where the problems are

2027
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:05,920
discontinuous and the search spaces are

2028
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:07,679
discontinuous you need to retain memory

2029
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,480
of what you explored and you need to

2030
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:12,960
construct a plan of what to explore next

2031
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,639
and this thing that means that you have

2032
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,600
next to this perceptual construction

2033
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:20,719
system and the motivational cybernetics

2034
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:22,159
an agent that is paying attention to

2035
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,719
what it should select at any given

2036
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:27,439
moment to maximize reward and this

2037
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:29,039
scanning system this attention agent

2038
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:32,559
is required for consciousness and

2039
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:34,479
consciousness it is its control model

2040
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,120
so it's the index memories that this

2041
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:39,119
thing retains when it manipulates the

2042
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:40,719
perceptual representations

2043
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:42,479
to

2044
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:44,719
maximize the value and minimize the

2045
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:46,559
conflicts and it to increase coherence

2046
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:48,399
so the purpose of consciousness is to

2047
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,120
create coherence in your perception

2048
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:53,278
representations remove conflicts predict

2049
01:09:51,119 --> 01:09:55,039
the future construct counterfactual

2050
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,440
representations so you can coordinate

2051
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:59,439
your actions and so on

2052
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:01,119
and in order to do this it needs to form

2053
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:03,198
memories these memories are partial

2054
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:05,279
binding states of the working memory

2055
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:08,319
contents that are being revisited later

2056
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:10,880
on to backtrack to undo certain states

2057
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:13,279
to look for alternatives and these index

2058
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,840
memories that you can recall that is

2059
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:17,119
what you perceive as your stream of

2060
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,560
consciousness and being able to recall

2061
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:20,640
these memories this is what makes you

2062
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,080
conscious if you could not remember what

2063
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,480
you paid attention to you wouldn't be

2064
01:10:22,079 --> 01:10:24,479
conscious

2065
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:30,880
so consciousness is the index in the

2066
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,560
memory database okay

2067
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,880
uh but

2068
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,120
let me sneak up to the questions of

2069
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,679
consciousness a little further

2070
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:42,640
so we usually

2071
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:46,079
relate suffering to consciousness

2072
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,079
so the capacity to suffer

2073
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:49,679
i think to me that's a really strong

2074
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:52,479
sign of consciousness

2075
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:55,119
is a thing that can suffer

2076
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:57,119
how how is that useful

2077
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:59,119
suffering

2078
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:01,599
and like in your model what you just

2079
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:02,640
described which is indexing of memories

2080
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,079
and

2081
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,840
what is the coherence with the

2082
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:07,279
perception

2083
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,279
uh with this predictive thing that's

2084
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:11,198
going on the perception

2085
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:12,719
how how does suffering relate to any of

2086
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:14,238
that

2087
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,480
you know the higher level suffering that

2088
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:19,759
humans do

2089
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:21,119
basically pain is a reinforcement signal

2090
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,360
it pain

2091
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:25,439
is a signal that one part of your brain

2092
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:27,839
sends to another part of your brain or

2093
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,839
an abstract sense part of your mind

2094
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,920
sends to another part of the mind to

2095
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,960
regulate its behavior to tell it the

2096
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,880
behavior that you're currently

2097
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,039
exhibiting should be improved

2098
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,000
and this is the signal that i tell you

2099
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:39,840
uh

2100
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,760
to move away from what you're currently

2101
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,640
doing and push into a different

2102
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,640
direction so pain gives you a

2103
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,840
part of you an impulse to do something

2104
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,239
differently

2105
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,239
but sometimes this doesn't work because

2106
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:54,799
for the training part of your brain is

2107
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:56,079
talking to the wrong region or because

2108
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,520
it has the wrong model of the

2109
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:58,719
relationships in the world maybe you're

2110
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,800
mismodeling yourself or you're

2111
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,239
mismodding the relationship of yourself

2112
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,000
to the world or you're mismodeling the

2113
01:12:02,238 --> 01:12:05,678
dynamics of the world so you're trying

2114
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,158
to improve something that cannot be

2115
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:10,319
improved by generating more pain but the

2116
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:12,559
system doesn't have any alternative

2117
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:14,158
so the uh it doesn't get better what do

2118
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,920
you do if something doesn't get better

2119
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:18,000
and you want it to get better you

2120
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,760
increase the strength of the signal and

2121
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,760
then the signal becomes chronic when it

2122
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:24,239
becomes permanent without a change

2123
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:26,640
inside this is what we call suffering

2124
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:28,559
and the purpose of consciousness is to

2125
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,239
deal with contradictions with things

2126
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,159
that cannot be resolved

2127
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:34,959
the purpose of consciousness i think is

2128
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:37,119
similar to a conductor in an orchestra

2129
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,800
when everything works well the orchestra

2130
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,039
doesn't need much of a conductor as long

2131
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,880
as it's coherent but when there is a

2132
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:45,039
lack of coherence or something is

2133
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:47,440
consistently producing disharmony and

2134
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:50,000
mismatches then the conductor becomes

2135
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:51,439
alert and interacts with it so suffering

2136
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,560
attracts the activity of our

2137
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:54,879
consciousness

2138
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:57,199
and the purpose of that is ideally that

2139
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,640
we bring new layers online new layers of

2140
01:12:57,198 --> 01:13:01,198
modeling that

2141
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:04,400
are able to create a model of the

2142
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:06,799
dysregulation so we can deal with it

2143
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:08,479
and this means that we typically get

2144
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:10,079
higher level consciousness so to speak

2145
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:11,919
right we get some consciousness above

2146
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:13,679
our pay grade maybe if we have some

2147
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,760
suffering early in our life most of the

2148
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:18,399
interesting people had trauma early on

2149
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:21,280
in their childhood and trauma means that

2150
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:23,439
you are suffering an injury for which

2151
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:24,880
the system is not prepared which it

2152
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:27,839
cannot deal with which it cannot

2153
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,440
insulate itself from so something breaks

2154
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,640
and this means that the behavior of the

2155
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:34,799
system is permanently

2156
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,560
disturbed in the way that

2157
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,560
some mismatch exists now in the

2158
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,640
regulation that just by following your

2159
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,320
impulses by following the pain in the

2160
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,320
direction which it hurts the situation

2161
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:46,158
doesn't improve but get worse

2162
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,279
and so what needs to happen is that you

2163
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:49,198
grow up

2164
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:51,759
yeah that and that's part that has grown

2165
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:53,759
up is able to deal with the part that is

2166
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,400
stuck in this earlier phase yeah so it

2167
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:59,119
leads to growth adding extra layers to

2168
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:00,719
okay to your cognition uh

2169
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:03,039
let me ask you then because i got to

2170
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,359
stick on suffering uh the ethics of the

2171
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:07,279
whole thing

2172
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:10,079
so not our consciousness but the

2173
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:13,279
consciousness of others you've uh

2174
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:16,238
uh tweeted one of my biggest fears

2175
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:17,920
is that insects could be conscious the

2176
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:20,238
amount of suffering on earth would be

2177
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,920
unthinkable

2178
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:25,678
so

2179
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,840
when we think of other conscious beings

2180
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,158
is

2181
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:32,560
suffering a property of consciousness

2182
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:34,799
that we're most concerned about

2183
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,800
so

2184
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:42,319
i'm still thinking about robots

2185
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:44,479
how to make sense of other non-human

2186
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:46,479
things

2187
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:50,559
that appear to have

2188
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:52,158
the depth of experience that humans have

2189
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,199
and to me

2190
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:57,279
that means consciousness and the darkest

2191
01:14:55,198 --> 01:15:00,158
side of that which is suffering

2192
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:02,319
the capacity to suffer

2193
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:04,079
and so i start thinking

2194
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:06,639
how much responsibility do we have for

2195
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:08,559
those other conscious beings

2196
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,880
that's where the um

2197
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,760
the definition of consciousness

2198
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,039
becomes most urgent like having to come

2199
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,880
up with a definition of consciousness

2200
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:18,479
becomes most urgent

2201
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,560
is

2202
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:23,559
who should we and should we not be

2203
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,560
torturing

2204
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,039
there's no general answer to this was

2205
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:31,839
genghis khan doing anything wrong

2206
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:33,198
it depends right on how you look at it

2207
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,239
well he

2208
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:38,960
he drew he drew a line somewhere

2209
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:40,799
where this is us and that's them it's

2210
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,800
the circle of empathy

2211
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,920
it's like these

2212
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,079
we don't have to use the word

2213
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,880
consciousness but

2214
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:50,719
these are the things that matter to me

2215
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,880
if they suffer or not and these are the

2216
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:55,679
things that don't matter yeah but when

2217
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,920
one of his commanders failed him he uh

2218
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:00,640
broke his spine and let him die

2219
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:02,480
in a horrible way and uh so

2220
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,760
in some sense i think he was indifferent

2221
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:05,678
to suffering

2222
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,880
or he was not different in the sense

2223
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,719
that he didn't

2224
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,319
see it as useful if he inflicted

2225
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:13,119
suffering

2226
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:15,359
but he did not see it as something that

2227
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:18,719
had to be avoided that was not the goal

2228
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:20,559
the question was how can i use suffering

2229
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:23,840
and the infliction of suffering to reach

2230
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,840
my goals from his perspective

2231
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,239
i i see so like different societies

2232
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,840
throughout history put different value

2233
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:31,519
on

2234
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,520
different individuals different psyches

2235
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,400
but also even the uh the objective of

2236
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,440
avoiding suffering like some society is

2237
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:38,960
probably

2238
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:40,719
i mean this is where like religious

2239
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:43,679
belief really helps

2240
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:45,520
that that afterlife

2241
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:48,480
that doesn't matter that you suffer or

2242
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,280
die what matters is you suffer honorably

2243
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:52,158
right

2244
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:53,840
so that you enter the afterlife

2245
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:55,599
it seems to be superstitious to me

2246
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:58,560
basically beliefs that

2247
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:00,000
assert things uh for which no evidence

2248
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,159
exists

2249
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,600
are incompatible with sound epistemology

2250
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:05,439
and i don't think that religion has to

2251
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,120
be superstitious otherwise it should be

2252
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:08,719
condemned okay in all cases you're

2253
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:11,198
somebody who's saying we live in a dream

2254
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:13,359
world we have zero evidence for anything

2255
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:15,198
so that's not the case

2256
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:17,439
there are limits to what languages can

2257
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:19,919
be constructed mathematics brings solid

2258
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,639
evidence for its own structure and once

2259
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,119
we

2260
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,640
have some idea of what languages exist

2261
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:26,719
and how a system can learn and what

2262
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,039
learning itself is in the first place

2263
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:31,840
and so on we can

2264
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:33,760
begin to realize that our intuitions

2265
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,679
that we are able to learn about the

2266
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:37,520
regularities of the world and minimize

2267
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:39,679
the appraisal and understand the nature

2268
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,719
of our own agency to some degree of

2269
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:44,960
abstraction that's not an illusion so

2270
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:47,198
useful approximation just because we

2271
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:48,880
live in a dream world doesn't mean

2272
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:50,479
mathematics can't

2273
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,960
uh give us a

2274
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:55,198
consistent glimpse of

2275
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,198
uh physical of objective reality we can

2276
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:58,960
basically distinguish useful encodings

2277
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:00,639
from useless encodings

2278
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:03,520
and when we

2279
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,679
apply our truth seeking to the world we

2280
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,360
know we usually cannot find out whether

2281
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:09,520
a certain thing is true

2282
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:11,039
what we typically do is we take the

2283
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,800
state vector of the universe separate it

2284
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:15,039
into separate objects that interact with

2285
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,320
each other so interfaces and this

2286
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:19,760
distinction that we are making is not

2287
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:21,599
completely arbitrary it's done to

2288
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,520
optimize the compression that we can

2289
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,920
apply to our models of the universe so

2290
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:28,080
we can predict what's happening with our

2291
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:30,640
limited resources in this sense is not

2292
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:32,719
arbitrary but the separation of the

2293
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,960
world into objects that are somehow

2294
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:36,960
discrete and interacting with each other

2295
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,960
is not the true reality right the

2296
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,039
boundaries between the objects are

2297
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:43,279
projected into the world not arbitrarily

2298
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:44,800
projected but still it's only an

2299
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:46,399
approximation of what's actually the

2300
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,239
case

2301
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:50,158
and we sometimes notice that we run into

2302
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:52,559
contradictions when we try to understand

2303
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,799
high-level things like economic aspects

2304
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:57,039
of the world and so on or political

2305
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,960
aspects or psychological aspects where

2306
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:00,719
we make simplifications and the objects

2307
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:02,158
that we are using to separate the world

2308
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,480
are just one of many possible

2309
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:06,799
projections of what's going on

2310
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:08,238
and so it's not in this postmodernist

2311
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,239
sense completely arbitrary and you're

2312
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:11,678
free to pick what you want or dismiss

2313
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:13,839
what you don't like because it's all

2314
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:16,399
stories no that's not true you have to

2315
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,079
show for every model of how well it

2316
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:19,839
predicts the world so the confidence

2317
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:22,000
that you should have in the entities of

2318
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:24,319
your models should correspond to the

2319
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,960
evidence that you have

2320
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:30,238
can i ask you in a small tangent

2321
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,359
uh to talk about your um

2322
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:34,079
favorite

2323
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:37,079
set of ideas and people which is post

2324
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:37,079
modernism

2325
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:42,559
what is what is post-modernism how would

2326
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,600
you define it and

2327
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,880
why

2328
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:49,120
to you is it not a useful framework of

2329
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:51,359
thought

2330
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,960
uh post-modernism is something that i'm

2331
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:56,719
really not an expert on

2332
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:58,560
and uh post-modernism is a a set of

2333
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:01,359
philosophical ideas that it's difficult

2334
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,239
to lamp together

2335
01:20:01,359 --> 01:20:04,639
that

2336
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:06,238
is characterized by some useful thinkers

2337
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,480
some of them post structuralist and so

2338
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:10,718
on and i'm mostly not interested in it

2339
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:13,039
because i i think that it's not leading

2340
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:15,920
me anywhere that i find particularly

2341
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:18,560
useful it's mostly i think born out of

2342
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:20,880
the inside that the ontologies that we

2343
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,719
impose on the world are not literally

2344
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,239
true and that we can often get to a

2345
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:26,319
different interpretation by the world by

2346
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:27,839
using a different ontology that is

2347
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:29,759
different separation of the world into

2348
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,480
interacting objects

2349
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,920
but the idea that this makes the world a

2350
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,238
set of stories

2351
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:39,039
that are arbitrary i think is wrong

2352
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:42,000
and the people that are engaging in this

2353
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:43,359
type of philosophy are working in in an

2354
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,198
area that i largely don't find

2355
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:47,599
productive there's nothing useful coming

2356
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:49,359
out of this so this idea that truth is

2357
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,000
relative is not something that has in

2358
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:53,599
some sense informed physics or theory of

2359
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,319
relativity and there is no feedback

2360
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:59,120
between those there is no meaningful

2361
01:20:56,319 --> 01:21:01,039
influence of this type of philosophy on

2362
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:03,279
the sciences or in engineering or in

2363
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:04,880
politics but there is a very strong

2364
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:06,238
information on

2365
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,760
of this on

2366
01:21:06,238 --> 01:21:09,839
ideology

2367
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:13,280
because it basically has become an

2368
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:15,119
ideology that is justifying itself by

2369
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:16,319
the notion that truth is a relative

2370
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:18,479
concept

2371
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:20,639
and it's not being used in such a way

2372
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:22,638
that the the philosophers that or

2373
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:25,199
sociologists that take up these ideas

2374
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:26,800
say oh uh i should doubt my own ideas

2375
01:21:25,198 --> 01:21:28,559
because maybe my separation of the world

2376
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,320
into objects is not completely valid and

2377
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,440
they should maybe use a different one

2378
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:35,439
and be open to a pluralism of ideas

2379
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:37,198
but it's mostly exists to dismiss the

2380
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:39,279
ideas of other people

2381
01:21:37,198 --> 01:21:41,119
it becomes yeah it becomes a political

2382
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:43,840
weapon of sorts

2383
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:46,880
to achieve power basically this uh

2384
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:49,440
there's nothing wrong i think with uh

2385
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:52,480
developing a philosophy around this but

2386
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:54,158
to develop norms around the idea that

2387
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:56,799
truth is something that is completely

2388
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:58,399
negotiable is incompatible with the

2389
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:01,199
scientific project

2390
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:03,759
and i think if the uh if the academia

2391
01:22:01,198 --> 01:22:05,359
has no defense against the ideological

2392
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,960
parts of

2393
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:10,399
the postmodernist movement it's doomed

2394
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,639
right you have to acknowledge

2395
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:13,679
the ideological part of any movement

2396
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:15,679
actually

2397
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,840
uh including post-modernism well the

2398
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:19,920
question is what an ideology is and to

2399
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:22,079
me an ideology is basically a viral

2400
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,319
memplex that is

2401
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:26,000
changing your mind in such a way that

2402
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:27,519
reality gets warped

2403
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,039
it gets warped in such a way that you're

2404
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:30,960
being cut off from the rest of human

2405
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:33,519
thought space and you cannot consider

2406
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,600
things outside of the range of ideas of

2407
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,199
your own ideology it was as possibly

2408
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,880
true right so i mean there's certain

2409
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:40,399
properties to an ideology that make it

2410
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,400
harmful one of them is that like

2411
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:44,158
dogmatism

2412
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:46,719
of just certainty

2413
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:48,960
dogged certainty in in that you're right

2414
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,639
you have the truth and nobody else but

2415
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,960
what is creating the certainty it's very

2416
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:54,880
interesting to look at the type of model

2417
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:57,198
that is being produced is it basically

2418
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,279
just to draw a strong prior and you tell

2419
01:22:57,198 --> 01:23:00,960
people oh this idea that you consider to

2420
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:02,559
be very true the evidence for this is

2421
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,480
actually just much weaker than you

2422
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,560
thought and look here at some studies no

2423
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:08,399
this is not how it works it's usually

2424
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,679
normative which means

2425
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:14,079
some thoughts are unthinkable because

2426
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:17,119
they would change your identity into

2427
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:19,279
something that is no longer acceptable

2428
01:23:17,119 --> 01:23:21,840
and this cuts you off from considering

2429
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:24,000
an alternative and many uh de facto

2430
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,920
religions use this trick to lock people

2431
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,679
into a certain mode of thought this

2432
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,000
removes agency over your own thoughts

2433
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:33,039
it's very ugly to me it's basically not

2434
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,560
just a process of domestication but it's

2435
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:36,880
actually an intellectual

2436
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,440
castration that happens it's an

2437
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:42,639
inability to think creatively and to

2438
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:42,638
bring forth new thoughts

2439
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:48,479
can i ask you about

2440
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,679
substances chemical substances that

2441
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:53,119
affect the video game

2442
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,119
the dream world

2443
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:57,119
so psychedelics

2444
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:59,119
that increasingly have been getting a

2445
01:23:57,119 --> 01:24:00,880
lot of research done on them so in

2446
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:03,359
general psychedelics

2447
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,560
psilocybin mdma but also really

2448
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:07,599
interesting one

2449
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:10,080
the big one which is dmt

2450
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,159
what and where are the places that these

2451
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:13,439
substances take

2452
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:16,559
the mind

2453
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:17,919
that is operating in the dream world

2454
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,719
do you have an interesting sense how

2455
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,239
this

2456
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,158
throws a wrinkle

2457
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:24,799
into the prediction model

2458
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:25,839
is it just some weird little quirk or is

2459
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,840
there

2460
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:31,480
is there some fundamental expansion of

2461
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,480
the mind going on

2462
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,360
i suspect that a way to look at

2463
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,198
psychedelics is that they induce

2464
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:38,479
particular types of lucid dreaming

2465
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:40,319
states

2466
01:24:38,479 --> 01:24:42,718
so it's a state in which

2467
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:44,479
certain connections are being

2468
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:47,600
severed in your mind when no longer

2469
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:49,198
active your mind basically gets free to

2470
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,960
move in a certain direction because some

2471
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:52,638
inhibition some particular inhibition

2472
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,639
doesn't work anymore

2473
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:57,039
and as a result you might stop having

2474
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:59,039
yourself or you might

2475
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:00,800
stop perceiving the world as

2476
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:02,000
three-dimensional

2477
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:04,400
and

2478
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,800
you can explore that state

2479
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:08,319
and i suppose that for every state that

2480
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,679
can be induced with psychedelics there

2481
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:10,960
are people that are naturally in that

2482
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,679
state

2483
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:13,279
so

2484
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:14,960
sometimes psychedelics that shift you

2485
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:17,119
through a range of possible mental

2486
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,800
states and they can also shift you out

2487
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:20,319
of the range of permissible mental

2488
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,560
states that is where you can make

2489
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:25,198
predictive models of reality

2490
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,480
and what i observe in people that use

2491
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:28,079
psychedelics

2492
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:29,519
a lot is that they tend to be over

2493
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:33,039
fitting

2494
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,040
overfitting means that you are

2495
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:38,000
using more bits for modeling the

2496
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:40,559
dynamics of a function than you should

2497
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,719
and so you can fit your curve to

2498
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:44,400
extremely detailed things in the past

2499
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,079
but this model is no longer predictive

2500
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:47,519
for the future

2501
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:49,519
what is it about psychedelics that

2502
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,120
forces that

2503
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,239
i thought it would be the opposite i

2504
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:55,279
thought i thought

2505
01:25:52,238 --> 01:25:56,959
uh that it's a it's a good mechanism for

2506
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:59,279
uh

2507
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:01,439
uh for generalization for regularization

2508
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:03,359
so it feels like

2509
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:05,599
psychedelics expansion of the mind like

2510
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:07,359
taking you outside of like forcing your

2511
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:11,199
model to be

2512
01:26:07,359 --> 01:26:12,319
uh non-predictive is a good thing

2513
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:15,279
meaning like

2514
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:16,880
uh it's almost like okay what i would uh

2515
01:26:15,279 --> 01:26:18,559
say psychedelics are akin to is

2516
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,760
traveling to a totally different

2517
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,600
environment

2518
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,039
like going if you've never been to like

2519
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,239
india or something like that from the

2520
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:25,760
united states

2521
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:28,879
very different set of people different

2522
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,679
culture different food different roads

2523
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,440
and

2524
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:33,440
values and all those kinds of things

2525
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:35,439
yeah so psychedelics can for instance

2526
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:38,000
teleport people into

2527
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:40,559
a universe that is uh hyperbolic which

2528
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,198
means that if you imagine a room that

2529
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:44,639
you are in you can turn around 360

2530
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,799
degrees and you didn't go full circle

2531
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:49,520
you need to go 720 degrees to go full

2532
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:51,600
circle exactly so the things that people

2533
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,360
learn in that state cannot be easily

2534
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,159
transferred in this universe that we are

2535
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:55,839
in

2536
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:57,679
it could be that if they're able to

2537
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:00,239
abstract and understand what happened to

2538
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:02,158
them that they understand that some part

2539
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:04,559
of their spatial cognition

2540
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:05,920
has been desynchronized and has found a

2541
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,440
different synchronization and this

2542
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:09,279
different synchronization happens to be

2543
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:10,879
a hyperbolic one right so you learn

2544
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:12,158
something interesting about your brain

2545
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,079
it's difficult to understand what

2546
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:16,000
exactly happened but we get a pretty

2547
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:18,000
good idea once we understand how the

2548
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,399
brain is representing geometry yeah but

2549
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,439
doesn't give you a fresh perspective on

2550
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:23,439
the physical reality

2551
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,880
who's making that sound

2552
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:32,800
is inside my head or is it external

2553
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:36,239
well there is no sound outside of your

2554
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:39,360
mind but uh it's making sense

2555
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:41,359
often on my nine physics

2556
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:44,559
uh yeah in the physical reality there's

2557
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:44,559
uh there's sound waves

2558
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,719
traveling through air okay

2559
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:51,119
that's our model of what happened

2560
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:53,520
tomorrow what happened right

2561
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:56,000
uh

2562
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:58,000
that doesn't uh don't psychedelics give

2563
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,960
you a fresh perspective on this physical

2564
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:04,810
reality like uh not this physical

2565
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:06,158
reality but this this more um

2566
01:28:04,810 --> 01:28:08,320
[Applause]

2567
01:28:06,158 --> 01:28:10,319
what do you call the dream world

2568
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:12,238
that's mapped directly to purpose of

2569
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:14,960
dreaming at night i think is yeah

2570
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:16,799
theater augmentation well exactly so

2571
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:19,439
that's very different that's a very

2572
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,520
similar just change parameters uh about

2573
01:28:19,439 --> 01:28:24,000
the things that you have learned

2574
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,440
and uh for instance when you are young

2575
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,520
you have seen things from certain

2576
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:29,678
perspectives but not from others so your

2577
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,679
brain is generating new perspectives of

2578
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:33,760
objects that you already know which

2579
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:35,359
means they can learn to recognize them

2580
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,600
later from different perspectives and i

2581
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:39,119
suspect that's the reason why many of us

2582
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,639
remember to have flying dreams as

2583
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:41,840
children because it's just different

2584
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:44,560
perspectives of the world that we

2585
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:46,079
already know and that it it starts to

2586
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,239
generate these

2587
01:28:46,079 --> 01:28:50,158
different perspective changes and then

2588
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:52,000
it fluidly turns this into a flying

2589
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:53,599
dream to make sense of what's happening

2590
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,760
right so you fill in the gaps and

2591
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,560
suddenly you see yourself flying

2592
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:58,239
and

2593
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,920
similar things can happen with semantic

2594
01:28:58,238 --> 01:29:02,079
relationships so it's not just spatial

2595
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,600
relationships but it can also be the

2596
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:05,119
relationships between ideas that are

2597
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,960
being changed

2598
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:09,439
and it seems that the mechanisms that

2599
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:12,880
make that happen during dreaming

2600
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:14,158
um are interacting with these same

2601
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,679
receptors

2602
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:17,198
that are being stimulated by

2603
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:19,679
psychedelics

2604
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:21,919
so uh i suspect that there is a thing

2605
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:23,760
that i haven't read really about

2606
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:26,319
the way in which dreams are induced in

2607
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,400
the brain it's not just that the

2608
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:30,158
activity of the brain gets tuned down

2609
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:32,000
because you are somehow your eyes are

2610
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:35,119
closed and you no longer get enough data

2611
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,600
from your eyes but there is a particular

2612
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:39,599
type of neurotransmitter that is

2613
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,440
saturating your brain during these

2614
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,880
phases during the rm phases and you

2615
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:44,638
produce

2616
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:47,119
controlled hallucinations

2617
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:48,560
and psychedelics are linking into these

2618
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:49,760
mechanisms

2619
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,039
i suspect

2620
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,800
so there's an

2621
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:55,039
another trickier form of data

2622
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,760
augmentation yes

2623
01:29:55,039 --> 01:29:59,679
but uh it's also data augmentation that

2624
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,440
can happen outside of the specification

2625
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:03,520
that your brain is tuned to so basically

2626
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:04,319
people are overclocking their brains and

2627
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,639
that

2628
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:09,198
that produces states that are

2629
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:11,840
subjectively extremely interesting

2630
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:13,599
yeah i just but from the outset very

2631
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,520
suspicious so

2632
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,920
i think i'm over applying the metaphor

2633
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:19,520
of a neural network in my own mind

2634
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,960
which

2635
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:24,400
i just think that doesn't lead to

2636
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:26,000
overfitting right but

2637
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:27,679
but you were just sort of anecdotally

2638
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,679
saying my experiences with people that

2639
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:31,440
have no psychedelics or that that kind

2640
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:33,520
of quality i think it typically happens

2641
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:34,399
so if you look at people like uh timothy

2642
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,639
leary

2643
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:37,679
and he has written beautiful manifestos

2644
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:40,880
about

2645
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:42,719
the effect of lsd on people he genuinely

2646
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:44,960
believed he writes in these manifestos

2647
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:46,480
that in the future science and art will

2648
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,158
only be done on psychedelics because

2649
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:50,399
it's so much more efficient and so much

2650
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:52,879
better and he gave

2651
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:55,039
lsd to children in this community of a

2652
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,359
few thousand people that he had near san

2653
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:59,519
francisco and

2654
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:01,599
basically he was losing touch

2655
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,440
with reality he did not understand the

2656
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,760
effects that the things that he was

2657
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:08,479
doing would have on the reception of

2658
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:10,239
psychedelics by society because he was

2659
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:11,678
unable to think critically about what

2660
01:31:10,238 --> 01:31:14,559
happened what happened was that he got

2661
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:16,639
in an euphoric state that euphoric state

2662
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:19,600
happened because he was overfitting he

2663
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:22,000
was taking this sense of euphoria and

2664
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,000
translating it into a model of actual

2665
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,439
success in the world right he was

2666
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,840
feeling better

2667
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:30,000
limitations had disappeared that he exp

2668
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,279
appearance to be existing but he didn't

2669
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,760
get superpowers i understand what you

2670
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:35,679
mean by overfitting now

2671
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,239
there's a lot of interpretation to the

2672
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:40,560
term overfitting in this case but i i

2673
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:42,799
got you so he was getting

2674
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:44,719
he was getting uh positive rewards from

2675
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,159
a lot of actions this year but not just

2676
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:48,800
this so if you take for instance john

2677
01:31:46,158 --> 01:31:52,079
lilly who um was studying dolphin

2678
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:53,679
languages and aliens and so on yeah a

2679
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:55,840
lot of people that use psychedelics

2680
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:58,560
became very loopy

2681
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:00,079
and the typical thing that you notice

2682
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,760
when people are in psychedelics is that

2683
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:03,600
they are in a state where they feel that

2684
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,360
everything can be explained now

2685
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:08,560
everything is clear everything is

2686
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:10,880
obvious yeah and uh sometimes they have

2687
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,719
indeed discovered a useful connection

2688
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:15,520
but not always very often these

2689
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,800
connections are over interpretations i

2690
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,880
wonder

2691
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,039
you know there's a question of uh

2692
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,400
correlation versus causation

2693
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:25,439
and also i wonder if it's the

2694
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:28,238
psychedelics or if it's more the social

2695
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:30,479
like being the outsider

2696
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:32,319
uh and having a strong community

2697
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:34,479
of outside and being having a leadership

2698
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:36,559
position in an outside occult-like

2699
01:32:34,479 --> 01:32:38,559
community that could have a much

2700
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:40,320
stronger effect of overfitting than do

2701
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,520
psychedelics themselves the actual

2702
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:43,599
substances

2703
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,280
because it's a counter culture thing so

2704
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,440
it could be that as opposed to the

2705
01:32:45,279 --> 01:32:50,158
actual substance if you're a boring

2706
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:52,158
person who wears a suit and tie and

2707
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:53,599
works at a bank

2708
01:32:52,158 --> 01:32:56,559
and takes psychedelics that could be a

2709
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:59,120
very different effect of psychedelics on

2710
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:01,440
on your mind it i'm just sort of raising

2711
01:32:59,119 --> 01:33:03,920
the point that the people you referenced

2712
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:05,678
are already weirdos i'm not sure exactly

2713
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:08,000
oh no not necessarily a lot of the

2714
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:10,880
people that uh tell me that they use

2715
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,439
psychedelics in a useful way

2716
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,960
started out as squares and were

2717
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:15,919
liberating themselves because they were

2718
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,439
stuck

2719
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,279
they were basically stuck in local

2720
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:21,519
optimum of their own self model of their

2721
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:23,279
relationship to the world and suddenly

2722
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:25,760
they had data augmentation they

2723
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:27,599
basically saw as an experience the space

2724
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,440
of possibilities they experienced what

2725
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,360
it would be like to be another person

2726
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:33,119
yeah and they took uh

2727
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:36,279
important lessons from that experience

2728
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:36,279
back home

2729
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:40,880
yeah i mean uh i love the the the

2730
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:42,560
metaphor of data augmentation because

2731
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:45,119
that's uh

2732
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:47,280
been the the primary driver of

2733
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:49,279
self-supervised learning in the vision

2734
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:52,319
computer vision domain is data

2735
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:55,119
augmentation so it's funny to think of

2736
01:33:52,319 --> 01:33:56,399
data augment like like chemically

2737
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:59,119
induced

2738
01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:00,879
data augmentation in the human mind

2739
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:02,479
there's also a very interesting effect

2740
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:05,600
that i uh

2741
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:08,079
noticed i've i know uh several people

2742
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:11,600
who are sphere to me that

2743
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:13,039
lsd has cured their migraines so

2744
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:15,440
severe cluster eight headaches or

2745
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:18,079
migraines that didn't respond to

2746
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:19,759
standard medication that disappeared

2747
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:22,158
after a single dose and i don't

2748
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:24,639
recommend anybody doing this especially

2749
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:26,559
not in the us where it's illegal uh and

2750
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:29,039
there are no studies on this for that

2751
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:32,960
reason but uh it seems that uh

2752
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:34,719
anecdotally that it basically can reset

2753
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,399
the serotonergic system so it's

2754
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,000
basically

2755
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:40,319
pushing them outside of their normal

2756
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,319
boundaries and as a result it needs to

2757
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:44,559
find a new equilibrium and in some

2758
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:46,158
people that equilibrium is better but it

2759
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,800
also follows that in other people it

2760
01:34:46,158 --> 01:34:50,960
might be worse so if you have a brain

2761
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:52,800
that is already teetering on the

2762
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,639
boundary to psychosis

2763
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,480
it can be permanently pushed over that

2764
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:57,840
boundary well that's why you have to do

2765
01:34:56,479 --> 01:34:59,599
good science which they're starting to

2766
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,800
do on all these different substances of

2767
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,039
how well it actually works for the

2768
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,560
different conditions like mdma seems to

2769
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:06,880
help with ptsd

2770
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:08,560
uh same with psilocybin

2771
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:10,719
that you know you need to do good

2772
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,960
science meaning large studies of large

2773
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:16,319
and yeah so based on the existing

2774
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:18,158
studies with mdma it seems that

2775
01:35:16,319 --> 01:35:19,840
if you look at rick doblin's work and

2776
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:21,279
what he has published about this and

2777
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,119
talks about

2778
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:24,960
mdma seems to be a psychologically

2779
01:35:23,118 --> 01:35:28,000
relatively safe drug but it's

2780
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:30,560
physiologically not very safe that is uh

2781
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,439
there is a neurotoxicity if you would

2782
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:35,520
use two large dose and if you uh combine

2783
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:37,759
this with alcohol which a lot of kids do

2784
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:40,719
in uh party settings during raves and so

2785
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:43,360
on it's very hepatotoxic so basically

2786
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:44,960
you can kill your liver and this means

2787
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:46,960
that it's probably something that is

2788
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,319
best and most productively used in

2789
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,679
clinical setting

2790
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:52,479
by people who really know what they're

2791
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:54,480
doing and i suspect that's also true for

2792
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:56,158
the other psychedelics that is

2793
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:59,439
uh while the other second eggs are

2794
01:35:56,158 --> 01:36:01,759
probably not as toxic as say alcohol

2795
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:03,439
the effects on niseki can be much more

2796
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:06,320
profound and lasting

2797
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:09,039
yeah well as far as i know psilocybin so

2798
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:10,960
mushrooms magic mushrooms

2799
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:13,600
as far as i know in terms of the studies

2800
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,279
they're running i think have no over

2801
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:17,920
like they're allowed to do what they're

2802
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:19,439
calling heroic doses so that one does

2803
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,600
not have a toxicity so they could do

2804
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:23,439
like huge doses in a clinical setting

2805
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,119
when they're doing study on psilocybin

2806
01:36:23,439 --> 01:36:26,399
which is kind of fun

2807
01:36:25,118 --> 01:36:28,158
yeah it seems that most of the

2808
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:29,198
psychedelics work in extremely small

2809
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:31,599
doses

2810
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:34,719
which means that the effect on the rest

2811
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:36,880
of the body is relatively low and mdma

2812
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:38,319
is probably the exception maybe ketamine

2813
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,520
can be dangerous and larger doses

2814
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:42,158
because it can

2815
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,960
depress breathing and so on but

2816
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:45,279
the

2817
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,960
lsd and psilocybin work in very very

2818
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:47,759
small doses at least the active part of

2819
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:50,560
them

2820
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,760
of um lsd is only the active part

2821
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:56,080
and the but the effect that you it can

2822
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,840
have on your mental wiring can be very

2823
01:36:56,079 --> 01:37:00,559
dangerous i think

2824
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,079
let's talk about ai a little bit

2825
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,400
what are your thoughts

2826
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:06,000
about gpt3 and

2827
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:09,039
language models trained with

2828
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,039
self-supervised learning

2829
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:14,560
it came out quite a bit ago but i wanted

2830
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,079
to get your thoughts on it yeah

2831
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:21,039
in the 90s i was in new zealand and

2832
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:24,079
i had an amazing professor ian witton

2833
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:26,000
who realized there was ward in class and

2834
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:28,719
put me in his lab and he gave me the

2835
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,359
task to discover grammatical structure

2836
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:33,039
in an unknown language

2837
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:34,799
and the unknown language that i picked

2838
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:37,920
was english because it was the easiest

2839
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:40,719
one to find corpus four construct one

2840
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:42,319
and he gave me the largest computer at

2841
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:44,319
the whole university it had two

2842
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:45,759
gigabytes of ram which was amazing and i

2843
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:47,679
wrote everything in c with some

2844
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,280
in-memory compression to do statistics

2845
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:50,560
over the language

2846
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:51,920
and

2847
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,840
first would

2848
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:56,158
create a dictionary of all the words

2849
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,920
which basically tokenizes everything and

2850
01:37:56,158 --> 01:38:00,638
compresses things so they don't need to

2851
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:04,158
store the whole world but just

2852
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:06,079
a code for every word and then i was um

2853
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:07,519
taking this all apart in sentences and i

2854
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:09,679
was trying to

2855
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:11,040
find all the relationships between all

2856
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:12,880
the words in the sentences and do

2857
01:38:11,039 --> 01:38:16,399
statistics over them

2858
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:18,239
and that proved to be impossible because

2859
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:20,319
the complexity is just too large so if

2860
01:38:18,238 --> 01:38:22,079
you want to discover the relationship

2861
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:23,920
between an article and a noun and there

2862
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:25,840
are three adjectives in between you

2863
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:28,079
cannot do engram statistics and look at

2864
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:29,679
all the possibilities that can exist at

2865
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:30,719
least not with the resources that we had

2866
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:32,560
back then

2867
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:34,158
so i realized i need to make some

2868
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,639
statistics over what i need to make

2869
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:38,559
statistics over so i wrote something

2870
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:41,359
that was pretty much a hack

2871
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:42,960
that did this for um at least first

2872
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:44,960
order relationships and i came up with

2873
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:47,439
some kind of mutual information graph

2874
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:49,039
that was indeed discovering uh something

2875
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:51,039
that looks exactly like the grammatical

2876
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:53,118
structure of the sentence just by trying

2877
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:54,880
to encode the sentence in such a way

2878
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:56,479
that the words would be written in the

2879
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:59,199
optimal order

2880
01:38:56,479 --> 01:39:01,839
inside of the model and

2881
01:38:59,198 --> 01:39:03,759
what i also found is that if we would be

2882
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,360
able to increase the resolution of that

2883
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,199
and

2884
01:39:05,359 --> 01:39:09,279
not just use this model to reproduce

2885
01:39:07,198 --> 01:39:11,039
grammatically correct sentences we would

2886
01:39:09,279 --> 01:39:13,039
also be able to correct stylistically

2887
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:15,279
correct sentences by just having more

2888
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:16,719
bits in these relationships and if we

2889
01:39:15,279 --> 01:39:18,639
wanted to have meaning we would have to

2890
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:20,239
go much higher order

2891
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:22,480
and i didn't know how to make higher

2892
01:39:20,238 --> 01:39:24,238
order models back then without spending

2893
01:39:22,479 --> 01:39:26,238
way more years in research on how to

2894
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:28,559
make the statistics over what we need to

2895
01:39:26,238 --> 01:39:29,279
make statistics over

2896
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,880
and

2897
01:39:29,279 --> 01:39:32,559
this thing that we cannot look at the

2898
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,319
relationships between all the bits in

2899
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,800
your input is being solved in different

2900
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:38,319
domains in different ways so in computer

2901
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,639
graphics the

2902
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:42,479
computer vision standard methods for

2903
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:44,639
many years now is convolutional neural

2904
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:46,479
networks convolutional neural networks

2905
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:48,319
are hierarchies of filters

2906
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:49,839
that exploit the fact that neighboring

2907
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:52,158
pixels in images are usually

2908
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,079
semantically related and distance pixels

2909
01:39:52,158 --> 01:39:55,359
and images are usually not semantically

2910
01:39:54,079 --> 01:39:57,600
related

2911
01:39:55,359 --> 01:39:58,960
so you can just by grouping the pixels

2912
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:01,039
that are next to each other

2913
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:02,719
hierarchically together reconstruct the

2914
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:04,880
shape of objects

2915
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:06,800
and this is an important prior that we

2916
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:09,118
built into these models so they can

2917
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:11,440
converge quickly but this doesn't work

2918
01:40:09,118 --> 01:40:14,079
in language for the reason that adjacent

2919
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:16,319
words are often but not always related

2920
01:40:14,079 --> 01:40:19,039
and distant words are sometimes related

2921
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:21,118
while the words in between are not

2922
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,560
right so how can you learn the topology

2923
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:24,880
of language

2924
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:27,679
and i think for for this reason that

2925
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:29,920
this difficulty existed the transformer

2926
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:31,520
was invented in

2927
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,719
natural language processing not in

2928
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:35,280
vision

2929
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:37,439
and what the transformer is doing it's a

2930
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:39,920
hierarchy of layers where every layer

2931
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:43,118
learns what to pay attention to in the

2932
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:46,158
given context in the previous layer

2933
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:48,639
so what to make the statistics over

2934
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:50,799
and the context is

2935
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:54,000
significantly larger than the adjacent

2936
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:56,480
word yes so the context that this um

2937
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:59,840
that gpt3 has been using the transformer

2938
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:02,079
itself is from 2017 and it's uh wasn't

2939
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:04,960
using that large of a context

2940
01:41:02,079 --> 01:41:07,118
openai has basically scaled up this idea

2941
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,480
as far as they could at the time and the

2942
01:41:07,118 --> 01:41:10,399
context is

2943
01:41:08,479 --> 01:41:13,279
about 2048

2944
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:15,599
symbols tokens in the language these

2945
01:41:13,279 --> 01:41:17,679
symbols are not characters but they take

2946
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:18,639
the words and project them into a vector

2947
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:19,679
space

2948
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,039
where

2949
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:23,118
words that are statistically

2950
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:24,960
co-occurring a lot are neighbors already

2951
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:26,479
so it's already a simplification of the

2952
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,560
problem a little bit

2953
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:31,039
and so every word is basically a set of

2954
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:33,280
coordinates in a high dimensional space

2955
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:35,519
and then they use some kind of trick to

2956
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:38,158
also encode the order of the words in a

2957
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:41,440
sentence or in the not just sentence but

2958
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:43,519
2048 tokens is about couple pages of

2959
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:45,439
text or two and a half pages of text

2960
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,679
and so they managed to do pretty

2961
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:49,039
exhaustive statistics over the potential

2962
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:50,960
relationships

2963
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:53,039
between two pages of text which is

2964
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,960
tremendous right i was just using a

2965
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:55,840
single sentence back then

2966
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:56,800
and

2967
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,000
i was

2968
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,000
only looking for first order

2969
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
relationships and there were really

2970
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,238
looking for much much higher level

2971
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,840
relationships and what they discover

2972
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:07,678
after they fed this with an enormous

2973
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:10,319
amount of treatment in their pretty much

2974
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:12,880
the written internet or a subset of it

2975
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:15,118
that had some quality but

2976
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:17,118
substantial portion of the common draw

2977
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:19,198
that uh they're not only able to

2978
01:42:17,118 --> 01:42:21,679
reproduce style but they're also able to

2979
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:24,319
reproduce some pretty detailed semantics

2980
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:26,239
like being able to um add three digit

2981
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:28,238
numbers and multiply two digit numbers

2982
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:30,158
or to translate between programming

2983
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:32,959
languages and things like that

2984
01:42:30,158 --> 01:42:36,960
so the results that gbt3 got i think

2985
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:38,800
were amazing by the way um

2986
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,480
i actually didn't check carefully it's

2987
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:42,000
funny you just mentioned

2988
01:42:40,479 --> 01:42:43,839
how you coupled semantics to the

2989
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,079
multiplication is it able to do some

2990
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:47,840
basic math on two uh uh two digit

2991
01:42:46,079 --> 01:42:49,679
numbers yes

2992
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:51,600
okay interesting i thought

2993
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:54,079
i thought there's a lot of

2994
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:56,079
failure cases yeah but basically it

2995
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:58,800
fails if you take larger digit numbers

2996
01:42:56,079 --> 01:43:00,880
so four digit numbers and so on uh makes

2997
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,960
carrying mistakes and so on and if you

2998
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,880
take large larger numbers you don't get

2999
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:05,760
useful results at all

3000
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,279
and

3001
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,360
this could be

3002
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:12,158
an issue of the training set

3003
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:14,399
down.net many examples of successful

3004
01:43:12,158 --> 01:43:16,719
long-form edition and standard uh human

3005
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:19,759
written text and humans aren't very good

3006
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:21,359
at doing three-digit numbers either yeah

3007
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:23,119
they're not you're not writing a lot

3008
01:43:21,359 --> 01:43:24,319
about it yeah and

3009
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:25,839
the other thing is that the loss

3010
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:27,759
function that is being used is only

3011
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:29,760
minimizing surprises so it's predicting

3012
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:31,920
what comes next in the typical text it's

3013
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:34,639
not trying to go for causal closure

3014
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:37,440
first as we do yeah

3015
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:39,520
and but the fact that that kind of

3016
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:42,158
prediction works

3017
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:44,080
to generate text that's semantically

3018
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:46,158
rich and consistent

3019
01:43:44,079 --> 01:43:48,639
is interesting yeah so yeah so it's

3020
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:50,879
amazing that it's able to uh

3021
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:52,400
generate symmetrically consistent text

3022
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:54,560
it's not consistent so the problem is

3023
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:57,039
that it loses coherence at some point

3024
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:59,840
but it's also i think not correct to say

3025
01:43:57,039 --> 01:44:02,238
that gptc3 is unable to deal with

3026
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:04,560
semantics at all because you ask it to

3027
01:44:02,238 --> 01:44:06,319
perform certain transformations in text

3028
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,960
and it performs this transformation and

3029
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:10,639
text and the kind of additions that it's

3030
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:13,198
able to perform are

3031
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:15,359
transformations and text right and

3032
01:44:13,198 --> 01:44:17,519
there are proper semantics involved you

3033
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:19,519
can also do more there was a paper that

3034
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:22,880
was generating

3035
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:24,080
lots and lots of mathematically correct

3036
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:26,319
text

3037
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:29,439
and was feeding this into a transformer

3038
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:32,079
and as a result it was able to learn how

3039
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:33,759
to do differentiation integration in

3040
01:44:32,079 --> 01:44:36,960
race that according to the authors

3041
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:36,960
mathematica could not

3042
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:40,639
to which some of the people in

3043
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:42,479
mathematica responded that uh they were

3044
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:44,159
not using the mathematica in the right

3045
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:46,399
way and so on i have not really followed

3046
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:48,799
the this resolution of this conflict

3047
01:44:46,399 --> 01:44:50,960
this this part as a small tangent i

3048
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:52,320
really don't like in machine learning

3049
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:54,079
papers which

3050
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:55,439
they often

3051
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:57,519
do um

3052
01:44:55,439 --> 01:44:59,678
anecdotal evidence they'll find like one

3053
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:01,840
example in some kind of specific use of

3054
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:04,158
mathematica and demonstrate look here's

3055
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:06,319
they'll show successes and failures but

3056
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:08,719
they won't have a very clear

3057
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:10,399
representation of how many cases this

3058
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:12,560
actually represents yes but i think as a

3059
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:17,279
first paper this is a pretty good start

3060
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:19,360
and yeah so uh the whole message is that

3061
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:20,800
the authors could get better results

3062
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:23,039
from this in their

3063
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,480
experiments than they could get from the

3064
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:27,600
vein which they were using computer

3065
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:30,479
ultra systems which means uh that was

3066
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:32,400
not nothing yeah and uh it's able to

3067
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:35,599
perform substantially better uh than

3068
01:45:32,399 --> 01:45:37,839
gptsv can based on a much larger amount

3069
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,840
of training data using the same

3070
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:40,800
underlying algorithm well let me let me

3071
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,880
ask

3072
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:46,719
again so i'm using your tweets as if

3073
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:46,719
this is like plato right

3074
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,639
as if this is

3075
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:51,439
well thought out novels that you've

3076
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:55,199
written

3077
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:56,960
uh you tweeted gpt4 is listening to us

3078
01:45:55,198 --> 01:45:58,638
now

3079
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,800
um

3080
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:03,039
this is one way of asking what are the

3081
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:05,520
limitations of gpt-3

3082
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:09,439
when it scales so what do you think will

3083
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:11,199
be the capabilities of gpt-4 gpt-5 and

3084
01:46:09,439 --> 01:46:13,599
so on what are the limits of this

3085
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:15,359
approach so uh obviously when we are

3086
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,960
writing things right now uh everything

3087
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:19,039
that we are writing now is going to be

3088
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:21,039
training data for the next generation of

3089
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:24,158
machine learning models so yes of course

3090
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:25,679
tbt4 is listening to us and i think the

3091
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:28,799
tweet is already a little bit older and

3092
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:30,960
the we now have wu dao and we have a

3093
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:33,679
number of other systems that basically

3094
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:36,000
are placeholders for gpt4 don't know

3095
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:37,600
what open ais plans are in the card i

3096
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:41,118
read that tweet

3097
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:42,719
in several ways so one is obviously

3098
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:44,639
everything you put on the internet is

3099
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:45,520
used as training data

3100
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:48,079
but

3101
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:49,600
in the second way i read it is

3102
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:51,519
in a uh

3103
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:53,840
we talked about agency

3104
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:55,360
i read it as almost like gpt4 is

3105
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:58,159
intelligent enough

3106
01:46:55,359 --> 01:47:00,319
to be choosing to listen

3107
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:02,719
so not only like did a programmer tell

3108
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:04,799
it to collect this data and use it for

3109
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:06,960
training i almost

3110
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,400
saw the humorous angle which is like it

3111
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,880
has achieved agi

3112
01:47:08,399 --> 01:47:13,149
kind of thing well the thing is um could

3113
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:15,039
we be already be living in gpt5

3114
01:47:13,149 --> 01:47:18,399
[Laughter]

3115
01:47:15,039 --> 01:47:20,238
so gpt4 is listening and dpt5 actually

3116
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:23,039
constructed the entirety of the

3117
01:47:20,238 --> 01:47:24,559
reality we in some sense the what

3118
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:26,639
everybody is trying to do right now in

3119
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:29,440
ai is to extend the transformer to be

3120
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:31,520
able to deal with video

3121
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:33,678
and uh there are very promising

3122
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:36,480
extensions where there is a work by

3123
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:38,079
google that is called perceiver

3124
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:39,759
and that is

3125
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:41,760
overcoming some of the limitations of

3126
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:43,760
the transformer by letting it learn the

3127
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:45,360
topology of the different modalities

3128
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:47,600
separately

3129
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:49,519
and by

3130
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:51,199
training it to find better input

3131
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:53,360
features so these basically feature

3132
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:57,599
abstractions that are being used by

3133
01:47:53,359 --> 01:47:59,118
this um successor or to gpt3 are chosen

3134
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:00,719
such a way that it's able to deal with

3135
01:47:59,118 --> 01:48:03,118
video input

3136
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:06,158
and there is more to be done so i one of

3137
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:08,559
the limitations of gpt three is that

3138
01:48:06,158 --> 01:48:10,158
it's uh amnesiac so it forgets

3139
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:12,239
everything beyond the two pages that it

3140
01:48:10,158 --> 01:48:14,399
currently reads also during generation

3141
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:16,479
not just during learning

3142
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:18,559
do you think that's fixable

3143
01:48:16,479 --> 01:48:20,399
within the space of deep learning

3144
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:23,440
can you just make a bigger bigger bigger

3145
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:25,519
input no uh i don't think that our own

3146
01:48:23,439 --> 01:48:27,039
uh working memory is infinitely large

3147
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,920
it's probably also just a few thousand

3148
01:48:27,039 --> 01:48:30,560
bits

3149
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:32,480
but uh what you can do is you can

3150
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:33,520
structure this working memory so instead

3151
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:35,519
of just

3152
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:37,440
force feeding this thing a certain thing

3153
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:39,520
that it has to focus on and it's not

3154
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:41,039
allowed to focus on anything else with

3155
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:42,960
its network

3156
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:45,198
you allow it to construct its own

3157
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,719
working memory as we do right when we

3158
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:48,158
are reading a book

3159
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:50,000
it's not that we are focusing our

3160
01:48:48,158 --> 01:48:52,238
attention in such a way that we can only

3161
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,560
remember the current page

3162
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:56,559
we will also try to remember other pages

3163
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,480
and try to undo what we learned from

3164
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,239
them or modify what we learned from them

3165
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:01,919
we might get up and take another book

3166
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:04,158
from the shelf we might go out and ask

3167
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:06,158
somebody and we can

3168
01:49:04,158 --> 01:49:08,638
edit our working memory in any way that

3169
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:10,960
is useful to put a context together

3170
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:12,960
allows us to draw the right inferences

3171
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:15,760
and to learn the right things

3172
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:17,920
so this ability to perform experiments

3173
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:20,480
on the world based on

3174
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:22,719
an attempt to become fully coherent and

3175
01:49:20,479 --> 01:49:25,359
to achieve causal closure to achieve a

3176
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:27,198
certain aesthetic of your modeling that

3177
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:29,839
is something that eventually needs to be

3178
01:49:27,198 --> 01:49:32,158
done and at the moment we are skirting

3179
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,760
this in some sense by building systems

3180
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:36,238
that are larger and faster so they can

3181
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:37,599
use dramatically larger resources and

3182
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:39,839
human beings can do and much more

3183
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:42,239
training data to get to models that in

3184
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:44,000
some sense are already very superhuman

3185
01:49:42,238 --> 01:49:45,439
and in other ways are laughingly

3186
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,439
incoherent

3187
01:49:45,439 --> 01:49:50,238
so do you think uh sort of

3188
01:49:47,439 --> 01:49:53,198
making um the systems like what would

3189
01:49:50,238 --> 01:49:55,039
you say multi-resolutional so like

3190
01:49:53,198 --> 01:49:57,039
some

3191
01:49:55,039 --> 01:49:58,800
uh some of the language models are

3192
01:49:57,039 --> 01:50:02,079
focused on

3193
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:05,279
two pages some are focused on

3194
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:07,439
uh two books some are focused on

3195
01:50:05,279 --> 01:50:09,840
two years of reading some are focused on

3196
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:12,158
a lifetime like so it's like stacks of

3197
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:14,560
it's the gpt3s all the way down you want

3198
01:50:12,158 --> 01:50:17,359
to have gaps in between them so it's not

3199
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:19,599
necessarily two years there's no gaps it

3200
01:50:17,359 --> 01:50:21,118
stinks out of two years or out of twenty

3201
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:22,800
years or two thousand years or two

3202
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:24,479
billion years yeah where you are just

3203
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:26,639
selecting those bits

3204
01:50:24,479 --> 01:50:28,959
that are predicted to be the most useful

3205
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:31,039
ones to understand what you're currently

3206
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:32,960
doing and this prediction itself

3207
01:50:31,039 --> 01:50:34,319
requires a very complicated model that's

3208
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,239
the actual model that you need to be

3209
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:37,920
making it's not just that you are trying

3210
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:39,839
to understand the relationships between

3211
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:41,520
things but what you need to make

3212
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,400
relationships or discover relationships

3213
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,320
over

3214
01:50:42,399 --> 01:50:46,479
i wonder what that

3215
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:48,238
thing looks like with the architecture

3216
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:50,559
for that for the thing that's able to

3217
01:50:48,238 --> 01:50:52,799
have that kind of model that i think it

3218
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:55,360
needs more degrees of freedom than the

3219
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:56,880
current models have so it starts out

3220
01:50:55,359 --> 01:50:58,479
with the fact that you

3221
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:01,039
possibly don't just want to have a feed

3222
01:50:58,479 --> 01:51:02,638
forward model but you want it to be

3223
01:51:01,039 --> 01:51:04,639
fully recurrent

3224
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:06,079
and to make it fully recurrent you

3225
01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:08,159
probably need to loop it back into

3226
01:51:06,079 --> 01:51:09,679
itself and allow it to skip connections

3227
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:11,598
once you do this

3228
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:13,840
right when you are predicting the next

3229
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:15,119
frame and your internal next frame

3230
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:16,079
in every moment

3231
01:51:15,118 --> 01:51:17,839
and you

3232
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:21,279
are able to skip connection it means

3233
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:23,840
that signals can travel from the output

3234
01:51:21,279 --> 01:51:26,399
of the uh network into the middle of the

3235
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:28,800
network faster than the inputs do you

3236
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:30,079
think it can still be differentiable do

3237
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,079
you think it still could be a neural

3238
01:51:30,079 --> 01:51:35,118
network sometimes it can and sometimes

3239
01:51:32,079 --> 01:51:36,800
it cannot so it it can still be a neural

3240
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:39,118
network but not a fully differentiable

3241
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:41,520
one and when you want to deal with

3242
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:44,000
non-differentiable ones you need to have

3243
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:45,520
an attention system that is discrete and

3244
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,039
dual dimensional and can perform

3245
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:49,360
grammatical operations you need to be

3246
01:51:47,039 --> 01:51:51,599
able to perform program synthesis you

3247
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:53,439
need to be able to backtrack in this

3248
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:55,279
operations that you perform on this

3249
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:57,519
thing this thing needs a model of what

3250
01:51:55,279 --> 01:51:58,960
it's currently doing and i think this is

3251
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:01,199
exactly the purpose of our own

3252
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:03,920
consciousness

3253
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:05,359
yeah the program things that triculo

3254
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:08,239
networks

3255
01:52:05,359 --> 01:52:10,960
so let me ask you it's not quite program

3256
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:13,839
synthesis but uh the application of

3257
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,679
these language models to generation

3258
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:17,920
to program synthesis but generation of

3259
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:19,118
programs so if you look at github open

3260
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,359
pilot

3261
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:22,719
which is based on openai's codex i don't

3262
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:23,839
know if you got a chance to look at it

3263
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:26,239
but it's

3264
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:28,639
the system that's able to generate code

3265
01:52:26,238 --> 01:52:31,439
once you uh prompt it with

3266
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:33,599
what is it like the header of a function

3267
01:52:31,439 --> 01:52:36,000
with some comments and it seems to do an

3268
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:36,960
incredibly good job

3269
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,359
or

3270
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:41,359
not a perfect job is very important but

3271
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:43,039
an incredibly good job of generating

3272
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:45,039
functions

3273
01:52:43,039 --> 01:52:47,599
what do you make of that are you is this

3274
01:52:45,039 --> 01:52:48,880
exciting or is this just a party trick a

3275
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:51,760
demo

3276
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:53,279
or is this revolutionary

3277
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:56,159
i haven't worked with it yet so it's

3278
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:58,079
difficult for me to judge it but i would

3279
01:52:56,158 --> 01:53:00,158
not be surprised if it turns out to be

3280
01:52:58,079 --> 01:53:02,000
revolutionary that's because the

3281
01:53:00,158 --> 01:53:04,238
majority of programming tasks that are

3282
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,599
being done in the industry right now are

3283
01:53:04,238 --> 01:53:07,279
not creative

3284
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:08,960
yeah people are writing code that other

3285
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:10,800
people have written or they're putting

3286
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:12,880
things together from code fragments that

3287
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:15,119
others have had and a lot of the work

3288
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:17,760
that program has done practice is to

3289
01:53:15,118 --> 01:53:19,598
figure out how to overcome the gaps in

3290
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:20,960
their current knowledge and

3291
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:23,199
the things that people have already done

3292
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:25,520
how to copy and paste from stuck over

3293
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:27,279
that's right and so of course we can

3294
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:29,599
automate that yeah

3295
01:53:27,279 --> 01:53:31,359
to uh make it much faster to copy and

3296
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:33,279
paste from stack overflow yes but it's

3297
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:34,960
not just copying and pasting it's also

3298
01:53:33,279 --> 01:53:36,479
basically learning which parts you need

3299
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:38,158
to modify

3300
01:53:36,479 --> 01:53:38,959
to make them fit together

3301
01:53:38,158 --> 01:53:41,198
yeah

3302
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:43,279
uh like literally sometimes as simple as

3303
01:53:41,198 --> 01:53:44,960
just changing the variable names

3304
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:46,319
so it fits into the rest of your code

3305
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,760
yes but this requires that you

3306
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:49,519
understand the semantics of what you're

3307
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:50,800
doing to some degree yeah

3308
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:52,320
and you can automate some of those

3309
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:55,279
things yes the the thing that makes

3310
01:53:52,319 --> 01:53:57,759
people nervous of course is that

3311
01:53:55,279 --> 01:54:01,599
a little bit wrong in a program

3312
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:03,840
can have a dramatic effect on the actual

3313
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:05,279
final operation of that program so it's

3314
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:07,599
one little error

3315
01:54:05,279 --> 01:54:09,359
which in in the space of language it

3316
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:10,719
doesn't really matter but in the space

3317
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:13,279
of programs

3318
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:15,198
can matter a lot yes but this is already

3319
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:18,158
what is happening when humans program

3320
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:20,158
code yeah this is so we have a

3321
01:54:18,158 --> 01:54:22,719
technology to deal with this

3322
01:54:20,158 --> 01:54:24,719
somehow it becomes scarier

3323
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:26,319
when you know that a program generated

3324
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:27,840
code that's running a nuclear power

3325
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:30,158
plant

3326
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:31,360
it becomes scarier you know humans have

3327
01:54:30,158 --> 01:54:32,879
errors too

3328
01:54:31,359 --> 01:54:35,118
exactly but

3329
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:37,599
it's scarier when a program is doing it

3330
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:41,198
because

3331
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:43,599
why why i mean there's a

3332
01:54:41,198 --> 01:54:46,719
there's a fear that a program

3333
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:49,360
like a program may not be

3334
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:53,039
as good as humans to know when stuff is

3335
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:53,039
important to not mess up

3336
01:54:53,279 --> 01:54:55,439
like

3337
01:54:55,920 --> 01:55:01,520
there's a misalignment of priorities

3338
01:54:59,279 --> 01:55:03,359
of values that's potential that maybe

3339
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:06,320
that's the source of the worry

3340
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:08,238
i mean okay if i give you code generated

3341
01:55:06,319 --> 01:55:09,439
by

3342
01:55:08,238 --> 01:55:11,598
uh

3343
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:14,000
github open pilot and code generated by

3344
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:17,360
a human and say here

3345
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:19,599
use use one of these which which how do

3346
01:55:17,359 --> 01:55:22,158
you select today and in the next 10

3347
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:25,199
years which code to use wouldn't you

3348
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:27,679
still be comfortable with the human

3349
01:55:25,198 --> 01:55:29,519
at the moment when you go to stanford to

3350
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:31,920
get an mri

3351
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:34,480
they will write a bill to the insurance

3352
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:37,039
over twenty thousand dollars

3353
01:55:34,479 --> 01:55:39,118
and of this maybe half of that gets paid

3354
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:41,599
by the insurance and the quarter gets

3355
01:55:39,118 --> 01:55:43,759
paid by you yeah and the mri cost them

3356
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,880
six hundred dollars to make maybe

3357
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,920
probably less

3358
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:47,760
and

3359
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:49,760
what are the values of the person that

3360
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:52,000
writes the software and deploys this

3361
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:53,920
process

3362
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,079
it's very difficult for me to say

3363
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:58,079
whether i trust people

3364
01:55:56,079 --> 01:56:01,519
i think that what happens there is a

3365
01:55:58,079 --> 01:56:03,599
mixture of proper anglo-saxon protestant

3366
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:05,440
values where somebody is trying to serve

3367
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:08,159
an abstract greater whole and organized

3368
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:10,719
crime well that's a very harsh you're

3369
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:10,719
you're um

3370
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:15,679
i think

3371
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:18,639
that's a harsh view of humanity there's

3372
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:21,599
a lot of bad people whether incompetent

3373
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:24,719
or just malevolent in this world yes

3374
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:27,199
but it feels like the more

3375
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:29,118
malevolent you so the more damage you do

3376
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:31,198
to the world

3377
01:56:29,118 --> 01:56:32,479
uh the more resistance you have in your

3378
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:33,359
own

3379
01:56:32,479 --> 01:56:34,399
human

3380
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:36,399
like

3381
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:38,399
but cannot explain with malevolence or

3382
01:56:36,399 --> 01:56:41,359
stupidity what can be explained by just

3383
01:56:38,399 --> 01:56:43,118
people acting on their incentives

3384
01:56:41,359 --> 01:56:44,960
right so what happens in stanford is not

3385
01:56:43,118 --> 01:56:46,960
that somebody is evil

3386
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:48,639
it's just that they do what they're

3387
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:50,880
being paid for

3388
01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:53,039
no and this is that's not evil that's i

3389
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:55,279
i tend to so no i see that as

3390
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:56,560
malevolence i see uh

3391
01:56:55,279 --> 01:56:59,198
as i

3392
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:02,560
uh even like being a good german as i

3393
01:56:59,198 --> 01:57:03,759
told you offline is some it's not

3394
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:05,760
it's not

3395
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:07,360
absolute malevolence but it's a small

3396
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:09,199
amount it's cowardice

3397
01:57:07,359 --> 01:57:11,279
i mean when you see there's something

3398
01:57:09,198 --> 01:57:13,198
wrong with the world

3399
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:15,039
um it's either incompetence that you're

3400
01:57:13,198 --> 01:57:17,118
not able to see it

3401
01:57:15,039 --> 01:57:19,198
or it's cowardice that you're not able

3402
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:21,598
to stand up not it's not necessarily in

3403
01:57:19,198 --> 01:57:22,638
a big way but in a small way

3404
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:25,119
so i

3405
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:26,880
i do think that is in a bit of

3406
01:57:25,118 --> 01:57:28,719
malevolence i'm not sure the example

3407
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:32,239
you're describing is the question is

3408
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:34,800
what is it that you are aiming for and

3409
01:57:32,238 --> 01:57:36,158
if you don't believe in the future

3410
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,000
if you for instance think that the

3411
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:39,519
dollar is going to crash by what you try

3412
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,000
to save dollars

3413
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:44,080
if you uh don't think that humanity will

3414
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,158
be around in 100 years from now because

3415
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:48,399
uh global warming will wipe out

3416
01:57:46,158 --> 01:57:50,079
civilization why would you need to act

3417
01:57:48,399 --> 01:57:52,079
as if it were

3418
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:53,920
right so the question is is there an

3419
01:57:52,079 --> 01:57:56,000
overarching aesthetics

3420
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:57,599
that is projecting you and the world

3421
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,679
into the future which i think is the

3422
01:57:57,599 --> 01:58:01,520
basic idea of religion that you

3423
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:03,359
understand the interactions that we have

3424
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:04,880
with each other as some kind of

3425
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:07,598
civilization level agent that is

3426
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:09,679
projecting itself into the future if you

3427
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:12,880
if you don't have that shared purpose

3428
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:14,800
uh right what is there to be ethical for

3429
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:17,920
so i think when we talk about

3430
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:20,159
essex and ai we need to go beyond the

3431
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:22,000
insane bias discussions and so on where

3432
01:58:20,158 --> 01:58:24,638
people are just measuring the distance

3433
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,238
between a statistic to their uh

3434
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:29,440
preferred um

3435
01:58:26,238 --> 01:58:30,959
current world model but the optimism

3436
01:58:29,439 --> 01:58:34,439
i was a little confused by the previous

3437
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:34,439
things just to clarify

3438
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:38,960
it's

3439
01:58:36,238 --> 01:58:41,118
there is a kind of underlying

3440
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:42,800
morality to

3441
01:58:41,118 --> 01:58:44,639
having an optimism that human

3442
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:47,279
civilization will persist for longer

3443
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:50,079
than a hundred years like that like uh i

3444
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:52,000
think a lot of people believe

3445
01:58:50,079 --> 01:58:54,238
that it's it's a good thing for us to

3446
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,800
keep living yeah of course and thriving

3447
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:58,959
morality itself is not an end to itself

3448
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:00,880
it's instrumental to people living in

3449
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:04,000
100 years from now

3450
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:06,079
right or 500 years from now right so uh

3451
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:08,639
it's only justifiable if you actually

3452
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:10,399
think that it will lead to people uh or

3453
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:13,359
increase the probability of people being

3454
01:59:10,399 --> 01:59:14,960
around in that time frame and a lot of

3455
01:59:13,359 --> 01:59:16,799
people don't actually believe that at

3456
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:19,118
least not actively

3457
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:21,119
but i believe what exactly so

3458
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:23,359
most people don't believe that they can

3459
01:59:21,118 --> 01:59:25,439
afford to act on such a model

3460
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:27,039
basically what happens in in the u.s is

3461
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:28,238
i think that the healthcare system is

3462
01:59:27,039 --> 01:59:29,920
for a lot of people no longer

3463
01:59:28,238 --> 01:59:31,439
sustainable which means that if they

3464
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:33,440
need the help of the healthcare system

3465
01:59:31,439 --> 01:59:35,839
they're often not able to afford it yeah

3466
01:59:33,439 --> 01:59:37,759
and when they cannot help it they are

3467
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:39,599
often going bankrupt it's i think the

3468
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:41,280
leading course cause of personal

3469
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:42,400
bankruptcy in the us is the healthcare

3470
01:59:41,279 --> 01:59:44,800
system

3471
01:59:42,399 --> 01:59:46,638
yeah and uh that would not be necessary

3472
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:48,960
it's not because people are consuming

3473
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:50,560
more and more uh medical services and

3474
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:52,800
are achieving a much much longer life as

3475
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:54,080
a result that's not actually the story

3476
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,920
that is happening because you can

3477
01:59:54,079 --> 01:59:57,920
compare to other countries and life

3478
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:59,599
expectancy in the u.s is currently not

3479
01:59:57,920 --> 02:00:01,599
increasing and it's not as high as in

3480
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:03,199
all the other industrialized countries

3481
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:04,719
so some industrialized countries are

3482
02:00:03,198 --> 02:00:06,238
doing better with a much cheaper

3483
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:07,039
healthcare system

3484
02:00:06,238 --> 02:00:08,559
and

3485
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:11,279
what you can see is for instance

3486
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:13,360
administrative bloat the

3487
02:00:11,279 --> 02:00:16,079
healthcare system has maybe to some

3488
02:00:13,359 --> 02:00:18,960
degree deliberately set up as a job

3489
02:00:16,079 --> 02:00:20,319
placement program to allow people to

3490
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:24,800
continue living in middle class

3491
02:00:20,319 --> 02:00:27,359
existence despite not having useful and

3492
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:29,840
use case in productivity so they are

3493
02:00:27,359 --> 02:00:31,519
being paid to push paper around and the

3494
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,119
number of administrators in the

3495
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:34,480
healthcare system has been increasing

3496
02:00:33,118 --> 02:00:35,679
much faster than the number of

3497
02:00:34,479 --> 02:00:36,879
practitioners

3498
02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:39,599
and this is something that you have to

3499
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:41,279
pay for right and also the

3500
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:42,880
revenues that are being generated in the

3501
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:45,118
healthcare system are relatively large

3502
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:46,719
and somebody has to pay for them and

3503
02:00:45,118 --> 02:00:48,158
the result why they are so large is

3504
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:51,198
because market mechanisms are not

3505
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:54,399
working right the fda is largely not

3506
02:00:51,198 --> 02:00:56,879
protecting people from malpractice

3507
02:00:54,399 --> 02:00:58,719
of healthcare providers the fda is

3508
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:01,679
protecting healthcare providers from

3509
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:03,439
competition right okay so this is a

3510
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:05,279
thing that is has to do with values and

3511
02:01:03,439 --> 02:01:07,598
this is not because people are malicious

3512
02:01:05,279 --> 02:01:10,559
on all levels it's because they are not

3513
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:12,800
incentivized to act on a greater whole

3514
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:14,719
on this idea that you treat somebody who

3515
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:16,480
comes to you as a patient like you would

3516
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:18,239
treat a family member yeah but yeah but

3517
02:01:16,479 --> 02:01:19,919
we're trying i mean

3518
02:01:18,238 --> 02:01:21,279
you're highlighting a lot of the flaws

3519
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:23,199
of the different institutions the

3520
02:01:21,279 --> 02:01:24,639
systems we're operating under but i

3521
02:01:23,198 --> 02:01:25,839
think there's a continuum throughout

3522
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:27,760
history

3523
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:29,679
mechanism design

3524
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:31,679
of trying to design incentives in such a

3525
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:33,440
way that these systems behave better and

3526
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:35,279
better and better i mean it's a very

3527
02:01:33,439 --> 02:01:37,439
difficult thing to operate

3528
02:01:35,279 --> 02:01:39,920
a society of hundreds of millions of

3529
02:01:37,439 --> 02:01:41,839
people effectively with yes

3530
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:44,399
so do we live in a society that is ever

3531
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:47,599
correcting is this uh right do we

3532
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:49,439
observe that our models of what we are

3533
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:51,679
doing are predictive of the future and

3534
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:53,359
when they are not we improve them

3535
02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:55,199
our laws

3536
02:01:53,359 --> 02:01:56,880
adjudicated with clauses that you put

3537
02:01:55,198 --> 02:01:58,399
into every law what is meant to be

3538
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:00,480
achieved by that law and the law will be

3539
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:01,598
automatically repealed if it's not

3540
02:02:00,479 --> 02:02:03,279
achieving that right if you are

3541
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:05,039
optimizing your own laws if you're

3542
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:06,319
writing your own source code

3543
02:02:05,039 --> 02:02:08,079
you probably

3544
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:09,519
make an estimate of what is the thing

3545
02:02:08,079 --> 02:02:11,118
that's currently wrong in my life what

3546
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:14,000
is it that i should change about my own

3547
02:02:11,118 --> 02:02:16,639
policies what is the expected outcome

3548
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,560
and if that outcome does manifest

3549
02:02:16,639 --> 02:02:20,079
i will change the policy back right or i

3550
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:22,239
will change it to something different

3551
02:02:20,079 --> 02:02:24,158
are we doing this on a societal level i

3552
02:02:22,238 --> 02:02:26,158
think so i think i think it's easy to

3553
02:02:24,158 --> 02:02:28,879
sort of highlight the i think we're

3554
02:02:26,158 --> 02:02:30,559
doing it in the way that um

3555
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:32,880
like i operate my current life i didn't

3556
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:35,039
sleep much last night uh

3557
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:36,480
you would say that lex the way you need

3558
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:37,679
to operate your life is you need to

3559
02:02:36,479 --> 02:02:40,479
always get sleep the fact that you

3560
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:42,960
didn't sleep last night is is totally

3561
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:44,238
the wrong way to operate in your life

3562
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:46,560
like you should have

3563
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:48,559
gotten all your done in time and

3564
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:49,920
gotten to sleep because sleep is very

3565
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:51,920
important for health and you're

3566
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:54,639
highlighting look this person is not

3567
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:56,960
sleeping look the the medical the health

3568
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:59,039
care system is operating poor but the

3569
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:00,719
point is that we just

3570
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:02,960
it seems like this is the way especially

3571
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:05,039
in the capital society we operate we

3572
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:08,079
keep running into trouble and last

3573
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:10,639
minute we we try to get our our way out

3574
02:03:08,079 --> 02:03:12,960
through innovation and it seems to work

3575
02:03:10,639 --> 02:03:15,440
you have a lot of people that ultimately

3576
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:19,359
are trying to build a better world and

3577
02:03:15,439 --> 02:03:21,439
and get uh urgency about them

3578
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:22,799
when it's the problem becomes more and

3579
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:24,559
more imminent

3580
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:26,000
and that's the way this operates but if

3581
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,880
you look at the

3582
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,679
the

3583
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:31,440
the history the the long arc of history

3584
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:34,079
it seems like that

3585
02:03:31,439 --> 02:03:36,158
operating on deadlines

3586
02:03:34,079 --> 02:03:37,840
produces progress and builds better and

3587
02:03:36,158 --> 02:03:40,158
better systems you probably agree with

3588
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:44,480
me that the us should have engaged in

3589
02:03:40,158 --> 02:03:46,638
mass production in january 2020

3590
02:03:44,479 --> 02:03:49,198
and that we should have shut down the

3591
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:51,520
airports early on and that we should

3592
02:03:49,198 --> 02:03:54,158
have made it mandatory that the people

3593
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:57,199
that work in nursery homes are

3594
02:03:54,158 --> 02:04:00,078
living on campus rather than living at

3595
02:03:57,198 --> 02:04:01,759
home and then uh coming in and infecting

3596
02:04:00,078 --> 02:04:03,840
uh people in the nursing homes that had

3597
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:04,880
no immune response to covet

3598
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:06,880
and uh

3599
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:08,960
that is something that was i think

3600
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:10,400
visible back then the correct decisions

3601
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:12,480
haven't been made

3602
02:04:10,399 --> 02:04:13,839
we would have the same situation again

3603
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:15,839
how do we know that these wrong

3604
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:17,679
decisions are not being made again have

3605
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,199
the people that made the decisions to

3606
02:04:17,679 --> 02:04:20,399
not protect the nursing homes been

3607
02:04:19,198 --> 02:04:22,559
punished

3608
02:04:20,399 --> 02:04:24,719
has have the people that made the wrong

3609
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:27,280
decisions with respect to testing that

3610
02:04:24,719 --> 02:04:29,599
prevented the development of testing by

3611
02:04:27,279 --> 02:04:31,359
startup companies and the importing of

3612
02:04:29,599 --> 02:04:33,599
tests from countries that already had

3613
02:04:31,359 --> 02:04:35,198
them have these people been held

3614
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:37,039
responsible well first of all so what do

3615
02:04:35,198 --> 02:04:39,598
you what do you want to like

3616
02:04:37,039 --> 02:04:41,118
put before the firing squad i think they

3617
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:43,039
are no just make sure that this doesn't

3618
02:04:41,118 --> 02:04:44,719
happen again no but

3619
02:04:43,039 --> 02:04:46,319
you see but it's not that

3620
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:48,719
yes they're being held responsible by

3621
02:04:46,319 --> 02:04:50,639
many voices by people being frustrated

3622
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:53,279
there's new leaders being born now

3623
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:54,319
they're going to see rise to the top in

3624
02:04:53,279 --> 02:04:56,399
10 years

3625
02:04:54,319 --> 02:04:58,880
this moves slower than

3626
02:04:56,399 --> 02:05:01,279
there's obviously a lot of uh

3627
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:03,599
older incompetence and bureaucracy and

3628
02:05:01,279 --> 02:05:05,679
these systems move slowly

3629
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:08,000
they move you know like science one

3630
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:11,199
death at a time so like

3631
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:12,880
yes i think the the pain has been felt

3632
02:05:11,198 --> 02:05:15,439
in the previous year

3633
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:17,440
is reverberating throughout the world

3634
02:05:15,439 --> 02:05:19,759
maybe i'm getting old i suspect that

3635
02:05:17,439 --> 02:05:22,078
every generation in the us after the war

3636
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:24,560
has lost the plot even more i don't see

3637
02:05:22,078 --> 02:05:27,039
this development the war world war ii

3638
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:29,520
yeah so basically there was a time when

3639
02:05:27,039 --> 02:05:31,599
uh we were modernist and in this

3640
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:33,840
modernist time

3641
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:36,078
the u.s felt actively threatened by the

3642
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:39,599
things that happened in the world the us

3643
02:05:36,078 --> 02:05:43,118
was worried about possibility of failure

3644
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:46,078
and this imminence of possible failure

3645
02:05:43,118 --> 02:05:47,439
led to decisions where there was a time

3646
02:05:46,078 --> 02:05:50,479
when the government would listen to

3647
02:05:47,439 --> 02:05:51,598
physicists about how to do things yeah

3648
02:05:50,479 --> 02:05:52,879
and the physicists were actually

3649
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:54,880
concerned about what the government

3650
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:56,880
should be doing so they would be writing

3651
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:58,480
letters to the government and so for

3652
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:00,880
instance the decision for the manhattan

3653
02:05:58,479 --> 02:06:02,879
project was something that was driven in

3654
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:04,960
the conversation between physicists and

3655
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:07,279
the government i don't think such a

3656
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:09,520
discussion would take place today i i

3657
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:11,599
disagree i think if the virus was much

3658
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:13,599
deadlier we would see a very different

3659
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:16,000
response i think the virus was not

3660
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:18,400
sufficiently deadly and instead because

3661
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,800
it wasn't very deadly what happened is

3662
02:06:18,399 --> 02:06:23,439
uh the the current system started to

3663
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:25,920
politicize it the mask this is what i

3664
02:06:23,439 --> 02:06:26,719
realized with masks early on they were

3665
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:29,440
not

3666
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:31,359
very quickly became not as a solution

3667
02:06:29,439 --> 02:06:33,118
but they became a thing

3668
02:06:31,359 --> 02:06:35,279
that politicians used to divide the

3669
02:06:33,118 --> 02:06:37,039
country so that that same thing is

3670
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:39,118
happening with vaccines same thing so

3671
02:06:37,039 --> 02:06:41,039
like nobody's really people weren't

3672
02:06:39,118 --> 02:06:42,158
talking about solutions to this problem

3673
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:44,078
because i don't think the problem was

3674
02:06:42,158 --> 02:06:46,799
bad enough when you talk about the world

3675
02:06:44,078 --> 02:06:48,719
the war i think what i think our lives

3676
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,279
are too comfortable

3677
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:52,800
i think in uh in the developed world

3678
02:06:51,279 --> 02:06:54,880
things are too good and we have not

3679
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:57,520
faced severe dangers

3680
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:59,520
one the dangers the severe dangers

3681
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:02,000
existential threats are faced that's

3682
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:05,599
when we step up on a small scale and a

3683
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,479
large scale now i don't

3684
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:08,639
i

3685
02:07:06,479 --> 02:07:10,879
that's sort of my argument here but i

3686
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:12,319
did think the virus is

3687
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:13,520
i was hoping that it was actually

3688
02:07:12,319 --> 02:07:16,000
sufficiently

3689
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:17,840
uh dangerous

3690
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,158
for us to step up because especially in

3691
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:23,279
the early days it was unclear it still

3692
02:07:20,158 --> 02:07:25,118
is unclear because of mutations

3693
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:26,639
how bad it might be

3694
02:07:25,118 --> 02:07:30,158
right and so

3695
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:33,520
i thought we would step up and

3696
02:07:30,158 --> 02:07:34,960
even so the masks point is is uh it's a

3697
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:37,360
tricky one because

3698
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:39,599
to me the manufacturer of masks isn't

3699
02:07:37,359 --> 02:07:41,759
isn't even the problem i'm still to this

3700
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:44,000
day and i was involved with with a bunch

3701
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:46,800
of this work have not seen good signs

3702
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:48,158
done on whether masks work or not

3703
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:50,400
like there still has not been a

3704
02:07:48,158 --> 02:07:52,000
large-scale study to me that should be

3705
02:07:50,399 --> 02:07:55,039
there should be large-scale studies and

3706
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:56,319
every possible solution like aggressive

3707
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:58,000
in the same way that the vaccine

3708
02:07:56,319 --> 02:07:58,719
development was aggressive there should

3709
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,960
be

3710
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:04,158
masks which test what kind of tests work

3711
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:06,719
really well uh what kind of uh like even

3712
02:08:04,158 --> 02:08:08,479
the question of how the virus spreads

3713
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:10,880
there should be aggressive studies on

3714
02:08:08,479 --> 02:08:12,559
that to understand i'm still

3715
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:14,480
as far as far as i know there's still a

3716
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:16,639
lot of uncertainty about that nobody

3717
02:08:14,479 --> 02:08:18,799
wants to see this as an engineering

3718
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:20,319
problem that needs to be solved it's

3719
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:22,320
it's uh

3720
02:08:20,319 --> 02:08:24,479
that i was surprised about but i find

3721
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:26,479
that our views are largely convergent

3722
02:08:24,479 --> 02:08:27,519
but not completely so i agree with the

3723
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:30,000
thing that

3724
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:32,560
uh because our society in some sense

3725
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:35,039
perceives itself as too big to fail

3726
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:36,800
right and uh the virus did not alert

3727
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:38,319
people to the fact that we are facing

3728
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:40,400
possible failure

3729
02:08:38,319 --> 02:08:42,158
uh that basically put us into the

3730
02:08:40,399 --> 02:08:44,158
post-modernist mode and i don't mean in

3731
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:46,238
the philosophical sense but in a

3732
02:08:44,158 --> 02:08:48,479
societal sense the difference between a

3733
02:08:46,238 --> 02:08:50,479
post-modern society and the modern

3734
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:52,319
society is that the modernist society

3735
02:08:50,479 --> 02:08:53,839
has to deal with the ground truth and

3736
02:08:52,319 --> 02:08:55,519
the postmodernist society has to deal

3737
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:58,078
with appearances

3738
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:59,840
politics becomes a performance and the

3739
02:08:58,078 --> 02:09:02,399
performance is done for an audience and

3740
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:04,719
the organized audience is the media and

3741
02:09:02,399 --> 02:09:06,319
the media evaluates itself via other

3742
02:09:04,719 --> 02:09:09,279
media right so you have an audience of

3743
02:09:06,319 --> 02:09:10,719
critics that evaluate themselves and i

3744
02:09:09,279 --> 02:09:12,800
don't think it's so much the failure of

3745
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:15,599
the politicians because to get in power

3746
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:17,599
and to stay in power you need to be able

3747
02:09:15,599 --> 02:09:20,000
to deal with the published opinion well

3748
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:21,520
i think it goes in cycles because the

3749
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:24,319
what's going to happen

3750
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:26,719
is all of the small business owners all

3751
02:09:24,319 --> 02:09:29,439
the people who truly are suffering and

3752
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:32,239
will suffer more because the effects

3753
02:09:29,439 --> 02:09:34,238
of the closure of the economy and the

3754
02:09:32,238 --> 02:09:37,919
lack of solutions to the virus

3755
02:09:34,238 --> 02:09:39,759
they're going to uprise and hopefully

3756
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:42,560
i mean this is this is where charismatic

3757
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:44,800
leaders can get the the world in trouble

3758
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:48,159
but hopefully we'll

3759
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:49,920
elect great leaders

3760
02:09:48,158 --> 02:09:52,238
that will break through this

3761
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:53,440
post-modernist idea of uh

3762
02:09:52,238 --> 02:09:55,678
of uh

3763
02:09:53,439 --> 02:09:57,279
the media and the perception and the

3764
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:58,800
drama on twitter and all that kind of

3765
02:09:57,279 --> 02:10:02,000
stuff but you know this can go either

3766
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:03,279
way yeah when the weimar republic was

3767
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,679
unable to

3768
02:10:03,279 --> 02:10:07,439
deal with the economic crisis that

3769
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:10,239
germany was facing

3770
02:10:07,439 --> 02:10:11,678
there was an option to go back

3771
02:10:10,238 --> 02:10:13,839
but there were people which thought

3772
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:16,480
let's get back to a constitutional

3773
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:18,800
monarchy and let's get this this to work

3774
02:10:16,479 --> 02:10:21,519
because democracy doesn't work

3775
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:23,039
and eventually uh there was no way back

3776
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:25,119
where people decided there was no way

3777
02:10:23,039 --> 02:10:26,960
back they needed to go forward and the

3778
02:10:25,118 --> 02:10:31,198
only options for going forward was to

3779
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:34,239
become a stalinist communist basically

3780
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:36,559
an option to completely expropriate

3781
02:10:34,238 --> 02:10:38,879
the factories and so on and nationalize

3782
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:41,280
them and to reorganize

3783
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:43,118
germany and communist terms and ally

3784
02:10:41,279 --> 02:10:45,920
itself with stalin

3785
02:10:43,118 --> 02:10:48,000
and fascism and both options were

3786
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:50,239
obviously very bad

3787
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,238
and the one that the germans picked led

3788
02:10:50,238 --> 02:10:54,319
to a catastrophe that was

3789
02:10:52,238 --> 02:10:56,718
that devastated europe

3790
02:10:54,319 --> 02:10:59,198
and i'm not sure if the us has an immune

3791
02:10:56,719 --> 02:11:00,960
response against that i think that the

3792
02:10:59,198 --> 02:11:04,719
far right is currently very weak in the

3793
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:04,719
u.s but this can easily change

3794
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:09,039
do you think uh

3795
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:10,799
from a historical perspective hitler

3796
02:11:09,039 --> 02:11:14,000
could have been stopped

3797
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:16,000
from within germany or or from outside

3798
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,760
or this

3799
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,599
well depends on who you want to focus

3800
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:21,360
whether you want to focus on stalin or

3801
02:11:19,599 --> 02:11:22,319
hitler but he feels like hitler was the

3802
02:11:21,359 --> 02:11:23,679
one

3803
02:11:22,319 --> 02:11:25,118
as a political movement that could have

3804
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:26,719
been stopped

3805
02:11:25,118 --> 02:11:28,639
i think that uh

3806
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:31,118
the point was that a lot of people

3807
02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:33,039
wanted hitler so he got support from a

3808
02:11:31,118 --> 02:11:35,439
lot of quarters it was a number of

3809
02:11:33,039 --> 02:11:36,880
industrialists who supported him because

3810
02:11:35,439 --> 02:11:38,638
they thought that the democracy is

3811
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:40,560
obviously not working and unstable and

3812
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:43,118
you need a strong man

3813
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:45,119
and he was willing to play that part

3814
02:11:43,118 --> 02:11:47,920
there were also people in the us who

3815
02:11:45,118 --> 02:11:50,559
thought that hitler would stop uh stalin

3816
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:52,319
and would act as a balrack against

3817
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:54,159
bolshevism

3818
02:11:52,319 --> 02:11:56,158
which he probably would have done right

3819
02:11:54,158 --> 02:11:58,960
but uh at which cost

3820
02:11:56,158 --> 02:12:01,598
and then many of the things that he was

3821
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:02,560
going to do like the holocaust

3822
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:04,078
was

3823
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:06,000
something where people thought this is

3824
02:12:04,078 --> 02:12:08,559
rhetoric he's not actually going to do

3825
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,399
this right especially many of the jews

3826
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:12,400
themselves which were humanist and for

3827
02:12:10,399 --> 02:12:14,158
them this was outside of the scope that

3828
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:16,158
was thinkable right

3829
02:12:14,158 --> 02:12:19,598
i mean i i i wonder

3830
02:12:16,158 --> 02:12:22,000
if hitler is uniquely

3831
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:23,520
i i want to carefully use this term but

3832
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:26,319
uniquely evil

3833
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:28,079
so if hitler was never born

3834
02:12:26,319 --> 02:12:29,039
if somebody else would come in this

3835
02:12:28,078 --> 02:12:30,319
place

3836
02:12:29,039 --> 02:12:31,118
so like

3837
02:12:30,319 --> 02:12:33,759
just

3838
02:12:31,118 --> 02:12:36,639
thinking about the progress of history

3839
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:37,440
how important are those singular figures

3840
02:12:36,639 --> 02:12:39,520
that

3841
02:12:37,439 --> 02:12:40,960
that lead to mass destruction and

3842
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:41,920
cruelty

3843
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:43,840
because

3844
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:46,480
my senses

3845
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:47,520
hitler was unique

3846
02:12:46,479 --> 02:12:49,439
the

3847
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:51,599
it wasn't just about the environment and

3848
02:12:49,439 --> 02:12:52,479
the context that gave him

3849
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:54,078
like

3850
02:12:52,479 --> 02:12:56,799
like another person would not come in

3851
02:12:54,078 --> 02:12:58,238
his place to do as destructive of the

3852
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:01,599
things that he did

3853
02:12:58,238 --> 02:13:06,158
there was a combination of uh charisma

3854
02:13:01,599 --> 02:13:08,239
of madness of psychopathy of just uh ego

3855
02:13:06,158 --> 02:13:10,879
all those things which are very unlikely

3856
02:13:08,238 --> 02:13:12,399
to come together in one person in the

3857
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:14,159
right time

3858
02:13:12,399 --> 02:13:16,399
it also depends on the context of the

3859
02:13:14,158 --> 02:13:19,439
country that you're operating in

3860
02:13:16,399 --> 02:13:22,479
if you uh tell the germans that they

3861
02:13:19,439 --> 02:13:24,719
have a historical destiny uh

3862
02:13:22,479 --> 02:13:26,158
in this romantic country the effect is

3863
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:27,118
probably different than it is in other

3864
02:13:26,158 --> 02:13:29,519
countries

3865
02:13:27,118 --> 02:13:32,479
but uh the uh

3866
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:35,040
stalin has killed a few more people than

3867
02:13:32,479 --> 02:13:36,799
hitler did and if you look at the

3868
02:13:35,039 --> 02:13:37,840
probability that you're survived under

3869
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:41,920
stalin

3870
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:44,239
uh right uh hitler killed people if uh

3871
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:47,520
they if he thought they were not worth

3872
02:13:44,238 --> 02:13:49,919
living or if they were harmful to his uh

3873
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:51,280
racist uh project right he basically

3874
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:53,760
felt that the jews would be too

3875
02:13:51,279 --> 02:13:55,840
cosmopolitan and would not be willing to

3876
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:58,159
uh participate in the racist

3877
02:13:55,840 --> 02:14:01,279
redefinition of society and the value of

3878
02:13:58,158 --> 02:14:03,839
society and an isno state in this way

3879
02:14:01,279 --> 02:14:05,359
that as he wanted it to have it so they

3880
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:06,078
he saw them as

3881
02:14:05,359 --> 02:14:07,759
a

3882
02:14:06,078 --> 02:14:10,960
harmful danger especially since they

3883
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:13,280
played such an important role in the

3884
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:15,279
economy and culture of germany

3885
02:14:13,279 --> 02:14:17,920
and uh

3886
02:14:15,279 --> 02:14:20,719
it so we had basically had some radical

3887
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:23,359
but rational reason to murder them

3888
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:25,039
and stalin just killed everyone

3889
02:14:23,359 --> 02:14:26,639
basically the stalinist purchase were

3890
02:14:25,039 --> 02:14:29,039
such a random thing where he said that

3891
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:29,039
there's a

3892
02:14:30,479 --> 02:14:35,198
certain possibility that this particular

3893
02:14:32,479 --> 02:14:36,879
part of the population has a number of

3894
02:14:35,198 --> 02:14:39,039
german collaborators or something and we

3895
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:41,279
just kill them all yeah right well if

3896
02:14:39,039 --> 02:14:43,439
you look at what mao did the number of

3897
02:14:41,279 --> 02:14:45,039
uh people that were killed absolute in

3898
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:47,598
absolute numbers were much higher under

3899
02:14:45,039 --> 02:14:50,399
mao that they were under stalin

3900
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:52,560
so it's super hard to say the the the

3901
02:14:50,399 --> 02:14:56,319
other thing is that you look at jinga's

3902
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:58,400
khan and so on how many people he killed

3903
02:14:56,319 --> 02:14:59,840
where do you see there are a number of

3904
02:14:58,399 --> 02:15:02,078
of things that happen in human history

3905
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:04,159
that actually really put a substantial

3906
02:15:02,078 --> 02:15:05,840
dent in the existing population or

3907
02:15:04,158 --> 02:15:06,960
napoleon

3908
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:09,039
and

3909
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:10,560
it's it's very difficult to eventually

3910
02:15:09,039 --> 02:15:12,319
measure it because what's happening is

3911
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:14,880
basically evolution

3912
02:15:12,319 --> 02:15:17,679
uh on a human scale

3913
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:19,279
where uh one monkey figures out a way to

3914
02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:20,880
become viral

3915
02:15:19,279 --> 02:15:23,039
and uh is

3916
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:25,279
using this viral technology to change

3917
02:15:23,039 --> 02:15:26,479
the patterns of society at the very very

3918
02:15:25,279 --> 02:15:29,118
large scale

3919
02:15:26,479 --> 02:15:31,279
and what we find so abhorrent about

3920
02:15:29,118 --> 02:15:32,559
these changes is the complexity that is

3921
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:34,880
being destroyed by this that it's

3922
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:36,320
basically like a big fire that burns out

3923
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:39,118
a lot of the existing culture and

3924
02:15:36,319 --> 02:15:41,198
structure that existed before

3925
02:15:39,118 --> 02:15:42,559
yeah and it all just starts with one

3926
02:15:41,198 --> 02:15:44,799
monkey

3927
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:46,239
one one cares mata gabe and there's a

3928
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:48,159
bunch of them throughout history yeah

3929
02:15:46,238 --> 02:15:50,238
but it's in a given environment it's

3930
02:15:48,158 --> 02:15:51,839
basically similar to wildfires in

3931
02:15:50,238 --> 02:15:53,198
california right the temperature is

3932
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:55,440
rising

3933
02:15:53,198 --> 02:15:57,118
there is less rain falling

3934
02:15:55,439 --> 02:15:58,799
and then certainly a single spark can

3935
02:15:57,118 --> 02:16:00,719
have an effect that in other times would

3936
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:02,239
be contained

3937
02:16:00,719 --> 02:16:04,560
okay

3938
02:16:02,238 --> 02:16:07,759
speaking of which i i love when we went

3939
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:11,920
to hitler and stalin from 20 30 minutes

3940
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:15,119
ago uh gpt 3 generating

3941
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:19,679
doing program synthesis the argument was

3942
02:16:15,118 --> 02:16:21,118
about morality of ai versus human

3943
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:23,440
so

3944
02:16:21,118 --> 02:16:23,439
um

3945
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:26,960
and specifically in the context of

3946
02:16:25,279 --> 02:16:29,198
writing programs specifically in the

3947
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:31,118
context of programs that can be

3948
02:16:29,198 --> 02:16:33,920
destructive so running nuclear power

3949
02:16:31,118 --> 02:16:35,039
plants or autonomous weapons systems for

3950
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:37,040
example

3951
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:39,760
and i think

3952
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:41,840
your inclination was to say that it's

3953
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:43,359
not so obvious that ai would be less

3954
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:46,558
moral than humans

3955
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:49,519
or less effective at making a a world

3956
02:16:46,558 --> 02:16:52,558
that would make humans happy so i i'm

3957
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:54,478
not talking about self-directed systems

3958
02:16:52,558 --> 02:16:57,199
that are

3959
02:16:54,478 --> 02:16:59,119
making their own goals at a global scale

3960
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:02,719
if you just talk about the deployment of

3961
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:04,639
technological systems that are able to

3962
02:17:02,718 --> 02:17:06,879
see order and patterns and use this as

3963
02:17:04,638 --> 02:17:08,318
control models to act on the goals that

3964
02:17:06,879 --> 02:17:10,959
we give them

3965
02:17:08,318 --> 02:17:12,638
then if we have the correct incentives

3966
02:17:10,959 --> 02:17:15,119
to set the correct incentives for these

3967
02:17:12,638 --> 02:17:16,000
systems i'm quite optimistic

3968
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:18,399
so but

3969
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:20,558
so humans versus ai let me give you an

3970
02:17:18,398 --> 02:17:23,840
example

3971
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:23,840
autonomous weapon system

3972
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:26,879
let's say there's a city somewhere in

3973
02:17:25,679 --> 02:17:30,398
the middle east

3974
02:17:26,879 --> 02:17:32,799
that has a number of terrorists

3975
02:17:30,398 --> 02:17:35,119
and the question is what's currently

3976
02:17:32,799 --> 02:17:37,199
done with with drone technologies you

3977
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:39,599
have information about the location of a

3978
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:41,359
particular terrorist and you have a

3979
02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:43,920
targeted attack you have a bombing of

3980
02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:46,079
that particular building

3981
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:48,558
and that's all directed by humans at the

3982
02:17:46,079 --> 02:17:50,079
high level strategy and also at the

3983
02:17:48,558 --> 02:17:52,558
deployment of individual bombs and

3984
02:17:50,079 --> 02:17:55,039
missiles like that the actual

3985
02:17:52,558 --> 02:17:56,718
everything is done by human except the

3986
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:58,639
the final targeting

3987
02:17:56,718 --> 02:18:00,959
and the the like the country so like

3988
02:17:58,638 --> 02:18:01,839
with spot similar thing like control the

3989
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:02,718
flight

3990
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:07,040
okay

3991
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:10,718
what if you give ai control and saying

3992
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:12,319
um write a program that says here's the

3993
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:14,799
best information i have available about

3994
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:16,959
the location of these five terrorists

3995
02:18:14,799 --> 02:18:18,638
here's the city make sure it's cons all

3996
02:18:16,959 --> 02:18:21,759
the bombing you do is constrained to the

3997
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:24,159
city make sure it's precision based

3998
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:26,719
but you take care of it so you do one

3999
02:18:24,159 --> 02:18:29,679
level of abstraction out and saying

4000
02:18:26,718 --> 02:18:31,598
take care of the terrorists in the city

4001
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:32,719
which are you more comfortable with the

4002
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:35,599
humans

4003
02:18:32,718 --> 02:18:37,279
or the javascript gpt-3 generated code

4004
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:39,920
that's doing the

4005
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:40,880
deployment i mean that's this is the the

4006
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:43,760
kind of

4007
02:18:40,879 --> 02:18:46,398
question i'm asking is

4008
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:48,559
the kind of bugs that we see in human

4009
02:18:46,398 --> 02:18:51,119
nature are they better or worse than the

4010
02:18:48,558 --> 02:18:53,679
kind of bugs we see in ai

4011
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:55,439
they're different bugs there is an issue

4012
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:58,879
that if people are

4013
02:18:55,439 --> 02:19:01,439
creating an in imperfect automation

4014
02:18:58,879 --> 02:19:02,799
of a process that normally requires a

4015
02:19:01,439 --> 02:19:05,439
moral judgment

4016
02:19:02,799 --> 02:19:07,119
and this mobile judgment is

4017
02:19:05,439 --> 02:19:10,079
the reason why it cannot be automated

4018
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:12,079
often is not because the

4019
02:19:10,079 --> 02:19:13,760
computation is too expensive

4020
02:19:12,079 --> 02:19:16,318
but because the model that you give the

4021
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:18,239
ai is not an adequate model of the

4022
02:19:16,318 --> 02:19:19,920
dynamics of the world because the ai

4023
02:19:18,239 --> 02:19:22,000
does not understand the context that

4024
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:23,679
it's operating in in the right way and

4025
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,840
this is something that already happens

4026
02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:28,239
with excel right you don't need to have

4027
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:31,439
an ai system to do this if you have an

4028
02:19:28,239 --> 02:19:33,519
automated process in place where humans

4029
02:19:31,439 --> 02:19:34,880
decide using automated criteria whom to

4030
02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:36,559
kill when

4031
02:19:34,879 --> 02:19:37,920
and whom to target when which already

4032
02:19:36,558 --> 02:19:39,759
happens

4033
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:42,000
right and you have no way to get off the

4034
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:43,679
kill list once that happens once you

4035
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,920
have been targeted according to some

4036
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:48,000
automatic criterion by people right in a

4037
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:49,840
bureaucracy

4038
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:52,318
that that is the issue the issue is it's

4039
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:53,200
not the ai it's the automation

4040
02:19:52,318 --> 02:19:54,879
so

4041
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:56,720
there's something about

4042
02:19:54,879 --> 02:19:58,799
right it's automation but there's

4043
02:19:56,719 --> 02:20:00,559
something about the

4044
02:19:58,799 --> 02:20:03,039
there's a certain level of abstraction

4045
02:20:00,559 --> 02:20:04,478
where you give control to ai to do the

4046
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:05,680
automation

4047
02:20:04,478 --> 02:20:07,920
there's a

4048
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:10,720
scale that can be achieved that it feels

4049
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:12,318
like the scale of bug and scale mistake

4050
02:20:10,719 --> 02:20:14,559
and scale of destruction that can be

4051
02:20:12,318 --> 02:20:16,879
achieved

4052
02:20:14,559 --> 02:20:19,840
of the kind that humans cannot achieve

4053
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:22,159
so ai is much more able to destroy an

4054
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:24,639
entire country accidentally versus

4055
02:20:22,159 --> 02:20:28,719
humans it feels like the more

4056
02:20:24,639 --> 02:20:31,039
civilians die as they react or suffer as

4057
02:20:28,719 --> 02:20:33,519
the consequences of your decisions

4058
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:36,319
the more weight there is on the human

4059
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:38,399
mind to make that decision

4060
02:20:36,318 --> 02:20:40,719
and so like it becomes more and more

4061
02:20:38,398 --> 02:20:43,680
unlikely to make that decision for

4062
02:20:40,719 --> 02:20:46,959
humans for ai it feels like it's harder

4063
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:49,120
to encode that kind of weight

4064
02:20:46,959 --> 02:20:51,919
in a way the ai that we're currently

4065
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:53,520
building is automating statistics right

4066
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:55,840
intelligence is the ability to make

4067
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:58,319
models so you can act on them and ai is

4068
02:20:55,840 --> 02:21:00,559
the tool to make better models

4069
02:20:58,318 --> 02:21:04,239
so in principle if you're using ai

4070
02:21:00,559 --> 02:21:06,559
wisely you're able to prevent more harm

4071
02:21:04,239 --> 02:21:08,318
and i think that the main issue is is

4072
02:21:06,559 --> 02:21:10,159
not on the side of the ai it's on the

4073
02:21:08,318 --> 02:21:12,559
side of the human command hierarchy that

4074
02:21:10,159 --> 02:21:15,680
is using technology irresponsibly so the

4075
02:21:12,559 --> 02:21:17,600
question is how hard is it uh to encode

4076
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:19,680
to to pro to properly encode the right

4077
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:21,600
incentives into the ai so

4078
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:24,398
for instance there's this idea what

4079
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:26,800
happens if we let our airplanes be flown

4080
02:21:24,398 --> 02:21:28,959
with ai systems and the neural network

4081
02:21:26,799 --> 02:21:30,719
is a black box and so on and it turns

4082
02:21:28,959 --> 02:21:33,679
out our neural networks are actually not

4083
02:21:30,719 --> 02:21:35,599
black boxes anymore there are uh

4084
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:36,639
function approximators using linear

4085
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:38,479
algebra

4086
02:21:36,639 --> 02:21:41,199
and uh there are performing things that

4087
02:21:38,478 --> 02:21:42,799
we can understand but we can also

4088
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:44,880
instead of letting the neural network

4089
02:21:42,799 --> 02:21:46,559
fly the airplane use the neural network

4090
02:21:44,879 --> 02:21:49,358
to generate approval of the correct

4091
02:21:46,559 --> 02:21:51,680
program with the degree of accuracy of

4092
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:54,079
the proof that a human could not achieve

4093
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:56,398
right so we can use our ai by combining

4094
02:21:54,079 --> 02:21:57,920
different technologies to build systems

4095
02:21:56,398 --> 02:22:00,398
that are much more reliable than the

4096
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:03,840
systems that a human being could create

4097
02:22:00,398 --> 02:22:06,559
and so in in this sense i would say that

4098
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:10,398
if you use an early stage of technology

4099
02:22:06,559 --> 02:22:12,239
to save labor and don't employ employ

4100
02:22:10,398 --> 02:22:14,318
competent people but just to hack

4101
02:22:12,239 --> 02:22:15,840
something together because you can that

4102
02:22:14,318 --> 02:22:17,359
is very dangerous and if people are

4103
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:20,318
acting under these incentives that they

4104
02:22:17,359 --> 02:22:22,640
get away with delivering shoddy work

4105
02:22:20,318 --> 02:22:24,398
more cheaply using ai is less human

4106
02:22:22,639 --> 02:22:26,959
oversight than before that's very

4107
02:22:24,398 --> 02:22:29,279
dangerous the thing is though ai is

4108
02:22:26,959 --> 02:22:30,959
still going to be unreliable perhaps

4109
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:33,840
less so than humans but it'll be

4110
02:22:30,959 --> 02:22:35,199
unreliable in novel ways

4111
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:37,120
and

4112
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:38,640
yeah but this is an empirical question

4113
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:41,760
and it's something that we can figure

4114
02:22:38,639 --> 02:22:44,159
out and work with so the issue is do we

4115
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:45,840
trust the systems the social systems

4116
02:22:44,159 --> 02:22:47,920
that we have in place and the social

4117
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:50,398
systems that we can build and maintain

4118
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:53,280
that they're able to use ai responsibly

4119
02:22:50,398 --> 02:22:54,879
if they can then ai is good news if they

4120
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:57,120
cannot then it's going to make the

4121
02:22:54,879 --> 02:22:59,358
existing problems worse

4122
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:01,200
well and also who creates the ai who

4123
02:22:59,359 --> 02:23:03,520
controls it who makes money from it

4124
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:05,600
because it's ultimately humans and then

4125
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:07,840
you start talking about how much you

4126
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:09,920
trust the humans so the question is what

4127
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:12,318
does who mean i don't think that we have

4128
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:14,478
identity per se i think that these the

4129
02:23:12,318 --> 02:23:15,439
story of a human being is somewhat

4130
02:23:14,478 --> 02:23:17,199
random

4131
02:23:15,439 --> 02:23:19,280
what happens is more or less that

4132
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:20,720
everybody is acting on their local

4133
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:23,120
incentives but they're perceived to be

4134
02:23:20,719 --> 02:23:25,519
their incentives and the question is

4135
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:26,560
what are the incentives that the one

4136
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:28,560
that is

4137
02:23:26,559 --> 02:23:30,318
pressing the button is operating under

4138
02:23:28,559 --> 02:23:31,840
yeah

4139
02:23:30,318 --> 02:23:33,920
it's nice for those incentives to be

4140
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:35,520
transparent so

4141
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:37,680
for example i'll give i'll give you

4142
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:40,079
examples there seems to be a significant

4143
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:41,359
uh distrust of um

4144
02:23:40,079 --> 02:23:42,239
a

4145
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:44,880
tech

4146
02:23:42,239 --> 02:23:46,639
like entrepreneurs in the tech space or

4147
02:23:44,879 --> 02:23:49,920
or people that run for example social

4148
02:23:46,639 --> 02:23:52,478
media companies like mark zuckerberg

4149
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:54,159
there's not a complete transparency of

4150
02:23:52,478 --> 02:23:56,000
incentives under

4151
02:23:54,159 --> 02:23:58,159
which that particular human being

4152
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,680
operates

4153
02:23:58,159 --> 02:24:01,760
the tren you know we can listen to the

4154
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:04,318
words he says or what the marketing team

4155
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:06,478
says for a company but we don't know and

4156
02:24:04,318 --> 02:24:08,959
that's that's becomes a problem when

4157
02:24:06,478 --> 02:24:10,398
that the algorithms and the systems

4158
02:24:08,959 --> 02:24:12,799
created by

4159
02:24:10,398 --> 02:24:15,119
uh him and other people

4160
02:24:12,799 --> 02:24:17,119
in that company start having more and

4161
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:20,079
more impact on society

4162
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:21,840
and that it starts you know if if the

4163
02:24:20,079 --> 02:24:25,039
incentives were somehow

4164
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:27,359
the definition and the explainability of

4165
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:29,520
the incentives was um

4166
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:30,880
decentralized such that no nobody can

4167
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:32,560
manipulate it

4168
02:24:30,879 --> 02:24:35,119
no propaganda

4169
02:24:32,559 --> 02:24:37,039
uh type manipulation of

4170
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:39,200
like how these systems actually operate

4171
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:42,080
could be done then yes

4172
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:44,319
it'd be not it i think i think ai could

4173
02:24:42,079 --> 02:24:47,039
achieve um

4174
02:24:44,318 --> 02:24:48,318
much fairer much more effective

4175
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:49,200
uh

4176
02:24:48,318 --> 02:24:52,000
sort of

4177
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:54,079
uh like solutions to to to difficult

4178
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:55,760
ethical problems but when there's like

4179
02:24:54,079 --> 02:24:58,478
humans in the loop

4180
02:24:55,760 --> 02:25:00,478
manipulating the

4181
02:24:58,478 --> 02:25:02,559
the the dissemination the communication

4182
02:25:00,478 --> 02:25:04,398
of how the system actually works that

4183
02:25:02,559 --> 02:25:06,719
feels like you can run to a lot of

4184
02:25:04,398 --> 02:25:08,879
trouble and that's why there's currently

4185
02:25:06,719 --> 02:25:10,559
a lot of distrust for for people at the

4186
02:25:08,879 --> 02:25:13,759
heads of companies that have

4187
02:25:10,559 --> 02:25:16,159
increasingly powerful ai systems

4188
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:18,239
i suspect what happened traditionally in

4189
02:25:16,159 --> 02:25:19,840
the u.s was that since our decision

4190
02:25:18,239 --> 02:25:22,000
making is much more central a

4191
02:25:19,840 --> 02:25:24,079
decentralized than in authoritarian

4192
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,760
state right people are making decisions

4193
02:25:24,079 --> 02:25:28,639
autonomously at many many levels in a

4194
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:30,880
society what happened that was uh we

4195
02:25:28,639 --> 02:25:33,519
created coherence and cohesion in

4196
02:25:30,879 --> 02:25:35,199
society by controlling what people

4197
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:37,520
thought and what information they had

4198
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:38,560
right the media synchronized public

4199
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:40,239
opinion

4200
02:25:38,559 --> 02:25:42,639
and social media have disrupted this

4201
02:25:40,239 --> 02:25:44,879
it's not i think so much russian

4202
02:25:42,639 --> 02:25:47,279
influence or something it's everybody's

4203
02:25:44,879 --> 02:25:49,759
influence it's that a random person can

4204
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:52,960
come up with a conspiracy theory and

4205
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:55,520
disrupt what people think and if that

4206
02:25:52,959 --> 02:25:58,079
conspiracy theory is more compelling or

4207
02:25:55,520 --> 02:26:00,159
more attractive than the standardized

4208
02:25:58,079 --> 02:26:01,760
public conspiracy theory that we give

4209
02:26:00,159 --> 02:26:03,359
people as a default

4210
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:04,960
then it might get more traction right

4211
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:07,359
you suddenly have the situation that the

4212
02:26:04,959 --> 02:26:11,039
single individual somewhere on a farm in

4213
02:26:07,359 --> 02:26:12,960
texas has more listeners than cnn

4214
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:13,720
which particular farmer you're referring

4215
02:26:12,959 --> 02:26:16,879
to in texas

4216
02:26:13,719 --> 02:26:19,039
[Laughter]

4217
02:26:16,879 --> 02:26:20,799
i probably know

4218
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:21,680
yes i had dinner with him a couple times

4219
02:26:20,799 --> 02:26:23,358
okay

4220
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:25,120
right this is an interesting situation

4221
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:27,439
because you cannot get to be an anchor

4222
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:29,840
and cnn if you don't go through a

4223
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:31,600
complete uh complicated gatekeeping

4224
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:34,478
process and suddenly you have random

4225
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:37,120
people without that gatekeeping process

4226
02:26:34,478 --> 02:26:38,559
uh just optimizing for attention

4227
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:40,640
not necessarily with a lot of

4228
02:26:38,559 --> 02:26:41,439
responsibility for the long-term effects

4229
02:26:40,639 --> 02:26:42,959
of

4230
02:26:41,439 --> 02:26:45,840
projecting these theories into the

4231
02:26:42,959 --> 02:26:47,438
public and now uh there is a push of

4232
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:49,040
making social media more like

4233
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:51,359
traditional media which means that the

4234
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:53,359
opinion that is being projected in

4235
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:55,760
social media is more limited to an

4236
02:26:53,359 --> 02:26:58,479
acceptable range with the goal of

4237
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:59,920
getting society into safe waters and

4238
02:26:58,478 --> 02:27:02,079
increase the stability and cohesion of

4239
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:04,239
society again which i think is a

4240
02:27:02,079 --> 02:27:06,639
laudable goal but of course it also is

4241
02:27:04,239 --> 02:27:08,239
an opportunity to seize the means of

4242
02:27:06,639 --> 02:27:10,398
indoctrination

4243
02:27:08,239 --> 02:27:12,318
and the incentives that people are under

4244
02:27:10,398 --> 02:27:14,079
when they do this are

4245
02:27:12,318 --> 02:27:17,039
in such a way that

4246
02:27:14,079 --> 02:27:18,879
the ai ethics that we would need

4247
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:20,800
becomes very often

4248
02:27:18,879 --> 02:27:23,358
something like ai politics which is

4249
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:24,719
basically partisan and ideological and

4250
02:27:23,359 --> 02:27:26,720
this means that

4251
02:27:24,719 --> 02:27:28,398
whatever one side says another side is

4252
02:27:26,719 --> 02:27:31,039
going to be disagreeing with right in

4253
02:27:28,398 --> 02:27:33,199
the same way as when you turn masks or

4254
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:35,600
the vaccine into a political issue if

4255
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,359
you say that it is politically virtuous

4256
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:39,200
to get vaccinated it will mean that the

4257
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:40,960
people that don't like you

4258
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:42,960
will not want to get vaccinated right

4259
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:46,079
and as soon as you have this partisan

4260
02:27:42,959 --> 02:27:47,358
discourse it's going to be very hard to

4261
02:27:46,079 --> 02:27:49,120
make the right decisions because the

4262
02:27:47,359 --> 02:27:51,359
incentives get to be the wrong ones ai

4263
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:53,280
ethics needs to be super boring it needs

4264
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:56,479
to be done by people who do statistics

4265
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:58,880
all the time and have extremely boring

4266
02:27:56,478 --> 02:28:00,159
long-winded discussions that most people

4267
02:27:58,879 --> 02:28:02,398
cannot follow because they are too

4268
02:28:00,159 --> 02:28:04,239
complicated but that are that serious

4269
02:28:02,398 --> 02:28:06,239
these people need to be able to to be

4270
02:28:04,239 --> 02:28:08,239
better at statistics than the leading

4271
02:28:06,239 --> 02:28:09,280
machine learning researchers and at the

4272
02:28:08,239 --> 02:28:12,000
moment

4273
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:14,079
the ia ethics the debate is the one but

4274
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:16,719
you don't have any barrier to entry

4275
02:28:14,079 --> 02:28:18,318
right everybody who has a strong opinion

4276
02:28:16,719 --> 02:28:21,279
and is able to signal that opinion in

4277
02:28:18,318 --> 02:28:21,279
the right strong words

4278
02:28:22,079 --> 02:28:24,318
and

4279
02:28:22,719 --> 02:28:25,760
to me that is a very frustrating thing

4280
02:28:24,318 --> 02:28:28,239
because the field is so crucially

4281
02:28:25,760 --> 02:28:29,760
important to us so crucially important

4282
02:28:28,239 --> 02:28:31,600
but

4283
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:33,520
uh the only qualification you currently

4284
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:34,720
need is to be outraged by the injustice

4285
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:36,720
in the world

4286
02:28:34,719 --> 02:28:38,959
it's more complicated right everybody

4287
02:28:36,719 --> 02:28:40,719
seems to be outraged but

4288
02:28:38,959 --> 02:28:42,159
so let's just say that the incentives

4289
02:28:40,719 --> 02:28:44,799
are not always the right ones so

4290
02:28:42,159 --> 02:28:47,039
basically i i suspect that

4291
02:28:44,799 --> 02:28:49,039
a lot of people that enter this debate

4292
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:50,640
don't have a vision for what society

4293
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:52,319
should be looking like in a way that is

4294
02:28:50,639 --> 02:28:55,519
non-violent where we preserve liberal

4295
02:28:52,318 --> 02:28:57,359
democracy where we make sure that we all

4296
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:59,359
get along and

4297
02:28:57,359 --> 02:29:00,399
we are around in a few hundred years

4298
02:28:59,359 --> 02:29:02,159
from now

4299
02:29:00,398 --> 02:29:04,799
preferably with a comfortable

4300
02:29:02,159 --> 02:29:07,119
technological civilization around us

4301
02:29:04,799 --> 02:29:10,639
i i generally

4302
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:12,479
have a very foggy view of that world but

4303
02:29:10,639 --> 02:29:14,959
i tend to try to follow and i think

4304
02:29:12,478 --> 02:29:17,279
society should in some degree follow

4305
02:29:14,959 --> 02:29:18,959
the gradient of love increasing the

4306
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:21,280
amount of love in the world

4307
02:29:18,959 --> 02:29:23,679
and whenever i see different policies or

4308
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:24,479
algorithms or ideas that are not doing

4309
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:26,800
so

4310
02:29:24,478 --> 02:29:27,920
obviously that that's the ones that kind

4311
02:29:26,799 --> 02:29:30,079
of resist

4312
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:32,478
so the thing that terrifies me about

4313
02:29:30,079 --> 02:29:35,600
this notion is i think that

4314
02:29:32,478 --> 02:29:37,760
german fascism was driven by love

4315
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:39,680
it was just a very selective love

4316
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:41,840
it was a love that now you're just

4317
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:43,120
manipulating i mean that's

4318
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:45,680
i

4319
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:49,040
it's you have to be very careful uh

4320
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:51,280
you're talking to the wrong person

4321
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:53,680
in this way about love so let's talk

4322
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:56,159
about what love is and i think that love

4323
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:58,559
is the discovery of shared purpose it's

4324
02:29:56,159 --> 02:29:59,600
the recognition of the sacred and the

4325
02:29:58,559 --> 02:30:01,199
other

4326
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:02,800
and this enables non-transactional

4327
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:04,479
interactions

4328
02:30:02,799 --> 02:30:07,679
but the

4329
02:30:04,478 --> 02:30:09,760
the size of the other that you include

4330
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:11,439
needs to be maximized

4331
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:12,960
so it's

4332
02:30:11,439 --> 02:30:14,639
it's basically

4333
02:30:12,959 --> 02:30:16,839
appreciation

4334
02:30:14,639 --> 02:30:18,959
like deep appreciation

4335
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:21,359
of uh

4336
02:30:18,959 --> 02:30:23,679
the world around you fully

4337
02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:25,200
like um

4338
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:26,720
including the people that are very

4339
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:28,720
different than you people that disagree

4340
02:30:26,719 --> 02:30:30,799
with you completely including people

4341
02:30:28,719 --> 02:30:33,519
including living creatures outside of

4342
02:30:30,799 --> 02:30:34,318
just people include including ideas and

4343
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:36,960
it's like

4344
02:30:34,318 --> 02:30:40,398
appreciation of the full mess of it and

4345
02:30:36,959 --> 02:30:42,719
also it has to do with like empathy

4346
02:30:40,398 --> 02:30:44,000
which is coupled with a lack of

4347
02:30:42,719 --> 02:30:45,840
confidence

4348
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,920
uncertainty about

4349
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:50,478
of your own rightness it's like an open

4350
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:52,398
a radical open-mindedness to the way

4351
02:30:50,478 --> 02:30:55,119
forward i agree with every part of what

4352
02:30:52,398 --> 02:30:58,079
you said and now if you scale it up what

4353
02:30:55,120 --> 02:31:01,280
you recognize is that life is in some

4354
02:30:58,079 --> 02:31:03,200
sense the service to a next level agency

4355
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:05,840
to the highest level agency that you can

4356
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:07,760
recognize it could be for instance life

4357
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:10,159
on earth or beyond that

4358
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:12,000
really you could say intelligent

4359
02:31:10,159 --> 02:31:14,799
complexity in the universe that you try

4360
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:16,719
to maximize in a certain way but when

4361
02:31:14,799 --> 02:31:18,879
you think it's true it basically means a

4362
02:31:16,719 --> 02:31:20,719
certain aesthetic

4363
02:31:18,879 --> 02:31:22,799
and there is not one possible aesthetic

4364
02:31:20,719 --> 02:31:24,959
there are many possible aesthetics and

4365
02:31:22,799 --> 02:31:27,119
once you project an aesthetic into the

4366
02:31:24,959 --> 02:31:29,519
future you can see that there are some

4367
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:31,680
which uh defect from it which are in

4368
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:33,280
conflict with it that are corrupt that

4369
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:35,120
are evil

4370
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:36,960
right you and me would probably agree

4371
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:38,800
that hitler was evil

4372
02:31:36,959 --> 02:31:40,959
because uh the aesthetic of the world

4373
02:31:38,799 --> 02:31:42,318
that he wanted is in conflict with the

4374
02:31:40,959 --> 02:31:44,559
aesthetic of the world that you and me

4375
02:31:42,318 --> 02:31:46,079
have in mind yeah

4376
02:31:44,559 --> 02:31:48,639
and

4377
02:31:46,079 --> 02:31:50,559
so they think that he destroyed we we

4378
02:31:48,639 --> 02:31:52,959
want to keep them in the world

4379
02:31:50,559 --> 02:31:55,359
there there's a kind of

4380
02:31:52,959 --> 02:31:57,199
uh there's kind of ways to deal i mean

4381
02:31:55,359 --> 02:31:59,280
hitler is an easier case but perhaps he

4382
02:31:57,200 --> 02:32:00,399
wasn't so easy in the 30s right to

4383
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:02,319
understand

4384
02:32:00,398 --> 02:32:03,279
who is hitler and who is not

4385
02:32:02,318 --> 02:32:04,879
no

4386
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:06,560
there was no consensus that the

4387
02:32:04,879 --> 02:32:09,839
aesthetics that he had in mind were

4388
02:32:06,559 --> 02:32:10,959
unacceptable yeah i mean it's difficult

4389
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:12,880
a lot

4390
02:32:10,959 --> 02:32:14,159
love is complicated

4391
02:32:12,879 --> 02:32:15,599
because

4392
02:32:14,159 --> 02:32:19,039
you can't just be

4393
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:20,640
uh so open-minded that you let eva walk

4394
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:24,399
into the door

4395
02:32:20,639 --> 02:32:25,760
but you can't be so self-self-assured

4396
02:32:24,398 --> 02:32:28,159
that

4397
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:29,520
um you you can always identify evil

4398
02:32:28,159 --> 02:32:31,200
perfectly

4399
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:32,720
because that's what leads to nazi

4400
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:34,479
germany

4401
02:32:32,719 --> 02:32:36,478
having a certainty of what isn't wasn't

4402
02:32:34,478 --> 02:32:38,639
evil like always drawing lines of good

4403
02:32:36,478 --> 02:32:41,519
versus evil

4404
02:32:38,639 --> 02:32:45,358
there seems to be a

4405
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:45,359
there has to be a dance between

4406
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:47,840
um

4407
02:32:46,959 --> 02:32:50,398
like

4408
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:53,040
hard stances extending up against what

4409
02:32:50,398 --> 02:32:56,239
is wrong and at the same time

4410
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:58,080
empathy and open-mindedness of

4411
02:32:56,239 --> 02:33:00,159
towards not knowing

4412
02:32:58,079 --> 02:33:02,398
what is right and wrong and like a dance

4413
02:33:00,159 --> 02:33:04,398
between those i found that when i watch

4414
02:33:02,398 --> 02:33:06,398
the miyazaki movies that there is nobody

4415
02:33:04,398 --> 02:33:07,760
who captures my spirituality as well as

4416
02:33:06,398 --> 02:33:10,318
he does

4417
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:12,478
it's very interesting and just wishes

4418
02:33:10,318 --> 02:33:14,318
right there is something going on in his

4419
02:33:12,478 --> 02:33:17,039
movies that is very interesting so for

4420
02:33:14,318 --> 02:33:20,000
instance mononoker is discussing

4421
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:22,560
not only an answer to

4422
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:25,120
disney's simplistic notion of mowgli the

4423
02:33:22,559 --> 02:33:26,879
jungle boy was raised by wolves and as

4424
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:29,760
soon as he sees people realizes that

4425
02:33:26,879 --> 02:33:31,839
he's one of them and

4426
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:34,159
the way in which the

4427
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:36,318
moral life and nature is simplified and

4428
02:33:34,159 --> 02:33:37,840
romanticized and turned into kitsch

4429
02:33:36,318 --> 02:33:40,239
right it's disgusting in the disney

4430
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:42,398
movie and he answers to this you see

4431
02:33:40,239 --> 02:33:44,079
he's replaced by mononoker this wolf

4432
02:33:42,398 --> 02:33:46,159
girl who was raised by wolves and who is

4433
02:33:44,079 --> 02:33:48,079
fierce and dangerous and

4434
02:33:46,159 --> 02:33:50,000
who cannot be socialized because he

4435
02:33:48,079 --> 02:33:52,318
cannot be tamed it cannot be part of

4436
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,520
human society and you see human society

4437
02:33:52,318 --> 02:33:55,680
it's something that is very very

4438
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:58,479
complicated you see people extracting

4439
02:33:55,680 --> 02:34:02,000
resources and destroying nature but the

4440
02:33:58,478 --> 02:34:04,639
purpose is not to be evil uh but to be

4441
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:07,120
able to have a life that is free from

4442
02:34:04,639 --> 02:34:10,719
for instance oppression and violence

4443
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:13,120
and uh to curb death and disease

4444
02:34:10,719 --> 02:34:14,879
and you basically see this conflict

4445
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:16,720
which cannot be resolved in a certain

4446
02:34:14,879 --> 02:34:19,358
way you see this moment when nature is

4447
02:34:16,719 --> 02:34:21,679
turned into a garden and it loses most

4448
02:34:19,359 --> 02:34:23,439
of what it actually is and humans no

4449
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:25,840
longer submitting to life and death and

4450
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:28,559
nature and to these questions there is

4451
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:30,079
no easy answer so it just turns it into

4452
02:34:28,559 --> 02:34:32,000
something that is being observed as a

4453
02:34:30,079 --> 02:34:33,799
journey that happens and that happens

4454
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:36,239
with a certain degree of

4455
02:34:33,799 --> 02:34:38,159
inevitability and the nice thing about

4456
02:34:36,239 --> 02:34:39,920
all his movies is there's a certain main

4457
02:34:38,159 --> 02:34:41,119
character and it's the same in all

4458
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:43,359
movies

4459
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:46,319
it's this little girl

4460
02:34:43,359 --> 02:34:49,840
that is basically heidi and i suspect

4461
02:34:46,318 --> 02:34:52,159
that happened because he when he did um

4462
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:54,318
field work for working on the heidi

4463
02:34:52,159 --> 02:34:56,318
movies back then the heidi animations

4464
02:34:54,318 --> 02:34:58,559
before he did his own movies he

4465
02:34:56,318 --> 02:35:01,199
traveled to switzerland and south uh

4466
02:34:58,559 --> 02:35:03,439
western southeastern europe and adriatic

4467
02:35:01,200 --> 02:35:04,960
and so on and got an idea about a

4468
02:35:03,439 --> 02:35:06,880
certain aesthetic and a certain way of

4469
02:35:04,959 --> 02:35:08,000
life that informed is his future

4470
02:35:06,879 --> 02:35:09,599
thinking

4471
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,959
and heidi has a very interesting

4472
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:13,120
relationship

4473
02:35:10,959 --> 02:35:14,559
to herself and to the world

4474
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:15,760
there is nothing that she takes for

4475
02:35:14,559 --> 02:35:17,680
herself

4476
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:20,239
she is in a way fearless because she is

4477
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:22,239
committed to a service to a greater

4478
02:35:20,239 --> 02:35:24,959
whole basically she is completely

4479
02:35:22,239 --> 02:35:26,719
committed to serving god it is not

4480
02:35:24,959 --> 02:35:29,119
an institutionalized god it has nothing

4481
02:35:26,719 --> 02:35:31,199
to do with the roman catholic church or

4482
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:33,280
uh something like this but in some sense

4483
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:35,680
heidi is an embodiment of the spirit of

4484
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:37,760
europea protestantism

4485
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:40,559
it's this idea of a being that is

4486
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:43,200
completely perfect and pure and it's not

4487
02:35:40,559 --> 02:35:45,359
a feminist vision because

4488
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:48,560
she is

4489
02:35:45,359 --> 02:35:51,280
not a girl boss or something like this

4490
02:35:48,559 --> 02:35:53,680
she is the justification for the men in

4491
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:55,200
the audience to protect her to build the

4492
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:56,239
civilization around her that makes her

4493
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:58,000
possible

4494
02:35:56,239 --> 02:36:00,559
right so she is not uh just the

4495
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:02,639
sacrifice of jesus who is innocent and

4496
02:36:00,559 --> 02:36:04,478
therefore nailed to the cross

4497
02:36:02,639 --> 02:36:07,039
she is not being sacrificed he is being

4498
02:36:04,478 --> 02:36:08,719
protected by everybody around her who

4499
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:10,399
recognizes that she is sacred and there

4500
02:36:08,719 --> 02:36:11,760
are enough around her to

4501
02:36:10,398 --> 02:36:13,358
to see that

4502
02:36:11,760 --> 02:36:15,120
right so this is a very interesting

4503
02:36:13,359 --> 02:36:17,520
perspective there is a certain notion of

4504
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:19,040
innocence and this notion of innocence

4505
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:21,280
is not universal it's not in all

4506
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:24,560
cultures right hitler was an innocent

4507
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:26,000
his idea of it of germany was not that

4508
02:36:24,559 --> 02:36:28,000
there is a innocence that is being

4509
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:30,159
protected there was a predator that was

4510
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:31,439
going to triumph yeah and it's also

4511
02:36:30,159 --> 02:36:32,959
something that is not at the core of

4512
02:36:31,439 --> 02:36:34,880
every religion there are many religions

4513
02:36:32,959 --> 02:36:38,000
which don't care about innocence they

4514
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:40,559
might care about um increasing

4515
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:43,120
the the status of something

4516
02:36:40,559 --> 02:36:45,680
right and that's a very interesting

4517
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:47,920
notion that is quite unique and not

4518
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:50,239
claiming it's the optimal one it's just

4519
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:52,879
a particular kind of aesthetic which i

4520
02:36:50,239 --> 02:36:55,439
think makes miyazaki into the most

4521
02:36:52,879 --> 02:36:58,079
relevant protestant philosopher today

4522
02:36:55,439 --> 02:37:00,318
and you're saying in terms of

4523
02:36:58,079 --> 02:37:02,840
of all the of all the ways that society

4524
02:37:00,318 --> 02:37:05,920
can operate perhaps the preservation of

4525
02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:07,040
innocence um might be one might be one

4526
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:09,680
of the best

4527
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:11,200
no it's just uh my aesthetic

4528
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:13,520
so you're aesthetic it's

4529
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:14,960
it's a particular way in which i feel

4530
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:16,720
that i relate to the world that is

4531
02:37:14,959 --> 02:37:19,039
natural to my own socialization and

4532
02:37:16,719 --> 02:37:22,318
maybe it's not an accident that i uh

4533
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:24,640
have cultural roots in europe yeah

4534
02:37:22,318 --> 02:37:26,559
in a particular world and yeah so

4535
02:37:24,639 --> 02:37:28,159
maybe it's a natural convergence point

4536
02:37:26,559 --> 02:37:31,519
and it's not something that you will

4537
02:37:28,159 --> 02:37:33,920
find in all other times in history

4538
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:37,760
i'd like to ask you about solzhenitsyn

4539
02:37:33,920 --> 02:37:40,960
and our individual role as ants in this

4540
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:42,398
very large society so he says that uh

4541
02:37:40,959 --> 02:37:44,559
some version of the line between good

4542
02:37:42,398 --> 02:37:46,398
and evil runs to the heart of every man

4543
02:37:44,559 --> 02:37:48,719
do you think all of us are capable of

4544
02:37:46,398 --> 02:37:52,478
good and evil like

4545
02:37:48,719 --> 02:37:52,478
what's our role in this play

4546
02:37:52,879 --> 02:37:58,879
uh in this game we're all playing

4547
02:37:55,520 --> 02:38:00,960
is all of us capable to play any role

4548
02:37:58,879 --> 02:38:02,639
like is there an ultimate responsibility

4549
02:38:00,959 --> 02:38:04,478
to um

4550
02:38:02,639 --> 02:38:05,680
you mentioned maintaining innocence or

4551
02:38:04,478 --> 02:38:07,920
whatever the

4552
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:09,040
whatever the highest ideal for a society

4553
02:38:07,920 --> 02:38:11,120
you want

4554
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:14,479
are all of us capable of living up to

4555
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:16,000
that and that's our responsibility or or

4556
02:38:14,478 --> 02:38:17,920
is there significant limitations to what

4557
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:20,478
we're able to do in terms of good

4558
02:38:17,920 --> 02:38:20,478
and evil

4559
02:38:21,280 --> 02:38:26,800
so there is a certain way if you are not

4560
02:38:23,439 --> 02:38:29,280
terrible if you are committed to

4561
02:38:26,799 --> 02:38:31,039
some kind of civilizational agency

4562
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:33,840
a next level agent that you are serving

4563
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:35,760
some kind of transcendent principle

4564
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:37,439
uh in the eyes of that transcendental

4565
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:39,359
principle you are able to discern good

4566
02:38:37,439 --> 02:38:41,200
from evil otherwise you cannot otherwise

4567
02:38:39,359 --> 02:38:43,200
you have just individual aesthetics

4568
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:45,359
right the cat that is torturing a mouse

4569
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:48,640
is not evil because the cat does not

4570
02:38:45,359 --> 02:38:50,800
envision or no part of the world

4571
02:38:48,639 --> 02:38:52,318
of the cat is envisioning a world where

4572
02:38:50,799 --> 02:38:54,478
there is no violence and nobody is

4573
02:38:52,318 --> 02:38:56,000
suffering yeah right if you have an

4574
02:38:54,478 --> 02:38:58,318
aesthetic where you want to protect

4575
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:00,799
innocence then torturing

4576
02:38:58,318 --> 02:39:02,639
somebody needlessly is evil

4577
02:39:00,799 --> 02:39:04,719
but only then

4578
02:39:02,639 --> 02:39:06,959
no but within i guess the question is

4579
02:39:04,719 --> 02:39:08,318
within the aesthetic like within

4580
02:39:06,959 --> 02:39:10,559
your

4581
02:39:08,318 --> 02:39:12,000
sense of what is good and evil are we

4582
02:39:10,559 --> 02:39:13,519
still

4583
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:17,120
it seems like

4584
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:19,280
we're still able to uh commit evil

4585
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:21,200
yes so basically if you are committing

4586
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:23,359
to this next level agent you are not

4587
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:24,800
necessarily are this next level agent

4588
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:27,280
right you are part of it you have a

4589
02:39:24,799 --> 02:39:30,079
relationship to it like a cell does to

4590
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:31,680
its organism it's hyper organism and it

4591
02:39:30,079 --> 02:39:34,559
only exists to the degree that it's

4592
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:35,920
being implemented by you and others

4593
02:39:34,559 --> 02:39:37,439
and

4594
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:39,600
that means that you're not completely

4595
02:39:37,439 --> 02:39:41,120
fully serving it you have freedom in

4596
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:43,439
what you decide whether you are acting

4597
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:45,920
on your impulses and local incentives on

4598
02:39:43,439 --> 02:39:47,840
your feral impulses so to speak or

4599
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:50,879
whether you're committing to it and what

4600
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:53,200
you perceive then is a tension between

4601
02:39:50,879 --> 02:39:55,599
what you would be doing with respect to

4602
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:57,200
the thing that you uh recognize as the

4603
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:59,280
sacred if you do

4604
02:39:57,200 --> 02:40:01,600
and what you're actually doing and this

4605
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:03,359
is the line between good and evil right

4606
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:05,680
where you see oh i'm here acting on my

4607
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:07,359
local incentives or impulses

4608
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:08,800
and here i'm acting on what i consider

4609
02:40:07,359 --> 02:40:10,960
to be sacred and there's a tension

4610
02:40:08,799 --> 02:40:12,959
between those and this is the line

4611
02:40:10,959 --> 02:40:14,318
between good and evil that might run

4612
02:40:12,959 --> 02:40:16,159
through your heart

4613
02:40:14,318 --> 02:40:17,359
and if you don't have that if you don't

4614
02:40:16,159 --> 02:40:19,279
have this relationship to a

4615
02:40:17,359 --> 02:40:20,960
transcendental agent you could call this

4616
02:40:19,279 --> 02:40:23,040
relationship to the next level agent

4617
02:40:20,959 --> 02:40:25,278
soul right it's not a thing it's not an

4618
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:26,640
immortal thing that is intrinsically

4619
02:40:25,279 --> 02:40:28,319
valuable it's a certain kind of

4620
02:40:26,639 --> 02:40:30,239
relationship that you project to

4621
02:40:28,318 --> 02:40:31,920
understand what's happening somebody is

4622
02:40:30,239 --> 02:40:33,199
serving this transcendental sacredness

4623
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:34,799
or they're not

4624
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:38,079
if you don't have your soul you cannot

4625
02:40:34,799 --> 02:40:40,398
be evil you're just a complex

4626
02:40:38,079 --> 02:40:42,719
natural phenomenon so if you look at

4627
02:40:40,398 --> 02:40:46,000
life like starting today or starting

4628
02:40:42,719 --> 02:40:48,478
tomorrow when we leave here today

4629
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:51,680
there's a bunch of trajectories that you

4630
02:40:48,478 --> 02:40:51,679
can take through life

4631
02:40:51,840 --> 02:40:57,279
may be countless

4632
02:40:53,760 --> 02:41:00,000
do you think some of these trajectories

4633
02:40:57,279 --> 02:41:04,239
in your own conception of yourself some

4634
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:06,799
of those trajectories are the ideal life

4635
02:41:04,239 --> 02:41:09,600
a life that uh if you were to be the

4636
02:41:06,799 --> 02:41:11,920
hero of your life story

4637
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:14,399
you would want to be like is there some

4638
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:16,000
joshua bach that you're striving to be

4639
02:41:14,398 --> 02:41:17,680
like this is the question i ask myself

4640
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:19,520
as an individual

4641
02:41:17,680 --> 02:41:21,040
trying to make

4642
02:41:19,520 --> 02:41:22,479
a better world in the best way that i

4643
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:24,720
could conceive of

4644
02:41:22,478 --> 02:41:26,719
what is my responsibility there

4645
02:41:24,719 --> 02:41:31,039
and how much am i responsible for the

4646
02:41:26,719 --> 02:41:33,840
failure to do so because i'm a i'm i'm

4647
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:35,680
lazy and incompetent too often

4648
02:41:33,840 --> 02:41:37,200
in my own perception

4649
02:41:35,680 --> 02:41:38,239
in my own worldview i'm not very

4650
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:41,040
important

4651
02:41:38,239 --> 02:41:43,439
so it's uh i don't have place for me as

4652
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:45,920
a hero in my own world

4653
02:41:43,439 --> 02:41:48,079
i'm trying to do the best that i can

4654
02:41:45,920 --> 02:41:49,279
which is often not very good

4655
02:41:48,079 --> 02:41:52,159
and

4656
02:41:49,279 --> 02:41:55,439
so it's not important for me to to have

4657
02:41:52,159 --> 02:41:57,600
status or to be seen in a particular way

4658
02:41:55,439 --> 02:41:59,359
it's helpful if others can see me or a

4659
02:41:57,600 --> 02:42:01,439
few people can see me that can be my

4660
02:41:59,359 --> 02:42:04,399
friends no sorry i i want to clarify

4661
02:42:01,439 --> 02:42:06,159
that hero i didn't mean status or

4662
02:42:04,398 --> 02:42:07,599
perception or

4663
02:42:06,159 --> 02:42:10,398
uh like

4664
02:42:07,600 --> 02:42:14,000
uh some kind of marketing thing but more

4665
02:42:10,398 --> 02:42:16,959
in private in the quiet of your own mind

4666
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:19,040
is there the kind of man you want to be

4667
02:42:16,959 --> 02:42:20,318
and would consider it a failure if you

4668
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:22,240
don't become that

4669
02:42:20,318 --> 02:42:23,278
that's what i'm meant by hero yeah not

4670
02:42:22,239 --> 02:42:25,199
really

4671
02:42:23,279 --> 02:42:27,840
i don't perceive myself as having such

4672
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:27,840
an identity

4673
02:42:28,559 --> 02:42:34,478
and it's also sometimes frustrating

4674
02:42:32,239 --> 02:42:36,239
but it's basically a

4675
02:42:34,478 --> 02:42:39,199
lack of

4676
02:42:36,239 --> 02:42:42,398
of having this notion of father that i

4677
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:42,399
need to be emulating

4678
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:48,719
it's interesting it means the leaf

4679
02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:51,680
floating down the river

4680
02:42:48,719 --> 02:42:51,679
i worry that

4681
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:55,840
sometimes it's more like being the river

4682
02:42:58,959 --> 02:43:02,750
i'm just a

4683
02:43:00,398 --> 02:43:04,159
fat frog sitting in a leaf

4684
02:43:02,750 --> 02:43:09,079
[Music]

4685
02:43:04,159 --> 02:43:09,079
on a dirty muddy lake

4686
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:15,200
waiting for a princess to kiss me

4687
02:43:13,439 --> 02:43:18,559
or the other way i forgot which way it

4688
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:20,319
goes somebody kisses somebody

4689
02:43:18,559 --> 02:43:23,680
i can ask you i don't know if you know

4690
02:43:20,318 --> 02:43:25,920
who michael malus is but um

4691
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:28,559
in terms of constructing systems of

4692
02:43:25,920 --> 02:43:29,359
incentives it's it's uh interesting to

4693
02:43:28,559 --> 02:43:31,278
ask

4694
02:43:29,359 --> 02:43:33,120
i don't think i've talked to you about

4695
02:43:31,279 --> 02:43:36,560
this before

4696
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:40,240
malice espouses anarchism so he sees all

4697
02:43:36,559 --> 02:43:40,239
government as fundamentally

4698
02:43:40,639 --> 02:43:45,119
getting in the way or even being

4699
02:43:42,079 --> 02:43:45,120
destructive to

4700
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:49,680
collaborations between human beings

4701
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:51,200
thriving

4702
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:53,680
what do you think what's the role of

4703
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:55,439
government in a society

4704
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:56,800
that um

4705
02:43:55,439 --> 02:43:59,680
that thrives

4706
02:43:56,799 --> 02:44:01,759
is anarchism at all compelling to you

4707
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:03,279
as a system so like

4708
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:05,840
not just small government but no

4709
02:44:03,279 --> 02:44:09,359
government at all

4710
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:09,359
yeah i don't see how this would work

4711
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:14,079
the government is an agent that imposes

4712
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:16,559
an offset on your reward

4713
02:44:14,079 --> 02:44:18,639
function on your payout matrix so it

4714
02:44:16,559 --> 02:44:20,799
your behavior becomes compatible with

4715
02:44:18,639 --> 02:44:22,719
the common good

4716
02:44:20,799 --> 02:44:24,639
so the argument there

4717
02:44:22,719 --> 02:44:26,318
is that you can have

4718
02:44:24,639 --> 02:44:28,000
collectives like

4719
02:44:26,318 --> 02:44:29,760
governing organizations but not

4720
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,959
government like where you're born in a

4721
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:32,478
particular

4722
02:44:30,959 --> 02:44:35,119
set of land

4723
02:44:32,478 --> 02:44:36,318
and therefore you must follow this

4724
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:38,399
uh

4725
02:44:36,318 --> 02:44:41,840
rule or else

4726
02:44:38,398 --> 02:44:43,039
you're forced by what they call violence

4727
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:45,279
because there's

4728
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:47,680
there's an implied violence here so what

4729
02:44:45,279 --> 02:44:49,279
government the key the key aspect of

4730
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:50,880
government is

4731
02:44:49,279 --> 02:44:53,200
is it uh

4732
02:44:50,879 --> 02:44:54,559
protects you from the rest of the world

4733
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:57,040
with an army

4734
02:44:54,559 --> 02:44:57,920
and with with police right so there's

4735
02:44:57,040 --> 02:45:00,399
this

4736
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:02,159
it has a monopoly on violence it's the

4737
02:45:00,398 --> 02:45:03,680
only one that's able to do violence

4738
02:45:02,159 --> 02:45:06,000
there are many forms of government not

4739
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:09,520
all governments do that right but we uh

4740
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:11,040
find that in the in successful countries

4741
02:45:09,520 --> 02:45:12,720
the government has a monopoly on

4742
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:15,359
violence

4743
02:45:12,719 --> 02:45:16,959
and uh that means that you cannot get

4744
02:45:15,359 --> 02:45:18,720
ahead by starting your own army because

4745
02:45:16,959 --> 02:45:21,199
the government will come down on you and

4746
02:45:18,719 --> 02:45:22,879
destroy you if you try to do that and in

4747
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:24,800
countries where you can build your own

4748
02:45:22,879 --> 02:45:26,799
army and get away with it some people

4749
02:45:24,799 --> 02:45:30,000
will do it right in these countries is

4750
02:45:26,799 --> 02:45:31,199
what we call failed countries in a way

4751
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:33,439
and

4752
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:35,439
you if you don't want to have violence

4753
02:45:33,439 --> 02:45:37,760
the point is not to appeal to the moral

4754
02:45:35,439 --> 02:45:39,920
intentions of people because some people

4755
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:41,840
will use strategies if they get ahead

4756
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:43,600
with them that feel a particular kind of

4757
02:45:41,840 --> 02:45:45,200
ecological niche so you need to destroy

4758
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:46,559
that ecological niche

4759
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:49,520
and if a

4760
02:45:46,559 --> 02:45:51,359
affective government has a monopoly on

4761
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:53,760
violence it can create a world where

4762
02:45:51,359 --> 02:45:56,000
nobody is able to use violence and get

4763
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:57,840
ahead right so you want to use that

4764
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:00,079
monopoly on violence not to exert

4765
02:45:57,840 --> 02:46:03,200
violence but to make violence impossible

4766
02:46:00,079 --> 02:46:06,000
to raise the cost of violence so people

4767
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:08,240
need to get ahead with nonviolent means

4768
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:10,879
so the idea is that you might be able to

4769
02:46:08,239 --> 02:46:13,039
achieve that in an anarchist state

4770
02:46:10,879 --> 02:46:15,039
with companies so with the with the

4771
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:15,840
forces of capitalism

4772
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:18,160
is

4773
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:20,159
create security companies

4774
02:46:18,159 --> 02:46:22,559
where the one that's most ethically

4775
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:24,239
sound rises to the top basically it

4776
02:46:22,559 --> 02:46:27,359
would be much better representative of

4777
02:46:24,239 --> 02:46:31,439
the people because there is uh

4778
02:46:27,359 --> 02:46:33,359
less sort of stickiness to the the big

4779
02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:35,840
military force sticking around even

4780
02:46:33,359 --> 02:46:38,880
though it's long overlived

4781
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:40,880
outlet so you have groups of militants

4782
02:46:38,879 --> 02:46:42,398
that are hopefully officially organized

4783
02:46:40,879 --> 02:46:44,478
because otherwise they're going to lose

4784
02:46:42,398 --> 02:46:46,398
against the other groups of militants

4785
02:46:44,478 --> 02:46:48,639
and they are coordinating themselves

4786
02:46:46,398 --> 02:46:50,639
with the rest of society

4787
02:46:48,639 --> 02:46:52,318
until they are having a monopoly on

4788
02:46:50,639 --> 02:46:54,079
violence how is that different from a

4789
02:46:52,318 --> 02:46:55,920
government i listen i'm doing right so

4790
02:46:54,079 --> 02:46:58,318
it's basically converging to the same

4791
02:46:55,920 --> 02:47:00,000
thing so i think it always i did in my

4792
02:46:58,318 --> 02:47:01,359
as i was trying to argue with malice i

4793
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,959
feel like it always converges towards

4794
02:47:01,359 --> 02:47:04,720
government at scale

4795
02:47:02,959 --> 02:47:07,358
but i think the idea is you can have a

4796
02:47:04,719 --> 02:47:10,239
lot of collectives that are

4797
02:47:07,359 --> 02:47:11,760
you basically never let anything scale

4798
02:47:10,239 --> 02:47:12,478
too big

4799
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:14,000
so

4800
02:47:12,478 --> 02:47:18,398
one of the problems with governments is

4801
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:20,799
it gets too big in terms of like the the

4802
02:47:18,398 --> 02:47:23,199
the size of the group over which it has

4803
02:47:20,799 --> 02:47:23,199
control

4804
02:47:23,920 --> 02:47:29,200
my sense is that would happen anyway in

4805
02:47:26,398 --> 02:47:31,680
in this so successful company like

4806
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:34,800
amazon or facebook i mean it starts

4807
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:37,040
forming a monopoly over over entire

4808
02:47:34,799 --> 02:47:38,559
populations not over just a hundred

4809
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:40,960
hundreds of millions but billions of

4810
02:47:38,559 --> 02:47:42,559
people so i don't know

4811
02:47:40,959 --> 02:47:44,639
but

4812
02:47:42,559 --> 02:47:46,159
there is something about the abuses of

4813
02:47:44,639 --> 02:47:48,879
power the government can have when it

4814
02:47:46,159 --> 02:47:49,840
has a monopoly on violence right

4815
02:47:48,879 --> 02:47:52,879
and so

4816
02:47:49,840 --> 02:47:54,559
that's that's a tension there but

4817
02:47:52,879 --> 02:47:56,559
so the question is how can you set the

4818
02:47:54,559 --> 02:47:58,559
incentives for government correctly and

4819
02:47:56,559 --> 02:48:01,119
this mostly applies at the highest

4820
02:47:58,559 --> 02:48:02,398
levels of government and we because we

4821
02:48:01,120 --> 02:48:04,160
haven't found a way to set them

4822
02:48:02,398 --> 02:48:06,159
correctly we made the highest levels of

4823
02:48:04,159 --> 02:48:08,478
government relatively weak

4824
02:48:06,159 --> 02:48:10,318
and this is i think part of the reason

4825
02:48:08,478 --> 02:48:12,159
why we had difficulty to coordinate the

4826
02:48:10,318 --> 02:48:13,600
pandemic response

4827
02:48:12,159 --> 02:48:14,879
and china didn't have that much

4828
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:17,040
difficulty

4829
02:48:14,879 --> 02:48:19,519
and there is of course a much higher

4830
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:21,040
risk of the abuse of power that exists

4831
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:22,640
in china because the power is largely

4832
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:23,439
unchecked

4833
02:48:22,639 --> 02:48:25,278
and

4834
02:48:23,439 --> 02:48:26,880
that's basically what happens in the

4835
02:48:25,279 --> 02:48:28,800
next generation for instance imagine

4836
02:48:26,879 --> 02:48:30,398
that we would agree that the current

4837
02:48:28,799 --> 02:48:32,559
government of china is largely correct

4838
02:48:30,398 --> 02:48:35,039
and but never limit and maybe we don't

4839
02:48:32,559 --> 02:48:36,959
agree on this but if if he did

4840
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:39,040
how can we make sure that this stays

4841
02:48:36,959 --> 02:48:42,159
like this and if you don't have checks

4842
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:43,359
and balances uh division of power

4843
02:48:42,159 --> 02:48:45,200
it's hard to achieve we don't have a

4844
02:48:43,359 --> 02:48:47,359
solution for that problem

4845
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:48,960
but the abolishment of government

4846
02:48:47,359 --> 02:48:51,439
basically would remove the control

4847
02:48:48,959 --> 02:48:54,559
structure from a cybernetic perspective

4848
02:48:51,439 --> 02:48:56,159
there is an optimal point in the system

4849
02:48:54,559 --> 02:48:59,039
that the regulation should be happening

4850
02:48:56,159 --> 02:49:00,879
right that you can measure the current

4851
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:02,479
incentives and the regulator would be

4852
02:49:00,879 --> 02:49:03,599
properly incentivized to make the right

4853
02:49:02,478 --> 02:49:05,358
decisions

4854
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:07,200
and change the payout metrics of

4855
02:49:05,359 --> 02:49:08,720
everything below it in such a way that

4856
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:10,880
the local prisoner's dilemmas get

4857
02:49:08,719 --> 02:49:12,959
resolved right you cannot resolve the

4858
02:49:10,879 --> 02:49:14,959
prisoner's dilemma without some kind of

4859
02:49:12,959 --> 02:49:18,959
eternal control

4860
02:49:14,959 --> 02:49:20,318
that emulates an infinite game in a way

4861
02:49:18,959 --> 02:49:22,318
yeah i mean there

4862
02:49:20,318 --> 02:49:25,039
there's a sense in which

4863
02:49:22,318 --> 02:49:26,398
it seems like the reason government

4864
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:27,680
the parts of government that don't work

4865
02:49:26,398 --> 02:49:30,719
well currently

4866
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:32,800
is because there's not good um

4867
02:49:30,719 --> 02:49:33,920
mechanisms

4868
02:49:32,799 --> 02:49:35,519
for

4869
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:37,359
through which to interact for the

4870
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:39,200
citizenry to interact with government is

4871
02:49:37,359 --> 02:49:40,559
basically it

4872
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:43,279
it hasn't caught up in terms of

4873
02:49:40,559 --> 02:49:46,000
technology and i think once you

4874
02:49:43,279 --> 02:49:47,840
integrate some of the digital revolution

4875
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:50,239
of of being able to have a lot of access

4876
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:53,200
to data be able to vote on on different

4877
02:49:50,239 --> 02:49:55,039
ideas at a local level at all levels at

4878
02:49:53,200 --> 02:49:57,439
the at the optimal level like you're

4879
02:49:55,040 --> 02:50:00,319
saying that can resolve the the prisoner

4880
02:49:57,439 --> 02:50:02,800
dilemmas and to integrate ai to help you

4881
02:50:00,318 --> 02:50:03,760
out automate things that are like

4882
02:50:02,799 --> 02:50:07,358
um

4883
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:08,719
that don't require the human ingenuity

4884
02:50:07,359 --> 02:50:10,399
i feel like that's that's where

4885
02:50:08,719 --> 02:50:11,920
government could operate that well and

4886
02:50:10,398 --> 02:50:13,358
can also

4887
02:50:11,920 --> 02:50:15,520
break apart the inefficient

4888
02:50:13,359 --> 02:50:17,359
bureaucracies if needed there'll be a

4889
02:50:15,520 --> 02:50:18,479
strong incentive to

4890
02:50:17,359 --> 02:50:20,960
to um

4891
02:50:18,478 --> 02:50:23,278
to be efficient and successful so out

4892
02:50:20,959 --> 02:50:25,039
human history we see an evolution and

4893
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:26,800
evolutionary competition of modes of

4894
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:29,279
government and of individual governments

4895
02:50:26,799 --> 02:50:31,278
is in these modes and every nation state

4896
02:50:29,279 --> 02:50:33,200
in some sense is some kind of organism

4897
02:50:31,279 --> 02:50:34,960
that has found different solutions for

4898
02:50:33,200 --> 02:50:36,720
the problem of government

4899
02:50:34,959 --> 02:50:37,919
and you could look at all these

4900
02:50:36,719 --> 02:50:40,719
different models and the different

4901
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:43,760
scales at which it exists as empirical

4902
02:50:40,719 --> 02:50:45,679
attempts to validate the idea of how to

4903
02:50:43,760 --> 02:50:49,120
build a better government

4904
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:51,840
and i suspect that the idea of anarchism

4905
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:53,520
similar to the idea of communism

4906
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:55,680
is the result of

4907
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:57,600
being disenchanted with the ugliness of

4908
02:50:55,680 --> 02:50:59,279
the real existing solutions and the

4909
02:50:57,600 --> 02:51:02,479
attempt to get to

4910
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:04,720
an utopia and i suspect that communism

4911
02:51:02,478 --> 02:51:06,159
originally was not a utopia i think

4912
02:51:04,719 --> 02:51:08,719
that's in the same way as original

4913
02:51:06,159 --> 02:51:09,920
christianity it had a particular kind of

4914
02:51:08,719 --> 02:51:13,119
vision

4915
02:51:09,920 --> 02:51:15,680
and this vision is a society a mode of

4916
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:18,000
organization within the society in which

4917
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:21,040
humans can

4918
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:22,879
coexist at scale without coercion

4919
02:51:21,040 --> 02:51:25,200
the same way as we do in a healthy

4920
02:51:22,879 --> 02:51:28,000
family right in a good family you don't

4921
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:30,240
terrorize each other into compliance

4922
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:31,600
but you understand what everybody needs

4923
02:51:30,239 --> 02:51:33,760
and what everybody can is able to

4924
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:36,159
contribute and what the intended future

4925
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:37,760
of the whole thing is and you

4926
02:51:36,159 --> 02:51:39,520
everybody coordinates their behavior in

4927
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:41,279
the right way and informs each other

4928
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:42,720
about how to do this and all the

4929
02:51:41,279 --> 02:51:44,960
interactions that happen are

4930
02:51:42,719 --> 02:51:47,438
instrumental to making that happen

4931
02:51:44,959 --> 02:51:49,119
right could this happen at scale and i

4932
02:51:47,439 --> 02:51:51,600
think this is the idea of communism

4933
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:54,160
communism is opposed to the idea that we

4934
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:55,920
need economic terror or other forms of

4935
02:51:54,159 --> 02:51:58,000
terror to make that happen but in

4936
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:59,680
practice what happened is that the

4937
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:02,159
proto-communist countries the real

4938
02:51:59,680 --> 02:52:04,559
existing socialism replaced a part of

4939
02:52:02,159 --> 02:52:06,318
the economic terror of his moral terror

4940
02:52:04,559 --> 02:52:08,239
right so we were told to do the right

4941
02:52:06,318 --> 02:52:10,159
thing for moral reasons and of course it

4942
02:52:08,239 --> 02:52:12,239
didn't really work and the economy

4943
02:52:10,159 --> 02:52:14,478
eventually collapsed and the immoral

4944
02:52:12,239 --> 02:52:16,398
terror had actual real cause right

4945
02:52:14,478 --> 02:52:18,879
people were in prison because they were

4946
02:52:16,398 --> 02:52:20,398
morally non-compliant

4947
02:52:18,879 --> 02:52:21,519
and

4948
02:52:20,398 --> 02:52:22,959
that is

4949
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:25,040
the other thing is that the idea of

4950
02:52:22,959 --> 02:52:27,039
communism became a utopia so it

4951
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:29,840
basically was projected to the afterlife

4952
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:32,160
we were told in in my childhood that

4953
02:52:29,840 --> 02:52:34,159
communism was a hypothetical society to

4954
02:52:32,159 --> 02:52:36,079
which we were in a permanent revolution

4955
02:52:34,159 --> 02:52:38,799
that justified everything was presently

4956
02:52:36,079 --> 02:52:40,318
wrong with society morally but it was

4957
02:52:38,799 --> 02:52:42,318
something that our grandchildren

4958
02:52:40,318 --> 02:52:44,639
probably would not ever see because it

4959
02:52:42,318 --> 02:52:46,318
was too ideal and too far in the future

4960
02:52:44,639 --> 02:52:48,478
to make it happen right now and people

4961
02:52:46,318 --> 02:52:50,398
were just not there yet morally

4962
02:52:48,478 --> 02:52:52,559
and the same thing happened with

4963
02:52:50,398 --> 02:52:54,719
christianity right this notion of heaven

4964
02:52:52,559 --> 02:52:56,318
was mythologized and projected into an

4965
02:52:54,719 --> 02:52:59,039
afterlife and i think this was just the

4966
02:52:56,318 --> 02:53:00,719
idea of god's kingdom of this world in

4967
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:02,880
which we instantiate the next level

4968
02:53:00,719 --> 02:53:05,039
transcendental agent in the perfect form

4969
02:53:02,879 --> 02:53:06,639
so everything goes smoothly and without

4970
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:09,279
violence and without conflict and

4971
02:53:06,639 --> 02:53:11,519
without this human messiness on this

4972
02:53:09,279 --> 02:53:13,520
economic messiness and the terror and

4973
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:14,800
coercion that existed in the present

4974
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:16,640
societies

4975
02:53:14,799 --> 02:53:18,799
and the idea of that the humans can

4976
02:53:16,639 --> 02:53:22,079
exist at scale in a harmonious way

4977
02:53:18,799 --> 02:53:23,679
non-coercively is untested right a lot

4978
02:53:22,079 --> 02:53:25,120
of people tested it but didn't get it to

4979
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:27,279
work so far

4980
02:53:25,120 --> 02:53:28,960
and the utopia is a world in where you

4981
02:53:27,279 --> 02:53:30,640
get all the good things without any of

4982
02:53:28,959 --> 02:53:33,278
the bad things

4983
02:53:30,639 --> 02:53:34,879
and you are i think very susceptible to

4984
02:53:33,279 --> 02:53:36,640
believe in utopia when you are very

4985
02:53:34,879 --> 02:53:38,879
young and don't understand

4986
02:53:36,639 --> 02:53:40,478
that everything has to happen in causal

4987
02:53:38,879 --> 02:53:42,559
patterns that there is always feedback

4988
02:53:40,478 --> 02:53:44,159
loops that ultimately are closed there's

4989
02:53:42,559 --> 02:53:46,639
nothing that just happens because it's

4990
02:53:44,159 --> 02:53:48,799
good or bad good or bad don't exist in

4991
02:53:46,639 --> 02:53:50,639
isolation they only exist with respect

4992
02:53:48,799 --> 02:53:51,438
to larger systems

4993
02:53:50,639 --> 02:53:56,239
so

4994
02:53:51,439 --> 02:53:57,680
can you intuit why utopias fail as uh as

4995
02:53:56,239 --> 02:54:00,000
systems

4996
02:53:57,680 --> 02:54:03,520
so like having a utopia that's out there

4997
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:04,639
beyond the horizon is it because then

4998
02:54:03,520 --> 02:54:06,560
um

4999
02:54:04,639 --> 02:54:09,920
so it's not only because it's impossible

5000
02:54:06,559 --> 02:54:12,959
to achieve utopias but it's because

5001
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:14,719
what certain humans certain small number

5002
02:54:12,959 --> 02:54:16,398
of humans start

5003
02:54:14,719 --> 02:54:18,398
to uh

5004
02:54:16,398 --> 02:54:22,398
um

5005
02:54:18,398 --> 02:54:25,439
sort of greedily attain power and money

5006
02:54:22,398 --> 02:54:26,559
and control and influence

5007
02:54:25,439 --> 02:54:28,079
as they

5008
02:54:26,559 --> 02:54:29,039
become uh

5009
02:54:28,079 --> 02:54:32,478
uh

5010
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:33,279
as they see the power in uh using this

5011
02:54:32,478 --> 02:54:35,039
uh

5012
02:54:33,279 --> 02:54:37,359
idea of a utopia it's probably like

5013
02:54:35,040 --> 02:54:39,439
saying why is my garden not perfect it's

5014
02:54:37,359 --> 02:54:41,760
because some evil weeds are overgrowing

5015
02:54:39,439 --> 02:54:43,920
it and they always do yeah right but

5016
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:45,600
this is not how it works a good garden

5017
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:47,359
is a system that is in balance and

5018
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:48,640
requires minimal interactions by the

5019
02:54:47,359 --> 02:54:49,760
gardener

5020
02:54:48,639 --> 02:54:52,239
and

5021
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:54,478
so you need to create a system that is

5022
02:54:52,239 --> 02:54:56,478
designed to self stabilize and the

5023
02:54:54,478 --> 02:54:58,079
design of social systems requires not

5024
02:54:56,478 --> 02:54:59,920
just the implementation of the desired

5025
02:54:58,079 --> 02:55:02,159
functionality but the next level design

5026
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:03,520
but also in biological systems you need

5027
02:55:02,159 --> 02:55:06,000
to create a system that wants to

5028
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:08,079
converge to the intended function

5029
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:09,680
right so instead of just creating an

5030
02:55:08,079 --> 02:55:12,239
institution like the fda that is

5031
02:55:09,680 --> 02:55:14,318
performing a particular kind of rule a

5032
02:55:12,239 --> 02:55:16,000
role in society you need to make sure

5033
02:55:14,318 --> 02:55:18,159
that the fda is actually driven by a

5034
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:19,920
system that wants to do this optimally

5035
02:55:18,159 --> 02:55:22,719
that is incentivize the root optimally

5036
02:55:19,920 --> 02:55:24,239
and then makes the performance that is

5037
02:55:22,719 --> 02:55:26,879
actually enacted in every generation

5038
02:55:24,239 --> 02:55:29,039
instrumental to that thing that actual

5039
02:55:26,879 --> 02:55:30,639
goal right and that is much harder to

5040
02:55:29,040 --> 02:55:32,399
design and to achieve so you have to

5041
02:55:30,639 --> 02:55:35,039
design a system where

5042
02:55:32,398 --> 02:55:36,959
i mean listen communism also was quote

5043
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:38,960
unquote incentivized

5044
02:55:36,959 --> 02:55:40,318
to be a

5045
02:55:38,959 --> 02:55:41,278
feedback

5046
02:55:40,318 --> 02:55:43,680
loop

5047
02:55:41,279 --> 02:55:45,359
system that achieves that utopia it's

5048
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:46,800
just it wasn't working given human

5049
02:55:45,359 --> 02:55:48,000
naturally the incentives were not

5050
02:55:46,799 --> 02:55:49,358
correct

5051
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:51,520
how do you uh

5052
02:55:49,359 --> 02:55:53,279
incentivize people when they are getting

5053
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:55,760
coal off the ground to work as hard as

5054
02:55:53,279 --> 02:55:58,399
possible because it's a terrible job and

5055
02:55:55,760 --> 02:56:00,960
it's very bad for your health and

5056
02:55:58,398 --> 02:56:03,599
right how do you do this and you can uh

5057
02:56:00,959 --> 02:56:05,119
give them prices and medals and status

5058
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:07,279
to some degree right there's only so

5059
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:09,279
much status to give for that and most

5060
02:56:07,279 --> 02:56:10,720
people will not fall for this yeah right

5061
02:56:09,279 --> 02:56:12,800
or you can pay them

5062
02:56:10,719 --> 02:56:14,639
or uh and you probably have to pay them

5063
02:56:12,799 --> 02:56:17,039
an asymmetric way because if you pay

5064
02:56:14,639 --> 02:56:19,199
everybody the same and they uh

5065
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:20,640
you nationalize the coal mines

5066
02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:23,120
eventually people will figure out that

5067
02:56:20,639 --> 02:56:25,680
they can game the system yes so you're

5068
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:27,920
you're describing capitalism

5069
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:30,639
so capitalism is the present solution to

5070
02:56:27,920 --> 02:56:32,639
the system and what he also noticed that

5071
02:56:30,639 --> 02:56:35,680
i think that marx was correct in saying

5072
02:56:32,639 --> 02:56:37,920
that capitalism is prone to crisis that

5073
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:40,720
capitalism is a system that in its

5074
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:42,879
dynamics is not convergent but divergent

5075
02:56:40,719 --> 02:56:45,438
it's not a stable system

5076
02:56:42,879 --> 02:56:46,799
and that eventually it produces an

5077
02:56:45,439 --> 02:56:48,960
enormous

5078
02:56:46,799 --> 02:56:50,719
potential for productivity

5079
02:56:48,959 --> 02:56:52,639
but it also is systematically

5080
02:56:50,719 --> 02:56:54,719
misallocating resources so a lot of

5081
02:56:52,639 --> 02:56:56,239
people cannot participate

5082
02:56:54,719 --> 02:56:58,559
in the production and consumption

5083
02:56:56,239 --> 02:57:00,639
anymore and this is what we observe we

5084
02:56:58,559 --> 02:57:02,318
observe that the middle class in the us

5085
02:57:00,639 --> 02:57:03,840
is tiny

5086
02:57:02,318 --> 02:57:04,879
it's uh

5087
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:06,960
a lot of people think that they're

5088
02:57:04,879 --> 02:57:10,318
middle class but if you are still flying

5089
02:57:06,959 --> 02:57:10,318
economy you're not middle class

5090
02:57:10,959 --> 02:57:14,719
right

5091
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:16,880
every class is a magnitude smaller class

5092
02:57:14,719 --> 02:57:16,879
and

5093
02:57:18,239 --> 02:57:20,398
right

5094
02:57:21,200 --> 02:57:25,680
classes really like airline classes

5095
02:57:23,450 --> 02:57:27,359
[Laughter]

5096
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:29,359
a lot of people are economy have we

5097
02:57:27,359 --> 02:57:31,040
really business class and very few are

5098
02:57:29,359 --> 02:57:33,840
first class and some are bridgette i

5099
02:57:31,040 --> 02:57:35,600
mean some i i understand i i i think

5100
02:57:33,840 --> 02:57:37,760
there's uh yeah

5101
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:39,200
maybe some people probably i would push

5102
02:57:37,760 --> 02:57:40,239
back against that definition of the

5103
02:57:39,200 --> 02:57:42,240
middle class it does feel like the

5104
02:57:40,239 --> 02:57:44,879
middle class is pretty large but yes

5105
02:57:42,239 --> 02:57:47,840
there's a discrepancy in terms of wealth

5106
02:57:44,879 --> 02:57:50,318
um so there's a big gap in terms of the

5107
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:52,559
productivity that our society could have

5108
02:57:50,318 --> 02:57:55,278
yeah there is no reason for anybody to

5109
02:57:52,559 --> 02:57:57,840
fly economy right we would be able to

5110
02:57:55,279 --> 02:57:59,680
let everybody travel in style

5111
02:57:57,840 --> 02:58:01,359
well but also some people like to be

5112
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:02,800
frugal even when they're billionaires

5113
02:58:01,359 --> 02:58:04,880
okay so like that

5114
02:58:02,799 --> 02:58:06,318
let's take that into yes but uh i mean

5115
02:58:04,879 --> 02:58:08,079
you probably don't need to be a

5116
02:58:06,318 --> 02:58:09,680
traveling lavish but

5117
02:58:08,079 --> 02:58:12,079
you also don't need to be tortured right

5118
02:58:09,680 --> 02:58:14,479
there is a difference between frugal and

5119
02:58:12,079 --> 02:58:15,840
uh subjecting yourself to torture listen

5120
02:58:14,478 --> 02:58:18,398
i love economy i don't understand why

5121
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:21,760
you're comparing a flying economy to

5122
02:58:18,398 --> 02:58:23,760
torture i don't although the the the

5123
02:58:21,760 --> 02:58:25,680
fight here there's two crying babies

5124
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:27,439
next to me so that but that has nothing

5125
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:29,120
to do with the comments it has to do

5126
02:58:27,439 --> 02:58:30,398
with crying babies they're very cute

5127
02:58:29,120 --> 02:58:32,319
though so yeah

5128
02:58:30,398 --> 02:58:34,959
i have two kids and sometimes i have to

5129
02:58:32,318 --> 02:58:37,119
go back to visit the grandparents

5130
02:58:34,959 --> 02:58:37,119
and

5131
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:42,960
back means going from the west coast to

5132
02:58:40,639 --> 02:58:45,278
germany and it's a long flight is it

5133
02:58:42,959 --> 02:58:47,679
true that so when you're a father

5134
02:58:45,279 --> 02:58:49,439
you you grow immune to the crying and

5135
02:58:47,680 --> 02:58:52,159
all that kind of stuff like you know

5136
02:58:49,439 --> 02:58:53,920
because like me just not having kids

5137
02:58:52,159 --> 02:58:55,279
it can be other people's kids can be

5138
02:58:53,920 --> 02:58:57,120
quite annoying when they're crying and

5139
02:58:55,279 --> 02:58:58,880
screaming and all that kind of stuff

5140
02:58:57,120 --> 02:59:01,439
uh when you have children and you're

5141
02:58:58,879 --> 02:59:02,959
wired up in the default natural way

5142
02:59:01,439 --> 02:59:05,840
you're lucky in this regard you fall in

5143
02:59:02,959 --> 02:59:07,919
love with them yeah and this falling in

5144
02:59:05,840 --> 02:59:09,680
love with them means that you

5145
02:59:07,920 --> 02:59:11,680
basically start to see the world through

5146
02:59:09,680 --> 02:59:13,520
their eyes and you understand that in a

5147
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:14,479
given situation they cannot do anything

5148
02:59:13,520 --> 02:59:15,920
but

5149
02:59:14,478 --> 02:59:17,679
um being

5150
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:19,920
expressing despair

5151
02:59:17,680 --> 02:59:21,680
and so it becomes more differentiated i

5152
02:59:19,920 --> 02:59:23,760
noticed that for instance my son is

5153
02:59:21,680 --> 02:59:25,359
typically acting on

5154
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:27,680
a pure

5155
02:59:25,359 --> 02:59:28,559
experience of what things are like right

5156
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:29,279
now

5157
02:59:28,559 --> 02:59:30,639
and

5158
02:59:29,279 --> 02:59:33,680
has to do this right now and you have

5159
02:59:30,639 --> 02:59:35,278
this a small child that is um if

5160
02:59:33,680 --> 02:59:37,279
when he was a baby and so on where he

5161
02:59:35,279 --> 02:59:38,720
was just immediately expressing what he

5162
02:59:37,279 --> 02:59:40,640
felt and if you cannot regulate this

5163
02:59:38,719 --> 02:59:42,719
from the outside well there's no point

5164
02:59:40,639 --> 02:59:44,318
to be upset about it right it's like

5165
02:59:42,719 --> 02:59:45,358
dealing with weather or something like

5166
02:59:44,318 --> 02:59:46,799
this

5167
02:59:45,359 --> 02:59:48,559
you all have to get through it and it's

5168
02:59:46,799 --> 02:59:51,039
not easy for him either

5169
02:59:48,559 --> 02:59:52,959
but uh if you also have

5170
02:59:51,040 --> 02:59:56,479
a daughter maybe she is planning for

5171
02:59:52,959 --> 02:59:58,079
that maybe she understands that you know

5172
02:59:56,478 --> 02:59:59,840
she's sitting in the car behind you and

5173
02:59:58,079 --> 03:00:01,760
she's screaming at the top of her lungs

5174
02:59:59,840 --> 03:00:03,680
and you're almost doing an accident yeah

5175
03:00:01,760 --> 03:00:05,520
and you really don't know what to do

5176
03:00:03,680 --> 03:00:10,000
what should i have done to make you stop

5177
03:00:05,520 --> 03:00:11,680
screaming you could have given me candy

5178
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:13,920
i think that's like a cat versus dog

5179
03:00:11,680 --> 03:00:15,279
discussion i love it so but

5180
03:00:13,920 --> 03:00:18,398
because you said the f

5181
03:00:15,279 --> 03:00:19,359
like a fundamental aspect of that is is

5182
03:00:18,398 --> 03:00:22,239
love

5183
03:00:19,359 --> 03:00:25,680
that makes it all like worth it

5184
03:00:22,239 --> 03:00:27,600
what in this monkey riding an elephant

5185
03:00:25,680 --> 03:00:29,520
in a dream world

5186
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:32,239
what role does love play

5187
03:00:29,520 --> 03:00:34,560
in the human condition

5188
03:00:32,239 --> 03:00:38,000
i think that love is the facilitator of

5189
03:00:34,559 --> 03:00:39,519
non-transsexual interaction

5190
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:41,200
you are um

5191
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:43,279
observing your own purposes some of

5192
03:00:41,200 --> 03:00:45,920
these purposes go beyond your ego they

5193
03:00:43,279 --> 03:00:47,680
go beyond the particular organism that

5194
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:49,439
you are and your local interests that's

5195
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:50,960
what you mean by non-transactional yes

5196
03:00:49,439 --> 03:00:52,720
so basically when you are acting in

5197
03:00:50,959 --> 03:00:55,759
transactional way it means that you are

5198
03:00:52,719 --> 03:00:57,119
respecting something in return for you

5199
03:00:55,760 --> 03:00:58,318
from the one that you're interacting

5200
03:00:57,120 --> 03:00:59,760
with

5201
03:00:58,318 --> 03:01:01,439
right you are interacting with a random

5202
03:00:59,760 --> 03:01:03,279
stranger you buy something from them on

5203
03:01:01,439 --> 03:01:05,760
ebay you expect a fair value for the

5204
03:01:03,279 --> 03:01:07,040
money that you send them and vice versa

5205
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:08,639
because you don't know that person you

5206
03:01:07,040 --> 03:01:10,399
don't have any kind of relationship to

5207
03:01:08,639 --> 03:01:11,599
them but when you know this person a

5208
03:01:10,398 --> 03:01:13,760
little bit better and you know the

5209
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:15,359
situation that they're in you understand

5210
03:01:13,760 --> 03:01:17,760
what they try to achieve in their life

5211
03:01:15,359 --> 03:01:19,760
and you approve because you you realize

5212
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:22,800
that they're in some sense serving the

5213
03:01:19,760 --> 03:01:24,239
same human sacredness as you are

5214
03:01:22,799 --> 03:01:27,199
and they need to think that you have

5215
03:01:24,239 --> 03:01:28,000
maybe you give it to them as a present

5216
03:01:27,200 --> 03:01:30,640
but

5217
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:32,559
the i mean the feeling itself of joy is

5218
03:01:30,639 --> 03:01:34,719
a kind of benefit

5219
03:01:32,559 --> 03:01:36,879
is the kind of transaction

5220
03:01:34,719 --> 03:01:39,039
like yes but the joy is not the point

5221
03:01:36,879 --> 03:01:40,719
the joy is the signal that you get it's

5222
03:01:39,040 --> 03:01:43,279
the reinforcement signal that your brain

5223
03:01:40,719 --> 03:01:45,119
sends to you because you are acting on

5224
03:01:43,279 --> 03:01:46,079
the incentives of the agent that you're

5225
03:01:45,120 --> 03:01:48,319
part of

5226
03:01:46,079 --> 03:01:50,239
we are meant to be part of something

5227
03:01:48,318 --> 03:01:52,590
larger right this is the way in which we

5228
03:01:50,239 --> 03:01:54,079
out-competed other hominins

5229
03:01:52,590 --> 03:01:57,760
[Music]

5230
03:01:54,079 --> 03:02:00,239
uh take their neanderthals uh yeah right

5231
03:01:57,760 --> 03:02:02,639
and also other humans uh right there was

5232
03:02:00,239 --> 03:02:04,318
a population bottleneck for a human

5233
03:02:02,639 --> 03:02:06,639
society that

5234
03:02:04,318 --> 03:02:09,519
leads to an extreme lack of genetic

5235
03:02:06,639 --> 03:02:12,639
diversity among humans if you look at

5236
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:14,319
bushmen in the kalahari that basically

5237
03:02:12,639 --> 03:02:16,239
tribes that are not that far distant to

5238
03:02:14,318 --> 03:02:18,000
each other have more genetic diversity

5239
03:02:16,239 --> 03:02:20,000
that exists between

5240
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:21,680
europeans and chinese

5241
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:23,760
and it's because basically the out of

5242
03:02:21,680 --> 03:02:25,920
africa population

5243
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:28,079
at some point had a bottleneck of just a

5244
03:02:25,920 --> 03:02:30,478
few thousand individuals

5245
03:02:28,079 --> 03:02:32,959
and what probably happened is not that

5246
03:02:30,478 --> 03:02:35,039
at any time the number of people shrunk

5247
03:02:32,959 --> 03:02:36,799
below a few hundred thousand

5248
03:02:35,040 --> 03:02:38,800
what probably happened is that there was

5249
03:02:36,799 --> 03:02:40,879
a small group that had a decisive

5250
03:02:38,799 --> 03:02:42,398
mutation that produced an advantage and

5251
03:02:40,879 --> 03:02:45,039
this group multiplied and killed

5252
03:02:42,398 --> 03:02:46,079
everybody else and we are descendants of

5253
03:02:45,040 --> 03:02:48,800
that group

5254
03:02:46,079 --> 03:02:52,079
yeah i i wonder what uh the the the

5255
03:02:48,799 --> 03:02:53,119
peculiar characteristics of that group

5256
03:02:52,079 --> 03:02:54,879
yeah

5257
03:02:53,120 --> 03:02:56,800
i mean we never know and a lot of people

5258
03:02:54,879 --> 03:02:59,039
do and we can only we can only just

5259
03:02:56,799 --> 03:03:01,920
listen to the echoes in our like the the

5260
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:03,920
ripples uh that are still within us so i

5261
03:03:01,920 --> 03:03:06,079
suspect what eventually made a big

5262
03:03:03,920 --> 03:03:10,079
difference was the ability to organize

5263
03:03:06,079 --> 03:03:12,559
at scale people to program each other

5264
03:03:10,079 --> 03:03:14,478
good ideas that we became programmable

5265
03:03:12,559 --> 03:03:17,039
that we are willing to work on lockstep

5266
03:03:14,478 --> 03:03:19,199
that we went below uh above the tribal

5267
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:21,600
level that we no longer were hoops over

5268
03:03:19,200 --> 03:03:23,200
a few hundred individuals and uh acted

5269
03:03:21,600 --> 03:03:25,760
on direct deportation systems

5270
03:03:23,200 --> 03:03:28,000
transactionally but that we basically

5271
03:03:25,760 --> 03:03:28,960
evolved an adaptation to become state

5272
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:31,279
building

5273
03:03:28,959 --> 03:03:31,278
yeah

5274
03:03:31,680 --> 03:03:36,079
to do to form collectives outside of the

5275
03:03:34,799 --> 03:03:38,559
direct collective yes and that's

5276
03:03:36,079 --> 03:03:40,719
basically a part of us became committed

5277
03:03:38,559 --> 03:03:41,920
to serving something outside

5278
03:03:40,719 --> 03:03:43,760
of what we know

5279
03:03:41,920 --> 03:03:45,760
yeah then that that's kind of what love

5280
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:48,800
is and it's terrifying because it meant

5281
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:50,559
that we eradicated the others

5282
03:03:48,799 --> 03:03:52,799
right it's a force it's an adaptive

5283
03:03:50,559 --> 03:03:54,398
force that gets us ahead in evolution

5284
03:03:52,799 --> 03:03:56,639
which means we displace something else

5285
03:03:54,398 --> 03:03:58,639
that doesn't have that

5286
03:03:56,639 --> 03:04:00,239
oh so we had to murder a lot of people

5287
03:03:58,639 --> 03:04:02,239
that weren't about love

5288
03:04:00,239 --> 03:04:03,920
so love led to destruction have the same

5289
03:04:02,239 --> 03:04:05,920
strong love as we did

5290
03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:09,200
right that's why i i mentioned this

5291
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:12,318
thing with fascism when you see this uh

5292
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:14,880
these speeches do you want total war and

5293
03:04:12,318 --> 03:04:17,199
everybody says yes right this is this

5294
03:04:14,879 --> 03:04:18,559
big uh oh my god we are part of

5295
03:04:17,200 --> 03:04:22,520
something that is more important than me

5296
03:04:18,559 --> 03:04:22,519
that gives meaning to my existence

5297
03:04:22,959 --> 03:04:26,559
fair enough

5298
03:04:23,870 --> 03:04:28,880
[Laughter]

5299
03:04:26,559 --> 03:04:30,959
uh do you have advice

5300
03:04:28,879 --> 03:04:33,039
for young people today

5301
03:04:30,959 --> 03:04:34,839
in high school in college

5302
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:38,479
that are thinking about what to

5303
03:04:34,840 --> 03:04:40,318
do uh with their career with their life

5304
03:04:38,478 --> 03:04:43,599
so that uh at the end of the whole thing

5305
03:04:40,318 --> 03:04:43,600
they could be proud of what they did

5306
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:47,520
don't cheat

5307
03:04:45,680 --> 03:04:49,520
have integrity

5308
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:51,760
integrity so what does integrity look

5309
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:54,479
like when you're the river or the leaf

5310
03:04:51,760 --> 03:04:56,639
or the fat frog in a lake

5311
03:04:54,478 --> 03:04:57,840
it basically means that you try to

5312
03:04:56,639 --> 03:05:00,879
figure out

5313
03:04:57,840 --> 03:05:01,920
what the thing is that is the most

5314
03:05:00,879 --> 03:05:03,679
right

5315
03:05:01,920 --> 03:05:05,279
and this doesn't mean that you don't uh

5316
03:05:03,680 --> 03:05:07,040
that you have to look for what other

5317
03:05:05,279 --> 03:05:08,800
people tell you what's right

5318
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:11,359
but uh you have to aim for moral

5319
03:05:08,799 --> 03:05:13,920
autonomy so things need to be right

5320
03:05:11,359 --> 03:05:16,479
independently of what other people say

5321
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:19,520
i always felt that um

5322
03:05:16,478 --> 03:05:21,920
when people told me to

5323
03:05:19,520 --> 03:05:24,720
listen to what others say like um read

5324
03:05:21,920 --> 03:05:26,398
the room build your uh ideas of what's

5325
03:05:24,719 --> 03:05:28,000
true based on the high status people of

5326
03:05:26,398 --> 03:05:29,599
your in-group that does not protect me

5327
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:31,279
from fascism

5328
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:34,318
the only way to protect yourself from

5329
03:05:31,279 --> 03:05:36,000
fascism is to decide is the world that

5330
03:05:34,318 --> 03:05:37,278
is being built here the world that i

5331
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:40,478
want to be in

5332
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:42,399
yeah and so in some sense uh try to make

5333
03:05:40,478 --> 03:05:44,639
your behavior sustainable act in such a

5334
03:05:42,398 --> 03:05:46,799
way that you would feel comfortable on

5335
03:05:44,639 --> 03:05:48,318
all sides of the transaction realize

5336
03:05:46,799 --> 03:05:50,159
that everybody is you in a different

5337
03:05:48,318 --> 03:05:53,840
timeline but is seeing things

5338
03:05:50,159 --> 03:05:56,000
differently and has reasons to do so

5339
03:05:53,840 --> 03:05:58,318
yeah there's uh

5340
03:05:56,000 --> 03:06:00,239
i've come to realize this recently there

5341
03:05:58,318 --> 03:06:01,359
is an inner voice that tells you what's

5342
03:06:00,239 --> 03:06:02,799
right and

5343
03:06:01,359 --> 03:06:04,399
wrong

5344
03:06:02,799 --> 03:06:06,398
and

5345
03:06:04,398 --> 03:06:08,159
speaking of reading the room there's

5346
03:06:06,398 --> 03:06:09,599
times what integrity looks like is

5347
03:06:08,159 --> 03:06:11,119
there's times when

5348
03:06:09,600 --> 03:06:12,079
a lot of people are doing something

5349
03:06:11,120 --> 03:06:14,000
wrong

5350
03:06:12,079 --> 03:06:16,478
and what integrity looks like is not

5351
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:17,200
going on twitter and tweeting about it

5352
03:06:16,478 --> 03:06:19,599
but

5353
03:06:17,200 --> 03:06:22,240
not participating quietly

5354
03:06:19,600 --> 03:06:23,200
not doing so it's not like signaling or

5355
03:06:22,239 --> 03:06:24,719
not

5356
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:28,159
all this kind of stuff but actually

5357
03:06:24,719 --> 03:06:30,159
living your what you think is right like

5358
03:06:28,159 --> 03:06:32,959
living it now that's also sometimes this

5359
03:06:30,159 --> 03:06:35,359
expectation that others are like us so

5360
03:06:32,959 --> 03:06:37,119
imagine the possibility that some of the

5361
03:06:35,359 --> 03:06:39,200
people around you are space aliens that

5362
03:06:37,120 --> 03:06:41,120
only look human

5363
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:42,880
right so they don't have the same price

5364
03:06:41,120 --> 03:06:44,880
as you do they don't have don't have the

5365
03:06:42,879 --> 03:06:46,478
same impulses that's what's right and

5366
03:06:44,879 --> 03:06:48,959
wrong there is a large

5367
03:06:46,478 --> 03:06:50,239
diversity in these basic impulses that

5368
03:06:48,959 --> 03:06:52,478
people can have

5369
03:06:50,239 --> 03:06:54,318
in a given situation and now realize

5370
03:06:52,478 --> 03:06:56,239
that you are a space alien

5371
03:06:54,318 --> 03:06:57,519
right you are not actually human you you

5372
03:06:56,239 --> 03:06:59,760
think that you're human but you don't

5373
03:06:57,520 --> 03:07:01,840
know what it means like what it's like

5374
03:06:59,760 --> 03:07:03,920
to be human you just make it up as you

5375
03:07:01,840 --> 03:07:06,000
go along like everybody else

5376
03:07:03,920 --> 03:07:08,079
and you have to figure that out what it

5377
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:10,239
means that you are

5378
03:07:08,079 --> 03:07:11,760
a full human being what it means to be

5379
03:07:10,239 --> 03:07:13,439
human in the world and how to connect

5380
03:07:11,760 --> 03:07:14,398
with others on that

5381
03:07:13,439 --> 03:07:17,279
and

5382
03:07:14,398 --> 03:07:19,599
there is also something don't be afraid

5383
03:07:17,279 --> 03:07:21,520
in the sense that you if you do this

5384
03:07:19,600 --> 03:07:23,040
you're not good enough because if you

5385
03:07:21,520 --> 03:07:25,359
are acting on these incentives of

5386
03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:27,359
integrity you become trustworthy that's

5387
03:07:25,359 --> 03:07:28,239
the way in which you can recognize each

5388
03:07:27,359 --> 03:07:29,920
other

5389
03:07:28,239 --> 03:07:31,840
there is a particular place where you

5390
03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:32,960
can meet you can figure out what that

5391
03:07:31,840 --> 03:07:35,359
place is

5392
03:07:32,959 --> 03:07:37,358
where you will give support to people

5393
03:07:35,359 --> 03:07:40,239
because you realize that they act with

5394
03:07:37,359 --> 03:07:42,159
integrity and they will also do that

5395
03:07:40,239 --> 03:07:43,760
so in some sense you are safe if you do

5396
03:07:42,159 --> 03:07:45,200
that

5397
03:07:43,760 --> 03:07:47,520
you're not always protected there are

5398
03:07:45,200 --> 03:07:48,560
people which will abuse you and that

5399
03:07:47,520 --> 03:07:50,239
might

5400
03:07:48,559 --> 03:07:52,719
that are bad actors in way that it's

5401
03:07:50,239 --> 03:07:53,920
hard to imagine before you meet them

5402
03:07:52,719 --> 03:07:55,760
but

5403
03:07:53,920 --> 03:07:57,760
there is also people which

5404
03:07:55,760 --> 03:07:59,680
will try to protect you

5405
03:07:57,760 --> 03:08:01,760
yeah this that's such a

5406
03:07:59,680 --> 03:08:03,840
thank you for saying that there's such a

5407
03:08:01,760 --> 03:08:05,359
hopeful message

5408
03:08:03,840 --> 03:08:08,159
that no matter what happens to you

5409
03:08:05,359 --> 03:08:08,159
there'll be a place

5410
03:08:08,239 --> 03:08:14,000
there's people you'll meet

5411
03:08:11,680 --> 03:08:15,600
that also have

5412
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:17,200
what you have

5413
03:08:15,600 --> 03:08:19,680
and

5414
03:08:17,200 --> 03:08:21,359
you will find happiness there and safety

5415
03:08:19,680 --> 03:08:24,000
there yeah but it doesn't need to end

5416
03:08:21,359 --> 03:08:26,479
well it can also uh all go wrong so this

5417
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:28,478
there's no guarantees in this life so

5418
03:08:26,478 --> 03:08:30,159
you can do everything right and you

5419
03:08:28,478 --> 03:08:32,079
still can fail and

5420
03:08:30,159 --> 03:08:34,318
you can still horrible things happening

5421
03:08:32,079 --> 03:08:35,039
to you that traumatize you and mutilate

5422
03:08:34,318 --> 03:08:36,719
you

5423
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:39,200
and you have to be grateful if it

5424
03:08:36,719 --> 03:08:39,199
doesn't happen

5425
03:08:40,239 --> 03:08:43,760
and ultimately be grateful no matter

5426
03:08:41,920 --> 03:08:46,719
what happens because even just being

5427
03:08:43,760 --> 03:08:48,559
alive is pretty damn nice

5428
03:08:46,719 --> 03:08:49,438
yeah even that you know

5429
03:08:48,559 --> 03:08:51,199
um

5430
03:08:49,439 --> 03:08:53,840
the gratefulness in some sense is also

5431
03:08:51,200 --> 03:08:56,319
just generated by your brain uh to keep

5432
03:08:53,840 --> 03:08:56,318
you going

5433
03:08:56,959 --> 03:09:00,799
it's all the trick

5434
03:08:58,879 --> 03:09:02,799
speaking of which

5435
03:09:00,799 --> 03:09:05,438
camus said

5436
03:09:02,799 --> 03:09:07,920
i see many people die because they judge

5437
03:09:05,439 --> 03:09:10,239
that life is not worth living

5438
03:09:07,920 --> 03:09:12,318
i see others paradoxically getting

5439
03:09:10,239 --> 03:09:14,879
killed for the ideas or illusions that

5440
03:09:12,318 --> 03:09:16,559
give them a reason for living

5441
03:09:14,879 --> 03:09:19,278
what is called the reason for living is

5442
03:09:16,559 --> 03:09:21,600
also an excellent reason for dying

5443
03:09:19,279 --> 03:09:24,640
i therefore conclude that the meaning of

5444
03:09:21,600 --> 03:09:26,479
life is the most urgent of questions

5445
03:09:24,639 --> 03:09:27,840
so i have to ask

5446
03:09:26,478 --> 03:09:31,438
what

5447
03:09:27,840 --> 03:09:33,279
joshua bach is the meaning of life

5448
03:09:31,439 --> 03:09:35,040
it is an urgent question according to

5449
03:09:33,279 --> 03:09:36,238
kamu

5450
03:09:35,040 --> 03:09:37,920
i don't think that there's a single

5451
03:09:36,238 --> 03:09:40,478
answer to this

5452
03:09:37,920 --> 03:09:42,159
nothing makes sense unless the mind

5453
03:09:40,478 --> 03:09:44,719
makes it so so

5454
03:09:42,159 --> 03:09:45,840
you basically have to project a purpose

5455
03:09:44,719 --> 03:09:47,679
and

5456
03:09:45,840 --> 03:09:49,760
if you zoom out far enough there's the

5457
03:09:47,680 --> 03:09:51,439
heat test of the universe and everything

5458
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:53,359
is meaningless everything is just a blip

5459
03:09:51,439 --> 03:09:55,680
in between and the question is do you

5460
03:09:53,359 --> 03:09:57,520
find meaning in this blab in between

5461
03:09:55,680 --> 03:09:59,680
do you find meaning and

5462
03:09:57,520 --> 03:10:01,680
observing squirrels

5463
03:09:59,680 --> 03:10:03,840
do you find meaning in raising children

5464
03:10:01,680 --> 03:10:06,159
and projecting a multi-generational

5465
03:10:03,840 --> 03:10:08,318
organism into the future do you find

5466
03:10:06,159 --> 03:10:10,559
meaning in projecting an aesthetic of

5467
03:10:08,318 --> 03:10:12,478
the world that you like to the future

5468
03:10:10,559 --> 03:10:14,398
and trying to serve that aesthetic and

5469
03:10:12,478 --> 03:10:15,278
if you do then life that has that

5470
03:10:14,398 --> 03:10:18,238
meaning

5471
03:10:15,279 --> 03:10:21,279
and if you don't then it doesn't

5472
03:10:18,238 --> 03:10:23,760
i kind of enjoy the idea that you just

5473
03:10:21,279 --> 03:10:26,640
create the most

5474
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:29,520
vibrant the most weird the most unique

5475
03:10:26,639 --> 03:10:31,920
kind of blip you can given your

5476
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:33,040
environment given your set of skills

5477
03:10:31,920 --> 03:10:35,920
just be the

5478
03:10:33,040 --> 03:10:35,920
the most weird

5479
03:10:36,079 --> 03:10:38,559
set of

5480
03:10:37,520 --> 03:10:40,720
uh

5481
03:10:38,559 --> 03:10:41,600
like local pocket of complexity you can

5482
03:10:40,719 --> 03:10:43,679
be

5483
03:10:41,600 --> 03:10:46,000
so that like when people study the

5484
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:48,079
universe they'll pause and be like uh

5485
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:50,799
that's weird

5486
03:10:48,079 --> 03:10:53,500
it looks like a useful strategy but of

5487
03:10:50,799 --> 03:10:55,358
course it's still motivated reasoning

5488
03:10:53,500 --> 03:10:56,559
[Laughter]

5489
03:10:55,359 --> 03:10:58,880
you're obviously acting on your

5490
03:10:56,559 --> 03:11:01,278
incentives here it's still a story we

5491
03:10:58,879 --> 03:11:04,000
tell ourselves within a dream that's

5492
03:11:01,279 --> 03:11:05,279
that's hardly in touch with reality it's

5493
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:08,279
definitely a good strategy if you're a

5494
03:11:05,279 --> 03:11:08,279
podcaster

5495
03:11:09,120 --> 03:11:11,760
uh

5496
03:11:10,079 --> 03:11:13,760
and a human which i'm still trying to

5497
03:11:11,760 --> 03:11:16,960
figure out if i am yeah there's a mutual

5498
03:11:13,760 --> 03:11:19,120
relationship somehow somehow josh

5499
03:11:16,959 --> 03:11:21,919

valuable time with me i hope we get to

uh

5507
03:11:30,478 --> 03:11:34,559

well meaningful

5509
03:11:34,559 --> 03:11:38,879

5518
03:11:53,840 --> 03:11:57,359
from carl young

5519
03:11:55,680 --> 03:11:59,840
people will do anything

5520
03:11:57,359 --> 03:12:01,680
no matter how absurd in order to avoid

5521
03:11:59,840 --> 03:12:03,680
facing their own souls

5522
03:12:01,680 --> 03:12:06,398
one does not become enlightened by

5523
03:12:03,680 --> 03:12:09,120
imagining figures of light but by making

5524
03:12:06,398 --> 03:12:11,039
the darkness conscious

5525
03:12:09,120 --> 03:12:14,920
thank you for listening and hope to see
